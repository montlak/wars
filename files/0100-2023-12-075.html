<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-74"><span class="space">f.</span> Degree of Control Test</h5>
<p class="noindent">Because the term "employee" under Title VII is interpreted according to the common law of agency, it is the degree of control that determines whether a complainant is an employee, and not the "economic realities" test that has been utilized by some courts. Under the "economic realities" test, the focus is on whether the complainant is dependent on the business to which he or she renders a service. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Wenli Ma v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01962390 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Court's decisions in the <span class="Italic">Darden</span> and the <span class="Italic">Reid</span> cases, the Commission finds that the term "employee" as it is used in section 717 of Title VII must be understood in light of the common law of agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In prior cases, the Commission has held that the test for determining whether an individual may be deemed an employee under section 717 of Title VII is set forth in the <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> decision upon which the agency relied in dismissing the appellant's complaints<span class="Italic">. Abramoff v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940476 (December 22, 1994); <span class="Italic">DaVeiga v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930201 (July 13, 1993); <span class="Italic">Puri v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920107 (March 5, 1992); and <span class="Italic">Bandali v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910067 (April 11, 1991). The <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> court held that consideration of all of the circumstances surrounding the work relationship is essential and that no one factor is determinative. 613 F.2d at 831.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> test is consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Darden</span> and <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, except that it references the "economic realities test" under which individuals are considered employees if, as a matter of economic reality, they are dependent upon the business to which they render service. 613 F.2d at 831 and n.22. For this reason, the <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> test has been called a hybrid test<span class="Italic">. See Frankel v. Bally, Inc.</span>, 987 F.2d 86, 89-90 (2d Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Mares v. Marsh</span>, 777 F.2d 1066, 1067 (5th Cir. 1985). However, as shown in footnote 4, the factors listed for consideration in the <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> decision are drawn from the common law of agency test, not the economic realities test. Thus, in practice, the application of the <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> test has not differed appreciably from an application of the common law of agency test<span class="Italic">. Frankel v. Bally, Inc.</span>, 987 F.2d at 90.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in accord with the Commission's prior practice and the <span class="Italic">Darden</span> and <span class="Italic">Reid</span> decisions, the Commission will apply the common law of agency test, considering all of the incidents of the relationship between the appellant's and the agency, in order to determine whether the appellant's should be deemed to be "employees" under section 717 of Title VII....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After considering all of the incidents of the relationship between the appellant's and the agency, the Commission finds that the appellants, as Visiting Fellows, should not be deemed to be "employee" under section 717 of Title VII. Instead, the Commission finds that the appellants were the recipients of fellowship awards from the agency which enabled them to gain valuable biomedical research experience and training under the guidance of a senior research investigator. In this respect, the Visiting Fellowships were similar to the grants and fellowships which students receive to provide support for the continuation of their studies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of central importance, the Commission finds that, unlike either employees or independent contractors, the terms of the Visiting Fellowships did not require that the appellants complete specific assignments or perform a specified amount or quality of work in order to receive their monthly fellowship stipends. Instead, under the Visiting Fellowship Program the appellants were provided an opportunity to work on a research project of mutual interest to the appellant's and Senior Research Investigator 1.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ma</span> noted the 12 factors <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> listed that normally factor into the analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_190"></span>The <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> decision included a non-exhaustive list of factors that should be considered in determining whether an individual is an employee under section 717 of Title VII: (1) the extent of the employer's right to control the means and manner of the worker's performance; (2) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether the work is usually done under the direction of a supervisor or is done by a specialist without supervision; (3) the skill required in the particular occupation; (4) whether the "employer" or the individual furnishes the equipment used and the place of work; (5) the length of time the individual has worked; (6) the method of payment, whether by time or by the job; (7) the manner in which the work relationship is terminated, i.e., by one or both parties, with or without notice and explanation; (8) whether annual leave is afforded; (9) whether the work is an integral part of the business of the "employer"; (10) whether the worker accumulates retirement benefits; (11) whether the "employer" pays social security taxes; and (12) the intention of the parties. 613 F.2d at 832. The <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> court indicated, however, that the most important factor to be considered is the extent of the employer's right to control the means and manner of the worker's performance. 613 F.2d at 831.</p>
<p class="noindent">Commission decisions over the years have added several factors and decisions on contractor complaints often refer to the factors by the number. For example in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120122912 (2014), the factors listed were:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The employer has the right to control when, where, and how the worker performs the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The work does not require a high level of skill or expertise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The employer furnishes the tools, materials, and equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;The work is performed on the employer's premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;There is a continuing relationship between the worker and the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6.&#x2003;The employer has the right to assign additional projects to the worker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7.&#x2003;The employer sets the hours of work and the duration of the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">8.&#x2003;The worker is paid by the hour, week, or month rather than the agreed cost of performing a particular job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">9.&#x2003;The worker does not hire and pay assistants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">10.&#x2003;The work performed by the worker is part of the regular business of the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">11.&#x2003;The worker is not engaged in his/her own distinct occupation or business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">12.&#x2003;The employer provides the worker with benefits such as insurance, leave, or workers' compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">13.&#x2003;The worker is considered an employee of the employer for tax purposes (i.e., the employer withholds federal, state, and Social Security taxes).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">14.&#x2003;The employer can discharge the worker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">15.&#x2003;The worker and the employer believe that they are creating an employer-employee relationship.</p>
<p class="noindent">But that decision notes that the list is not exhaustive. And no one factor is dispositive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Angelica P. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120172789 (2018). "What actually happens in the workplace" will determine whether an individual is an employee as the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Serita B. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120150846 (2016). <span class="Italic">Serita B</span>. involved a contractor who was terminated about a month after she informed her agency supervisor of her pregnancy. Before the Commission, the contractor's office represented that the staffing firm was responsible for the hiring and firing of individuals it placed, but that agency management provided input into those matters based on work performance. The Commission found that the agency requested that the complainant be terminated based on performance and, within days of that request, the complainant was fired. Reversing the agency's dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim in <span class="Italic">Serita B</span>., the Commission reprimanded agencies that fail to follow Commission guidance on joint employer relationships and emphasized the contract between the agency and the staffing firm is not dispositive as to who qualifies as an employer:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin our analysis by noting that some agencies have not applied the Commission's longstanding position on the issue of joint employment, a position that the Commission has announced a number of times and in a number of formats, including Compliance Manual chapters, formal enforcement guidance, and federal-sector rulings. We note that the Commission's long-standing position on "joint employers" is found in numerous sources. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., EEOC Compliance Manual Section 2, "Threshold Issues," Section 2-[II(B)(1)(a)(iii)(b) (May 12, 2000) (Compliance Manual) 4; <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Application of EEO Laws to Contingent Workers Placed by Temporary Employment Agencies and Other Staffing Firms</span> (Dec. 3, 1997) (Enforcement Guidance), "Coverage Issues," Question 2; <span class="Italic">Ma v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs</span>., EEOC Appeal Nos. 01962389 to 01962390 (May 29, 1998). We reiterate the analysis set forth in those decisions and guidance documents in this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies often conclude that an individual is not an employee based solely on the fact that the individual performs work pursuant to a contract between the federal government and an outside organization and the outside organization, not the federal government, controls the pay and benefits of that individual. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Helen G. v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120150262 (Feb. 11, 2016); <span class="Italic">Nicki B. v. Dep't of Educ</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120151697 (Feb. 9, 2016). These elements are just two of the factors relevant to joint employment under the Commission's long-standing position and it is not at all surprising that they would be present when an individual working under a federal contract for a federal agency raises a complaint of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "joint employer" refers to two or more employers that each exercises sufficient control of an individual to qualify as the worker's employer. Compliance Manual, Section 2-III(B)(1)(a)(iii)(b). To determine whether the Agency has the right to exercise sufficient control, EEOC considers factors derived from common law principles of agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> Enforcement Guidance, "Coverage Issues," at Question 2. EEOC considers, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the Agency's right to control when, where, and how the worker performs the job; the right to assign additional projects to the worker; whether the work is performed on Agency premises; whether the Agency provides the tools, material, and equipment to perform the job; the duration of the relationship between the Agency and the worker whether the Agency controls the worker's schedule; and whether the Agency can discharge the worker. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 2-III(A)(1) (citing <span class="Italic">Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden</span>, 503 U.S. 313, 323-24 (1992)); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Skanska USA Bldg., Inc</span>., 550 F. App'x 253, 256 (6th Cir. 2013) ("Entities are joint employers if they 'share or co-determine those matters governing essential terms and conditions of employment'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Carrier Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 768 F.2d 778, 781 (6th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see also Ma</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01962389 to 01962390.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language of the contract between the agency and the staffing firm is not dispositive as to whether a joint-employment situation exists. In determining a worker's status, EEOC looks to what actually occurs in the workplace, even if it contradicts the language in the contract between the staffing firm and the agency. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A45313 (Mar. 16, 2006) (while contract between staffing firm and agency provided that contract personnel were employees of staffing firm under its administrative supervision and control, agency actually retained supervisory authority over the contract workers).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the factor of the right to control when, where, and how the worker performs the job and to assign additional projects, complete agency control is not required; the control may be partial or joint and still point to joint employment. <span class="Italic">Shorter v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120131148 (June 11, 2013) (where both staffing firm and agency made assignments, this pointed to joint employment); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120143162 (May 20, 2015), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520150430 (Mar. 11, 2016) (where staffing firm wrote and issued complainant's appraisal with input from agency, this pointed toward joint employment). Likewise, where both the agency and staffing firm provided tools, material, and equipment to perform the job, this pointed to joint employment. <span class="Italic">Elkin v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120122211, 2012 WL 5818075 (Nov. 8, 2012). Similarly, where a staffing firm terminates a worker after an agency communicates it no longer wants the worker's services, this supports a finding that the agency has joint or <span class="Italic">de facto</span> power to discharge the worker. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Complainants v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120141963 to 0120141762 (Jan. 28, 2015); <span class="Italic">see also Skanska USA Bldg., Inc</span>., 550 Fed. App'x at 254, 256 (where defendant removed staffing firm's workers from job site without challenge from staffing firm, and after such removals staffing firm generally fired worker, this pointed to joint employment); <span class="Italic">Butler v. Drive Auto. Indus. of America, Inc.,</span> 793 F.3d 404, 414-15 (4th Cir. 2015). The EEOC considers an entity's right to control the terms and conditions of employment, whether or not it exercises that right, as relevant to joint employer status. Enforcement Guidance, "Coverage Issues," at Question 2, Example 5 (where an entity reserve the right to direct the means and manner of an individual's work, but does not generally exercise that: right, the entity may still be found to be a joint employer).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the right to control, EEOC does not consider any one factor to be decisive and emphasizes that it is not necessary to satisfy a majority of the factors. In particular, the fact that an individual performs work pursuant to a contract between the federal government and an outside organization and is paid and provided with benefits by that organization, on its own, is not enough to show that joint employment does not exist. Rather, the analysis is holistic; all the circumstances in the individual's relationship with the agency should be considered to determine if the agency should be deemed the worker's joint employer. Enforcement Guidance, "Coverage Issues," at Qs. 1 and 2. In sum, a federal agency will qualify as a joint employer of an individual if it has the requisite right to control the means and manner of the individual's work, regardless of whether the individual is paid by an outside organization or is on the federal payroll. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., at Q. 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_191"></span>Here, the analysis is straight-forward. The Agency controlled how Complainant performed her job. S1 assigned Complainant her work, set deadlines, advised her on her performance and demeanor, and assigned her additional projects. Complainant served the Agency from July 2013 until her termination in August 2014, a significant duration. She worked on Agency premises using Agency equipment, and the Agency set her working hours. Significantly, Complainant has alleged discrimination when she was terminated from her position with the Agency. Shortly after the Agency requested Staffing Firm 2 to cut off Complainant's services, the staffing firm expressed its belief that it was "required" to comply with the request and then terminated Complainant. As such, we conclude that the Agency had <span class="Italic">de facto</span> or joint power to terminate Complainant. Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth in our previous decisions and guidance, we find that the Agency possessed sufficient control over Complainant's position to qualify as her joint employer for the purpose of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reiterate that the analysis used in this case, as previously set forth in our guidance documents and in decisions such as <span class="Italic">Ma v. Department of Human Services, supra</span>, is the proper analytical approach.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission approved of the agency's argument in <span class="Italic">Tena C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2022001480 (2022), that the complainant's work was "in furtherance of specific contract deliverables (i.e., training on technical capabilities) that support [Agency] missions but are outside the scope of the regular business of the [Agency]." In that case, the complainant alleged standing, noting that her work hours were based on the agency's training schedule, she had access to agency secure locations and software and she received instruction from an agency employee. The Commission still found that the complainant's role was not part of the agency's primary mission in <span class="Italic">Tena C</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly, Complainant demonstrated that she received instructions from the JSTP Chief, an Agency employee, as opposed to the PM. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Ranae P. v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2021005034 (Jan. 24, 2022) (determining Agency was joint employer in part because the complainant's supervisor and other management officials employed by the agency testified that they provided the complainant with her assignments). Complainant aptly reasoned that the JSTP Chief "controls the entire Training Division and Joint Staff Actions Process," and her role as a Training Specialist was to support JSTP, therefore, by providing training under the JSTP Chief's leadership and using training processes devised by the JSTP Chief, the Agency was controlling her daily assignments and schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency concedes that Complainant assisted the JSTP Chief as needed but maintains that the JSTP Chief had no supervisory authority and "only utilizes the contractor personnel through PM in accordance with the PWS." The JSTP Chief confirms that Complainant and the other Salient Training Specialists provided "administrative support to JSTP as outlined in the PWS," and that she was "working with the [Training Specialists] to revise existing course content and assessment instruments." However, the JSTP Chief also testified that if she had "any issues with contract personnel" she had to address them with COR, who would then raise them with PM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also explained that all of its contractor employees are provided with a CAC and JKO training to the extent necessary to perform their job duties. The PWS supports that Salient, rather than the Agency, is responsible for ensuring that the personnel they place in Training Specialist positions have the required JKO training and are provided with a CAC that allows them access limited to the duration and scope of their position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued it was not a joint employer because Complainant's work is "in furtherance of specific contract deliverables (i.e., training on technical capabilities) that support [Agency] missions but are outside the scope of the regular business of the [Agency]." Complainant's own proffered evidence, when considered alongside the PWS, confirms that her role as Training Specialist fell outside the scope of the Agency's "regular business." For instance, Complainant establishes that she compiled a roster, sent the invitation, assisted with enrollment, and led a few of the training sessions for a webinar entitled Action Officer ("AO") Course. This was in accordance with the PWS, as one of the specific "deliverables" Salient was to provide (i.e. "maintain and conduct the AO Course"). Likewise, evidence establishing that Complainant assisted personnel with onboarding, and compiled feedback and scores from a training for the JSTP Chief were also consistent with Salient's obligations under the PWS. Even if the JSTP Chief assigned these tasks to Complainant, it does not establish that she or the Agency had "sufficient control" over Complainant's employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Complainant v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120130942 (May 23, 2013) (Where Agency employee determined the complainant's schedule and made general assignments, but the contractor paid wages, granted and denied leave, and the work performed was not integral to the Agency's mission, Agency not found to exercise sufficient control to be considered joint employer).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These circumstances are consistent with the Commission's prior determinations where, like here, the complainant works on agency property, using agency equipment, yet the agency still lacks control that would qualify it as a "joint employer.," <span class="Italic">See e.g. Berniece R. v. Nat'l Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2021005199 (Jan. 18, 202) (Agency "clearly demonstrated" that the contractor controlled the means and manner of the complainant's employment by providing a copy of the contract, as well as a "contractor questionnaire" completed during EEO Counseling, establishing, that the complainant's work as a Senior Systems Engineer was not an integral part of the agency's business).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in consideration of the numerous factors, we do not find that the Agency exhibited sufficient control over Complainant to be considered her joint employer for EEO purposes. We acknowledge that Complainant performed her job at the Agency's facility, with Agency equipment, and her schedule was limited by the Agency's core hours. She was provided with specialized training and access to Agency software. However, Salient provide her with pay and benefits. In January 2022, it was Salient who corresponded with Complainant requesting medical documentation to support her sick leave status. Salient also provided onsite supervision, PM, to monitor Complainant's performance. Further, Complainant's role, as a Training Specialist, was not part of the Agency's primary mission.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Georgia Z. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 2021000668 (2021), the agency concluded that joint employment did not exist because the contractor had the authority to exert more control over the complainant than the agency. The Commission rejected that position as a "foundational error," reiterating that "[c]ontrol may be partial and without even a majority of factors shown for there to be sufficient control over the individual to qualify as an employer."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Rina F. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120160808 (2016), also provides instructional analysis on the joint employer relationship. In that case, the Commission stressed that the question of whether an employer-employee relationship exists is fact-specific. Reiterating the <span class="Italic">Ma</span> factors, the Commission added:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Application of EEO Laws to Contingent Workers Placed by Temporary Employment Agencies and Other Staffing Firms</span> (Dec. 3, 1997), we recognize that a "joint employment" relationship may exist where both the agency and the staffing firm may be joint employers. Similar to the analysis set forth above, a determination of joint employment requires an assessment of the comparative amount and type of control the staffing firm and the agency each maintains over a complainant's work. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A45313 (Mar. 16, 2006). Thus, a federal agency will qualify as a joint employer of an individual if it has the requisite means and manner of control over the individual's work under the criteria above, whether or not the individual is on the federal payroll. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For example, an agency may be considered an employer of the worker if it supplies the workspace, equipment, and supplies, and if it has the right to control the details of the work performed, to make or change assignments, and to terminate the relationship. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Application of EEO Laws to Contingent Workers Placed by Temporary Employment Agencies and Other Staffing Firms</span>, at Coverage Issues, Question 2.</p>
<p class="noindent">Over the years, some factors have been more frequently highlighted and considered than others. Sometimes with varying results. And, not all factors will be accorded the same weight depending on the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Baiamonte v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A61526 (2006). For ease of research, we have broken out those factors in the subheadings below, but it is important to remember that no one factor stands alone or will be dispositive as to the degree of control the agency has exercised. All of them will inform that answer.</p>
