<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-22"><span class="space">4.</span> Post-<span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Bostock</span></span> Commission Decisions</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Phyllis F. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120150799 (2021), found that comments "premised on [the complainant's] sex; the sex of people she associated with; and included sex-based preferences, assumptions, expectations, stereotypes or norms" were based on the complainant's sexual orientation and violated Title VII. The complained of conduct in <span class="Italic">Phyllis F.</span> included:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her complaint, Complainant alleged that a co-worker (TSO1) made several comments towards her about her sexual orientation which created a hostile work environment. Specifically, Complainant asserted that on February 13, 2013, while looking at a picture of her dogs, TSO1 approached her and said, "You are never going to have a man in your life as long as you have those two dogs." Complainant claimed that these types of comments occurred weekly, but that she did not complain about this incident immediately. Complainant further asserted that, on March 26, 2013, TSO1 interrupted a conversation she was having with another co-worker and stated, "You know they can mess around and have sex and do what they want I don't care, but I do not think same-sex couples should be allowed to get married."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that she and another TSO (TSO2) raised the issue with their second-level supervisor, a Transportation Security Manager (TSM), and scheduled a meeting to discuss it. However, TSM cancelled the meeting and Complainant went to her union representative instead. Report of Investigation Complainant did not hear back from her TSM about the incident until August 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also asserted that on March 30, 2013, a co-worker (TSO3) informed her that she had overheard TSO1 and Complainant's first-line supervisor, a Supervisory Transportation Screening Officer (STSO), having a conversation about the sexual orientation of two officers. TSO3 advised Complainant that she heard her name mentioned in the conversation. Complainant averred that, after this event, she did not feel comfortable going to STSO about that harassment because he had informed TSO1 about her complaints. Complainant averred she informed TSM about this incident as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both STSO and TSM averred that the March 30, 2013 incident occurred while counseling TSO1 about the earlier statements. TSO1 responded to the allegation by averring that she was not aware of Complainant's sexual orientation at the time she made these comments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains corroborating testimony of TSO1's comments. TSO3 averred that she heard TSO1 make statements like this in the past and that it was clear that Complainant and TSO2 were offended by them. ROI at 541. She also averred that TSO1 made additional comments even after being told that they were offensive, and that management did not do anything to fix the hostile work environment. ROI at 553, 543. Another co-worker (TSO4) also averred that she believed that Complainant was being targeted because of her sexual orientation and EEO activity. ROI at 560, 566, 558.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserted that management and her co-workers were <span id="Page_993"></span>aware of her complaints to management in March 2013, and they began retaliating against her for having complained. She contacted an EEO Counselor on April 2, 2013. Complainant stated that on April 7, 2013, TSO1 refused to take a bag that Complainant was passing to her until she placed it on the floor first and stated to Complainant that she "would not want to touch your hands and you report me for harassment." TSO1 does not dispute saying this. Complainant also stated that in April 2013, TSO1 prohibited her from accessing and screening luggage, which was her assignment at the time. Complainant averred that, after this incident, she went to the checkpoint to work and informed the Lead TSO (LTSO1) about the incident. When TSO1 came back upstairs to the checkpoint, TSO1 allegedly remarked that she was "going to file an EEO complaint against [Complainant] because I did not do anything and she filed one against me." In response to this allegation, TSM averred that STSO counseled TSO1 about the incident and told her to stop the childish behavior because there were clearly issues between the two. In his affidavit, STSO averred it was merely a communication problem. However, TSO3 averred that she believed that this incident occurred because Complainant was pursuing the option of an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the record reveals that management sent an email on May 21, 2013, advising employees to be respectful of people's orientations, Complainant asserted that the Agency's efforts at ending the harassment were not sufficient. Complainant recalled requesting to be separated from TSO1 starting in March 2013, but she was informed that the airport was too small and only had one checkpoint, which would make such accommodation impossible. Complainant also averred that she asked TSM if she could get a transfer away from the harassment, but that TSM informed her that she had not been at the facility a year, which was required by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). TSM did not dispute this testimony and STSO averred that he did not remember Complainant asking for a transfer. STSO averred that he does not remember if Complainant asked to be separated or transferred. ROI at 440.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that, in the meantime, the harassment continued. She claimed that on May 27, 2013, TSO1 remarked:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Those girls never told me they were gay, I could not tell by looking at them. I have a sister who is gay, and I don't agree with her lifestyle, I still do not think gay people should be allowed to get married, I don't believe in it. I do not know why those girls still have a problem with me.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, Complainant met with STSO and informed him that the comments were continuing, and that then-President Obama had advised that employees were entitled to equal rights in the workplace regardless of sexual orientation. In response, STSO told her that she should not discuss politics at work. In an affidavit, TSO1 denied making this statement in front of Complainant. STSO averred that he did not remember the incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When asked what actions he took in response to Complainant's allegations, STSO averred that he conducted daily shift briefings on hostile work environment, but he did not remember if he offered any preventative or corrective actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also alleged that the Agency continued to retaliate against her in her performance rating when on July 7, 2013, she received only "Achieved Expectations" instead of "Exceeds Expectations." Complainant claimed that she should have received a higher rating because she had a clean disciplinary record and took on extra assignments. She further alleged that others did not perform extra assignments but received higher ratings. Complaint averred that when she asked STSO about her rating, she was told that she received a "3" for "Achieved Expectations" because she lacked experience. ROI at 358. Complainant then raised the matter with TSM, who changed the rating to an "Exceeded Expectations." TSM averred that he changed the rating when Complainant presented him with a list of her accomplishments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also claimed she was subjected to reprisal when she was not afforded advanced notice of overtime opportunities and was subjected to excess scrutiny at the checkpoint from the LTSO, which was embarrassing. TSO3 corroborated Complainant's testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant continued to revisit her transfer request with TSM at her one-year anniversary. However, in August 2013, TSM informed Complainant that she had to apply through the National Voluntary Transfer Program. TSM also advised her that staffing levels were low and that any decision as to whether she could be transferred would need to take staffing levels into consideration. Complainant stated that another female transferred to another airport but that management did not permit Complainant to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also complained about the harassment to her third-level supervisor, the Assistant Federal Security Director (AFSD) in Raleigh, North Carolina. The record contains an August 14, 2013 email from Complainant to AFSD asking her for assistance. In the email, Complainant alerted AFSD to the harassment and her EEO complaint. Complainant also informed her that she had completed the National Voluntary Transfer application and requested a transfer to Santa Barbara, where there was an opening. AFSD inquired as to whether Complainant had been separated from the harasser and informed her that her transfer request would be investigated. Complainant informed AFSD that she never received a response from TSM regarding her allegations and AFSD said she would follow up.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A few days later, on August 22, 2013, TSM sent Complainant a memo regarding her EEO allegations. Therein, TSM reported that he had completed an inquiry into Complainant's EEO complaint and he was able to substantiate only one incident because of a lack of corroborating evidence. He said the matter would be addressed with appropriate disciplinary action. However, there is no evidence that any disciplinary action was taken against TSO1 or any other individual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to Complainant's allegations, AFSD averred that she contacted TSM in August 2013, and she was satisfied that he had dealt with the situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">She added that she visited the Greenville, North Carolina facility in person on September 6, 2013, to discuss standards of conduct with Complainant and others. She also informed Complainant about the process of obtaining a transfer through the CBA. She noted that it was her belief that Complainant reacted negatively whenever she was with TSO1, and that Complainant was overly sensitive. She concluded that inappropriate comments were made, but there was insufficient evidence that TSO1 did this with intent to offend Complainant, and that "it is reasonable to believe that [TSO1] and [Complainant] have generational differences." With regard to separating Complainant and TSO1, she noted that because the airport had only one checkpoint it would be difficult to separate Complainant from TSO1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite AFSD's visit to the facility, Complainant claimed that TSO1's harassment continued through the fall of 2013, in retaliation for filing a complaint. The record reveals that on October 19, 2013, Complainant contacted AFSD again about the harassment and "mental intimidation." In her email, Complainant again requested a transfer to get away from the harassment. AFSD again referred Complainant to the CBA and stated that she would have TSM speak with Complainant. Complainant advised AFSD that she heard other TSOs and LTSO discussing whether they could have Complainant disciplined for having an attitude toward superiors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two incidents occurred on October 23, 2013, which ultimately led to Complainant's termination. Complainant claimed that at around 1:30-2:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, TSO1 made snide comments about her in front of passengers and tried to intimidate her. As a result, Complainant averred, she left her post because she was no longer felt comfortable working alongside TSO1. Complainant informed her Lead TSO (LTSO2) about the incident and then phoned TSM. Complainant averred that TSM assured her she would not have to work with TSO1 again, and she should come back in time for the next flight, approximately 2 hours later, when TSO1 would not be working. TSM's testimony does not dispute this; rather, he averred that he told Complainant to come back two hours later and that he "gave her a pass" for the first incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant averred that the second incident occurred soon after she returned around 4:00 <span class="small">P.M</span>. She stated that to her surprise, TSO1 was at the US Airways counter, out of uniform. Complainant again believed that she was being intimidated and left the building. Complainant contacted her LTSO and TSM again and informed them that she did not feel safe and was going to see her doctor. At this point, TSM told Complainant she was acting like a baby and that she should return immediately. Complainant averred that she returned about 30 minutes later.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was charged with 3.15 hours of Absence without Official Leave (AWOL). Soon thereafter, on October 31, 2013, AFSD scheduled a meeting to discuss the AWOL charge, but Complainant did not have time to confer with her union representative. The meeting was rescheduled to November 6, 2013, but Complainant averred she did not have representation. Complainant alleged that during that meeting, AFSD informed Complainant that her complaints were a distraction to security and that they did not believe her harassment allegations. AFSD averred that Complainant was terminated because management had lost confidence in her ability to perform the job and because she presented a security risk when she left her post.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claimed that she was retaliated against when she was issued the AWOL and termination charges. She denied being absent for 3 hours and 15 minutes and alleged that others have been late for work or have walked off the job but were not similarly disciplined. TSM denied that others were treated more favorably when they were AWOL. However, TSO3 averred that TSO1 was AWOL many times and was not disciplined.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also claimed that at this time a transfer to Santa Barbara was in the works, but on November 6, 2013, she was terminated. AFSD averred that Complainant was not eligible for a transfer because of the AWOL charge.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Phyllis F</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_994"></span>After a review of the record, we conclude that Complainant was subjected to harassment because of her sex because she was subjected to severe or pervasive comments which were premised on her sex; the sex of people she associated with; and included sex-based preferences, assumptions, expectations, stereotypes or norms. The record reveals that starting in February 2013, TSO1 made several offensive comments towards Complainant about her sexual orientation and suggested that she needed a man in her life. Complainant later overheard STSO and TSO1 discussing the incident, and TSO1 again remarked about gay marriage. Complainant also found this was offensive. TSO1 continued to make her disapproval of homosexuality and gay marriage known in May 2013. Complainant understood that TSO1 did not approve of her "lifestyle" and became fearful when working with TSO1, and thus the conduct unreasonably interfered with her work performance. Complainant has met her burden of establishing that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her sex.</p>
