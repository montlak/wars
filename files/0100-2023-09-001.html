<h2 class="h2" id="seci-1"><span class="space">I.</span> ORGANIZATION OF THE <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">GUIDE</span></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are many ways that this book could be organized. No single format would satisfy everyone's needs. This is true, in part, because the book is intended for a wide variety of people who already have, and require, different levels of understanding about the EEO process and the substantive law involved. The book is intended for use by laypersons, who have little or no understanding of the area; by human relations specialists; equal employment opportunity personnel; and less experienced representatives, who have some background and understanding of the procedures and substantive law; and by longtime EEO personnel, seasoned practitioners and administrative judges, who fully understand both the procedures and the law. In other words, this book is intended for use by the full array of individuals who must administer, implement, defend, prosecute, and adjudicate equal employment opportunity programs and cases in the federal sector.</p>
<p class="noindent">The book is organized first to acquaint the reader with the statutory authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the federal sector EEO administrative process, including the precomplaint or counseling stage, and to give a complete overview of the formal complaint stage. Until October 1, 1992, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission operated the federal sector EEO process under 29 CFR Part 1613. As of October 1, 1992, the Commission's regulations at 29 CFR Part 1614 became effective, and Part 1613 was abolished. Part 1614 revised the federal sector EEO administrative process. The <span class="Italic">Guide</span> has been organized to be consistent with Part 1614. At the same time, because the Commission still looks to Part 1613 to interpret Part 1614, case law and guidance issued under Part 1613 are included in the book to the extent they remain relevant. On July 12, 1999, the Commission amended Part 1614 to be effective November 9, 1999. The changes, which were significant, generated much in the way of comment from agencies, complainants' representatives, and affected organizations. The changes brought about by the amendments are reviewed in <a href="0100-2023-10-001.html#sec1-1">Chapter 1</a> and discussed in detail throughout the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>, where appropriate. On May 21, 2002, the Commission issued a notice of final rulemaking amending 29 CFR 1614.203. 67 Fed. Reg. 35732. The rulemaking adopts the Commission's guidance under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 29 CFR Part 1630 as being applicable in federal sector cases effective June 20, 2002, thereby replacing its previous guidance issued under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Pursuant to the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, the Commission issued its Notice of Final Rulemaking adopting changes to Part 1630 to make it consistent with the ADAAA. The amendments to Part 1630 become effective May 24, 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent">In December 2009, the EEOC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would make several discrete, though largely insignificant changes, to Part 1614 and the federal sector process. The most significant changes were to the class complaint processing regulations. The changes, published at 77 Fed. Reg. 43498-43506 (July 25, 2012) became effective on September 24, 2012, brought the class complaint process in line with the individual complaint process and adopted a final agency action procedure requiring agencies to appeal findings of administrative judges in class complaints in the same manner as they must appeal individual complaint decisions. Other changes were mostly cosmetic and are noted in the appropriate chapters on the EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the regulations of the EEOC set forth the administrative process in general detail, the Commission supplements the regulations through management directives issued to federal agencies. These management directives contain further explanation, guidance, and clarification of the Commission's position on a wide range of substantive and procedural issues in much the same way that the Federal Personnel Manual formerly supplemented the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management. Of particular significance is Management Directive ("MD") 110, Federal Sector Complaints Processing Manual, which was revised in November 1999 to implement the Commission's amendments to Part 1614. MD-110 is now available online at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/federal-sector/management-directive/management-directive-110">https://www.eeoc.gov/federal-sector/management-directive/management-directive-110</a>, and has also been included in relevant sections of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>. The importance of MD-110 should not be overlooked; the "Commission's guidance is binding in nature, Federal agencies are required to comply with it." MD-110 at p. 2. One of the few other changes of any significance in the Commission's 2012 rulemaking was the addition of 29 CFR 1614.102(e) making clear that compliance with Part 1614 and EEOC Management Directives and Bulletins is mandatory on the part of agencies.</p>
<p class="noindent">As of July 1, 2002, the Commission published a <span class="Italic"><a href="https://deweypub.com/store/media/EEOC_Administrative_Judges_Handbook.pdf">Handbook for Administrative Judges. The Judges' Handbook</a></span> contains standardized procedural guidance for the processing of cases at the hearing stage and also contains considerable guidance on discovery and summary judgment. The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> is discussed in <a href="0100-2023-15-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In October 2003, the Commission issued Management Directive 715 with guidance to federal agencies for establishing and maintaining affirmative employment programs under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. The Management Directive requires federal agencies to do an annual self-analysis of complaint activity and processing and to scrutinize the resulting data for employment barriers to protected groups. MD-715 is discussed in Chapter 1 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-10-025.html#sec1-26">Management Directive 715</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also publishes, from time to time, "Enforcement Guidance" and "Field Instructions" on various topics of interest in the field of discrimination law that set forth the Commission's position and case law, as well as the case law of the federal courts. The Commission has issued and periodically updates an EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span> that contains additional guidance on substantive and procedural matters before the Commission. Although the <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span> is drafted primarily with the private sector in mind, many sections are specifically applicable to the federal government and the Office of Federal Operations, the EEOC's federal sector appellate branch, routinely relies on the <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span> in its decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the Commission publishes the Digest of Equal Employment Opportunity Law on a quarterly basis. The Digest reviews significant federal sector decisions issued by the Office of Federal Operations and also contains an article on a current topic of interest setting forth important decisions and Commission guidance on the subject. All of these publications are available on the Commission's website at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The first seven chapters of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> explain the EEO process as administered by the federal agencies covered by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Equal Pay Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. The <span class="Italic">Guide</span> begins with a chapter that presents an overview of EEOC jurisdiction and the administrative process. The next three chapters cover the complaint process from precomplaint counseling through the investigative stage. Under the former Part 1613, agencies were required to make attempts at settling the complaint at the conclusion of the investigative stage. Although that requirement was dropped from Part 1614, as the complaint moves from the investigative to the hearing stage, aside from precomplaint counseling this still is the most likely time for the parties to engage in settlement discussions. As a result, the topic of settlement is covered in <a href="0100-2023-14-001.html#sec5-1">Chapter 5</a>. Hearings are covered in <a href="0100-2023-15-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a>, and the discussion of the administrative process concludes with a <a href="0100-2023-16-001.html#sec7-1">Chapter 7</a> on final agency decisions. Appeals to the EEOC are covered in <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec8-1">Chapter 8</a>. <a href="0100-2023-18-001.html#sec9-1">Chapter 9</a> deals with issues related to employees and their representatives in the administrative process, including the use of official time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Chapters <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec10-1">10</a> through <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">12</a> discuss the theories of intentional, adverse impact, and harassment discrimination, and the burdens of proof applicable to each theory. The purpose behind this organization is to give the reader a firm grasp of the entire EEO process and a basis for evaluating potential cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">Chapters 13 through 17 deal with the actual prohibited bases of discrimination, i.e., race, color, sex, national origin, religion, disability status, age, and reprisal. The purpose of these chapters is to give the reader an understanding of how the analytical modes apply to the various bases of discrimination and to bring attention to variations of those modes under specific prohibited bases. The next chapter, <a href="0100-2023-27-001.html#sec18-1">Chapter 18</a>, focuses on how these bases of prohibited discrimination are applied to the wide variety of personnel actions and terms and conditions of employment encountered in the federal workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent">A chapter on processing class action complaints, <a href="0100-2023-28-001.html#sec19-1">Chapter 19</a>, has been included to follow the chapter on personnel actions. The chapter deals mainly with practice and procedure in class actions, as distinguished from individual complaints. Since the vast majority of agency and Commission cases deal with complaints of discrimination filed by individuals, the chapter has been segregated from the other chapters on the administrative processing of complaints to avoid confusion.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a href="0100-2023-29-001.html#sec20-1">Chapter 20</a> deals with options for pursuing EEO complaints through negotiated grievance procedures and the Merit Systems Protection Board. In some instances, as addressed in that chapter, the employee will have the option of choosing one of those forums over the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next, the book contains chapters on forms of relief available through the EEO process, <a href="0100-2023-30-001.html#sec21-1">Chapter 21</a>, and the recovery of attorney fees, <a href="0100-2023-31-001.html#sec22-1">Chapter 22</a>. Since relief is, after all, the object of bringing any complaint and, at least from a complainant's point of view, the desired culmination of all the effort that goes into a complaint, it seemed appropriate to reserve a discussion of relief until the end of the book. This is not to say that the chapter on relief is only for complainants. Agencies also should be familiar with their potential liabilities in a case, since such a determination may have considerable influence on settlement deliberations. Also, a thorough familiarity with remedies will help avoid disputes in cases where an agency enters a finding of discrimination and grants relief. In previous editions, the issues of relief and attorney were included in the same chapter. But with the passage of time, not to mention new legislation, each area has become complex enough to deserve separate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_2"></span>The <span class="Italic">Guide</span> includes a subject matter <a href="0100-2023-34-001.html#ind">index</a>, a detailed table of contents, and a table of cases. It is anticipated that the book will not keep one so enthralled as to be read from cover to cover. Rather, it is anticipated that the book will be used by persons to gain a general understanding of specific areas of law, or to assist in answering particular questions about an individual case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The book also is not designed to give the reader an exhaustive account of every case decided by the Commission on a particular subject. For the most part, string cites have been avoided. The author's intent is to give the reader a reasonably succinct statement of the law in a particular area, discuss the significant cases, provide commentary, and then move on to other subjects.</p>
<p class="noindent">One reason for avoiding string cites is that, in the past, the Commission, unlike the courts, issued written decisions in each case that came before it. Courts, on the other hand, do not always issue written decisions and even when they do, many are "unpublished" because the court does not believe the case is of precedential value or clarifies existing law in any way. Many of the Commission's past decisions lack any precedential or clarifying value. They are merely the final administrative resolution for the parties of cases that involve the application of well-established law to a particular set of facts. An attempt to include all of these cases in any book would add quantity, but not quality. In late 1997, the Commission adopted the practice of issuing "short form" decisions in many of its cases. Those decisions, without any discussion, provide a final administrative resolution to cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">String cites also have been avoided because they tend to give the reader the impression that the author has made an extensive effort to include in the text all citations that are, or may be, relevant to a particular determination in a specific case. This, in turn, tends to discourage further research. For the practitioner, there is no substitute for an actual review of Commission decisions selected because of their relevance to a particular case. The book is intended to make the overall task of research easier, not to replace it. Review of additional Commission decisions which apply established law to various factual scenarios may well give the reader a better understanding of how to evaluate his or her own case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Comments, be they on the organization, substance, style, or errors of commission or omission, are appreciated. Once the author has overcome the personal trauma of the particular criticism, comments will be assessed and possibly even used in subsequent revisions of the book. Of course, the author retains the right to label the commentator a fool and persist in his own backward and stubborn ways. Finally, the publisher retains the right to label the author a fool and insist on appropriate revisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">This book is designed to be a resource for learning about the sometimes peculiar world of discrimination law in the federal sector. The author has sought to include some practical tips regarding the handling of those cases; those tips should not be construed as legal advice. In the end, there is no substitute for the preparation that goes into individual cases. It is hoped, however, that this <span class="Italic">Guide</span> will make that preparation somewhat easier.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's decisions are published and available in printed form and on computer on-line services, greatly expanding the resources of both employees and agency representatives in pursuing discrimination complaints. The Commission has made some of its federal sector case law available on its website.</p>
