<h2 class="h2" id="sec5-14"><span class="space">II.</span> OFFERS OF RESOLUTION</h2>
<p class="noindent">In its 1999 amendments to Part 1614, the Commission abandoned the certified offer of full relief in favor of an offer of resolution. The offer of resolution is loosely based on an offer of judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 68. Agencies may tender offers of resolution that limit their liability for attorney fees if a complainant refuses the offer and, in a subsequent decision, is awarded less than what the agency offered. The regulation, 29 CFR 1614.109(c), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Any time after the filing of the written complaint but not later than the date an administrative judge is appointed to conduct a hearing, the agency may make an offer of resolution to a complainant who is represented by an attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;Any time after the parties have received notice that an administrative judge has been appointed to conduct a hearing, but not later than 30 days prior to the hearing, the agency may make an offer of resolution to the complainant, whether represented by an attorney or not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;The offer of resolution shall be in writing and shall include a notice explaining the possible consequences of failing to accept the offer. The agency's offer, to be effective, must include attorney's fees and costs and must specify any non-monetary relief. With regard to monetary relief, an agency may make a lump sum offer covering all forms of monetary liability, or it may itemize the amounts and types of monetary relief being offered. The complainant shall have 30 days from receipt of the offer of resolution to accept it. If the complainant fails to accept an offer of resolution and the relief awarded in the administrative judge's decision, the agency's final decision, or the Commission decision on appeal is not more favorable than the offer, then, except where the interest of justice would not be served, the complainant shall not receive payment from the agency of attorney's fees or costs incurred after the expiration of the 30-day acceptance period. An acceptance of an offer must be in writing and will be timely if postmarked or received within the 30-day period. Where a complainant fails to accept an offer of resolution, an agency may make other offers of resolution and either party may seek to negotiate a settlement of the complaint at any time.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant does not accept an offer of resolution within 30 days, the case proceeds on its normal course.</p>
<p class="noindent">Offers of judgment in the courts have created some confusion, and there will certainly be many disputes regarding how offers of resolution should be interpreted in cases in the administrative EEO process. One of the main areas of dispute will likely be how to assign value to injunctive relief--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, non-monetary relief--that the agency did not offer but the complainant was awarded by the Commission. The Commission recognized that non-monetary relief is of value to complainants, and observed in its comments with the final rule, 64 Fed. Reg. 37,648 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that, when comparing the relief offered in an offer of resolution with that actually obtained, we intended that non-monetary relief as well as monetary relief would be considered. Although a comparison of non-monetary relief may be inexact and difficult in some cases, non-monetary relief can be significant and cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p class="noindent">Indeed, it will be difficult to place a value on such non-monetary relief as a finding of discrimination, a notice of the violation posted at the agency, or mandated training of the responsible agency officials.</p>
<p class="noindent">The exception to limiting attorney fees after rejection of an offer and subsequent failure to be awarded more than the offer is when granting fees would be in the interest of justice. The Commission indicated that it will take a very narrow view of this exception, noting, at 64 Fed. Reg. 37,648 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not envision many circumstances in which the interest of justice provision will apply. One example, however, of appropriate use of the exception would be where the complainant received an offer of resolution, but was informed by a responsible agency official that the agency would not comply in good faith with the offer (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, would unreasonably delay implementation of the relief offered). The complainant did not accept the offer for that reason, and then obtained less relief than was contained in the offer of resolution. We believe that it would be unjust to deny attorney's fees and costs in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_351"></span>Of course, the complainant would have to prove this prospective lack of good faith before the agency even has a chance to attempt compliance with the offer. Unless the agency was careless enough to put its bad intentions in writing or announce them to a group of people, the agency's prospective bad faith would be almost impossible for a complainant to show.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a level on which the provision is nonsensical. The impact of rejecting an offer of resolution is to limit the agency's liability for attorney fees. Prior to the hearing stage, the agency cannot make an offer of resolution to a complainant not represented by an attorney. The agency can only make an offer of resolution to a complainant not represented by an attorney once the case is before an administrative judge. Obviously, this provision is intended to insulate the complainant not represented by a lawyer from undue influence. There is some question as to why an agency would make an offer of resolution, designed to limit its liability for attorney fees, to a complainant who is not represented by an attorney. Presumably, this question and others will be answered in the Commission's case law that will undoubtedly develop around this new provision. The only apparent reason is to prevent a complainant from retaining a lawyer. Most lawyers, knowing the complainant is not likely able to pay full fees, will not accept a case if there is a restriction on fee recovery.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission gives a lengthy explanation of offers of resolution in MD-110, at 6-28 to 6-30:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An offer of resolution made pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(c) can be made to a complainant who is represented by an attorney at any time after the filing of a complaint until thirty (30) days before a hearing. If, however, the complainant is not represented by an attorney, an offer of resolution cannot be made before the case is assigned to an Administrative Judge for a hearing. (These time and representation provisions apply only to offers of resolution and do not restrict the parties from discussing settlement or engaging in an alternate dispute resolution process in an effort to resolve an EEO complaint.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainants have 30 days from receipt of an offer of resolution to consider the offer and decide whether to accept it. Offers of resolution must be in writing and must explain to the complainant the possible consequences of failing to accept the offer. The agency's offer, to be acceptable, must include attorney's fees and costs, and must specify any non<span class="Italic">-</span>monetary relief. The agency may offer a lump sum payment that includes all forms of monetary liability, including attorney's fees and costs, or the payment may itemize the amounts and types of monetary relief being offered. Complainant's acceptance of the offer must also be in writing. Upon acceptance, the complaint is settled in full and processing ceases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If a complainant decides not to accept the offer, the agency takes no immediate action, and the complaint continues to be processed normally. After the hearing is completed, if the Administrative Judge (or the Commission on appeal) concludes that discrimination has occurred, but provides for less relief than the amount offered by the agency earlier in its offer of resolution, then the agency may use complainant's decision not to accept its offer of resolution to argue for a reduction in its obligation to pay complainant's attorney's fees. In general, if a complainant fails to accept a properly made offer, and the relief ordered on the complaint is not more favorable than the offer, then the complainant will not receive payment from the agency for attorney's fees or costs incurred after the expiration of the 30-day acceptance period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It should be noted, however, that an exception to this general rule exists where the interests of justice would not be served. An example of an appropriate use of the interests of justice exception is where the complainant received an offer of resolution, but was informed by a responsible agency official that the agency would not comply in good faith with the offer (for example, would unreasonably delay implementation of the relief offered). If the complainant did not accept the offer for that reason, and then obtained less relief than was obtained in the offer, it would be unjust to deny attorney's fees and costs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant's failure to accept an offer of resolution does not preclude the agency from making other offers of resolution or either party from seeking to negotiate a settlement of the complaint at any time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When comparing the relief offered in an offer of resolution with that actually obtained, the Commission intends that non-monetary as well as monetary relief be considered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a comparison of non-monetary relief may be inexact and difficult in some cases, non-monetary relief can be significant and cannot be overlooked. Attorney's fees and costs incurred after the offer of resolution may not be included in the amount actually obtained for comparison purposes. For guidance, parties may wish to refer to court cases deciding issues involving an offer of judgment made pursuant to Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Marek v. Chesney</span>, 473 U.S. 1 (1985). While not identical, the Commission's offer of resolution provision was modeled on the Rule 68 offer of judgment process.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a hearing is bifurcated an offer of resolution must be made at least 30 days prior to the hearing on liability and not 30 days prior to the hearing on damages. In <span class="Italic">Pearman v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A40063 (2004), the Commission found that an offer of resolution made after the hearing on liability but before the hearing on damages was not valid. "Waiting until the damages hearing to present the offer did not serve one of the regulation's purposes: judicial economy." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission also found the offer was invalid because it did not specify nonmonetary relief such as posting of a notice of violation and training.</p>
<p class="noindent">One aspect of the offer of resolution is that the agency must be prepared to follow through on its promises in the offer if the complainant accepts. In <span class="Italic">Lelah T. v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0720150034 (2015), the agency made an offer of resolution and, in the same communication, included a proposed settlement agreement that offered less in the way of relief. The agency argued that the complainant did not accept the offer because it said the full terms would be put in a fully drafted and executed agreement. The agency also argued that the offer was void because it did not contain OWBPA language. The Commission rejected both arguments, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree. On February 27, 2015, the Agency presented Complainant with two separate documents. The first was the offer of resolution, where the Agency provided more favorable terms and warned that if she did not accept it and received less relief from the AJ or on appeal, she would forfeit Agency payment of some attorney fees. The second was the proposed settlement agreement, with far less favorable terms. When Complainant's attorney pointed out this inconsistency and asked the Agency what the offer was, the Agency replied the offer of resolution was the offer. It added that the offer of resolution would only be filed with the Commission if the parties proceed to hearing and Complainant prevailed on some or all of her claims, and the proposed settlement agreement was what the Agency proposed the parties file with the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency presented Complainant with an offer of resolution with more favorable terms to limit the payment of attorney fees if the AJ or EEOC on appeal awarded Complainant less favorable relief. As acknowledged by the Agency, it would only file the offer with the Commission if the parties proceeded to a hearing and Complainant prevailed on part or all of her claims. This strategy backfired when Complainant accepted the offer of resolution, to the apparent surprise of the Agency. We agree with Complainant that she was free to reject the separate proposed settlement agreement because it was not consistent with the accepted offer of resolution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OWBPA, which amended the ADEA effective October 16, 1990, provides that a waiver of ADEA claims is not considered knowing and voluntary unless certain procedural requirements are met, including that the waiver specifically refer to rights or claims under the ADEA. The Agency argues that because the accepted offer of resolution does not meet the requirements of the OWBPA, the resolution is void. Assuming without deciding that the OWBPA applies to the offer of resolution process, we disagree with the Agency. As argued by Complainant, the OWBPA is for the benefit of the complainant, not the Agency. <span class="Italic">Canada v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12056 (June 7, 2002) (where Complainant did not invoke the protection of the OWBPA, and specifically requested the Agency to abide by the terms of the settlement agreement, the parties remain bound by the terms thereof. Accordingly, the Agency improperly reinstated the complaint). The Agency cites four cases in support of its argument. But none of the cases involved an Agency invoking the OWBPA to find a settlement agreement invalid.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We understand the Agency's concern about the OWBPA waiver not being addressed in the accepted offer of resolution. Previously Complainant indicated she was willing to address this by signing a settlement agreement consistent with the offer of resolution that contained the Proper waivers. We will address this in the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the order, the complainant was required to cooperate with the agency if it wished to enter into an agreement that contained the OWBPA language.</p>
