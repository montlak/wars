<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-26"><span class="space">E.</span> VAGUE AGREEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Except as noted above in the section on Oral Agreements, settlement agreements are required to be reduced to writing. That is still no guarantee that disputes as to the meaning of the agreement will not be encountered. Terms used in the agreement should be clearly defined and the obligations of the parties should be expressed in clear, plain English. Both parties should be careful that all provisions of settlement actually agreed upon are reflected in the written document. As a general rule, oral promises not reflected in the agreement are not enforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many agreements include a standard clause to the effect that the agreement reflects the entire understanding of the parties. When the settlement agreement includes a provision to the effect that the writing constitutes the complete understanding of the parties, the remaining provisions should be clear as to the letter and intent of their meaning. In <span class="Italic">Villalpando v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01832074 (1984), the EEOC refused to reinstate a complaint where the agreement provided that the agency would not engage in reprisal against the appellant. The appellant alleged that the agency's refusal to reassign him was an act of reprisal and constituted a breach of the agreement. Because the agreement made no mention of what acts would be considered as reprisal, the EEOC found the agreement had not been breached. Although the agency would not reinstate the initial complaint, it did accept for investigation the employee's allegation that the failure to reassign him was in reprisal for protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">A common phrase referenced in contract law is a "meeting of the minds," which requires that the contract reflect a common understanding between the parties in the formation of the agreement. When a provision or provisions of a contract are vague, it follows that the parties may not have had the same understanding of the promises that were made. When this happens, the contract may be void. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Darlena H. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120173018 (2018), where the parties agreed that the complainant would "resume her FMO [Field Maintenance] Duties." Both the agency and the complainant interpreted that clause differently, and the Commission found the contract to be void for vagueness:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as to provision (2), Complainant asserted that she has not been provided with her FMO duties. As to the specific FMO duties, Complainant was primarily concerned with the fact that she had the keys of a staff car removed from her which she used to conduct her field visits and EWP reviews in the field with Postmasters. In addition, Complainant indicated that she had conducted EWP assessments and provided training to all new custodians in the field office in the Honolulu District. As such, she claimed that the Manager failed to return her to these duties following her EWP assignment. In support of her claim, Complainant provided a copy of the position description which provides overall information regarding the position but does not specify which duties Complainant performed or the duties to which she should have resumed. In response, the Agency pointed to information provided by the Manager who indicated that the car is not part of Complainant's duties and EWP assessments and training were Complainant's collateral duties which Complainant had performed. However, the Manager has since been assigned these duties to other employees. Again, we note that the Agency failed to provide a copy of a statement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the settlement agreement, we determine that this provision is too vague and general to have allowed for a meeting of the minds between the parties. Specifically, we find that the settlement language that Complainant "will resume her FMO Duties" is too ambiguous. In this regard, we note the divergent interpretations by the parties with respect to what these terms mean. Complainant believed it meant that she was to return to the duties she had been performing. The Agency, on the other hand, stated that the Manager believed that these duties were not within Complainant's position description. Consequently, we find that there was no contemporaneous meeting of the minds between the parties and that the settlement agreement is void for vagueness. <span class="Italic">See Mullen v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890349 (May 18, 1989). When voiding an agreement, the parties are returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> at the time the agreement was entered.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agreements that are contingent upon the fulfillment of certain conditions or the occurrence of certain events also leave themselves open to varying interpretations that may make the agreements essentially unenforceable. In <span class="Italic">Leach v. USPS</span>, 01832150 (1984), the appellant withdrew her complaint pursuant to an agreement which stated she would be reemployed by the agency if she met the physical requirements of her new position. Following a physical examination, she was informed that she failed to meet the physical requirements for the position in question. The EEOC upheld the decision of the agency not to reinstate her complaint due to breach of the agreement because the appellant failed to show the agreement was abrogated. The agency also correctly advised the appellant that if she disagreed with the results of the physical, she could initiate a new complaint based on disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a clause is vague does not mean the agreement is void or that the agency has no obligation to the complainant. The Commission will find the agency breached a settlement agreement where a vague clause concerning priority consideration is given different interpretations by the parties but the agency cannot demonstrate compliance regardless of which interpretation is adopted. <span class="Italic">Sarnowski v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01892384 (1989). The proper remedy in such a case, because the agreement cannot be enforced, is to remand the complaint to the agency with instructions to the parties to attempt another informal settlement and, failing that, for the agency to reinstate the complaint. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, when the only terms included in the agreement are vague, it is unenforceable and void. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lukas v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120103165 (2012), the parties agreed that the complainant would be "consistently" assigned to work vacant routes and that if the complainant "consistently" was unavailable for the assignments, she would forfeit the scheduling opportunities. The Commission found that agreement was too vague to constitute a "meeting of the minds" between the two parties. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Santos v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520120539 (2013) (agreement voided as vague where parties agreed complainant would be placed in a certain level position but failed to specify when placement would take place).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DeLong v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A53582 (2006),<span class="Italic"> recon. denied</span>, 05A53582 (2006), the Commission found that an agency commitment to give the complainant a variety of assignments outside of a particular office and within her medical restrictions was enforceable even though the provision was vague. The Commission found that the agency was in breach because, over a 16-month period, it had given the complainant only three such assignments, and two were to the same job. Although the complainant had requested specific enforcement, the Commission ordered her complaint reinstated. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Gayles v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064585 (2008), the Commission found that the terms of the agreement were vague, but not so vague as to be unenforceable. The agency agreed to place the complainant in a job within her medical restrictions. The complainant's physician said she should be placed in a low-stress job, but not as a letter carrier. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that the letter carrier position that the complainant was offered was a low-stress job in a different location. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Gayles</span>, found "that the terms of the settlement agreement are exceptionally vague and provide very little context to the agency's broad promise to comply with complainant's medical restrictions. As such, the poorly drafted agreement states that the agency would abide by the restrictions of complainant's physician, without qualification."</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961542 (1997), the Commission ordered reinstatement of the complaint after finding a breach of settlement agreement, because the potential for future breach of the agreement was great based upon the vagueness of a crucial clause. In that case, the agreement called for the appellant to make a "concerted" effort to bid on daytime jobs. In exchange, the complainant was to be granted a temporary change in schedule to daytime hours on her current position. Although the complainant submitted bids for 16 of 23 posted daytime jobs in a several month period, the agency contended this was not a "concerted" effort. Because "reasonable minds" could differ on what "concerted" means, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bullock</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c) provides that if the Commission determines that the agency is not in compliance with a settlement agreement and the noncompliance is not attributable to acts or conduct of the complainant, it may order compliance or it may order that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased. The decision regarding whether to order compliance with the agreement or reinstatement of the complaint is discretionary and based on the facts of each case. We reluctantly find that the facts warrant setting the settlement aside and reinstating appellant's informal Complaint No. 1B-065-1022-94 from the point processing ceased. Our decision ordering reinstatement is based, in large part, on the fact that we find that the settlement, as written, will likely result in future allegations of breach.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem with the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Bullock</span> is that it had already found the agency was in breach and that the complainant had made a "concerted" effort. The complainant's reward for this effort, and the agency's punishment for its obstinacy, was to have the entire agreement voided.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lowrance v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10685 (2001), found the settlement agreement was void for lack of consideration because the agency incurred no legal detriment and the agreement was too vague for enforcement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the agreement, which requires the agency to make a conscious effort to examine the workload each day so that perhaps [complainant] can work towards an eight hour day" (emphasis added), does not require the agency to incur any legal detriment at all. We find the "conscious effort" element to be too vague to be enforced. Further, the agreement fails to provide complainant with an eight-hour day, but instead states that "perhaps" it would occur. Therefore, we <span id="Page_358"></span>find that complainant received no consideration for withdrawing her complaint and the settlement agreement is void.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Flowers v. Postmaster General</span>, 05900618 (1990), the Commission found that although the agency could not be deemed to have violated a vague settlement clause, "the interest of equity" required reinstatement of the complaint. In that case, the agency agreed to hire the complainant as a letter carrier contingent upon obtaining a government driving license. At the time of the agreement, both the complainant and the agency knew her state driver's license was suspended. The Commission found the precise wording of the clause was vague and that it was possible that the complainant did not know she could not obtain a government license without a valid state license.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case that is noted more for its curiosity than legal significance, the appellant alleged that the agency breached a settlement agreement by not purchasing him an acceptable chair. The appellant's doctor approved a "Lazy Boy" executive recliner. However, the agency felt the chair was not conducive to an acceptable work environment and the appellant was sent to another doctor for examination. The other doctor recommended a different type of chair, which the appellant refused to accept. Finding that the settlement agreement was silent on who could determine what was an acceptable chair, the EEOC ruled that there was insufficient evidence that the agency violated the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v. USPS</span>, 01842121 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC does not adhere rigorously to the parol evidence rule. However, when an agreement is otherwise clear on its face and appears to be complete, the mere appellant's assertions that other oral promises were made will not be persuasive. <span class="Italic">See Cox v. USPS</span>, 01841114 (1985). In <span class="Italic">Henaghan v. USPS</span>, 01860776 (1987), the Commission found that the agency failed to honor a settlement agreement when it refused to consider the complainant for a part-time vacancy. The agreement merely stated that the agency would consider the complainant for part-time vacancies. The Commission rejected the assertion of the Postmaster that the complainant had stated orally he would not consider a position for only 10 hours per week.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission generally follows contract rules for interpretation of agreements, and the meaning of the agreement is to be deduced from the language and contents of the agreement when the language is plain and unambiguous. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roberts v. USPS</span>, 01842193 (1985). The agreement truly must be binding to be enforceable. A promise that reassignment is possible will not be considered as a binding agreement. <span class="Italic">See Vicor v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 01831442 (1983). Settlement language that is vague, but not so vague that it cannot be subject to interpretation, will be construed against the party drafting the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Ledford v. Postmaster General</span>, 01913078 (1991). In that case, the agreement provided the complainant would receive priority consideration for the next two vacancies for which she applied. The agency argued that it was not in breach of the agreement because it was incumbent upon the complainant to inform the selecting officials of her priority consideration. The Commission rejected that argument finding that, in the absence of any express language defining who was required to inform the selecting official, the language would be construed against the agency since the agency drafted the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">That ambiguities in the language of a settlement agreement are held against the drafter is particularly true where the agency, after drafting the agreement, adopts an interpretation that deprives the complainant of any consideration. <span class="Italic">Bohelska v. Postmaster General</span>, 05950389 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a settlement agreement is so vague that what the parties agreed upon cannot be determined, the proper course is to declare the settlement null and void and to resume processing of the complaint from the point of settlement. <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. USPS</span>, 01831956 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">A settlement provision that requires a complainant to "make every effort" to display a "positive and professional demeanor" is too vague to enforce. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01932660 (1993). Even if the Commission could discern what was meant by such a demeanor, it could not determine if the complainant's actual efforts were less than required by the provision. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Zebrowski v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965176 (1997), the Commission held that the settlement agreement's requirement that appellant be treated with "dignity and respect" was too vague to allow a determination as to whether the agency complied with the provision, and that the appellant received no consideration for withdrawing his request for EEO counseling. The Commission remanded the case to the agency to process the complaint. The very same month it decided the <span class="Italic">Zebrowski</span> case, however, the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Bruns v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965395 (1997), that the settlement agreement's requirement that appellant be "treated fairly with dignity and respect" is too vague to allow a determination as to whether the agency complied with such a provision, and therefore the appellant failed to show breach. But, in <span class="Italic">MacNair v. Postmaster General</span>, 01964653 (1997), the Commission again found that the settlement agreement's requirement that appellant be treated with "dignity and respect" was too vague to allow a determination as to whether the agency complied with such a provision, and the provision that appellant be "provided a workplace free of harassment and discrimination did not confer on appellant any benefit that she was not already entitled to as a matter of law." The Commission found that appellant received no consideration for withdrawing her complaint. The Commission set aside the settlement agreement for lack of consideration and remanded the case to the agency to reinstate the settled matter from the point processing ceased. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992286 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a settlement agreement states that a suspension will be vacated if the complainant has fully successful performance evaluations and no further discipline for one year, the focus is not on the final rating, but on all interim ratings as well. In <span class="Italic">Law v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01953655 (1996), the Commission found the agency had not breached the settlement agreement where the complainant had a final rating of fully successful but one interim rating of minimally successful. The Commission found the settlement language, which specified evaluations in the plural, was controlling and that the complainant was required to have a rating of fully successful on all ratings for the year.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agreement that fails to specific when an agency will take a personnel action is void for vagueness. For example, in <span class="Italic">Santos v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520120539 (2013), the Commission found an agreement that provided that complainant's PS Form 50 would be reissued to reflect a Level PS-07(0) was void for vagueness where the agreement failed to specify and effective date and the parties disagreed on the effective date. The Commission found that the vague nature of the agreement demonstrated that the parties had not reached a meeting of the minds.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency offers a settlement that it deems full relief and the offer is vague, the offer should be clarified and resubmitted to the complainant. It is error for the agency to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the complainant rejected an offer of full relief. <span class="Italic">Sewell v. Army and Air Force Exchange Service</span>, 01881953 (1988). In that case, the agency offered full settlement with respect to one complaint but, in the agreement, referred to all of the complainant's outstanding complaints. The Commission ordered the agency to resubmit the agreement in clarified form and to give the complainant another 15 days to respond.</p>
