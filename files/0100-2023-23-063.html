<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-61_1"><span class="space">a.</span> Performance Issues vs. Ability to Perform Essential Functions of the Job</h5>
<p class="noindent">The fact that an employee is performing her duties poorly does not mean <span class="Italic">per se</span> that she is no longer a qualified individual with a disability. The agency has means at its disposal to deal with poor performance or misconduct problems, but terminating the reasonable accommodation process is not one of those means. In <span class="Italic">Ghannam v. Agency for International Development</span>, 01990574 (2000), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, complainant "conditionally accepted" the offered reassignment, advising S1 that she still sought accommodation in her original position, and within weeks her physician proposed that the agency consider whether assistive technology could be used to permit complainant to resume her original duties. In these circumstances, we do not find that the interactive process, or the agency's ongoing duty to accommodate a qualified individual with a disability, was terminated by virtue of complainant's reassignment to a receptionist position. We find that the agency was required to consider the request for accommodation in complainant's original secretarial position, and absent undue hardship, to provide such accommodation in lieu of reassignment to a receptionist position. <span class="Italic">Compare Villanova v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05 940528 (September 27, 1995) (complainant was not entitled to voice-activated computer software as accommodation for carpal tunnel syndrome where agency offered equally effective accommodation within her current position by assigning her non-typing duties).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we do not disturb the AJ's findings that the remainder of complainant's claims are without merit, and further that much of complainant's testimony was discredited by the evidence of record. Similarly, we do not disturb the AJ's factual findings that complainant failed to perform her library duties in a satisfactory manner. However, as a legal matter, we find that complainant's deficient job performance, on which the AJ relies, did not terminate the agency's ongoing obligation to provide reasonable accommodation. Poor job performance by an employee is distinct from an employee's failure to cooperate in the interactive process. Generally, if a qualified individual with a disability performs poorly or engages in misconduct, the employer may have grounds for disciplinary action, a poor appraisal, or other appropriate personnel action, not termination of reasonable accommodation efforts. While a qualified individual with a disability remains an employee, he or she is entitled to reasonable accommodation absent undue hardship or direct threat.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Tanya D. v. Attorney General</span>, 2022002544 (2022), noted that "any concerns with the quality of Complainant's performance are irrelevant" to whether the complainant is able to perform the essential functions of the job. After being reassigned to a new location, <span class="Italic">Tanya D</span>. requested a flexible schedule and to return to her original assignment location as a reasonable accommodation. Instead, the agency allowed her to "take appropriate leave to address medical appointments and/or therapy," "coordinate and/or schedule her medical appointments and/or therapy before and/or after business hours" and adjusted her work schedule. The AJ issued summary judgment in favor of the agency, finding that the complainant was not an individual with a disability. In reversing the AJ's decision, the Commission reiterated the difference between poor performance and a complainant's inability to perform the essential functions of the position in <span class="Italic">Tanya D</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the record contains a statement from the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Counterterrorism Branch in Miami who stated that she has worked with Complainant since 2011 and to her knowledge, Complainant is fit for duty and has consistently been rated "Successful" and "Excellent" on her performance appraisals in that time. While we acknowledge that there is evidence in the record of performance issues with Complainant, we note that aside from Complainant's need to take breaks, the issues relate to Complainant's diligence in performing her job, rather than any indication that she is not qualified to perform the job. For example, the Supervisory Special Agent (SSA 2) at the Miami Airport stated Complainant is "slow with paperwork, but she does a good job when she puts her mind to it," while the ASAC confirmed that, "[w]hen [Complainant] is focused, she does good work, but that focus is hard to maintain and frequently misdirected."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, to the extent the AJ and Complainant's supervisors appear to have considered Complainant's performance issues in determining that Complainant was not entitled to an accommodation, we emphasize that any concerns with the quality of Complainant's performance are irrelevant. The pertinent question is whether the Agency could have accommodated Complainant's disability without incurring an undue hardship, not whether Complainant's performance merited special privileges. <span class="Italic">See Alonso T. v. Equal Empl. Opp'y Comm'n</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120162340 (Jan. 15, 2020) ("Reasonable accommodation is a right, not a privilege.") In addition, while some of her supervisors indicate concerns with her mobility, there is no evidence in the record that Complainant was deemed physically unfit for duty nor has the Agency specifically established that there are essential functions of her position which Complainant was not physically able to perform. Hypothetical speculation that Complainant's physical condition may inhibit her ability to perform the essential functions of her job are not sufficient without actual evidence to that effect, especially in light of the fact that Complainant's performance was, as noted earlier, consistently rated as "Successful" and "Excellent." We further note that the SAC did not mention any concerns with Complainant's physical ability to perform her job in denying Complainant's reasonable accommodation request to be <span id="Page_1172"></span>reassigned to the Miami Airport. We therefore find that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee is not removed from the ambit of being a qualified individual with a disability where withdrawal of a previous reasonable accommodation leads to performance problems. In <span class="Italic">Hamblin v. Attorney General</span>, 0720070041 (2009), the complainant, an FBI financial analyst with bipolar disorder, was accommodated for approximately five years with an early work schedule. The early work schedule permitted the complainant to manage sleep problems and exhaustion and also attend doctors' appointments. When a new supervisor revoked the early work schedule the complainant began experiencing performance problems. The Commission rejected an agency argument that the complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability because of the performance problems where prior performance was satisfactory. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Hamblin</span> also found that the agency did not demonstrate that continuing the accommodation would have been an undue hardship:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency contends that complainant was not a qualified individual because two special agents and an Assistant United States Attorney requested in 2001 that complainant not be assigned to work on their cases; complainant's performance summary assessment for the period June 13, 2001 to August 27, 2001 stated that complainant exhibited problems with the organization of data and financial summaries; complainant had performed "minimal" work on her cases at the time of a file review in January 13, 2003; complainant received a "Does Not Meet Expectations" on her August 4, 2003 PAR; and, complainant did not improve during the ninety-day assistance period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, despite these cited deficiencies, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's conclusion that complainant was a "qualified" individual with a disability because the record shows that she satisfactorily performed the duties of her position before her new supervisor revoked her accommodation of an early work schedule. For example, complainant received "fully successful" or "superior performance appraisals from 1998 until 2002, including a "Meets Expectations" rating from her new supervisor as late as October 2002. To the extent that the agency contends that there were problems with complainant's work performance under the new supervisor, we agree with the AJ that the March 2003 and August 2003 revocation of complainant's accommodation likely played a substantial role in complainant's declining work performance. Further, while complainant's supervisor initially rated complainant "Does Not Meet Expectations" in seven critical elements in August 2003, complainant's rating was ultimately raised to "Meets Expectations" in six of seven critical elements. Thus, we do not find that complainant's evaluations reflect that she was unable to perform the essential functions of her financial analyst position with the requested accommodation of an early work schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, based on our review of the hearing transcript and documentary evidence, we concur with the AJ that management at complainant's facility was aware of complainant's Bipolar Disorder and her need to work an early schedule in order to avoid exhaustion and concentration problems, as well as to attend doctor's appointments. In particular, we find that complainant and her physician informed the agency in January 2003, March 2003, and April 2003 that complainant needed to work an early schedule because of medical appointments and sleep problems associated with her Bipolar Disorder.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified and documentary evidence reflects that complainant informed the agency that she experienced great difficulty sleeping, sometimes going entire days without sleeping. The record further reflects that she informed the agency that she needed to work an early schedule because she could concentrate better in the morning, was often exhausted in the afternoon because of her Bipolar Disorder, and had medical appointments in the afternoon. Additionally, we find that when complainant was first granted an early work schedule in November 2000, the agency allowed her to continue working the early schedule until March 2003, in apparent recognition that she needed this schedule because of her Bipolar Disorder. Moreover, in February 2001, complainant's previous supervisor recommended that complainant continue the early work schedule because she had been "productive, less stressed and more able to focus on her duties with an alternative work schedule." Furthermore, we find that the agency acknowledged complainant's need to work the early work schedule in April 2003 when it overturned the supervisor's revocation of complainant's early work schedule. Consequently, we concur with the AJ that granting complainant an early work schedule was a medically necessary and effective accommodation for complainant's Bipolar Disorder.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's supervisor contended that she revoked complainant's early work schedule so that she could interact more with complainant. However, we do not find that complainant's work schedule constituted an undue burden on the agency, especially in light of the fact that the agency granted complainant an early work schedule for well over three years and returned complainant to an early work schedule in April 2003. Thus, we find that substantial evidence supports the AJ's conclusion that the agency has not proven that providing complainant with an early work schedule would have been an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the record supports the AJ's determination that the agency's failure to provide complainant with a reasonable accommodation resulted in her termination. As noted by the AJ, complainant testified that the revocation of her early work schedule was a "nightmare" because the later schedule exacerbated her sleep problems, made her more exhausted, increased her stress level, and made it more difficult for her to focus. Like the AJ, we are persuaded that complainant was unable to raise her performance during the crucial ninety-day assistance period because the agency's revocation of her early work schedule disturbed her fragile sleep patterns. Thus, we find that substantial evidence supports the AJ's conclusion that the agency's failure to accommodate complainant with an early work schedule ultimately led to her termination. <span class="Italic">See Linda Jambora v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. Appeal No. 0720040128 (May 16, 2006) (Commission found that agency constructively discharged complainant when it revoked her reasonable accommodation of working the day shift).</p>
