<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-96"><span class="space">1.</span> Physical Qualifications</h4>
<p class="noindent">When a qualified employee with a disability asserts that the physical qualifications for a position are not job-related, the burden of persuasion shifts to the agency to demonstrate that the complainant "cannot safely and efficiently perform the essentials of the position in question." <span class="Italic">Ahrens v. USPS</span>, 01821917 (1983). This is a dramatic departure from other forms of discrimination where only the burden of production shifts to the agency. In <span class="Italic">Ahrens</span>, the agency failed to establish how a 70-pound lifting requirement was reasonably related to performance of the job at issue, since there was no evidence establishing that other custodians were required to routinely lift or carry that amount of weight without assistance. The Commission also went on to note that the agency, even if it establishes that the criteria are job-related, must be circumspect in concluding that a qualified individual with a disability cannot meet the criteria. The EEOC noted that the applicant's present position was one of manual labor and he had testified that he had been doing heavy work all of his life.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the agency has carried its burden of demonstrating that the criteria are job-related and the employee cannot meet the physical requirements, the agency carries the additional burden of demonstrating that accommodation of the condition would impose an undue burden on the agency. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Navy</span>, 01830922 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency does not have an obligation to accommodate every physical condition which might detract from an employee's performance. For example, an employee who suffers from vision problems is responsible for providing his own eyeglasses and, if the glasses are broken, to replace them in a timely fashion. <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 05840105 (1986). When an agency takes action against an employee for performance deficiencies as a result of failing to meet this responsibility, it has not breached its obligation of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency disqualifies a person from employment on the basis of a medical condition, it bears the burden of proving the nature and extent of the employee's medical condition. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01873389 (1988). In the <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> case, the agency disqualified the complainant based on a back condition. The complainant's physician had cleared her for return to work. The complainant refused to submit to x-rays requested by the agency physician, but indicated her own physician had recently taken x-rays. The Commission found the agency had the affirmative obligation to take steps to obtain the x-rays or show they were unobtainable. Without x-rays, the Commission noted, the agency had only an undocumented medical opinion upon which to base its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency asserts that a complainant cannot meet a qualification standard for a position, it bears the burden both of providing that the standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity, and that it has conducted an individualized inquiry of the complainant's condition in determining he cannot meet the standard, even with accommodation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Tom S. v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120121619 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act prohibits a covered entity from engaging in discrimination against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in, among other things, hiring. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). Such discrimination includes "using qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability...unless the standard, test, or other selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 12112(6)(6); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10 (making unlawful a covered entity's use of qualification standards that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability unless such standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "qualification standard" is not defined in the statute. The regulations define "qualification standard" as "the personal and professional attributes, including the skill, experience, education, physical, medical, safety, and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(q).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to safety requirements that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that the requirement is job related and consistent with business necessity. The regulations provide that an Agency can meet this standard by showing that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the "direct threat" analysis set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). 29 C.F.R. 1630 App. 1630.15(b) and (c); <span class="Italic">Nathan v. Dep't. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070014 (July 19, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A person is a "direct threat" if he or she poses a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of him or herself or others which cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The "direct threat's evaluation must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to perform the essential functions of the job. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If no such accommodation exists, the Agency may refuse to hire an applicant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to exclude an individual on the basis of possible future injury, the Agency bears the burden of showing there is a significant risk; for example, a high probability of substantial harm. A speculative or remote risk is insufficient. The Agency must show more than that an individual with a disability seeking employment stands some slightly increased risk of harm. <span class="Italic">Selix v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (Mar. 16, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such a finding must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk, (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm, (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Erhazabsl</span>, 536 U.S. 73 (2002); <span class="Italic">Cook v. State of Rhode Island, Dep't of Mental Health Retardation and Hospitals</span>, 10 F.3d 17 (1st Cir. 1993). A determination of significant risk cannot be based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation, or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. Rather, the Agency must gather information and base its decision on substantial information regarding the individual's work and medical history. <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03948 (July 30, 2003); <span class="Italic">Nathan</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070014.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency stated that the requirement that Complainant pass the S-3 and S-4 clearance is job-related and consistent with business necessity because full-time Mechanical Technicians are required to respond to nuclear emergencies as "radiological emergency preparedness responders," which require the use of respirators and SCBAs. Mechanical Technicians need to be able to respond at a moment's notice in the event that a nuclear emergency occurs; that includes donning a respirator or SCBA within two minutes of the emergency. The Agency stated that because of Complainant's cardiac disease and lung issues, he would pose a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of himself and possibly to others if he were to wear a respirator or SCBA, which risk cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that in determining whether Complainant would pose a significant risk of harm to himself if he was to wear a respirator or SCBA, the Agency's physician used guidelines provided by the American Thoracic Society, which is a renowned medical society, and the guidance provided by OSHA for respirator clearance. The Agency physician did an <span id="Page_1363"></span>in-depth individualized analysis of Complainant and the requirements of the position before she reached her conclusion. Specifically, the Agency physician went to the job site to personally witness the conditions that Mechanical Technicians such as Complainant would be in. She noted that she went to the work site to see the level of intensity that Mechanical Technicians' bodies would be exposed to in order to make sure that she made the best medical judgment when doing her medical evaluations. Additionally, the physician personally examined Complainant, asked him questions about his health, considered his current lifestyle habits, such as smoking, analyzed all of his medical history, analyzed his spirometry results, and looked at all of the job requirements to make her decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency physician stated that Complainant already bad a history of four heart attacks and had significant issues with oxygen flowing to his heart, which required 12 cardiac stems to open up the vasculature of the heart to get more oxygen to the heart. The record reveals that the use of a respirator or a SCBA creates an oxygen "drag" of air where the air is intense coming in and an individual has to work harder to breathe the air. The Agency physician noted that if Complainant were to use a respirator or a SCBA, there is a significant likelihood that it would be difficult for Complainant to bring in the flow of oxygen because he already had compromised oxygen flow to vital organs; coupled with his lung issues from smoking, this could very likely result in an undue burden on Complainant's lungs and heart and create a life-threatening situation for Complainant. Additionally, if Complainant became incapacitated and could not respond to the nuclear emergency, it is reasonably conceivable that many other individuals would be put at risk of substantial harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant provided medical documentation dated April 11, 2011, from a cardiac and vascular disease physician. The documentation was a general form and stated that Complainant was released to work, and the option for "no applicable restrictions" was circled. Complainant also provided a brief note from his personal physician dated April 7, 2011, which said that Complainant's medical problems are "currently under excellent control and he has no restrictions. He may do "hot work<span class="Italic">."</span> In fact, he may do all the facets of his job without restrictions."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we note that none of Complainant's current medical documentation from his physicians addressed whether Complainant could wear a respirator or a SCBA, even though as of the date of the documentation Complainant was aware that he had been medically denied the position because the Agency believed he could not wear a respirator and SCBA. The medical documentation provided by Complainant was general and in one case just a standard medical form, and did not address the S-3 and S-4 clearance requirement concerns raised by the Agency. There is no documentation or statement from Complainant's physicians that would specifically counter the Agency's physician's conclusion that Complainant would pose a direct threat to himself, and possibly to others, if he had to wear a respirator or a SCBA during a nuclear emergency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency stated that there is no reasonable accommodation that would allow Complainant to wear a respirator or a SCBA. Complainant has not provided any evidence that would establish that a reasonable accommodation existed. As a result, we find that the Agency established that, because of Complainant's cardiac disease and lung issues, be would pose a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of himself and/or others if he was to wear a respirator or SCBA, which is an essential function of the job that cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by reasonable accommodation.</p>
