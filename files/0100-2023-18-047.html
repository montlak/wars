<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-47"><span class="space">1.</span> Restrictions on Representatives' Time</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency employee is expected to spend the majority of his or her time working for the agency. When an employee begins to represent several complainants, this can cause problems. It is not unreasonable for an agency to restrict the total amount of representational time granted to an employee on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The agency should consider "the nature of the position occupied by the representative, the relationship of that position to the mission of the agency, and the degree of hardship imposed on the mission of the agency by the representative's absence from his/her normal duties." MD-110 at 6-16 to 6-17.</p>
<p class="noindent">In two companion cases, <span class="Italic">Binion v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01963870 (1997) and <span class="Italic">Morman v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01964629 (1997), the Commission found that although an agency may not disqualify a representative on the basis that he is spending too much time away from his normal job duties, an agency may properly restrict the amount of time spent on representing complainants. Both cases involved employee representatives who represented several complainants. The agency took the position that these representational duties required so much official time that it interfered with the ability of the employees to work for the agency. In the lead case, <span class="Italic">Binion</span>, the Commission rejected the agency's position, but held the agencies were not barred from dealing with the official time problem:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the allegations, on appeal, involving appellant's representative, we note that our records indicate that this individual has been disqualified by the agency from representing appellant in this matter as of April 1996. In view of our remand of a portion of appellant's claim herein for continued processing, we deem it appropriate to address the allegation raised on appeal concerning the subject disqualification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that, in disqualifying appellant's representative from further representation of appellant in this matter, the agency has relied upon a section of the Commission's regulations, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(c), which provides, in pertinent part, that "[i]n cases where the representation of a complainant or agency would conflict with the official or collateral duties of the representative, the Commission or the agency may, after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify the representative."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, appellant argues that the appropriate issue is one of reasonable official time allowed, not disqualification, that his immediate supervisor has not been consulted concerning any instances of work related conflicts, and that "neglect of duty" is "a disciplinary problem" that does not provide grounds for disqualification under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our comprehensive search of decisions on this topic indicates that disqualification procedures have been discussed in the past mainly in cases where the representation of a complainant or agency by a particular individual creates a potential ethical conflict of interest either because of the representative's position with the agency, or because of the position occupied by the individual being represented<span class="Italic">. See Collins v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943450 (June 16, 1995) (disqualification for conflict of official duties discussed in context of prohibition on EEO officials serving as representatives); <span class="Italic">Reda v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01944316 (February 16, 1995) (case in which appellant's representative was disqualified by agency where he was a bargaining unit employee representing a nonbargaining unit supervisor); <span class="Italic">Riess v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880243 (June 22, 1988) (Commission affirms agency disqualification of chosen representative where union official represented former management official in same bargaining unit)<span class="Italic">. But see Kennedy v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05870122 (July 2, 1987) (Commission declined to address whether agency properly rejected appellant's request to be represented by a particular individual because his representation had reached "maximum allowability").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, guidance concerning Commission intent in drafting the subject regulation can be found in the Commission's summaries preceding the proposed and subsequent adoption of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.214(b), which has not been materially changed by the Commission's promulgation of Part 1614. In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission indicated that language had been added to &#x00A7; 1613.214(b) "to indicate that representatives can be disqualified for conflicts of interest." 51 Fed. Reg. 29482 (August 18, 1986). However, in the summary of the final rule, the Commission indicated, in response to commenters who wanted to include "conflict of position" in the regulation, that "[t]he regulation now permits disqualification when representation would conflict with the representative's duties. As an example, a counselor could not serve as a representative for either party." 52 Fed. Reg. 41920 (October 30, 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in disqualifying appellant's representative herein, the agency has indicated no such ethical considerations but instead asserts that the representative has been disqualified from representation in this and in numerous other cases because of the agency's assessment that his representation of the complainants would result in "a significant decrease in the timely processing of critical assets" and thereby "conflict" with the performance of his official duties. Correspondence from various agency officials indicates the agency's concern that such representation would result in the "neglect" of the representative's official duties as a Wood Working Blocker and Bracer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Commission acknowledges that the agency has a clear and legitimate interest in utilizing its employees to complete the duties of the positions into which they have been hired and in minimizing the adverse impact of the use of official time on the accomplishment of the agency's mission, we must temper this important interest and balance it with the explicit right of the complainant under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(a) to be "accompanied, represented and advised by a representative of complainant's choice." The Commission's regulations and the applicable <span id="Page_674"></span>EEOC Management Directive provisions were designed to, in concert, achieve such a balance. To that end, the Commission's regulations at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(b) permit agencies to approve or deny official time within the confines of "a reasonable amount of official time." The regulations specifically indicate that the agency is not required to "change work schedules, incur overtime wages, or pay travel expenses to facilitate the choice of a specific representative or to allow the complainant and representative to confer."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the EEOC Management Directive-110 for 29 CFR Part 1614 (October 22, 1992) (MD-110) provides necessary guidance concerning the agency's authority over the approval or denial of official time in situations including the representation of multiple complainants by a single individual, by indicating, in pertinent part, under the heading "Aggregate Time Spent on EEO Matters" as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Commission considers it reasonable for agencies to expect their employees to spend most of their time doing the work for which they are employed. Therefore, an agency may restrict the overall hours of official time afforded to a representative, for both preparation purposes and for attendance at meetings and hearings, to a certain percentage of that representative's duty hours in any given month, quarter or year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">MD-110, Section 5-16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In fact, decisions have previously dealt with agency assertions that the approval of large amounts of official time for the representation of other employees hampers its mission by acknowledging the existence of this authority<span class="Italic">. See Macon v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Request No 05870191 p.4, and n.5 (July 2, 1987); <span class="Italic">Sanich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01900060 (January 29, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that vesting the agency with the authority to completely deprive a complainant of his or her choice of representative through the disqualification procedures based upon interests other than ethical considerations would be both inconsistent with the Commission's past application of conflict of interest provisions in the EEO process and would constitute a significant expansion of agency authority fraught with potential pitfalls. In this regard, we are mindful that permitting such blanket disqualifications to be made under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(c) would deprive appellants of their chosen representatives, regardless of whether the representative would choose to accomplish such representation on his or her own time, rather than the agency's. We also note that such unfettered authority to disqualify complainants' representatives is a power with the clear potential for abuse in cases where representatives have previously been effective in pursuing complaints against an agency or where the agency is otherwise unfavorably disposed toward a particular party or representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, while we hold that the agency's disqualification of the complainant's chosen representative pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(c) is inappropriate, the agency is not without resources in this case and in others to prevent abuse of the use of the official time provisions in our regulations and to ensure that the accomplishment of its mission is not unduly burdened by such usage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have previously discussed, the agency clearly may act, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(b) and MD-110, Section 5-16, to restrict the overall hours of official time afforded to appellant's representative for both preparation purposes and for attendance at meetings and hearings to a certain percentage of that representative's duty hours in any given month, quarter or year. In arriving at such restrictions, as stated in MD-110, the agency should consider the nature of the position occupied by the representative, the relationship of that position to the mission of the agency, and the degree of hardship imposed on the mission of the agency by the representative's absence from his or her normal duties.<span class="Italic"> See</span> MD-110, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the agency is advised that it may, in accordance with MD-110 and our regulations, advise the representative that while he cannot be disqualified from representation of particular complainants pursuant to the conflict of interest provisions in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(c), the official time he is entitled to utilize may be limited in accordance with 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(b) and MD-110, Section 5-16. The agency is further instructed to notify each of the complainants so represented of any such overall restrictions on the amount of official time to be utilized by this representative. The agency should also remind such complainants of their duty to proceed with meetings and hearings even if their representative is unable to attend due to his usage of all of his allotted official time.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's opinion in <span class="Italic">Binion</span> has been codified in its regulatory guidance at MD-110 at 6-18 to 6-19:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission considers it reasonable for agencies to expect their employees to spend most of their time doing the work for which they are employed. Therefore, an agency may restrict the overall hours of official time afforded to a representative, for both preparation purposes and for attendance at meetings and hearings, to a certain percentage of that representative's duty hours in any given month, quarter, or year. Such overall restrictions would depend on the nature of the position occupied by the representative, the relationship of that position to the mission of the agency, and the degree of hardship imposed on the mission of the agency by the representative's absence from his/her normal duties. The amount of official time to be afforded to an employee for representational activities will vary with the circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, &#x00A7; 1614.605(c) provides that in cases where the representation of a complainant or agency would conflict with the official or collateral duties of the representative, the Commission or the agency may, after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify the representative. At all times, the complainant is responsible for proceeding with the complaint, regardless of whether s/he has a designated representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission does not require agencies to provide official time to employee representatives who are representing complainants in cases against other federal agencies. However, the Commission encourages agencies to provide such official time.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Deal v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03760 (2001), the Commission found that an instruction to the complainant not to spend more than 10% of her time on representational activities was lawful:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as the matter of official time is raised, we note that the record indicates that the representative was representing some 30 EEO complainants and that the agency instructed him to restrict his official time for representational activities to 10% of his weekly work hours. Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 CFR Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), 6-16 (November 9, 1999) provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Commission considers it reasonable for agencies to expect their employees to spend most of their time doing the work for which they are employed. Therefore, an agency may restrict the overall hours of official time afforded to a representative, for both preparation purposes and for attendance at meetings and hearings, to a certain percentage of that representative's duty hours in any given month, quarter, or year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the foregoing, and inasmuch as the AJ found that complainant did not establish that her representative was in fact denied any written request for official time, the Commission is not persuaded that the agency's instructions constituted a violation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Szluer v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072747 (2007), where the agency restricted the complainant to 10 hours per week to handle EEO claims.</p>
