<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-81"><span class="space">A.</span> SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The general factual standard for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 is that there are no material facts in genuine dispute. The Commission's regulation, at 29 CFR 1614.109(g)(1), expands slightly on the standard by stating that a decision without a hearing is appropriate where "some or all material facts are not in genuine dispute and there is no genuine issue as to credibility..." The expansion of the regulation to include cases where some material facts remain in dispute is simply a way to account for partial summary judgment. The Commission also added language specifically precluding the use of summary judgment to resolve disputes of credibility. Partial summary judgment and credibility disputes are discussed below. The legal standard for summary judgment is that the moving party must be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In many ways, the legal standard just states the obvious: If there are no material facts in dispute, someone is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Yaccarino v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05735 (2001), the Commission succinctly set forth the standards that apply to summary judgment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Supreme Court has held that summary judgment is appropriate where a court determines that, given the substantive legal and evidentiary standards that apply to the case, there exists no genuine issue of material fact<span class="Italic">. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</span> 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment a court does not sit as a fact finder<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The evidence of the non-moving party must be believed at the summary judgment stage and all justifiable inferences must be drawn in the non-moving party's favor<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> A disputed issue of fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable fact finder could find in favor of the non-moving party<span class="Italic">. Celotex v. Catrett,</span> 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</span> 846 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1988). A fact is "material" if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the case. If a case can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence, summary judgment is not appropriate. In the context of an administrative proceeding under Title VII, an AJ may properly consider summary judgment only upon a determination that the record has been adequately developed for summary disposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts have been clear that summary judgment is not to be used as a "trial by affidavit." <span class="Italic">Redmand v. Warrener,</span> 516 F.2d 766, 768 (1st Cir. 1975). The Commission has noted that when a party submits an affidavit and credibility is at issue, "there is a need for strident cross-examination and summary judgment on such evidence is improper." <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940339 (February 24, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the hearing process is intended to be an extension of the investigative process, designed to "ensure that the parties have a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain and supplement the record and to examine and cross-examine witnesses." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Management Directive (MD) 110, as revised, November 9, 1999, Chapter 6, page 6-1; <span class="Italic">see</span> also 29 CFR 1614.109(c) and (d). "Truncation of this process, while material facts are still in dispute and the credibility of witnesses is still ripe for challenge, improperly deprives complainant of a full and fair investigation of her claims." <span class="Italic">Mi S.</span> <span class="Italic">Bang v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961575 (March 26, 1998)<span class="Italic">. See</span> also <span class="Italic">Peavley v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950628 (October 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Chronister v.

Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A03423 (2001) (no material dispute of fact where complainant provided evidence that she lifted pallets in excess of her lifting restriction, but no evidence that she was required by the agency to lift the pallets).</p>
<p class="noindent">"A fact is 'material' if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the case. If a case can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence, summary judgment is not appropriate. In the context of an administrative proceeding under Title VII, an AJ may properly consider summary judgment only upon a determination that the record has been adequately developed for summary disposition." <span class="Italic">Holden v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01983800 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Boyle v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01996602 (2001). If more than one inference can be drawn from the facts, the case is not appropriate for summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01973339 (1999). The factfinder is required to hear the evidence, weigh the evidence and then issue a decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">"In the context of an administrative proceeding under Title VII, summary judgment is appropriate if, after adequate investigation, complainant has failed to establish the essential elements of his or her case." <span class="Italic">Monsegue v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A03398 (2001). However, <span class="Italic">Monsegue</span> constitutes a slight misstatement of the law. In order to survive summary judgment, the complainant is not required to establish the essential elements of his or her case, but must establish that there is a triable issue of fact regarding those elements. The fact that the complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination does not preclude summary judgment where the agency articulates a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">See Brantley v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01985037 (2001). At that point, the complainant must come forward with some evidence of pretext to avoid summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not proper for an administrative judge to grant summary judgment to an agency based on his evaluation of the evidence. For example, in <span class="Italic">Paris v. TVA</span>, 01940631 (1994), the Commission reversed the summary judgment finding of its administrative judge where the recommended decision was based on the judge's determination that the complainant was not treated differently than a comparative employee, instead of on a determination that there were no facts in genuine dispute. The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Atencio v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01975245 (2000), finding that the administrative judge improperly resolved credibility disputes in granting summary judgment. The Commission remanded the case for a hearing. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kaprive v. National Security Administration</span>, 01986151 (2000) (in finding that the complainant was not "plainly superior" to the selectee the judge improperly weighed the evidence); <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02986 (2000) (summary judgment improper where affidavits are unclear); <span class="Italic">Sheppard v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 01A02919 (2000) (summary judgment improper where credibility issues remained); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs,</span> 01A03176 (2000) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">While the Commission's summary judgment rule is fashioned after Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, administrative judges should not be too quick to apply the stringent requirements of Rule 56 to Commission proceedings. On the other hand, complainants should not withhold evidence with the idea that they can surprise the agency at the hearing. The Commission attempted to explain the balance in <span class="Italic">Roland v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01882726 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires motions for and opposing summary judgment to set forth facts through admissible evidence. A party cannot rely upon mere allegations or denials. The appropriate time for the appellant to present allegations and evidence is during the investigation. Withholding evidence until the appeal or the hearing could jeopardize the appellant's case, especially with the existence of the new rule. If evidence is not available until a later time, an explanation should be given for the delay. Here, however, the appellant had alleged at least one comparative during the investigation that the agency failed to investigate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, while the guidelines for summary judgment are useful in applying the new rule under Title VII, some distinctions between the civil court process and administrative EEO process should be made. In a civil case, there is compulsory discovery and most parties are represented by counsel. In the EEO administrative process, most complainants proceed <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> and 29 CFR 1613.216(a) requires agencies to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">among other things, thoroughly investigate the matter complained of, with particular attention paid to...review of the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred, the treatment of members of the complainant's group identified by his complaint as employees in the organizational segment in which the alleged discrimination occurred, and any policies and practices related to the work situation which may constitute, or appear to constitute, discrimination even though they have not been expressly cited by the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ has misapplied the new rule, 29 CFR 1613.218(g). The appellant has clearly questioned the adequacy of the investigation. When he requested a hearing, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the investigation. In his response to the Show Cause Order, the appellant submitted the names of additional comparatives, including a couple that he had referenced in his affidavit, but that the agency had not investigated. The agency, in their [sic] response memorandum, chose not to respond to these additional allegations; rather, it give a blanket denial in memorandum form, which is not admissible evidence. We find that the appellant has raised a genuine issue concerning the sufficiency of the record, and we find that the record submitted on appeal is incomplete....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although discovery is now available, the Commission will probably continue to be more lenient than federal courts in applying summary judgment <span id="Page_471"></span>rulings, particularly when a complainant is not represented by counsel. The Commission remanded the <span class="Italic">Roland</span> case with instructions for the agency to develop the record on comparable employees, including those named by the complainant. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bhuller v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910523 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">But, with somewhat circular logic, in <span class="Italic">Simpkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 05950536 (1996), the Commission held that the administrative judge did not err in failing to order an agency to comply with the complainant's discovery requests where the administrative judge instead granted the agency's motion for summary judgment. The Commission simply brushed aside the argument of the complainant that he needed the discovery to demonstrate there were material facts at issue--a showing that would have precluded summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Petty v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A24206 (2003), the Commission gave a thorough explanation of its summary judgment standards and the special obligations imposed on an EEOC administrative judge in applying those standards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before we can ascertain whether the AJ and the agency properly concluded that complainant did not meet his burden of persuasion, we must first determine whether it was appropriate for the AJ to have issued a decision without a hearing on this record. No one disputes that complainant requested a hearing, and complainants generally are entitled to do so<span class="Italic">. See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(a) (stating that "[w]hen a complainant requests a hearing, the Commission shall appoint an administrative judge to conduct a hearing..."). In certain circumstances, though, the Commission's rules allow an administrative judge to rule on the merits of a case without first taking live testimony at an actual hearing. According to the applicable regulations, if:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a party believes that some or all material facts are not in genuine dispute and there is no genuine issue as to credibility, the party may, at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing or at such earlier time as required by the administrative judge, file a statement with the administrative judge prior to the hearing setting forth the fact or facts and referring to the parts of the record relied on to support the statement. The statement must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any such material fact. The party shall serve the statement on the opposing party....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The opposing party may file an opposition within 15 days of receipt of [such a] statement.... The opposition may refer to the record in the case to rebut the statement that a fact is not in dispute or may file an affidavit stating that the party cannot, for reasons stated, present facts to oppose the request. After considering the submissions, the administrative judge may order that discovery be permitted on the fact or facts involved, limit the hearing to the issues remaining in dispute, issue a decision without a hearing or make such other ruling as is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 C.F.R. 1614.109(g)(1), (2) [emphasis added];<span class="Italic"> see also</span> EEO MD-110, at 7-14 (providing largely the same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, an administrative judge may propose to issue a decision without a hearing <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> (or, "on his or her own motion"). If:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...the administrative judge determines upon his or her own initiative that some or all facts are not in genuine dispute, he or she may, after giving notice to the parties and providing them an opportunity to respond in writing within 15 calendar days, issue an order limiting the scope of the hearing or issue a decision without holding a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 C.F.R. 1614.109(g)(3); <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEO MD-110, at 7-15 [emphasis added] (stipulating that an administrative judge may issue a decision without a hearing if the administrative judge concludes that "some or all of the material facts are not in genuine dispute").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These federal sector provisions are "similar to summary judgment in court." EEO MD-110, at 7-14. Indeed, they are patterned after Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<span class="Italic">. See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Koslow. v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12763 (Mar. 7, 2002) (noting as much); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (providing that, in the federal court system, summary judgment will be appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law"). In both the federal court system and the administrative process, this dispositive mechanism is designed to facilitate faster adjudication of claims where critical facts are uncontested--that is, where the only task remaining is to apply the relevant law to undisputed facts to determine which party should prevail. However, before an administrative judge can properly issue a decision without a hearing in the federal sector, either on his or her own initiative or after a motion is made by either party, several criteria must be met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the administrative judge must be certain that the investigative record has been adequately developed. Unlike the typical civil employment discrimination trial in federal court, an EEOC hearing is not strictly judicial in nature--it is a quasi-investigatory exercise, as well. It is specifically designed as "an adjudicatory proceeding that completes the process of developing a full and appropriate record." EEO MD-110, at 7-1 [emphasis added]; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(a) (stating that once a complainant requests a hearing and an EEOC administrative judge is appointed, the administrative judge assumes "full responsibility for the adjudication of the complaint, including overseeing the development of the record"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> EEO MD-110, at 7-7 (explaining that "[t]he Commission intends that the [a]dministrative [j]udge will take complete control of the case once a hearing is requested"). Agencies are initially responsible for conducting thorough and complete investigations of complaints of discrimination brought against them.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.108(b) (instructing agencies to "develop an impartial and appropriate factual record upon which to make findings on the claims raised by the written complaint"); and EEO MD-110, at 6-1 (noting that an "appropriate factual record is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred"). However, Commission rules recognize that agencies will not always meet their regulatory burden to conduct such comprehensive investigations. The rules thus clarify that "where a hearing is properly requested and where there has been no investigation or there is an incomplete or inadequate investigation, the record in the case shall be developed under the supervision of the [a]dministrative [j]udge." EEO MD-110, at 7-7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A hearing is often indispensable in this endeavor. It "provides the parties with a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain and supplement the record and, in appropriate instances, to examine and cross-examine witnesses." EEO MD-110, at 7-1. For this reason, the hearing is considered to be "part of the investigative process" itself. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(e). Accordingly, an administrative judge may not issue a decision without a hearing if he or she has concluded that holding an actual hearing would aid in the development of an appropriate factual record (i.e., one which contains all the information necessary to enable an accurate adjudication of the complaint on its merits)<span class="Italic">. See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Brown v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992087 (Sept. 13, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the administrative judge cannot issue a decision without a hearing unless there are no genuine issues of material fact. According to the U.S. Supreme Court, "the substantive law will identify which facts are material," and "only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law [not unnecessary or irrelevant factual disputes] will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc.</span>, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). In the hearing context, in circumstantial disparate treatment cases such as this one, this means that the administrative judge must look to the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> evidentiary scheme to determine which facts may be "material" in this sense. Thus if, for example, "a complainant is unable to set forth facts necessary to establish one essential element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, a dispute over facts necessary to prove another element of the case [i.e., whether the agency's legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions is true] would not be material to the outcome." EEO MD-110, at 7-15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming there are material facts in dispute, "summary judgment will not lie if the dispute...is 'genuine,' that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the [party opposing summary judgment]." <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 477 U.S. at 248. At summary judgment, the threshold inquiry is "determining whether there is the need for a trial--whether, in other words, there are any...factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 250. In the federal sector, the critical question is whether there is a need for a hearing--whether, in other words, there are issues of material fact that must be resolved by an administrative judge, acting as a jury would, because such issues may reasonably be resolved in favor of either the complainant or the agency. Consequently, the administrative judge cannot issue a decision without a hearing if the theoretically "reasonable administrative judge," acting as a fact finder, could find in favor of the party opposing the issuance of a decision without a hearing (typically the complainant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third and similarly, the administrative judge may not issue a decision without a hearing if he or she actually has to find facts first to do so. According to the Supreme Court, "at the summary judgment stage the judge's function is not...to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 477 U.S. at 249. "Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 255. Therefore, at summary judgment, the "evidence of the [party opposing summary judgment] is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the hearing context, of course, the administrative judge is both judge and jury--legal arbiter and fact finder. In deciding whether to issue a decision without a hearing, the administrative judge must be careful not to conflate these two roles. For purposes of issuing a decision without a hearing, the administrative judge is acting only as legal arbiter and cannot determine the truth of any matter that may only appropriately be <span id="Page_472"></span>decided after a hearing has been held (albeit by the administrative judge then properly acting as a fact finder). Therefore, if the administrative judge cannot issue a decision without a hearing without first playing the part of jury (e.g., finding facts after assessing credibility, weighing evidence, drawing definitive conclusions, etc.), then the administrative judge must hold a hearing<span class="Italic">. See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Reyes v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A23975 (Nov. 4, 2002) (arguing that the evidence of the party opposing the issuance of a decision without a hearing must be believed); <span class="Italic">Miles v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A04665 (Oct. 31, 2002) (noting that if a case can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence, rendering a decision without first holding a hearing would be inappropriate); <span class="Italic">Franklin v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10101 (Sept. 25, 2002) (asserting that whenever the credibility of witnesses is ripe for challenge, there is a need for the type of "strident cross examination" only available via a hearing); and <span class="Italic">Engel v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A13103 (Aug. 29, 2002) (declaring that administrative judges should not conduct "trials by affidavit" in ruling on motions for a decision without a hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fourth and finally, the administrative judge should not rule in favor of one party without holding a hearing unless he or she ensures that the party opposing the ruling is given (1) ample notice of the proposal to issue a decision without a hearing, (2) a comprehensive statement of the allegedly undisputed material facts, (3) the opportunity to respond to such a statement, and (4) the chance to engage in discovery before responding, if necessary. According to the Supreme Court, Rule 56 itself precludes summary judgment "where the [party opposing summary judgment] has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition." <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 477 U.S. at 250. In the hearing context, this means that the administrative judge must enable the parties to engage in the amount of discovery necessary to properly respond to any motion for a decision without a hearing. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(g)(2) (suggesting that an administrative judge could order discovery, if necessary, after receiving an opposition to a motion for a decision without a hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once such discovery has been completed, however, the Supreme Court has said that the party opposing summary judgment must go "beyond the pleadings and by [his or] her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."' <span class="Italic">Celotex Corporation</span>, 477 U.S. at 324 [citations omitted]. Similarly, in the federal sector, the party opposing the issuance of a decision without a hearing should not rely solely on mere counselor report or complaint allegations, speculation, conclusory statements, or denials. Instead, the opposing party should generally point to evidence from the investigative report or gleaned in discovery (e.g., witness affidavits, interrogatories, admissions, deposition testimony, or other supporting materials) to demonstrate that there are genuine issues of material fact which mandate a full hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, EEO MD-110, at 7-15 (providing that "[t]he party opposing summary judgment must identify the disputed facts in the record with specificity or demonstrate that there is a dispute by producing affidavits or records that tend to disprove the facts asserted by the party [favoring a decision without a hearing]. In addition, the [opposing party] must explain how the facts in dispute are material under the legal principles applicable to the case."); <span class="Italic">see also Patton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930055 (July 1, 1993) (where EEOC upheld the issuance of a decision without a hearing, since the complainant had "only made a general pleading" with regard to a material fact and did not present any specific facts showing how or why the fact was in genuine dispute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, if the opposing party does not respond in this way to a motion for a decision without a hearing, the administrative judge should not automatically enter judgment against the opposing party. Instead, the administrative judge himself or herself should review the entire record and verify that there are indeed no genuine issues of material fact, and that judgment as a matter of law should be granted to the party favoring a decision without a hearing. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(g) (anticipating that the administrative judge must ultimately determine that some or all facts are not in genuine dispute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ concluded that the agency's initial replies were "proper and thorough," and that its brief opposing the motion to compel was "well crafted" and "exactly on point." However, the AJ's decision does not adequately explain this conclusion. For example, did the AJ affirmatively mean that the Privacy Act of 1974 prohibits the disclosure of any and all materials sought in items 7 and 8 of the original discovery request (as the agency's brief indicates)? If so, this conclusion would have been erroneous<span class="Italic">. Cf. Jackman v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950760 (Aug. 30, 1996) (indicating that in a non-selection case, the AJ can even sanction the agency for failing to disclose pertinent application information for other applicants (such as the prior education and experience of the applicants)--notwithstanding Privacy Act concerns to the contrary); and <span class="Italic">Moten v. Matthews</span>, 1976 W.L. 1731 (D.D.C. Aug. 12, 1976) (where the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the Food and Drug Administration to answer interrogatories posed by a federal employee--even though the agency argued that the information requested was protected by the Privacy Act of 1974--because the complainant was raising a claim of discriminatory non-promotion, and the interrogatories sought data on the educational backgrounds and prior work experience of similarly situated promotees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, complainant tried to get the agency to supply him with various important documents and explanations, to no avail. When he turned to the AJ for help via a motion to compel and explicitly stated in the motion that he needed the agency to cooperate "[f]or purposes of defining what issues are in dispute"--the AJ responded by denying his motion to compel and request for sanctions, and by entering judgment against him. However, he only should have rendered a decision without a hearing after ensuring that complainant had the chance to equip himself with the information needed to respond to the agency's motion. Instead, the AJ incorrectly denied complainant a hearing precisely because complainant had not presented enough evidence to prove his case--even though discovery and a hearing would have helped him gather such evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For similar reasons, it was also inappropriate for the AJ to conclude, as he did, that there were no genuine issues of material fact outstanding at the time the agency made its motion. There was no way for complainant to prove that there were material facts in dispute because he was never given the chance to uncover evidence that presumably could have helped him do so. For instance, the AJ simply asserted that "the undisputed facts establish that there is no genuine issue as to the [a]gency's articulated reasons, i.e., there is no evidence of falsity or that intentional discrimination was the real reason for any of the [a]gency's actions." AJ's Decision without a Hearing (May 29, 2002), at 2. Thus, the AJ erroneously presumed away complainant's contentions that there were facts in dispute, and then prematurely concluded that no evidence of falsity existed. The Administrative Judge erred when he concluded no evidence of falsity existed when the agency was not required to turn over information which (as delineated above) may have proven such pretext?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the AJ acted impermissibly as a fact finder in rendering his ruling. The agency's motion for a decision without a hearing contained a "Statement of Facts" which the AJ adopted. This statement of facts included the "fact" that "[n]one of the panel members [or] the selecting official...considered race, age, sex, or prior [EEO] activity in the selection process." Agency's Motion for Decision without a Hearing (Apr. 1, 2002), at 2. It also asserted as "fact" that complainant "was not selected 'for a number of reasons to include his interview and his ongoing job performance did not reflect that he had moved forward with our new way of doing business."'<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> By indicating, as the AJ did in his decision, that the agency's motion "accurately identified the undisputed facts" the AJ credited the agency's version of the material facts. In doing so, the AJ inappropriately assessed the credibility of the various parties' explanations, weighed the evidence, and determined the truth of matters that should not have been decided until after hearing was held.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is error for the administrative judge to order the agency to conduct an investigation of a claim not included in the report of investigation and then grant summary judgment on the claim prior to the conclusion of the investigation. <span class="Italic">Jones-Mason v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01A14338 (2002).</p>
