<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-8"><span class="space">2.</span> Criminal Arrests</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission adopted a policy that use of criminal arrests to exclude persons from employment has a disparate impact on black and Hispanic employees and applicants. An agency cannot use an arrest as a basis for exclusion without demonstrating a business necessity. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01983135 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2012, the Commission issued EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>, No. 915.002 (2012). "Where employers apply criminal record exclusions uniformly, the exclusions may still operate to disproportionately and unjustifiably exclude people of a particular race or national origin ('disparate impact discrimination'). If the employer does not show that such an exclusion is 'job related and consistent with business necessity' for the position in question, the exclusion is unlawful under Title VII." Questions and Answers About the EEOC's Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII (2012). The guidance did not change the Commission's long-standing position regarding the consideration of a candidate's criminal record in hiring decisions, but rather provides more detail on its position with examples and specific discussion regarding disparate impact and disparate treatment theories. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission's guidance on the subject as it relates to policies tending to have an adverse impact is reproduced below, in pertinent part: "With respect to criminal records, there is Title VII disparate impact liability where the evidence shows that a covered employer's criminal record screening policy or practice disproportionately screens out a Title VII-protected group and the employer does not demonstrate that the policy or practice is job related for the positions in question and consistent with business necessity.":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Determining Disparate Impact of Policies or Practices that Screen Individuals Based on Records of Criminal Conduct</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Identifying the Policy or Practice</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first step in disparate impact analysis is to identify the particular policy or practice that causes the unlawful disparate impact. For criminal conduct exclusions, relevant information includes the text of the policy or practice, associated documentation, and information about how the policy or practice was actually implemented. More specifically, such information also includes which offenses or classes of offenses were reported to the employer (e.g., all felonies, all drug offenses); whether convictions (including sealed and/or expunged convictions), arrests, charges, or other criminal incidents were reported; how far back in time the reports reached (e.g., the last five, ten, or twenty years); and the jobs for which the criminal background screening was conducted. Training or guidance documents used by the employer also are relevant, because they may specify which types of criminal history information to gather for particular jobs, how to gather the data, and how to evaluate the information after it is obtained.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Determining Disparate Impact</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">National data. . .supports a finding that criminal record exclusions have a disparate impact based on race and national origin. The national data provides a basis for the Commission to further investigate such Title VII disparate impact charges. During an EEOC investigation, the employer also has an opportunity to show, with relevant evidence, that its employment policy or practice does not cause a disparate impact on the protected group(s). For example, an employer may present regional or local data showing that African American and/or Hispanic men are not arrested or convicted at disproportionately higher rates in the employer's particular geographic area. An employer also may use its own applicant data to demonstrate that its policy or practice did not cause a disparate impact. The Commission will assess relevant evidence when making a determination of disparate impact, including applicant flow information maintained pursuant to the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, workforce data, criminal history background check data, demographic availability statistics, incarceration/conviction data, and/or relevant labor market statistics.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer's evidence of a racially balanced workforce will not be enough to disprove disparate impact. In <span class="Italic">Connecticut v. Teal</span>, the Supreme Court held that a "bottom line" racial balance in the workforce does not <span id="Page_784"></span>preclude employees from establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact; nor does it provide employers with a defense. The issue is whether the policy or practice deprives a disproportionate number of Title VII-protected individuals of employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in determining disparate impact, the Commission will assess the probative value of an employer's applicant data. As the Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, an employer's "application process might itself not adequately reflect the actual potential applicant pool since otherwise qualified people might be discouraged from applying" because of an alleged discriminatory policy or practice. Therefore, the Commission will closely consider whether an employer has a reputation in the community for excluding individuals with criminal records. Relevant evidence may come from ex-offender employment programs, individual testimony, employer statements, evidence of employer recruitment practices, or publicly posted notices, among other sources. The Commission will determine the persuasiveness of such evidence on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Job Related For the Position in Question and Consistent with Business Necessity</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Generally</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the plaintiff in litigation establishes disparate impact, Title VII shifts the burdens of production and persuasion to the employer to "demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity." In the legislative history of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, Congress referred to <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> and its progeny such as <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody</span> and <span class="Italic">Dothard</span> to explain how this standard should be construed. The <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> Court stated that the employer's burden was to show that the policy or practice is one that "bear[s] a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used" and "measures the person for the job and not the person in the abstract." In both <span class="Italic">Albemarle</span> and <span class="Italic">Dothard</span>, the Court emphasized the factual nature of the business necessity inquiry. The Court further stated in <span class="Italic">Dothard</span> that the terms of the exclusionary policy must "be shown to be necessary to safe and efficient job performance."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a case involving a criminal record exclusion, the Eighth Circuit in its 1975 <span class="Italic">Green v. Missouri Pacific Railroad</span> decision, held that it was discriminatory under Title VII for an employer to "follow[ ] the policy of disqualifying for employment any applicant with a conviction for any crime other than a minor traffic offense." The Eighth Circuit identified three factors (the "<span class="Italic">Green</span> factors") that were relevant to assessing whether an exclusion is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity:</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> The nature and gravity of the offense or conduct;</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> The time that has passed since the offense or conduct and/or completion of the sentence; and</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> The nature of the job held or sought.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2007, the Third Circuit in <span class="Italic">El v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority</span> developed the statutory analysis in greater depth. Douglas El challenged SEPTA's policy of excluding everyone ever convicted of a violent crime from the job of paratransit driver. El, a 55 year-old African American paratransit driver-trainee, was terminated from employment when SEPTA learned of his conviction for second-degree murder 40 years earlier; the conviction involved a gang fight when he was 15 years old and was his only disqualifying offense under SEPTA's policy. The Third Circuit expressed "reservations" about a policy such as SEPTA's (exclusion for all violent crimes, no matter how long ago they were committed) "in the abstract."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying Supreme Court precedent, the <span class="Italic">El</span> court observed that some level of risk is inevitable in all hiring, and that, "[i]n a broad sense, hiring policies. . .ultimately concern the management of risk." Recognizing that assessing such risk is at the heart of criminal record exclusions, the Third Circuit concluded that Title VII requires employers to justify criminal record exclusions by demonstrating that they "accurately distinguish between applicants [who] pose an unacceptable level of risk and those [who] do not."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Third Circuit affirmed summary judgment for SEPTA, but stated that the outcome of the case might have been different if Mr. El had, "for example, hired an expert who testified that there is a time at which a former criminal is no longer any more likely to recidivate than the average person,. . .[so] there would be a factual question for the jury to resolve." The Third Circuit reasoned, however, that the recidivism evidence presented by SEPTA's experts, in conjunction with the nature of the position at issue--paratransit driver-trainee with unsupervised access to vulnerable adults--required the employer to exercise the utmost care.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the subsections below, the Commission discusses considerations that are relevant to assessing whether criminal record exclusion policies or practices are job related and consistent with business necessity. First, we emphasize that arrests and convictions are treated differently.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Arrests</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact of an arrest does not establish that criminal conduct has occurred. Arrests are not proof of criminal conduct. Many arrests do not result in criminal charges, or the charges are dismissed. Even if an individual is charged and subsequently prosecuted, he is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arrest, however, may in some circumstances trigger an inquiry into whether the conduct underlying the arrest justifies an adverse employment action. Title VII calls for a fact-based analysis to determine if an exclusionary policy or practice is job related and consistent with business necessity. Therefore, an exclusion based on an arrest, in itself, is not job related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another reason for employers not to rely on arrest records is that they may not report the final disposition of the arrest (e.g., not prosecuted, convicted, or acquitted). As documented in Section III.A., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the DOJ/BJS reported that many arrest records in the FBI's III database and state criminal record repositories are not associated with final dispositions. Arrest records also may include inaccuracies or may continue to be reported even if expunged or sealed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example&#x2003;3</span>: <span class="Italic">Arrest Record Is Not Grounds for Exclusion</span>. Mervin and Karen, a middle-aged African American couple, are driving to church in a predominantly white town. An officer stops them and interrogates them about their destination. When Mervin becomes annoyed and comments that his offense is simply "driving while Black," the officer arrests him for disorderly conduct. The prosecutor decides not to file charges against Mervin, but the arrest remains in the police department's database and is reported in a background check when Mervin applies with his employer of fifteen years for a promotion to an executive position. The employer's practice is to deny such promotions to individuals with arrest records, even without a conviction, because it views an arrest record as an indicator of untrustworthiness and irresponsibility. If Mervin filed a Title VII charge based on these facts, and disparate impact based on race were established, the EEOC would find reasonable cause to believe that his employer violated Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although an arrest record standing alone may not be used to deny an employment opportunity, an employer may make an employment decision based on the conduct underlying the arrest if the conduct makes the individual unfit for the position in question. The conduct, not the arrest, is relevant for employment purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example&#x2003;4</span>: <span class="Italic">Employer's Inquiry into Conduct Underlying Arrest</span>. Andrew, a Latino man, worked as an assistant principal in Elementary School for several years. After several ten and eleven-year-old girls attending the school accused him of touching them inappropriately on the chest, Andrew was arrested and charged with several counts of endangering the welfare of children and sexual abuse. Elementary School has a policy that requires suspension or termination of any employee who the school believes engaged in conduct that impacts the health or safety of the students. After learning of the accusations, the school immediately places Andrew on unpaid administrative leave pending an investigation. In the course of its investigation, the school provides Andrew a chance to explain the events and circumstances that led to his arrest. Andrew denies the allegations, saying that he may have brushed up against the girls in the crowded hallways or lunchroom, but that he doesn't really remember the incidents and does not have regular contact with any of the girls. The school also talks with the girls, and several of them recount touching in crowded situations. The school does not find Andrew's explanation credible. Based on Andrew's conduct, the school terminates his employment pursuant to its policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Andrew challenges the policy as discriminatory under Title VII. He asserts that it has a disparate impact based on national origin and that his employer may not suspend or terminate him based solely on an arrest without a conviction because he is innocent until proven guilty. After confirming that an arrest policy would have a disparate impact based on national origin, the EEOC concludes that no discrimination occurred. The school's policy is linked to conduct that is relevant to the particular jobs at issue, and the exclusion is made based on descriptions of the underlying conduct, not the fact of the arrest. The Commission finds no reasonable cause to believe Title VII was violated.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Convictions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, a record of a conviction will usually serve as sufficient evidence that a person engaged in particular conduct, given the procedural safeguards associated with trials and guilty pleas. However, there may be evidence of an error in the record, an outdated record, or another reason for not relying on the evidence of a conviction. For example, a database may continue to report a conviction that was later expunged, or may continue to report as a felony an offense that was subsequently downgraded to a misdemeanor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_785"></span>Some states require employers to wait until late in the selection process to ask about convictions. The policy rationale is that an employer is more likely to objectively assess the relevance of an applicant's conviction if it becomes known when the employer is already knowledgeable about the applicant's qualifications and experience. As a best practice, and consistent with applicable laws, the Commission recommends that employers not ask about convictions on job applications and that, if and when they make such inquiries, the inquiries be limited to convictions for which exclusion would be job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Determining Whether a Criminal Conduct Exclusion Is Job Related and Consistent with Business Necessity</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that a criminal conduct exclusion that has a disparate impact is job related and consistent with business necessity under Title VII, the employer needs to show that the policy operates to effectively link specific criminal conduct, and its dangers, with the risks inherent in the duties of a particular position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two circumstances in which the Commission believes employers will consistently meet the "job related and consistent with business necessity" defense are as follows:</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> The employer validates the criminal conduct screen for the position in question per the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (Uniform Guidelines) standards (if data about criminal conduct as related to subsequent work performance is available and such validation is possible); or</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> The employer develops a targeted screen considering at least the nature of the crime, the time elapsed, and the nature of the job (the three <span class="Italic">Green</span> factors), and then provides an opportunity for an individualized assessment for people excluded by the screen to determine whether the policy as applied is job related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The individualized assessment would consist of notice to the individual that he has been screened out because of a criminal conviction; an opportunity for the individual to demonstrate that the exclusion should not be applied due to his particular circumstances; and consideration by the employer as to whether the additional information provided by the individual warrants an exception to the exclusion and shows that the policy as applied is not job related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Section V.B.9, <span class="Italic">infra</span> (examples of relevant considerations in individualized assessments).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Depending on the facts and circumstances, an employer may be able to justify a targeted criminal records screen solely under the <span class="Italic">Green</span> factors. Such a screen would need to be narrowly tailored to identify criminal conduct with a demonstrably tight nexus to the position in question. Title VII thus does not necessarily require individualized assessment in all circumstances. However, the use of individualized assessments can help employers avoid Title VII liability by allowing them to consider more complete information on individual applicants or employees, as part of a policy that is job related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">State of Texas v. EEOC and US Attorney General</span>, No. 18-10628 (5th Cir. 2019) (holding that the Commission "overstepped its statutory authority" in issuing its guidance on arrest and conviction records; finding that Commission guidance does not establish "substantive rules," but rather are "procedural regulations" and could not be enforced against the State of Texas).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Beaton v. Attorney General</span>, 01996580 (2002), the Commission described the agency's burden of proof in an adverse impact case when it is alleged that arrests form the basis of rejection for employment. The Commission found that applicants can be rejected based only on the conduct at issue, and not the fact that there has been an arrest. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Beaton</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has found that the use of arrest records as an absolute bar to employment has a disparate impact on certain protected groups, including Blacks. EEOC Policy Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest Records in Employment Decisions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span> (1982), No. N-915-061, at 1-2, 3 (September 7, 1990) (Arrest Records Policy Guidance). Arrests can only be considered as a means of "triggering" further inquiry into that person's character or prior conduct<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 12. After considering all of the circumstances, if the employer reasonably concludes that the applicant's or employee's conduct is evidence that he or she cannot be trusted to perform the duties of the position in question, the employer may reject that person<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disparate impact practices, neutral on their face and even neutral in terms of intent cannot be maintained if they operate to freeze the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> of discriminatory employment practices<span class="Italic">. Van De</span> <span class="Italic">Car v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971656 (August 17, 2000). The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. 2000e) effectively codified the requirement that an employer prove a legitimate business purpose and not merely produce evidence of it as stated in the Supreme Court case, Wards <span class="Italic">Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</span> 490 U.S. 642 (1989)<span class="Italic">. See Van De Car</span>. In other words, once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact is established, the employer has the burden of showing that the challenged practice is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity<span class="Italic">. Barcela v. Department of State,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01965018 (December 5, 1997)<span class="Italic">. See</span> also Arrest Records Policy Guidance at 5. Business necessity can be established where the employee or applicant is engaged in conduct which is particularly egregious or related to the position in question<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2. The Commission has also stated that once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing is made of disparate impact, the employer has the burden of showing that the policy has "a manifest relationship to the employment in question." <span class="Italic">Van De Car</span> <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977 (1988). In disparate impact cases, in general, no evidence of motive of discriminatory intent is needed<span class="Italic">. Van De Car</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the use of arrest records alone cannot be used to routinely exclude persons from employment. Arrest Records Policy Guidance at 1. However, conduct which indicates unsuitability for a particular position is a basis for exclusion<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 4. Accordingly, an arrest record may be used as evidence of conduct, which may render an applicant unsuitable for a particular position<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 4, 6. An employer may deny employment opportunities to persons based on any prior conduct which indicates that they would be unfit for the position in question, whether that conduct is evidenced by an arrest, conviction or other information provided to the employer<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 6. It is the conduct, not the arrest<span class="Italic"> per se</span>, which the employer may consider in relation to the position sought<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2. Where it appears that the applicant or employee engaged in the conduct for which he was arrested and that the conduct is job-related and relatively recent, exclusion is justified<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1, 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency acknowledged that it was complainant's arrests that prompted the agency's decision to withdraw the tentative offer. FAD at 7. The agency further concluded that it could have reasonably concluded that complainant was a less attractive candidate for the position, after learning about complainant's multiple arrests<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> However, there was no consideration in the FAD of whether the arrests were appropriate in light of complainant's conduct. It appears that the agency assumed the arrests were based on true allegations of inappropriate conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the initial question to be addressed is whether complainant's arrest record reflects his conduct. The employer must evaluate whether the arrest record reflects the applicant's conduct. Arrest Records Policy Guidance at 2. Arrests alone are not reliable evidence that a person has actually committed a crime<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In cases alleging race discrimination based on the use of arrest records, courts have generally required a showing that the alleged conduct was actually committed<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 8. An arrest record does no more than raise a suspicion that an applicant may have engaged in a particular type of conduct<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to complainant's first arrest, the evidence shows that there was a "pretty heated" dispute on August 17, 1992, between complainant and the woman he was living with. Complainant indicated that he was arrested in the District of Columbia on a simple assault/domestic violence charge. Complainant acknowledged that he was living with the woman; that they were not married; that they had a one-month old son together; that he told her he was leaving for another woman; that they got into a "pretty heated" dispute; that she approached him with a knife and he defended himself; and that she then called the police. With respect to the second arrest, involving a July 16, 1993, incident, complainant indicated that the woman refused to allow him to visit the son; that he became upset; that he had "a few choice words" for her; that she alleged that he struck her in trying to take their son; and that she called the police. The August 1992 and July 1993 domestic abuse charges were dropped for want of prosecution, after the woman did not follow through with the charges and apparently did not appear in court. Complainant pleaded innocent to both charges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It appears from the record that the agency did not dispute complainant's characterization of the arrests. Thus, according to complainant the disputes primarily involved significant verbal exchanges. To the extent there were physical abuse accusations in the August 1992 arrest, complainant submitted he was acting in self-defense. To the extent there were physical abuse questions in the August 1993 arrest, complainant denied that he had struck his accuser. Complainant contended that he was innocent in both instances of the charges. There is nothing in the record to contradict complainant's characterization of his conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third arrest, in September 1992, concerned a DUI incident, in which he failed a field sobriety test. However, it is undisputed that the charge was dismissed, after the blood test complainant took showed that he was not under the influence of alcohol. Accordingly, it would have been inappropriate for the agency to consider the DUI arrest in its decision to withdraw the tentative offer of employment to complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question to be addressed is whether complainant's conduct was job-related with respect to the Legal Technician position in question<span class="Italic">. See</span> Arrest Records Policy Guidance at 6-8. The considerations relevant to the determination of whether the alleged conduct demonstrates unfitness <span id="Page_786"></span>for the particular job include: (1) the nature and gravity of the offense or offenses; (2) the time that has passed since the arrest; and (3) the nature of the job held or sought<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 6-7 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing the first factor, there were two relevant arrests, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> the August 1992 and July 1993 incidents for alleged domestic abuse. Obviously, if physical abuse occurred, the charges are considerably more serious than if the disputes involved only verbal exchanges and complainant was acting in self-defense. The Commission must take the record as it finds it, and there is nothing from the agency to contradict complainant's characterization of the arrests. Accordingly, while the verbal nature of the disputes do not appear to be minor, they do not appear to be particularly serious in terms of gravity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second factor, the first arrest took place in August 1992 and the second arrest took place in July 1993. The decision to withdraw the tentative offer of employment was made sometime around February 18, 1997, when complainant was informed of the decision to withdraw the tentative offer. Therefore, it appears the arrests took place more than four and three years respectively from the time of the decision to withdraw the tentative offer of employment. The arrests were therefore not recent occurrences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the third factor, as a Legal Technician in the Board of Immigration Appeals, complainant would presumably be assisting in the interpretation and enforcement of the law, involving immigration matters. The position was "security sensitive" and was subject to a security clearance. FAD at 4. Indeed, the agency explained that a decision was never made as to whether complainant should receive security clearance for the position because management officials made a decision to retract complainant's tentative offer before the security office processed complainant's paperwork<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the position sought involves enforcing the law or preventing crime, courts tend to closely scrutinize evidence of prior criminal conduct of applicants. Arrest Records Policy Guidance at 7. The agency has not shown that the arrests were job-related for the position in question. The agency treated the complaint as a disparate treatment case, emphasizing that there was no discriminatory animus shown against complainant. While the Executive Officer responded that he had conducted a personal review of complainant's application process, including the complainant's FBI Background Investigation Report, and determined that the action to withdraw the tentative offer was done solely based upon suitability/security concerns, the response was of a conclusory nature. He did not go through the evaluation contemplated by the Arrest Records Policy Guidance. The subject matters of the arrests for domestic abuse did not involve dishonesty or disloyalty, and the agency did not establish a nexus to the performance of the Legal Technician position. To the extent the agency was concerned about complainant's ability to work and temperament in a stressful environment, as well as a concern for violence, it appears that the agency did not consider complainant's service at the agency's Environment and Natural Resources Division, Environmental Crimes Section, in which complainant served three years and nine months, resigning for personal reasons on May 1, 1996<span class="Italic">. See</span> FAD at 5. To the extent the agency was concerned about a previous physical altercation at the agency by another individual (<span class="Italic">see id.</span>), there is no evidence that complainant had ever been involved in a physical altercation at work, and otherwise according to complainant, only in self defense with respect to the August 1992 incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency failed to meet its burden of showing that complainant's arrest record was job-related. Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the agency discriminated against complainant on the basis of his race (Black). It is well-settled that when discrimination is found, the agency must eliminate the unlawful employment practice complained of and provide the complainant with full, make whole relief<span class="Italic">. See Wilson v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950309 (September 26, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, complainant must successfully complete the security clearance process<span class="Italic">. See</span> FAD at 4<span class="Italic">. See</span> also Complainant's Affidavit at 7, 12-13. Although it is well settled that the Commission lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of claims pertaining to the denial or revocation of a security clearance (see <span class="Italic">Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518 (1988)), the Commission has the authority to determine whether the grant, denial, or revocation of a security clearance was conducted in a discriminatory manner<span class="Italic">. See Schroder v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930248 (April 14, 1994); <span class="Italic">see</span> also Policy Guidance on the Use of the National Guidance on the Use of the National Security Exception contained in 703(g) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, EEOC Notice N-915-041 (November 2, 1989); <span class="Italic">Ward v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973627 (April 20, 2000). Complainant must also successfully meet any other of the agency's job-related requirements involving the tentative offer of employment.</p>
