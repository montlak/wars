<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-86"><span class="space">3.</span> Espousal of Beliefs</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not discriminate against an employee on the basis of his religious beliefs, but that does not mean the agency is required to allow the employee to espouse religious ideas during the performance of his work when to do so is inconsistent with the performance of work duties. In <span class="Italic">Hendrickson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01922928 (1992), the employee, a tax examining assistant, persisted in praying with taxpayers during telephone conferences and making statements like "Praise the Lord" in response to questions such as whether or not the taxpayer was married. Although the employee also was accused of making other inappropriate remarks of a nonreligious nature, the agency did not deny that it based his removal, in part, upon his religious comments. The Commission found that there was a causal connection between the religious comments and the termination, but upheld the removal as nondiscriminatory because such remarks "were clearly inconsistent with the performance of his duties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast is the Commission's handling of the phrase "have a blessed day," a greeting that is not uncommon on government employee's voice mail messages. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120131652 (2014), <span id="Page_1047"></span>the Commission found that use of the phrase did not make one a "missionary." The Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with respect to Complainant's allegation that MT subjected her to religious haranguing, the record simply does not support her assertion. There are no indications that MT in any way tried to evangelize her or force her or otherwise attempt to persuade her to accept any particular religious point of view. Even during the mediation, MT did not read his Bible out loud or otherwise attempt to shout Complainant down. He merely read his Bible silently until the mediator told him to put it away. Moreover, the salutation, "have a blessed day," is commonly used, and the fact that one uses it in correspondence does not make that person a missionary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if this claim met the first prong of the hostile environment, it would still fail the second. The preponderant evidence does not establish that any action taken by MT or any incident arising from MT's conduct toward Complainant was motivated by MT's considerations of Complainant's religion, gender, or previous EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant did not openly profess to follow a particular religious faith, and MT stated without contradiction that he had no idea of what Complainant's religious affiliation was. As previously noted, neither MT's use of the "angel wings" icon or the phrase "have a blessed day," reflected any religious motivation on his part in connection with his interactions with Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The White House, in 1997, issued specific guidance on religious expression in the federal workplace. Those guidelines are discussed separately, below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as in any other complaint of discrimination, a complainant alleging religious discrimination must allege some kind of personal harm. See Chapter 3, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-12-013.html#sec3-14">Bases for Dismissal of Complaints</a>." A Jewish complainant fails to allege personal harm when he complains of religious discrimination because the Postal Service sold Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman videotapes at Christmas. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972416 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his December 12, 1996 complaint, appellant alleged that he was discriminated against on the basis of religion (Jewish) when on November 4, 1996, and continuing, the agency marketed and sold nationwide "The Rudolph, Frosty &#x0026; Friends Sing Along" videotapes. Appellant stated that the agency should be impartial regarding religious beliefs and that by marketing the videotape, the agency violated ethical standards. Appellant noted that because the agency had shown progress by acknowledging other religious beliefs when it began issuing a Chanukah stamp, it should not issue a videotape reflecting only one religious belief. Appellant requested the removal of the videotapes from the market or, alternatively, the marketing of a seasonal videotape which reflected other religious ideas and beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its final decision, the agency dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. The agency stated that appellant failed to demonstrate that he suffered an individual or unique harm with respect to a term, condition or privilege of employment and, therefore, was not aggrieved. The agency noted that a generalized grievance was not sufficient to establish standing under the Commission's regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, the Commission determines that the complaint fails to state a claim and, therefore, the agency's dismissal was proper. In <span class="Italic">Scheiman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01953809 (October 5, 1995), cited by the agency in its response to the appeal, the Commission addressed a similar issue. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Scheiman</span> alleged discrimination on the basis of religion because the agency issued Christmas stamps but did not issue Chanukah stamps. Appellant indicated that he requested that the agency issue a Chanukah stamp but that the agency failed to do so. Appellant alleged that the agency's explanation for not issuing a Chanukah stamp was that it was precluded from honoring religious holidays. Appellant alleged that the agency also explained that the stamps it issued depicted art masterpieces, contemporary winter scenes or images associated with the holiday season. Appellant further alleged in <span class="Italic">Scheiman</span> that Christian customers had the choice to purchase religious or nonreligious stamps but that he did not have a similar choice. We determined that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Scheiman</span> failed to show that the terms, conditions, and privileges of his employment were harmed by the agency's actions and that he suffered an individual or unique harm. Therein, we also noted <span class="Italic">Warth v. Seldin</span>, 422 U.S. 490 (1975), wherein the Supreme Court held that a generalized grievance shared by all or a substantially large class of individuals is not sufficient to establish standing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Commission notes that on appeal, appellant asserted that because of the agency's action, he personally felt hurt and ashamed that the Jewish religion was not afforded the same recognition as the Catholic or Protestant religions. Assuming that appellant's statement is a request for damages, we find that when, as in the instant case, an allegation fails to state a claim, it will not be converted into a processable claim merely because the complainant has requested specific relief in the form of compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Larotonda v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933946 (March 11, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The tension between an employee's right to hold her own religious beliefs and espouse those beliefs and the employer's right to expect an employee to refrain from disruptive conduct also was the subject of a lengthy and split decision in the Fourth Circuit. In <span class="Italic">Chalmers v. Tulon Co. of Richmond</span>, 101 F.3d 1012 (4th Cir. 1997), a divided court upheld the right of an employer to terminate the plaintiff for sending religious letters to a supervisor and a subordinate. The majority found the plaintiff was not entitled to accommodation because she had never informed her employer that her religious beliefs would compel her to write such letters and, in any event, the conduct could not be reasonably accommodated by the employer. The dissent argued that it was legal error to construe Title VII as requiring an employee to inform her employer, in advance, of every practice that furthered her religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Chalmers</span>, there was no dispute that the plaintiff was a supervisor whose work the company valued. There also was no dispute that for several years she had been a born-again Christian. After becoming disturbed that her supervisor had committed to producing a project for customers on a schedule he knew could not be met, the plaintiff wrote the supervisor a letter and sent it to his home. The letter, which was opened by the supervisor's wife, stated that God was not pleased about some of the supervisor's behavior and that the supervisor needed to get "straight" with God. In part because of a past affair, the supervisor's wife assumed the behavior referred to was yet more marital infidelity. Needless to say, this caused the supervisor no small degree of distress.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff also wrote a letter to the home of a subordinate who was recovering from complications from a delivery. The letter advised the subordinate, who was an unwed mother, that God also was not pleased with her behavior and that sometimes God made people sick when he was not pleased with them.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff's employment was terminated as a result of these letters. The district court granted summary judgment for the employer and the court of appeals affirmed. The majority in <span class="Italic">Chalmers</span>, 101 F.3d at 1018-21, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Title VII similarly classifies religion, sex, and race as illegal considerations, the definition of "religion" in the statute places it in a special category. "Religion" is defined to include "all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's...religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e(j). Because this definition includes a requirement that an employer "accommodate" an employee's religious expression, an employee is not limited to the disparate treatment theory to establish a discrimination claim. An employee can also bring suit based on the theory that the employer discriminated against her by failing to accommodate her religious conduct. <span class="Italic">See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 97 S. Ct. 2264, 53 L. Ed.2d 113 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a religious accommodation case, an employee can establish a claim even though she cannot show that other (unprotected) employees were treated more favorably or cannot rebut an employer's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her discharge. This is because an employer must, to an extent, actively attempt to accommodate an employee's religious expression or conduct even if, absent the religious motivation, the employee's conduct would supply a legitimate ground for discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, an employee who is terminated for refusing to work on Sundays can maintain an accommodation claim even if other nonreligious employees were also fired for refusing Sunday work, and even though the employer's proffered reason for the discharge--the refusal to perform required Sunday work--is legitimate and nondiscriminatory (because the Sunday work rule applies to all employees, regardless of religion). If the employee has notified the employer of his religious need to take Sundays off, the burden rests on the employer to show that it could not accommodate the employee's religious practice without undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See EEOC v. Ithaca Indus., Inc.</span>, 849 F.2d 116, 118 (4th Cir.) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (definition of religion under Title VII requires employers to make reasonable accommodations, short of undue hardship), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 488 U.S. 924, 109 S. Ct. 306, 102 L. Ed.2d 325 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court did not fully elaborate on the basis for its dismissal of Chalmers' claim. The court did state that Chalmers had failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and that, even if she had, Tulon had offered a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for her discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this appeal, Chalmers does not appear to challenge the district court's rationale for dismissing her claim under the disparate treatment theory, nor could she. Tulon's proffered reasons for discharging Chalmers--because her letters, which criticized her fellow employees' personal lives and beliefs, invaded the employees' privacy, offended them and damaged her working relationships--are legitimate and non-discriminatory. Examination of the letters indicates that Chalmers knew that her conduct might distress her co-workers (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, her statement in the letter to Combs--"You probably do not want to hear this"). Additionally, the damage to her working relationship with LaMantia, arising from the marital discord her letter caused, is attributable to Chalmers whether <span id="Page_1048"></span>or not it was intended or foreseeable (had she not invaded LaMantia's privacy by sending the letter to his home and included vague references to immoral conduct, Mrs. LaMantia would not have been upset).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chalmers' primary argument is not that the district court erred in its analysis of her claim under the disparate treatment theory, but that the court erred in failing to analyze her suit under the accommodation theory. In other words, she apparently maintains that even if her letters provided Tulon with a legitimate reason for her discharge, her religious motive for writing the letters required Tulon to accommodate her conduct. Accordingly, we turn to the question of whether Chalmers' complaint survives summary judgment under the accommodation theory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have never articulated a framework for analyzing religious accommodation claims. Several of our sister circuits, however, have developed such a framework, which we now adopt.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> religious accommodation claim, a plaintiff must establish that: "(1) he or she has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief that conflicts with an employment requirement; (2) he or she informed the employer of this belief; (3) he or she was disciplined for failure to comply with the conflicting employment requirement." <span class="Italic">Philbrook v. Ansonia Bd. of Educ.</span>, 757 F.2d 476, 481 (2d Cir. 1985) (quoting <span class="Italic">Turpen v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R.R. Co.</span>, 736 F.2d 1022, 1026 (5th Cir. 1984)), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds</span>, 479 U.S. 60, 65, 107 S. Ct. 367, 370, 93 L. Ed.2d 305 (1986). If the employee establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden then shifts to the employer to show that it could not accommodate the plaintiff's religious needs without undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also EEOC v. Arlington Transit Mix, Inc.</span>, 957 F.2d 219, 221-22 (6th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Beasley v. Health Care Serv. Corp.</span>, 940 F.2d 1085, 1088 (7th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Hacienda Hotel</span>, 881 F.2d 1504, 1512 (9th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Louisiana</span>, 874 F.2d 992, 995 (5th Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 493 U.S. 1059, 110 S. Ct. 871, 107 L. Ed.2d 955 (1990); <span class="Italic">Protos v. Volkswagen of America, Inc.</span>, 797 F.2d 129, 133 (3d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 972, 107 S. Ct. 474, 93 L. Ed.2d 418 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chalmers has alleged that she holds <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious beliefs that caused her to write the letters. Tulon offers no evidence to the contrary. The parties agree that Tulon fired Chalmers because she wrote the letters. Accordingly, Chalmers has satisfied the first and third elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> test. However, in other equally important respects, Chalmers' accommodation claim fails.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chalmers cannot satisfy the second element of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> test. She has forecast no evidence that she notified Tulon that her religious beliefs required her to send personal, disturbing letters to her coworkers. Therefore she did not allow the company any sort of opportunity to attempt reasonable accommodation of her beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As Chalmers recognizes, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under the accommodation theory requires evidence that she informed her employer that her religious needs conflicted with an employment requirement and asked the employer to accommodate her religious needs. <span class="Italic">See Redmond v. GAF Corp.</span>, 574 F.2d 897, 901 (7th Cir. 1978) (<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> standard includes a "requirement that plaintiff inform his employer of both his religious needs and his need for an accommodation"); <span class="Italic">Cary v. Carmichael</span>, 908 F. Supp. 1334, 1343-46 (E.D. Va. 1995). <span class="Italic">Compare Ithaca</span>, 849 F.2d at 118 (if an employee requests to observe the Sabbath, the employer must attempt to accommodate) with <span class="Italic">EEOC v. J.P. Stevens &#x0026; Co.</span>, 740 F. Supp. 1135, 1137 (E.D.N.C. 1990) (employer may fire an employee who failed to provide advance notice of his religious beliefs regarding the Sabbath).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chalmers concedes that she did not expressly notify Tulon that her religion required her to write letters like those at issue here to her co-workers, or request that Tulon accommodate her conduct. Nonetheless, for several reasons, she contends that such notice was unnecessary in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, Chalmers asserts that Tulon never explicitly informed her of a company policy against writing religious letters to fellow employees at their homes and so she had "no reason to request an accommodation." Reply Brief at 12. However, companies cannot be expected to notify employees explicitly of all types of conduct that might annoy co-workers, damage working relationships, and thereby provide grounds for discharge. As noted previously, Chalmers implicitly acknowledged in the letters themselves that they might distress her co-workers. Moreover, she conceded that, as a supervisor, she had a responsibility to "promote harmony in the workplace."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a rule justifying discharge of an employee because she has disturbed co-workers requires careful application in the religious discrimination context (many religious practices might be perceived as "disturbing" to others), Chalmers, particularly as a supervisor, is expected to know that sending personal, distressing letters to coworkers' homes, criticizing them for assertedly ungodly, shameful conduct, would violate employment policy. Accordingly, the failure of the company to expressly forbid supervisors from disturbing other employees in this way, provides Chalmers with no basis for failing to notify Tulon that her religious beliefs required her to write such letters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Alternatively, Chalmers contends that the notoriety of her religious beliefs within the company put it on notice of her need to send these letters. In her view, Chalmers satisfied the notice requirement because Tulon required "only enough information about an employee's religious needs to permit the employer to understand the existence of a conflict between the employee's religious practices and the employer's job requirements." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Polk County</span>, 61 F.3d 650, 654 (8th Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Heller v. EBB Auto Co.</span>, 8 F.3d 1433, 1439 (9th Cir. 1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Knowledge that an employee has strong religious beliefs does not place an employer on notice that she might engage in any religious activity, no matter how unusual. Chalmers concedes that she did not know of any other employee who had ever written distressing or judgmental letters to co-workers before, and that nothing her co-workers had said or done indicated that such letters were acceptable. Accordingly, any knowledge Tulon may have possessed regarding Chalmers' beliefs could not reasonably have put it on notice that she would write and send accusatory letters to co-workers' homes. <span class="Italic">Cf. Brown</span>, 61 F.3d at 654 (holding that because the employee had engaged in similar religious conduct on prior occasions, employer had notice of the conflict).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chalmers also contends that the letters themselves provided notice that her religious beliefs compelled her to write them. But giving notice to co-workers at the same time as an employee violates employment requirements is insufficient to provide adequate notice to the employer and to shield the employee's conduct. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Angelica Uniform Group, Inc.</span>, 762 F.2d 671 (8th Cir. 1985) (plaintiff failed to provide adequate notice to establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where she left a note to her employer immediately before she went away for several days, informing the employer that she would need to exceed her allotted leave time for religious reasons).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a similar vein, Chalmers appears to contend that because Tulon was necessarily aware of the religious nature of the letters after her co-workers received them and before her discharge, Tulon should have attempted to accommodate her by giving her a sanction less than a discharge, such as a warning. This raises a false issue. There is nothing in Title VII that requires employers to give lesser punishments to employees who claim, after they violate company rules (or at the same time), that their religion caused them to transgress the rules. <span class="Italic">See Johnson</span>, 762 F.2d at 673 (employer need not establish that it attempted accommodation when plaintiff failed to provide adequate notice to the employer before violating employment rules, even though the employer knew of the religious motive for employee's violation prior to discharge).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Part of the reason for the advance notice requirement is to allow the company to avoid or limit any "injury" an employee's religious conduct may cause. Additionally, the refusal even to attempt to accommodate an employee's religious requests, prior to the employee's violation of employment rules and sanction, provides some indication, however slight, of improper motive on the employer's part. The proper issue, therefore, is whether Chalmers made Tulon aware, prior to her letter writing, that her religious beliefs would cause her to send the letters. Since it is clear that she did not, her claims fail. <span class="Italic">See J.P. Stevens</span>, 740 F. Supp. at 1137.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, Chalmers has not pointed to any evidence that she gave Tulon--either directly or indirectly--advance notice of her need for accommodation. For this reason, Chalmers has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under the religious accommodation theory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If we had concluded that Chalmers had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, Chalmers' religious accommodation claim would nonetheless fail. This is so because Chalmers' conduct is not the type that an employer can possibly accommodate, even with notice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chalmers concedes in the letters themselves that she knew the letters to her co-workers, accusing them of immoral conduct (in the letter to Combs, suggesting that Combs' immoral conduct caused her illness), might cause them distress. Even if Chalmers had notified Tulon expressly that her religious beliefs required her to write such letters, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> that she was "led by the Lord" to write them, J.A. 66, Tulon was without power under any circumstance to accommodate Chalmers' need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Typically, religious accommodation suits involve religious conduct, such as observing the Sabbath, wearing religious garb, etc., that result in indirect and minimal burdens, if any, on other employees. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wilson v. U.S. West Communications</span>, 58 F.3d 1337, 1342 (8th Cir. 1995) (accommodation required when employee wore a religious button that bothered co-workers indirectly). An employer can often accommodate such needs without inconveniencing or unduly burdening other employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a case like the one at hand, however, where an employee contends that she has a religious need to impose personally and directly on fellow employees, invading their privacy and criticizing their personal lives, the employer is placed between a rock and a hard place. If Tulon had the power to authorize Chalmers to write such letters, and if Tulon had granted Chalmers' request to write the letters, the company would subject itself to possible suits from Combs and LaMantia claiming that Chalmers' conduct violated their religious freedoms or constituted <span id="Page_1049"></span>religious harassment. Chalmers' supervisory position at the Richmond office heightens the possibility that Tulon (through Chalmers) would appear to be imposing religious beliefs on employees. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wilson</span>, 58 F.3d at 1342 ("Title VII does not require an employer to allow an employee to impose...religious views on others").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, even if Chalmers had notified Tulon that her religion required her to send the letters at issue here to her co-workers, Tulon would have been unable to accommodate that conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not in any way question the sincerity of Chalmers' religious beliefs or practices. However, it is undisputed that Chalmers failed to notify Tulon that her religious beliefs led her to send personal, disturbing letters to her fellow employees accusing them of immorality. It is also undisputed that the effect of a letter on one of the recipients, LaMantia's wife, whether intended or not, caused a co-worker, LaMantia, great stress and caused him to complain that he could no longer work with Chalmers. Finally, it is undisputed that another employee, Combs, told a company officer that Chalmers' letter upset her (although she later claimed that her working relationship with Chalmers was unaffected). Under these facts, Chalmers cannot establish a religious accommodation claim. Accordingly, the district court's order granting summary judgment to Tulon is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a dissent that demonstrates just how deep the divisions on issues involving religious discrimination run, Justice Neimeyer in <span class="Italic">Chalmers</span>, 101 F.3d at 1025-27, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on the Fifth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Turpen v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas RR Co.</span>, 736 F.2d 1022 (5th Cir. 1984), the majority concludes that Chalmers' claim was fatally flawed because she somehow failed to give Tulon notice of her religious beliefs. Obviously, if an employer is to be charged with discrimination against an employee "because of" the employee's religious beliefs or practice, the employer must be aware of the beliefs or practice and understand their religious nature. But the majority errs both legally and factually when it decides that Chalmers' claim must fail because she did not explicitly inform Tulon that she would write religious letters to co-workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is legal error to construe Title VII to impose a burden on the employee of informing her employer in advance about each practice the employee will follow in furtherance of religious beliefs. It is undoubtedly true that an employer cannot be held liable for religious discrimination by, for example, assigning an employee to work on Sunday when the employer has no knowledge that work on Sunday violates the employee's religious beliefs. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., EEOC v. Ithaca Indus., Inc.</span>, 849 F.2d 116 (4th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Redmond v. GAF Corp.</span>, 574 F.2d 897 (7th Cir. 1978). But that does not impose an additional religious disclosure burden on Title VII plaintiffs. Instead, it is merely a recognition that Title VII's "because of" requirement cannot be satisfied where the employer has no knowledge that the conduct warranting discharge was religious in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority has grafted a claim-defeating notice requirement onto the statutory requirements for establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, concluding as a matter of law, "any knowledge Tulon may have possessed regarding Chalmers' beliefs could not reasonably have put it on notice that she would write and send accusatory letters to coworkers' homes." This notice requirement would preclude liability for every adverse employment action taken because of a religious practice if the employer did not know in advance that the practice would take place, even though the employer recognized the practice as religious in nature. Under that rule an employer would automatically be exonerated from liability when, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, it fired an employee who arrived at work on Ash Wednesday with a cross of ashes marked on her forehead, because the employee violated a work rule against face paint. The irrationality of such a rule is readily apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Polk County</span>, 61 F.3d 650 (8th Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), the Eighth Circuit appropriately avoided such an irrational rule. It noted, "Because the first reprimand related directly to religious activities by Mr. Brown, we agree with the district court that the defendants were well aware of the potential for conflict between their expectations and Mr. Brown's religious activities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 654 (emphasis added). The court concluded that the employer violated Title VII when it fired Brown (without attempting accommodation) based on the religious activities giving rise to the first reprimand. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 657. Brown thus stands for the precise proposition that the majority rejects: Religious conduct violating employment requirements may be sufficient to put an employer on notice of the need to accommodate the religious practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The wisdom of the Eighth Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is demonstrable by understanding the irrational ramifications of the majority's ruling. The majority's rule would mean that as a matter of law a Jew could not make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under Title VII if, on the first day of work, he was fired for wearing a yarmulke that, unknown to him, violated his company's dress code. Similarly, a Muslim would have no case for being fired the first time mandatory company meetings conflicted with his prayer schedule; a Jehovah's Witness would have none upon being fired for her disrespect in refusing to attend a company-wide celebration of the CEO's birthday; a Mormon would have none for being fired the first time he refused to work late on church-wide family nights. And, of course, as the majority concludes, an evangelical Baptist's case would fail as a matter of law if she is fired the first time she puts in writing the religious ideas that she has been permitted and encouraged to speak. This is not the law of Title VII. If the employer knows that conduct is religious when it makes the discharge decision "because of" that conduct, the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> elements of a religious discrimination claim have been satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the law requires Chalmers to inform Tulon about the practices she might take in furtherance of her beliefs, the majority impermissibly finds facts when it says "any knowledge Tulon may have possessed regarding Chalmers' beliefs could not reasonably have put it on notice that she would write and send accusatory letters to co-workers' homes." While one might be able to conclude that Tulon had no notice that the LaMantias would experience stress from Chalmers' letter--a fact irrelevant for assessing Chalmers' <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case--a factfinder would certainly be entitled to view the record and conclude (1) that LaMantia was aware that Chalmers believed she should urge coworkers to accept Jesus Christ and (2) that the letters were a religious practice in furtherance of that belief. Indeed, when viewed in a light most favorable to Chalmers, Chalmers' assertions that she discussed religion repeatedly with LaMantia, that LaMantia talked about his own religious encounters, that he showed Chalmers particular respect in the workplace, and that he never objected or took exception to any religious discussion with Chalmers could support the conclusion that he was encouraging her to continue her practices. The majority seems to conclude, however, that religious conversations are so dissimilar from written letters of identical content that a reasonable factfinder could never find sufficient employer notice of the employee's religious practices. But, if Tulon denies the sufficiency of notice based on LaMantia's experience with Chalmers, then the issue is in dispute and can only be resolved by factfinding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a plaintiff establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under Title VII, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that it is "unable to reasonably accommodate to the...[religious] practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e(j); <span class="Italic">Ithaca</span>, 849 F.2d at 118; <span class="Italic">Redmond</span>, 574 F.2d at 901.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To meet its burden, Tulon must at a minimum demonstrate that Chalmers' practice was inconsistent with the needs of its workplace. Absent some inconsistency, Tulon cannot rely on the practice as a reason for discharging Chalmers. That is, if a religious practice is not in some way inconsistent with a company policy, custom, or requirement (whether explicit or not), permitting the practice cannot unduly burden the conduct of business. Yet Tulon has failed to demonstrate that the letters violated any company policy, custom, or requirement. Indeed, in briefing this case Tulon has pointedly conceded that it "had [no] policy prohibiting...the sending of letters (religious or not) to the homes of Tulon employees." Nor has it established beyond dispute that sending the letters in fact disrupted the workplace. Despite the statements of Combs and Chalmers that the workplace was not disrupted, the majority finds the opposite. To conclude, as the majority has, that the employee disrupted the workplace requires several factual findings that are impermissible on review of a summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without Tulon even taking a position that it could not accommodate Chalmers' religious practice, the majority rules also that "Chalmers' conduct is not the type that an employer can possibly accommodate, even with notice." Op. at 1021. Even if it were within the majority's province to make such a finding, it could not do so on the present record, drawing all legitimate inferences in favor of Chalmers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority assumes that Chalmers' "need" to write evangelical letters is absolute and that she would not stop writing them if asked to do so. This conclusion is drawn from the unsupported belief that Chalmers' "religious beliefs required her to send personal, disturbing letters to her co-workers," or that they "compelled her to write them," and that "she has a religious need to impose personally and directly on fellow employees." These conclusions, however, are not supported by the record. Chalmers stated that she was "led by the Lord" and "inspired" to write LaMantia. To conclude that these statements mean that she could not, consistent with her religious beliefs, accept requests to stop writing may not even be a legitimate inference, much less the only legitimate inference. Certainly, it requires factfinding, which we are not free to do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority's holding that Chalmers' conduct was beyond accommodation is even more remarkable in light of the fact that the statute imposes the burden on the employer to demonstrate that a religious practice cannot be accommodated without undue hardship. The parties have not even been given an opportunity to explore that issue at trial. By ruling that as a matter of law Chalmers' conduct was not susceptible to accommodation, the majority in effect shifts to Title VII plaintiffs the burden of refuting a defense that the defendant neither asserted nor demonstrated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whatever we or the district court think about Chalmers' religious practices, it is not our place to preempt a trial of her claim by assuming that all factual disputes will be resolved against her. And we err legally <span id="Page_1050"></span>by imposing a statutorily ungrounded prior notice requirement in circumstances where the employer fully appreciates the religious nature of a practice. Finally, we compound that error by shifting to the plaintiff a burden that the statute places on the defendant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The judgment should be vacated and the case remanded for trial.</p>
