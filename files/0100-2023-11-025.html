<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-26"><span class="space">3.</span> Constructive Notice</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a case that would mark a radical departure from cases involving agency posting requirements--<span class="Italic">Polsby v. Chase</span>, 970 F.2d 1360, 1363-64 (4th Cir. 1992)--the court, interpreting the requirements of Part 1613, held that the burden is clearly on the complainant seeking a waiver of the limitations period to establish that the failure to contact a counselor was the result of deliberate actions by the agency, or actions which the agency should have known would mislead a complainant on the applicable time frames:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Polsby claims lack of notice of the thirty day requirement, but she admits that she does not know whether NIH has posted notice of the time limits. She states that there were many notices posted on bulletin boards, but that she was unaware of any indicating the time limit for sex discrimination complaints. She does not claim that any of the original defendants misrepresented the time limits or otherwise misled her. A grant of equitable relief requires a diligent search by Polsby. "One who fails to act diligently cannot invoke equitable principles to excuse that lack of diligence." <span class="Italic">Baldwin County Welcome Ctr. v. Brown</span>, 466 U.S. 147, 151, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 1725, 80 L. Ed.2d 196 (1984). Likewise, we have stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The statute of limitations will not be tolled on the basis of equitable estoppel unless the employee's failure to file in timely fashion is the consequence either of a deliberate design by the employer or actions that the employer should unmistakably have understood would cause the employee to delay filing his charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Price v. Litton Business Sys.</span>, 694 F.2d 963, 965-66 (4th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Felty v. Graves-Humphreys Co.</span>, 818 F.2d 1126 (4th Cir. 1987). In a factually similar case, the Fifth Circuit remarked:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the case at bar, plaintiff's equitable tolling argument is entirely dependent on [the defendant's] failure to post any notice of EEOC procedures and on plaintiff's ignorance of her rights under Title VII. These facts as presented here are insufficient to support equitable tolling. Plaintiff makes no allegation that [the defendant] misled her concerning her Title VII rights or misrepresented any of the facts which would support her cause of action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Cruce v. Brazosport Indep. Sch. Dist.</span>, 703 F.2d 862, 864 (5th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Polsby did consult during this time period with at least one attorney, who advised her that she had six months in which to bring her complaint to the attention of an EEO counselor. While it is unfortunate that she received this erroneous advice, the HHS does not bear responsibility for the mistaken counsel of an attorney with whom Polsby consulted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Polsby complains bitterly that a person described to her as an EEO counselor and with whom she first consulted did not inform her of the time limit. Polsby, however, does not claim that any of the defendants led her to make the assumption that the person was an EEO counselor. Again, HHS should not have to bear responsibility for mistakes by Polsby where it did nothing to mislead her. As stated by the Supreme Court, "[p]rocedural requirements established by Congress for gaining access to the federal courts are not to be disregarded by courts out of a vague sympathy for particular litigants." <span class="Italic">Baldwin County Welcome Ctr.</span>, 466 U.S. at 152, 104 S. Ct. at 1726. Under these circumstances, we find that waiver and equitable tolling are inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Polsby also contends that the time bar defense is an affirmative defense which, according to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c), must be raised in the answer. Polsby points out that HHS has not raised the defense. However, we have allowed affirmative defenses to be pled in pre-trial motions and cannot find any abuse of discretion by the district court in permitting HHS to raise this defense after the answer. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n. Int'l.</span>, 759 F.2d 1161, 1164 (4th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 474 U.S. 946, 106 S. Ct. 312, 88 L. Ed.2d 289 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Polsby further claims that a federal regulation requires HHS to extend the time limit where the complainant did not know of the time limit. The regulation provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency shall extend the time limits in this section: (i) When the complainant shows that he was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, or that he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from submitting the matter within the time limits; (ii) or for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 CFR 1613.214(a)(4) (1985). Polsby, however, misconstrues the regulation. It is clear that an extension of the time limit is mandatory where the complainant has not been notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them. Use of the conjunction requires that both parts be satisfied before the extension of time is mandatory. Polsby, however, has failed to demonstrate that the NIH did not post notice of the time limits. She alleges simply that she did not know what was posted and only believed that no notice existed.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the same time that the Fourth Circuit was moving toward imposing far more stringent requirements on complainants alleging lack of notice, the Commission was gradually drifting away from its previous position that the complainant was required to prove lack of notice and toward the position that the agency must prove it was in compliance with posting requirements. For example, the Commission found that where a complainant asserts her contact of a counselor was untimely because of the agency's failure to post the required EEO notices, the agency must do more than merely assert that it did post notices. It must make some specific showing that notices were posted <span id="Page_53"></span>at the facility in question. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01932365 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, there were situations where the Commission found that the employee had constructive notice of the filing requirements. The agency was not required to prove that the employee had actual notice of the EEO procedures, but could rely on constructive notice. Constructive notice "require[s] a finding that the agency's efforts in publicizing the process were reasonably calculated to inform employees of the equal employment opportunity complaint process." <span class="Italic">Ross v. USPS</span>, 01832383 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Ross</span>, the Commission held that a showing of constructive notice was not necessary where the agency shows the employee properly initiated the EEO process on two previous occasions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission imputed constructive knowledge of EEO procedures to an employee when an agency complied with notice posting requirements. The agency was required to produce evidence that it took sufficient actions to justify the inference of constructive knowledge. In <span class="Italic">Bass v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01933183 (1992), the agency, in its final decision, dismissed an untimely complaint relying on a summary of a statement from an agency official that it was not likely the complainant was unaware of EEO procedures. It further contended that descriptions of the discrimination complaint process were posted in work areas, but supplied no statements from anyone attesting to that fact. The Commission held that blanket conclusions, without supporting affidavits or other evidence, were insufficient to demonstrate the agency had complied with posting requirements and it declined to impute knowledge of the EEO complaint process to the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Polsby, supra</span>. While the case was pending, the Solicitor General indicated it would change its position on agency posting requirements. As a result, the case was remanded to the Fourth Circuit for consideration of the Solicitor General's opinion. <span class="Italic">Polsby v. Shalala</span>, 507 U.S. 1048, 113 S. Ct. 1940, 123 L. Ed.2d 646 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pride v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930134 (1993), relying on <span class="Italic">Polsby</span>, the Commission reversed an agency dismissal of a complaint where the employee had not timely contacted an EEO counselor because there was no showing that the agency informational notices about the EEO process contained the specific time limits for initiating a complaint. The Commission remanded the case for the taking of specific evidence on the content of agency notices. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930442 (1993) (an agency contention that EEO posters were conspicuously posted was insufficient where an employee claims they were not so posted).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Neugroschl v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 01933826 (1993), the Commission extended its holding in <span class="Italic">Pride</span>. Although the Commission noted that an agency can demonstrate constructive notice of EEO time limits, it rejected such notice based on an employee handbook that contained EEO time frames. The agency demonstrated that its regulations required its employees to read the handbook twice per year. However, the agency introduced no evidence that the complainant had actually been given the handbook. The Commission remanded the case for the taking of additional evidence on whether the handbook had ever been provided to the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, relying on <span class="Italic">Pride</span> and <span class="Italic">Polsby</span>, the Commission refused to impute constructive notice of the time frame for contacting a counselor where the agency showed that its notices did contain the time frame but did not show that its notices were posted at least 45 days prior to the complainant's contact with counselor. <span class="Italic">Zanghi v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01934334 (1993). The Commission also found the agency's contention that the complainant was represented by the union during precomplaint counseling and that the union was aware of the appropriate time frames was insufficient to prove notice.</p>
<p class="noindent">A succinct statement of the Commission's current position on constructive notice is provided in <span class="Italic">Drake v. Attorney General</span>, 0120131871 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the Commission's policy that constructive knowledge will be imputed to an employee when an employer has fulfilled its obligation of informing employees of their rights and obligations under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910474 (September 12, 1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of America</span>, 861 F.2d 746, 752-53 (1st Cir. 1988). In this case, the Agency has stated that it posted an EEO poster in Complainant's work facility containing information regarding EEO rights as well as the applicable time limits for initiating an EEO counseling process. The Agency also stated that on June 22, 2010 Complainant attended training which covered the 45-day limitation period. Complainant has not contradicted the Agency's contention. Based on the foregoing, we note that the Agency has provided this Commission with information sufficient to determine that Complainant in fact had constructive knowledge of the time limits for EEO Counselor contact. <span class="Italic">Pride v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930134 (August 19, 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Polsby v. Shalala</span>, 113 S. Ct. 1940 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">A good example of proof sufficient to establish constructive notice is <span class="Italic">Moore v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120093719 (2010). In that case, the agency's human resource chief submitted an affidavit stating that the complainant took the agency's Newcomers Training, as well as documentation that the training covered the timeframe for counselor contact and information on how to contact a counselor. The affidavit also stated that an EEO poster with timeframes was posted at the complainant's worksite at the time she worked there. On that basis, the Commission found that the complainant had constructive notice of the 45-day period even though she denied actual knowledge. Unfortunately, that finding did not help the agency as the Commission also found that the complaint involved a hostile environment and since one act in furtherance of the hostile environment had occurred within the 45 days prior to counselor contact, the complaint was timely. See section on "<a href="0100-2023-11-054.html#sec2-54">The Supreme Court's View--<span class="Italic">Morgan</span></a>," below. By comparison, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0520120198 (2015), the Commission found that the agency had not established that the complainant obtained constructive notice of the time limit through training. Although the agency submitted a sign-in sheet from the training and a slide with information on the time period, it did not present evidence that the slide was used during the training that the complainant attended.</p>
<p class="noindent">Lack of notice of the agency's EEO procedures can provide a basis for accepting an otherwise untimely complaint. One of the factors the Commission will examine to determine whether the complaint should be accepted is the reasonableness of the employee's contention that she was not aware of the time limits for contacting a counselor. It is reasonable to waive the time limit for initiating counseling for an employee who is terminated after only 16 days of service and who spent the majority of her duty hours outside the agency facility in which the EEO procedures were posted. <span class="Italic">Mayes v. USPS</span>, 01832491 (1984). However, it is not reasonable for an employee with 14 years of service and who holds a management position to assert that he was unaware of the time limit for contacting a counselor. <span class="Italic">Shabazz v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971930 (1998). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cecile S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161104 (2016) (declining to extend time limit where complainant had previous experience with the EEO complaint process).<span class="Italic"> But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cochern v. Secretary of Labor</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a42296.txt">01A42296</a> (2005) (time limit for counselor contact waived for 19-year employee where no showing she had notice of time limits); <span class="Italic">Fischberg v. Attorney General</span>, 01985143 (1999) (the fact that his wife had filed an EEO complaint did not put complainant on notice of the 45-day time limit for counselor contact); <span class="Italic">Dabon v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01974641 (1998) (rejecting an argument that it is implausible to think that an employee with 17 years of federal experience, who participated in class action, would be unaware of the time limit).</p>
<p class="noindent">A limited knowledge of the English language may provide a basis for waiving the time limit for counselor contact. The Commission will look at the reasonableness of a claim that the employee did not understand the posting. In <span class="Italic">Afahrezvani v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05920047 (1992), the Commission was unpersuaded by the contention of an Iranian-born complainant that he would not have understood EEO posters, even if he had been aware of them. The Commission noted that the complainant was close to receiving a Masters Degree in social work from a state university and that the posters describe the EEO process in "relatively simple terms...."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Beehler v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01941246 (1994), the Commission again restricted the doctrine of constructive notice and placed upon agencies a clear burden of demonstrating that constructive notice was warranted in a particular case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also argues that he was unaware of the time limit to contact an EEO Counselor. It is the Commission's policy that constructive knowledge will be imputed to an employee when an employer has fulfilled its obligations under Title VII<span class="Italic">. Thompson v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910474 (Sept. 12, 1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of America</span>, 861 F.2d 746 (1st Cir. 1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that new employees, as part of their inprocessing orientation, receive a pack of information which includes a letter dated March 25, 1988, which identifies the EEO Counselors and explains the EEO process and time deadlines for contacting an EEO Counselor. The record contains a memorandum dated April 7, 1993 from the Chief, Human Resources, stating that the March 25, 1988 letter is given to each employee when he or she processes in for employment. We find that the March 25, 1988 letter explains the EEO process and specifically states that complaints of discrimination must be brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor within 30 calendar days of the alleged discrimination. The March 25, 1988 letter also listed the names of the EEO Counselors. The EEO Counselor's Report states that the Chief, Human Resources stated that appellant was given a copy of the March 25, 1988 letter as part of appellant's new employee orientation on the discrimination complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that when he received his new employee orientation in June 1990, he did not receive any EEO information or the March 25, 1988 letter. Furthermore, appellant states that his own records in his home do not contain a copy of the March 25, 1988 letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency's proof and arguments are insufficient to show that appellant had actual or constructive knowledge, via his new employee orientation, of the time limits for contacting an EEO Counselor. The agency has presented evidence showing that the March 25, 1988 letter is in appellant's file and that the March 25, 1988 letter is customarily given to new employees. In this case, however, appellant disputes that he received the letter. There is no evidence in the record which persuasively shows that appellant received the March 25, 1988 letter. For instance, <span id="Page_54"></span>there are no statements by any personnel office or human resource office employee stating that he or she actually remembers giving appellant the March 25, 1988 letter. Furthermore, the agency has not provided any document with appellant's signature showing that he received the March 25, 1988 letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also argues that in early 1992 appellant met with the Human Resources Officer to discuss the situation and that he was advised by the Human Resources Officer of his right to file a complaint and who he should contact. The record contains a memorandum dated April 5, 1993 from the Chief, Civilian Personnel Operations Branch who states in the memorandum that in early 1992 she was performing the duties of a Human Resources Officer. The memorandum states that appellant approached her to discuss some of the incidents that led to the filing of the instant complaint. The memorandum further states: "I told [appellant] that if he wanted to pursue this issue through the EEO process, he should speak to [the named] Equal Employment Officer, Offutt AFB."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The memorandum never states that appellant was informed of the time deadline for contacting an EEO Counselor. Furthermore, the agency has not argued that appellant was specifically informed of the time deadline for contacting an EEO Counselor during this meeting in early 1992. Therefore, we find that the evidence concerning the early 1992 meeting is insufficient to show that appellant had actual or constructive knowledge of the time limits for contacting an EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also argues that EEO posters are posted on all official bulletin boards. Recently, the Commission held that information in an EEO Counselor's report regarding posting of EEO information was inadequate to support application of a constructive notice rule<span class="Italic">. Pride v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930134 (Aug. 19, 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Polsby v. Shalala</span>, 113 S. Ct. 1940 (1993)). The Commission found in <span class="Italic">Pride</span> that the agency had merely made a generalized affirmation that it posted EEO information<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The Commission found that it could not conclude that appellant's contact of an EEO Counselor was untimely without specific evidence that the poster contained notice of the time limit<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In the instant case, the agency failed to assert, or provide evidence showing, that the posters contained a notice of the time limit to contact an EEO Counselor. Furthermore, the record contains no evidence as to when this information was posted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Commission can not determine if appellant had constructive notice during the relevant time period unless there is evidence in the record as to when appellant could be found to be on constructive notice. Therefore, we find that the agency improperly dismissed the complaint on the grounds that appellant contacted an EEO Counselor in an untimely manner. We shall remand this matter to the agency pursuant to the ORDER set forth below for evidence regarding if and when the information about time deadlines was posted and any other evidence necessary to determine when appellant learned of the time limit for contacting an EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent">While an agency's burden in demonstrating that constructive notice should be imputed to an employee is not an onerous one, it should be clear that agencies must be meticulous in the presentation of facts to support constructive notice. As part of its burden, the agency must demonstrate that the complainant had constructive notice of the applicable time frames during the relevant time period for initiating counseling. <span class="Italic">Whitfield v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942271 (1994). However, once the agency meets its burden of establishing constructive notice, it is not a defense that the employee was actually unaware of the time limits for contacting a counselor. In <span class="Italic">Van Atta v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A11690 (2001), the Commission noted "whether or not complainant was actually aware of the 45-day limit, we find that the agency established that complainant had constructive knowledge of the time limit." As a result, the complainant's contact with a counselor, which occurred outside of the 45-day limit, was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Constructive notice of the time limit for initiating counseling was imputed to the complainant in <span class="Italic">Prial v. Attorney General</span>, 01200638721 (2006), where the agency demonstrated that all new employees were given a handbook discussing the time limit and the agency head had distributed two agency wide memoranda with notice of the time limit. In addition, the Commission noted that the complainant did not contact a counselor earlier because she was afraid of reprisal and concerned that no one would believe her allegations of sexual harassment since there were no witnesses. The <span class="Italic">Prial</span> case can be contrasted with <span class="Italic">Budnik v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120055810 (2006), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span>, 0520070154 (2006), where the agency presented evidence of posting EEO notices, but no evidence that the notices specifically contained information on the time limit for counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Shields v. Secretary of Transportation, FAA</span>, 01941919 (1994), the Commission found that calling an agency hotline set up to dispense information on the EEO complaint process did not constitute contact with an official "logically connected" with the EEO process for the purpose of initiating the complaint process. However, the Commission also found that, in the absence of specific evidence that the hotline had dispensed information on EEO filing periods, it would not impute such knowledge to the complainant. As the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Shields</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, appellant argues that he timely initiated EEO Counselor contact by contacting an agency Hotline on November 28, 1989, and on approximately twelve subsequent occasions. The record reflects that the agency did not consider its Hotline as a means of pursuing the EEO complaint process. We have consistently held that a complainant satisfies the criterion of Counselor contact by contacting an agency official logically connected with the EEO process, even if that official is not an EEO Counselor, and by exhibiting an intent to begin the EEO process<span class="Italic">. See Floyd v. National Guard Bureau</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890086 (June 22, 1989). We do not find that appellant's contact with an agency Hotline constitutes EEO contact for purposes of tolling the time limit; however, the record reflects that, when contacting the Hotline, appellant expressed an interest in pursuing a discrimination complaint. The record is unclear regarding whether appellant had actual or constructive notice of the limitation period for initiating timely EEO Counselor contact at the time he first called the Hotline in November 1989. The record contains no evidence indicating that appellant ever received an agency handbook or any other documents providing specific information relating to the necessity for initiating timely EEO Counselor contact. We are therefore unable to determine, in this case, whether appellant was specifically informed of the necessity for seeking EEO Counselor contact and/or the time limits on initiating such contact....</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, an agency seeking to rely on constructive notice of EEO deadlines to dismiss a complaint as untimely must, at a minimum, demonstrate that its notice contained sufficient information on those deadlines, the notice was posted where potential complainants would likely see it, and the notice was posted during the 45-day period immediately preceding the initiation of counseling. For example, in <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944923 (1994), the agency submitted evidence that it posted EEO information, including deadlines, on bulletin boards and orally instructed employees on the appropriate EEO filing times. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Secretary of Defense, AAFES</span>, 01A12050 (2001) (the agency submitted an affidavit from the human resources officer stating that posters containing the time limit for counselor contact were on display at all relevant times in complainant's workspace).</p>
<p class="noindent">Further, an agency must demonstrate that it posted the EEO information in an area that is accessible to employees. In <span class="Italic">Smock v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01963016 (1997), the appellant asserted that the EEO poster was not posted in a place that was accessible to employees until February 1996. Until the matter was brought to the attention of a higher level agency official, the EEO poster was posted in an administrative area located in a secluded room which housed the agency safe and files with access limited to four agency officials. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Smock</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD asserts that the agency's EEO Office "published and distributed to each office building a poster(s) for their bulletin board(s)" at various times between November 1985 and January 1995. The agency has failed to establish that the appellant was aware of the EEO process and the time limits for initiating it prior to the time she contacted the EEO Counselor in September 1995. Although the agency claims that the EEO posters were made available for posting in each agency building, it does not dispute the appellant's assertion that they were not posted at her work site in a place that was accessible to all the employees until after she had filed the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Mower v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960153 (July 19, 1996), the appellant asserted that the agency's bulletin board containing the EEO poster was blocked by boxes of supplies and equipment, and was otherwise located in a poorly lit area. The Commission held that the time for initiating EEO counseling was extended pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.105(a)(2). The Commission stated in <span class="Italic">Mower</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Commission's regulations authorize the agency to extend the time for initially contacting an EEO Counselor if a complainant has shown that he or she was not notified of the time limits or was otherwise unaware of them. In this instance, appellant has argued that he was not aware of the time requirements for the EEO process, and that the place where every employee should be able to reference general material about the EEO process was inaccessible. The agency has not denied appellant's contention on appeal that the bulletin board was in fact blocked or that the view was obstructed. The agency is reminded that it has a duty to publicize the time limitations for contacting an EEO Counselor and to permanently post these requirements. A notice with an obstructed view does not meet this requirement<span class="Italic">. See Lazarus v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920765 (January 14, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an EEO counselor's affirmation that EEO information was posted is generally not sufficient to prove constructive notice, the Commission found, in <span class="Italic">Godbey v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01964650 (1997), that the EEO counselor's statements were specific enough to prove that the agency satisfied EEO posting requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the statement provided by the EEO Counselor is specific enough to satisfy the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Pride</span>. In so finding, we note that the Counselor's statement not only sets forth the specific <span id="Page_55"></span>language (including the 45-day time limit) contained in the notice, but the location and size of the notice and when it was first posted. We also note that appellant never addressed this statement, nor has he offered any evidence which rebuts it. For these reasons, we find that constructive knowledge of the 45-day time limit can be imputed to appellant. Accordingly, we find that the agency properly dismissed appellant's complaint for untimeliness. With regard to appellant's statement that he was not aware of the 45-day time limit, the agency cited a signed statement from the EEO Counselor which was attached to his report. According to the Counselor, a 24" x 18" poster which set forth the 45-day time limit for initiating EEO counseling was posted near the main entry of the Facility's Production area. According to the Counselor, the poster had been in that location since 1991 and was updated in 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the significant factor in the <span class="Italic">Godbey</span> case is not that it was an EEO counselor contending there was sufficient notice; it was the detail set forth in the counselor's statement and the complainant's failure to rebut that evidence that led the Commission to conclude the complainant had constructive knowledge of the time limits. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 01971138 (1997) (a statement in an EEO counselor's report that notices were not posted was dispositive of the notice issue).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965286 (1997), however, the Commission found that EEO counselor contact was timely where there was contradictory evidence regarding whether EEO notices were posted. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we note that appellant claimed that she was unaware of the 45-day limitation period for contacting an EEO Counselor. The record contains an affidavit from an agency Human Resources Specialist, who states that there were six EEO posters posted at appellant's facility during the period between the alleged discrimination and appellant's contact of an EEO Counselor. However, we find that this affidavit is rendered less than persuasive by the affidavit submitted by appellant's former supervisor. In that affidavit, the former supervisor stated that in late June 1994, she searched the entire work area of her facility and the employee break room, but she could not locate an EEO poster. This account of the lack of EEO posters at appellant's facility is corroborated by the president of appellant's local union. We find in light of the fact that an agency supervisor contradicted the Human Resources Specialist's affidavit, that the agency failed to prove that appellant had actual or constructive notice of the applicable time limit. Therefore, appellant lacked constructive notice of the 45-day limitation period. Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint on the grounds of untimely EEO contact was improper and is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Boothe v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963341 (1997), the Commission failed to impute constructive knowledge of the EEO time frames to the complainant where she demonstrated that a foot injury had kept her off the workroom floor for several months. The Commission also noted that, within the appropriate time period after developing a reasonable suspicion of discrimination, the complainant had contacted agency officials and made them aware of her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the evidence demonstrates that the notice of EEO rights was partially obstructed the Commission failed to apply constructive notice of the 45-day time limit. In <span class="Italic">Watts v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A50553 (2005), the Commission noted that there was simply no guarantee that the agency had complied with the posting requirements. However, where the agency demonstrates that twice within three years it distributed a memorandum from the agency head with information about sexual harassment and the time limit for contacting a counselor, constructive notice will be imputed, <span class="Italic">Prial v. Attorney General</span>, 01200638721 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">As an alternative to showing that a notice of EEO rights was posted, an agency can demonstrate that the time limits for initiating counseling and filing complaints was covered in training. However, the evidence must be submitted as part of the complaint file and may not be submitted on appeal. In <span class="Italic">Woods v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120091027 (2009), the agency submitted evidence that it conducted a training session for employees that covered EEO timeframes for filing, but the complainant countered with evidence that she had been hospitalized for psychiatric treatment when the training was held. On appeal, the agency submitted evidence that the complainant had attended a similar training session the year before. The Commission rejected that evidence finding that to "allow [the agency] to now provide new evidence or change its arguments after complainant has filed her appeal is unfair to the complainant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
