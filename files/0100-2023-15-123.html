<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-121"><span class="space">1.</span> Justice Memo Halting Fees as Sanctions</h4>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, in response to a request by the Department of Navy, issued a memorandum in January 2003 in which it expressed the opinion that the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the EEOC from using attorney fees as a sanction against agencies for discovery misconduct. Shortly after the memorandum was issued, the EEOC instructed its administrative judges to stop issuing fees as a sanction while it assessed the memorandum and determined whether to challenge that opinion. Because of the significance of the memorandum, it is substantially reproduced below:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the resolution of this dispute binges on the doctrine of sovereign immunity, we begin by explaining its basic principles. Most fundamentally, the federal government may not be sued without its consent, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., FDIC v. Meyer,</span> 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Cohens v. Virginia,</span> 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 411-12 (1821). The absence of consent bars proceeding against the government<span class="Italic">. See Meyer,</span> 510 U.S. at 475. The authority to consent to suit--to waive sovereign immunity--does not rest with the executive branch, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., United States v. Shaw,</span> 309 U.S. 495, 500-01 (1940) (explaining "that without specific <span class="Italic">statutory consent,</span> no suit may be brought against the United States. No <span class="Italic">officer</span> by his action can confer jurisdiction.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Munro v. United States,</span> 303 U.S. 36, 41(1938); <span class="Italic">United States v. Horn,</span> 29 F.3d 754, 761 (1st Cir. 1994), or with the courts, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Lane v. Pena,</span> 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996); <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 498 U.S. 89, 95 (1990); <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> 309 U.S. at 502, but solely with Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, waivers of the "Federal Government's sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed <span class="Italic">in statutory text." Lane</span>, 518 U.S. at 192 (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. Nordic Village,</span> 503 U.S. 30, 37 (1992). Furthermore, waivers must be "strictly construed, in terms of (their] scope, in favor of the sovereign." <span class="Italic">Lane,</span> 518 U.S. at 192. It follows that waivers of immunity with respect to one type of relief do not thereby waive immunity with respect to other forms of relief. Thus, although the Clean Water Act and the <span class="Italic">Resource Conservation</span> and Recovery Act waived the immunity of federal agencies with respect to "coercive fines" designed to insure compliance with the statutes, those statutes did not render such agencies liable for "punitive fines" for past violations<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Energy v. Ohio,</span> 503 U.S. 607, 614-20(1992) (concluding that the statutes do not contain a "clear and unequivocal waiver of anything more" than the coercive fines and declining to infer "a broader reading"). And statutes that clearly waive the government's immunity from attorney's fees do not thereby waive immunity from interest on those fees, even if private parties would be liable for interest<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Library of Congress v. Shaw,</span> 478 U.S. 310, 3 17-19 (1986). Instead, the government's sovereign immunity must be clearly and specifically waived with respect to each form of relief claimed<span class="Italic">.

Blue Fox, Inc.,</span> 525 U.S. 255 (1999).[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;On close examination, several cases that may appear to be narrow exceptions to the traditional sovereign immunity canons are actually consistent with them. The Court, for example, has held that equitable tolling generally applies to suits against the government for which Congress has waived immunity<span class="Italic">. See Irwin,</span> 498 U.S. at 95-96. To reach this result, however, the Court first concluded that application of equitable tolling "amounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver," because "[f]ederal courts have typically extended equitable relief only sparingly,"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 95-96. Even so, the Court has shown great reluctance to extend <span class="Italic">Irwin. See Raygor v. Regents of the Univ. of Minn.,</span> 534 U.S. 533, 543 (2002) (declining to extend <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> to the context of state sovereign immunity). And although the Court has sustained attorney's fee awards for representation in administrative proceedings under part of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(l)(A) (2000) (providing for such awards to a "prevailing party...<span class="Italic">in any civil action</span>...for judicial review of agency action") (emphasis added), it did so only after first finding that the administrative proceedings at issue were "so intimately connected with judicial proceedings as to be considered part of the 'civil action' for purposes of a fee award." <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Hudson,</span> 490 U.S. 877, 892 (1989); <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 885 (emphasizing that the judicial review provision at issue entailed "a degree of interaction between a federal court and an administrative agency alien to traditional review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act"). In any event, the Court has stressed that such cases "do not...eradicate the traditional principle that the <span class="Italic">Government's consent</span> to be sued must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign and not enlarge(d) beyond what the language required."<span class="Italic"> Nordic Village</span>, 503 U S. at 34 (alteration in oriGINAl) (quotations and <span class="Italic">citations</span> omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The presumption against waivers of sovereign immunity is especially strong in the context of monetary claims; it "operates on the broadest possible level" and "stands as an obstacle to <span class="Italic">virtually all direct assaults against the public fisc,</span> save only those incursions from time to time authorized by Congress," <span class="Italic">Horn,</span> 29 F.3d at 761 (emphasis added). "To sustain a claim that the Government is liable for awards of monetary damages, the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims." <span class="Italic">Lane,</span> 518 U.S. at 192 (citing <span class="Italic">Nordic Village,</span> 503 U.S. at 34). As we have previously explained, a statutory provisions does not waive sovereign immunity for monetary claims if there exists any plausible reading that would not authorize monetary relief <span class="Italic">See Availability of Money Damages Under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,</span> 18 Op. O.L.C. 180, 180 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It follows that attorney's fees may not be imposed against the United States absent an express statutory waiver. In fact, such claims are treated more strictly than other monetary claims because of, among other things, the so-called "American Rule." Under the American Rule, even "the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorney's fee from the loser." <span class="Italic">Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. The Wilderness Soc'y</span>, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975); <span class="Italic">see also Buckhannon Bd and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep 't of Health and Human Res.,</span> 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001). Moreover, prevailing-party requirements are often read into fee-recovery statutes that do not explicitly require such<span class="Italic">. See, e.g, Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club,</span> 463 U.S. 680, 686, 694 (1983) (holding that "a fee claimant must 'prevail' before it may recover attorney's fees," despite a provision of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7607(f) (2000), allowing the district court to "award costs [and attorney's fees against the United States] whenever it determines that such an award is appropriate"). Further, the Supreme Court narrowly construes who qualifies as a prevailing party<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Buckhannon,</span> 532 U.S. at 600 (concluding that a plaintiff who secures the desired relief because a law suit induced the defendant <span class="Italic">voluntarily</span> to change its conduct is not a "prevailing party"). Finally, even prevailing-party status may be insufficient<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Farrar v. Hobby,</span> 506 U.S. 102, 115(1992) (concluding that "[i]n some circumstances, even a plaintiff who formally 'prevails' under [42 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 1988 should receive no attorney's fees at all"). Thus, multiple canons of construction come into play in considering the imposition of attorney's fees against the United States, all of which presume that such awards are unavailable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although most of the sovereign immunity case law arises in the context of suits before federal district courts, these principles apply with equal force to agency adjudications. This follows most immediately, we believe, from the fact that, as discussed above, Congress--not the executive branch--controls the terms of any waiver of sovereign immunity. Moreover, any other rule would undermine Congress's ability to waive immunity in a specific forum to the exclusion of another, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., McElralh v. United <span id="Page_504"></span>States,</span> 102 U.S. 426, 440 (1880), and more generally, to control the terms under which the United States would be liable to private parties. And, unsurprisingly, the courts have applied the sovereign immunity canons to proceedings before agencies and non-Article III courts<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Ardestani v. INS,</span> 502 U.S. 129, 137 (1991) (holding that sovereign immunity barred fee award to prevailing party in INS proceeding); <span class="Italic">Nordic Village,</span> 503 U.S. 30 (holding sovereign immunity presumptions applicable in Bankruptcy Court); <span class="Italic">Foreman v. Department of the Army,</span> 241 F.3d 1349, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (applying sovereign immunity principles to conclude that the Merit Systems Protection Board lacks authority to impose monetary damages)<span class="Italic">. Cf United States v. Sherwood,</span> 312 U.S. 584, 587-88 (1941) (noting that "[e)xcept as Congress has consented there is no jurisdiction in the Court of Claims [a legislative court] more than in any other court to entertain suits against the United States"). This Office has likewise opined that sovereign immunity principles govern agency awards of monetary relief <span class="Italic">See Authority of USDA to Award Monetary Relief for Discrimination,</span> 18 Op. O.L.C. 52 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the Supreme Court has raised the question whether "ordinary sovereign immunity presumptions" apply to the question whether an agency may itself grant a specific form of relief against the government when Congress has clearly waived immunity from such relief in suits brought before the district courts<span class="Italic">. West v. Gibson,</span> 527 U.S. 212, 222 (1999). The Court explicitly declined to decide this question, however, concluding in that case that sufficient evidence of a waiver before the agency existed under the traditional presumptions. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> In our view, there can be no doubt that normal sovereign immunity presumptions apply even to the question of how "the waived damages remedy is to be administered,"<span class="Italic"> Id. See also Id.</span> at 224-28 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). As the dissent in <span class="Italic">West</span> pointed out, "[i]t is settled law that a waiver sovereign immunity in one forum does not effect a waiver in other forums."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 226 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (citing <span class="Italic">McElrath v. United States,</span> 102 U.S. 426, 440 (1880); <span class="Italic">Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read,</span> 322 U.S. 47, 54 &#x0026; n.6 (1944); and <span class="Italic">Case v. Terrell,</span> 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 199, 201 (1870)) But, in any event, there is no suggestion in <span class="Italic">West</span> that the <span class="Italic">existence</span> of a waiver should be ascertained differently in the administrative context than it would be in an Article III court. It is also worth observing that the Court recently declined to distinguish between "court-like administrative tribunals" and Article III proceedings for purposes of state sovereign immunity<span class="Italic">. Federal Maritime Comm'n v. South Carolina State Ports Auth.,</span> 122 S. Ct. 1864, 1874-75 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">III.&#x2003;ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Against this backdrop, we turn to EEOC's arguments in support of its power to impose attorney's fees on federal agencies for failure to comply with AJ orders. EEOC appears to put forth two main arguments supporting its authority to impose such fees upon the government. First, EEOC contends that both its statutory mandate to eliminate discrimination from the federal workplace "through appropriate remedies," 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b), and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure suffice to waive the federal government's sovereign immunity from the type of sanctions at issue here. Second, EEOC maintains that it has inherent power, as an adjudicatory body, to impose these sanctions against federal agencies. The doctrine of sovereign immunity forecloses both arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;No Express Waiver Allows EEOC To Impose Monetary Sanctions on Federal Agencies in the Absence of a "Prevailing Party" Determination</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC cites 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b) as evidence that Congress has waived the federal government's immunity from the sanctions at issue here. That section empowers EEOC to enforce the prohibition on discrimination in the federal workplace "through appropriate <span class="Italic">remedies," Id.</span> (emphasis added). Attorney's fees imposed as a sanction for failure to comply with AJ orders relating to the adjudicatory process (such as discovery orders), however, are not a remedy for any act of discrimination. Because the waiver contained in section 2000e-16 must be interpreted in accordance with the above-mentioned rules of construction, this statutory provision does not supply the authority EEOC seeks. EEOC's reliance on <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson,</span> 527 U.S. 212 (1999), is therefore entirely misplaced. In <span class="Italic">West,</span> the Court determined that compensatory damages are an "appropriate remedy" for violations of Title VII as applied to the federal workplace, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 217, and that EEOC therefore "possesses the legal authority to <span class="Italic">enforce"</span> Title VII through such awards<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 223. As discussed above, the parties in <span class="Italic">West</span> agreed that Congress had waived the government's sovereign immunity from compensatory damages. By contrast, neither section 2000e-16(b), nor any other statute, contains a provision that even pertains to violations of AJ orders, much less provides an explicit waiver of the government's immunity to monetary sanctions for violations of such orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC next asserts that "the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity for payments by federal agencies of attorney's fees as sanctions incurred during the federal court adjudicatory process." EEOC Letter at 4. Without further analysis, EEOC simply declares that [t]hose rules also allow agencies engaged in administrative adjudicatory processes to sanction parties before them, including federal agencies,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span> Some courts have concluded that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, either by their own force or through the Equal Access to Justice Act, waive the United States' sovereign immunity from monetary sanctions <span class="Italic">imposed</span> by <span class="Italic">federal district courts. See, e.g., M.A. Mortenson Co. v. United States,</span> 996 F.2d 1177, 1181-84 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Mattingly v. United States</span>, 939 F.2d 816, 818 (9th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Adamson v. Bowen,</span> 855 F.2d 668, 671-72 (10th Cir. 1988). We disagree with this position<span class="Italic">. See</span> Memorandum for Roger B. Clegg, Associate Deputy Attorney General, Office of the Attorney General, from Larry L Simms, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, <span class="Italic">Re: Departmental Policy on Special Masters</span> (Oct. 2, 1984).[3] But even were we to agree with these holdings, nothing in them supports EEOC's assertion that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure somehow work such a waiver for sanctions imposed during the administrative process for violations of AJ orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3] In <span class="Italic">Mattingly v. United States,</span> 939 F.2d 816, 818 (9th Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit noted that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure "apply by their own force to all litigants before the court" and that Rule 11 did not expressly exempt attorneys representing the United States. The court concluded that because Congress authorized promulgation of the Rules, "applying them to the government with full force cannot be said to violate the principles of sovereign immunity."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Sovereign immunity principles, however, clearly foreclose the result reached by the court, even assuming that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are functionally equivalent to a statute for these purposes. Because the Rules wholly fail to mention the federal government, it certainly cannot be said that they contain an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity, <span class="Italic">see Lane,</span> 518 U.S. at 192. And, of course, such waivers may not be implied<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., id.; Irwin,</span> 498 U.S. at 95. The fact that the Rules seemingly apply equally to all parties appearing before the court does not change the analysis. As the Supreme Court has explained, "when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign immunity place[s] the Federal Government on an entirely different footing than private parties." <span class="Italic">Lane,</span> 518 U.S. at 196.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Moreover, both the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2072 (2000), and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure themselves preclude the conclusion that the Rules constitute such a waiver. The Rules Enabling Act provides that the Rules may not "enlarge substantive rights," 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2072(b). But by awarding attorney's fees under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where such awards would otherwise be unavailable, these courts have enlarged substantive rights<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Alyeska,</span> 421 U.S. at 259 n.31 (suggesting strongly that rules for awarding attorney's fees are substantive for purposes of <span class="Italic">Erie</span> <span class="Italic">R. Co. v. Tompkins,</span> 304 U.S. 64 (1938)). Further, the Supreme Court has explained that "it is axiomatic that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Owen Equip. and Erection Co. v. Kroger,</span> 437 U.S. 365, 370 (1978); <span class="Italic">United States v. Sherwood,</span> 312 U.S. 584, 589-90 (1941). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure themselves clearly state that "[t]hese rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the United States district courts or the venue of actions therein," Fed. R. Civ. P. 82. Because, as we explained above, sovereign immunity <span class="Italic">is jurisdictional, see, e.g., Meyer,</span> 510 U.S. at 475, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are quite incapable of providing a waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Although not discussed by EEOC, some courts have found that the Equal Access to Justice Act ("EAJA"), 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412 (2000), waives sovereign immunity for sanctions imposed for violations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., MA. Mortenson Co. v. United States,</span> 996 F.2d 1177, 1181-84 (finding it "permissible to here look beyond the specific language used" in the EAJA and resorting quite candidly to legislative history to find a waiver of sovereign immunity for discovery sanctions imposed in violation of Rule 37(b)(2) of the United States Claims Court); <span class="Italic">Adarnson v. Bowen,</span> 855 F.2d 668, 671-72 (10th Cir. 1988)<span class="Italic">. But see Mattingly</span> (declining to find the asserted waiver in the EAJA). This does not help EEOC either, if for no other reason than that, as noted below, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to EEOC proceedings. We must note, however, that the approach taken by these courts cannot be reconciled with clear Supreme Court precedent, which requires that waivers of the "Federal Government's sovereign immunity must be <span class="Italic">unequivocally expressed in statutory text," Lane,</span> 518 U.S. at 192 (emphasis added). The EAJA allows "the <span class="Italic">prevailing party</span> in any <span class="Italic">civil action"</span> to recover from the United States certain costs and fees. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(a), (b) (emphasis added)<span class="Italic">. In Adamson,</span> the court simply ignored the pellucid prevailing party requirement. Instead, the court relied on legislative history and its estimation of Congress's intent<span class="Italic">. See Adamson,</span> 855 F.2d at 671-72. But this flouts the Supreme Court's admonition that "the 'unequivocal <span class="Italic">expression' of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is</span> an expression in statutory text<span class="Italic">. If clarity does not exist <span id="Page_505"></span>there, it cannot be supplied by a committee report." Nordic Village,</span> 503 U.S. at 37 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not even apply to EEOC proceedings,<span class="Italic"> see</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 ("These rules govern the procedure in the United States district courts..." (emphasis added), a point on which EEOC has itself relied, <span class="Italic">see Bell v. Dalton,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01940852, 1994 WL 741530, at *5 (Aug. 17, 1994) ("While the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are used as guidance, they are not binding upon the Commission."). Thus, even if we accepted the proposition that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure waived the government's sovereign immunity from fee awards imposed by federal district courts for breach of those rules, we do not see how this waiver could extend to agency proceedings in which the Rules do not apply. That is, even if Congress had waived sovereign immunity for violations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in federal court, it would not follow that it has also waived immunity for arguably analogous (though formally distinct) violations before an entirely different body where these rules do not apply. Indeed, as we have emphasized, the doctrine of sovereign immunity requires the exact opposite presumption<span class="Italic">. See supra</span> Part II; <span class="Italic">see also McElrath,</span> 102 U.S. at 440.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The tentative and unsupported suggestion in <span class="Italic">West</span> that the traditional sovereign immunity canons may not apply in determining whether an administering agency may grant a form of relief for which sovereign immunity has clearly been waived at least before the district courts could not help EEOC, even if we believed that it represented the best view of the law<span class="Italic">. See West</span>, 527 U.S. at 222; <span class="Italic">see also supra</span> Part II. In <span class="Italic">West,</span> everyone agreed that sovereign immunity from compensatory damages had been waived; the only issue was <span class="Italic">when</span> such damages could be awarded. Because it is impossible to violate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in EEOC proceedings for the simple reason that those rules do not apply, there is no need to analyze the timing issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally and in light of the foregoing analysis, we note that Congress has in fact waived sovereign immunity from attorney's fees to a limited extent in the Title VII context. Section 2000e-5(k) provides that "[i]n any action or proceeding under this subchapter <span class="Italic">the court,</span> in its discretion, may allow the <span class="Italic">prevailing party...</span>a reasonable attorney's fee (including expert fees) as part of the costs." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k) (2000) (emphasis added). When an agency violates an AJ order in an EEOC proceeding, we do not yet have a prevailing party in an administrative proceeding, let alone in a civil action. This consideration (among others) renders section 2000e-5(k) inapplicable to violations of such AJ orders. Furthermore, "[t]he clarity of [this] provision[ ] is in sharp contrast to the waiver [EEOC] seeks to tease out of' other provisions, and "illustrates Congress' ability to craft a clear waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity against particular remedies." <span class="Italic">Lane,</span> 518 U.S. at 194. Extending this waiver to cover awards of attorney's fees for violations of orders issued by AJs in the course of EEOC proceedings would constitute an impermissible broadening of the terms and scope of the waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because EEOC points to no explicit statutory text in which we could begin to find a waiver of sovereign immunity, let alone a waiver that "unambiguously...extends to monetary claims," <span class="Italic">Nordic Village</span>, 503 U.S. at 34, we conclude that EEOC lacks express authority to impose monetary sanctions on federal agencies for failure to comply with AJ orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;EEOC Does Not Have Inherent Power To Impose Monetary Sanctions on Federal Agencies</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC next argues that its power to impose attorney's fees against federal agencies flows from "the judicial doctrine of the 'inherent powers' of the forum." EEOC Letter at 3. EEOC directs our attention to <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Nasco, Inc.,</span> 501 U.S. 32 (1991), in which the Court discussed the inherent power of the federal courts. But EEOC is not a federal court, and the sanctioned party in <span class="Italic">Chamber's</span> was not a federal agency. Because we conclude that the latter difference proves decisive, we address the former only in passing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, Congress has waived sovereign immunity to some extent by applying Title VII to the federal workplace and empowering EEOC to investigate and remedy violations of the statute. Furthermore, agencies <span class="Italic">may</span> possess <span class="Italic">some</span> inherent power to impose sanctions designed to protect the integrity of their proceedings, at least against litigants other than the federal government<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Touche Ross &#x0026; Co. v. SEC,</span> 609 F.2d 570, 582 (2d Cir. 1979) (upholding SEC rule enabling agency to bar attorneys from practicing before it); <span class="Italic">see also American Bus Ass'n v. Slater,</span> 231 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (discussing inherent powers of agencies)<span class="Italic">. But see Slater,</span> 231 F.3d at 9 (Sentelle, J., concurring) ("Agencies have no inherent powers. They instead are creatures of statute and may act only because, and only to the extent that, Congress has delegated them the power to act.") (citations omitted). And arguably, EEOC may have some inherent power to impose some type of sanctions designed to maintain the integrity of its proceedings even against federal agencies. One could infer this from the fact that Congress is presumed to have made its statutory scheme effective.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But it follows from our discussion above that whatever inherent power EEOC may possess cannot possibly extend to the imposition of <span class="Italic">monetary</span> sanctions against the federal government. As we have explained, the imposition of such sanctions would require a clear statement of consent in the text of a statute (the very antithesis of inherent power). That is, as discussed above, the authority to waive sovereign immunity (especially with respect to monetary claims) rests with Congress, not the executive branch. Thus, no act of EEOC (including promulgation or invocation of a regulation) can, by itself, waive the government's sovereign immunity. Because we have already concluded that Congress has not waived this immunity, it follows that EEOC lacks the authority to impose these monetary sanctions.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4] EEOC contends that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3) (2002) provides AJs with the authority to impose monetary sanctions against the government. That provision allows AJs to impose certain sanctions for failure to comply with their orders. Those sanctions include drawing adverse inferences against the noncomplying party, exclusion of other evidence offered by the noncomplying party, issuing an adverse ruling against that party, and taking "such other actions as appropriate."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Noticeably absent is any mention of monetary sanctions, a fact that has not evaded EEOC, <span class="Italic">see</span> EEOC Letter at 3 (noting that EEOC regulations "explicitly provide for sanctions other than attorney's fees"). Even if this provision were found in a statute (and not merely a regulation), the provision "fails to establish unambiguously that the waiver extends to monetary claims," <span class="Italic">Nordic Village,</span> 503 U.S. at 34, and therefore fails to waive immunity from those claims, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 37<span class="Italic">. See also Availability of Money Damages Under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,</span> 18 Op. O.L.C. 180, 181 (1994) (concluding that the term "appropriate relief' in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act does not suffice to authorize monetary relief against the federal government). Indeed, in <span class="Italic">United States v. Woodley,</span> 9 F.3d 774, 781-82 (9th Cir. 1993), the Ninth Circuit refused to find a waiver of sovereign immunity in the similarly-worded Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(2), under which "the court may order 'a non-complying' party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing evidence not disclosed, <span class="Italic">or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances,"</span> Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2) (emphasis added.) The court found fatal the fact that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(2), unlike several provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, "provides no independent authority for a monetary sanction." <span class="Italic">Woodley,</span> 9 F.3d at 781-82<span class="Italic">. See also In-State Steel Constr. Co. v. Herman,</span> 164 F.3d 973, 980 (6th Cir. 1999) (concluding that agency rule providing for non-monetary sanctions "indicates an intention to preclude monetary sanctions").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that significant controversy surrounds the question whether even Article III courts enjoy inherent power to impose monetary sanctions against the federal government<span class="Italic">. Compare Horn,</span> 29 F.3d at 763-67;<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 765 n.13 (noting that "when the two doctrines [sovereign immunity and inherent powers] lock horns, contempt is barred by sovereign immunity"), with <span class="Italic">Cobell v.</span> <span class="Italic">Norton,</span> 226 F. Supp.2d 1, 154--55 (D.D.C. 2002) (arguing that if sovereign immunity were to bar the court from exercising its claimed inherent power, the court would be unable to enforce its orders against the executive branch, a result that the court believed to be inconsistent "with the tripartite framework established by the Constitution"); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. Waksberg,</span> 112 F.3d 1225,1227 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (characterizing the separation-of-powers argument as serious enough to invoke the canon of constitutional avoidance); <span class="Italic">cf Chambers,</span> 501 U.S. at 58 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (agreeing with the majority that Article III courts derive a measure of independent authority from the Constitution). Whatever the merit of this debate, it has no application in this context, as EEOC and the Navy are both part of the executive branch.</p>
