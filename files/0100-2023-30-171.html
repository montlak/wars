<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-161a"><span class="space">8.</span> Exacerbation of Preexisting Conditions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Discrimination that exacerbates a preexisting condition can lead to a significant financial award. In <span class="italic">Lauralee C. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020000598 (2021), the Commission found that the agency subjected the complainant to reprisal when it issued her a letter of admonishment, placed her on administrative leave, refused her a permanent position and terminated her. The complainant alleged that the discrimination triggered her preexisting PTSD:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant provided medical documents, and a personal statement establishing that prior to her employment with the Agency, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD") having survived, as well as high stress assignments. Her PTSD manifested as severe depression, difficulty sleeping, inability to think clearly, inability to enjoy life, and at her lowest point, in 2010, she seriously contemplated suicide. Complainant explained that when retaliatory acts in Claims (A), (B), and (C), occurred, they triggered emotions she associated with her military sexual trauma ("MST") in 1994 perpetrated by a supervisor, and caused a major flare-up of her PTSD. Following her non-conversion, and subsequent termination from ERPi, Complainant felt hopeless about her future employment, she became severely depressed, and was often unable to get out of bed. Her mental health difficulties were exacerbated by the financial difficulties accompanying unemployment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to her own detailed account, and financial documentation, Complainant provided statements from three witnesses. Two witnesses ("W1" and "W2") provided accounts of Complainant during her appointment. W1 was Complainant's coworker for a year, they worked in the same office and Complainant confided in her during the time frame of the Agency's retaliatory actions. W1 recalled that Complainant exhibited great anxiety and distress regarding S2, and shared her allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination, as well as her belief that S2 used his influence to insure that she was converted to a permanent position, and to remove her from the contract ERPi was working on as retaliation for reporting him. W2 was one of the team members who interviewed and selected Complainant for the PMF position in 2013. W2 testified that she observed Complainant's demeanor decline from highly enthusiastic about her PMF appointment, to exhibiting clear indications of someone "struggling." In W2's opinion, Complainant exhibited symptoms of depression. W2 confirmed that environment of the Office of Policy and Planning likely caused Complainant stress because it was fast paced, and because there was an attitude "imparity" regarding female employees. W2, who had since sought and accepted a lateral transfer, recalled that in an incident similar to that of Complainant, S2 instructed her to be more "humble," indicating an impact on whether he would recommend her for promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third witness, ("W3") an Addiction Therapist of the Substance Abuse Recovery Program treated Complainant for a severe Substance Use Disorder ("SUD") between July 2016 and September 2016, that her discrimination harassment case created an enormous amount of stress and it was a struggle to recover, she referred her for inpatient care. The medical documents provided demonstrate that Complainant was prescribed a number of medications to treat her multiple mental health conditions, as well as regular therapy between April 2018 to October 2018. They also reflect inpatient hospitalization for complex PTSD from August 16, 2018 to September 26, 2018. Complainant describes feeling lost and incomplete in every way, unable to maintain a relationship, and attributes her two stays in inpatient treatment programs to her financial and emotional harm arising from the Agency's retaliatory actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $95,000, citing to precedential decisions where the complainant's preexisting condition was exacerbated by the agency's discrimination in <span class="italic">Lauralee C</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency supported its award of $95,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages by identifying two prior decisions on compensatory damages issued by the Commission which, like the instant case, involved a complainant whose pre-existing health conditions were exacerbated by the discriminatory action and where their emotional harm arose from financial stress proximately caused by the agency's discriminatory termination of their employment. <span class="italic">See Emmett W. v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120143098) (May 3, 2016) ($80,000 awarded after discriminatory termination where complainant <span id="Page_1943"></span>experienced financial difficulties, including canceled medical insurance and bankruptcy, which caused severe stress and emotional distress, damaging his family relationships, causing humiliation in the community and exacerbating his pre-existing conditions of PTSD and traumatic brain injury ("TBI") which are triggered by high anxiety and stress), and <span class="italic">Brown-Fleming v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420080016 (Oct. 28, 2010) (petition for enforcement of order to pay compensatory damages for harassment finding in EEOC Appeal No. 0120045121 (Dec. 20, 2006)). ($150,000 awarded discriminatory termination where the complainant experienced depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, crying spells, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, as well as financial difficulties requiring her to liquidate her retirement account, which caused extreme stress exacerbating mental and physical conditions attributable to the stress, including abdominal pain, worsening hypertension, dramatic weight loss and worsening psoriasis). While both cases are instructive, taking into consideration the additional factors contributing to Complainant's emotional distress and the supporting documentation she provided, Complainant's complaint is more similar to <span class="italic">Emmitt W.</span> Also, the duration and severity of the discrimination, which included a finding of prolonged harassment by multiple coworkers and supervisors that included racial epitaphs, as well as sexual harassment, in addition to unlawful termination in <span class="italic">Browin-Fleming</span>, supported a much larger award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, an award of $95,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate in this case. <span class="italic">See also Scott K. v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120182127 (Feb. 20, 2020) ($85,000 awarded where the agency did not attempt to provide the complainant work within his medical restrictions, unlawfully discharging him, resulting in severe depression, change in personality financial stress, exacerbating his condition) <span class="italic">citing Billy B. v.

<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">Lydia F. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020001007 (2021), the Commission increased a compensatory damages award from $5,500 to $20,000 concluding that the administrative judge underestimated the "extent to which Complainant's symptoms were exacerbated as a result of the denied accommodation and constructive discharge":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's award of $5,500 in compensatory damages is also inappropriate. At the outset, the AJ did not give sufficient consideration to the demoralizing and humiliating nature of Complainant's forced resignation. We have previously found awards in the $5,500 range to be an appropriate amount of compensatory damages for employees whose pre-existing conditions were aggravated by an agency's denial of reasonable accommodation, taking into consideration outside factors and the duration of the denial. <span class="italic">See Phillis W. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120180863 (Jun. 5, 2019) ($5,000 awarded for exacerbation of pre-existing physical disability as a result of the Agency's delay of over a year in replacing ergonomic chair as a reasonable accommodation) citations omitted, <span class="italic">see also, Chara S. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019001100 (July 16, 2020) ($6,000 award where Complainant failed to establish that the three-week delay in granting reasonable accommodation was the proximate cause complainant's disability-related injury, also noting that complainant's emotional distress could be attributed to outside factors), <span class="italic">Freddie M. v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2020002968 (Dec. 30, 2020) ($5,000 awarded to complainant with bilateral degenerative knee impairment who was denied a parking space as a reasonable accommodation for 7 months, because the evidence indicated that the denial of an accommodation "contributed in small part to Complainant's emotional pain, depression, and irritability," particularly his termination, which was not at issue and could not be a basis for recovering damages). In the instant case, Complainant not only established that the symptoms of her mental health conditions were exacerbated as a result of the Agency's discriminatory acts, she also provided sufficient evidence connecting the Agency's actions to additional emotional harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the AJ's analysis of complainant's prior diagnoses of her mental health conditions seems to assume that her symptoms were continuous, stating, "[s]ince 2013, Complainant has experienced sleep impairments, anxiety symptoms (e.g., heart pounding or racing, trembling or shaking, etc.), and ADHD symptoms (e.g., difficult sustaining attention in tasks)." The record reflects that Complainant's mental health was monitored by a psychiatrist and she underwent treatment, including pharmaceuticals, for her mental health conditions throughout the relevant timeframe. Thus, the award amount that the AJ calculated underestimates the extent to which Complainant's symptoms were exacerbated as a result of the denied accommodation and constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our reading of the record indicates that the denial of a reasonable accommodation exacerbated her mental health conditions and amplified Complainant's stressors outside of work, not the other way around. For instance, Complainant withdrew from one of her courses as a result of stress due to working without a reasonable accommodation, decreasing the likelihood that Complainant's status as a full-time student could be blamed for the exacerbation of her depression and anxiety. Considered with the record, the testimonial evidence Complainant provided successfully connects the denials of a reasonable accommodation and resulting constructive discharge to emotional harm and the exacerbation of her mental health conditions, particularly for the period between February and May 2016. The evidence reflects that she withdrew from friends and family, including her children, she avoided social situations, stopped her daily phone conversation with her mother, and lost interest in sex with her husband. Complainant also struggled to eat, a manifestation of her depression and anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The initial October 2015 denial of a reasonable accommodation placed Complainant in a stressful atmosphere for a prolonged amount of time, and, as the AJ put it, set her up for failure. Moreover, as an individual with ADD, the energy and effort required to resume focus on a task after an interruption in an area with numerous interruptions all day, supports Complainant's account of continuous elevated anxiety while at the front desk.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During February and March 2016, the final two months of her employment, Complainant's anxiety and depression were exacerbated, when she was denied a reasonable accommodation again, yet assigned goals that were unrealistic without a reasonable accommodation. The record reflects that Complainant was consumed with meeting the goals, worked diligently, increased her output, and followed the Agency's advice, such as changing her attitude, as evidenced by her positive statements in the weekly meeting records. Without a reasonable accommodation, she fell short every week. Complainant recounts her humiliation at the weekly meetings after working as hard as she could then being told it was not enough. The weekly meetings became a major source of anxiety for Complainant with ongoing effects, including feelings of inadequacy. In two months, Complainant lost 19 pounds, went from a friendly demeanor to rarely smiling, causing coworkers and patients alike to ask her if she was ok. During this time frame, Complainant withdrew from a course almost immediately after she started it because she was concerned she would fail, as work took up so much of her energy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into consideration the relatively short time Complainant held her position, and her initial lack of personal investment, the record still reflects that her constructive discharge caused her emotional distress. Complainant states that she was deeply humiliated, and her depression was exacerbated when, upon her "resignation" she had to go to the front desk and publicly pack her things, with people asking her what happened. The circumstances of the constructive discharge were particularly demoralizing because the Agency essentially rejected Complainant a second time when it rescinded its offer of a lower graded position. Despite her initial attitude of just doing enough to "get by," Complainant was forced to resign after demonstrating dramatic improvement after working as hard as she could for weeks, literally exhausting herself. Under these circumstances, termination for performance issues and denial of an opportunity to keep working at a lower grade for less money would have also been demoralizing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also argues that even though she obtained better paying job two months later (and had access to her husband's health insurance) she was still harmed by her two months of unemployment. At the time of her constructive discharge, Complainant was not in a secure financial position, so her debt increased. She could not afford medical bills, and she received demanding calls and letters from credit card companies and a notice from an attorney that her debts were passed on to a collection agency. The financial stress exacerbated Complainant's anxiety and depression and put a strain on her marriage. She said she and her husband verbally fought, and it became a struggle to stay calm when talking to him or their children.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also establishes that once she started work at her new job, she continued feel the impact of the denied reasonable accommodation, and constructive discharge. The humiliation over the circumstances of her "resignation" followed her, as she felt acutely embarrassed whenever anyone asked about her previous job. Complainant's prior feelings of being constantly on edge, in fear of criticism and losing her job resurfaced when she returned to work, even after receiving satisfactory performance reviews. Complainant also describes a lack of confidence in herself and her work that did not exist prior to the denial of a reasonable accommodation and constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1944"></span>We conclude that $20,000 is an appropriate award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages under the circumstances of this case and considering the emotional harm and exacerbation of Complainant's mental health conditions that resulted from both the denial of a reasonable accommodation and the constructive discharge. This award is not motivated by passion or prejudice, not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and is consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="italic">See Wagner v.
