<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-44"><span class="space">H.</span> EXPUNGEMENT OF RECORDS--"CLEAN PAPER" AGREEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many settlement agreements involve the cancelation or rescission of an agency action. However, the Commission draws a distinction between rescission of an action and expungement of the record involving that action. In any settlement that cancels or rescinds a personnel action, the parties should specifically address the issue of what happens to the existing records of that action. Similar issues also arise in so-called "clean paper" agreements where, at part of the settlement, the complainant agrees to resign in lieu of removal. Clean paper agreements also raise issues to what prospective employers seeking references can be told. Agreements should be highly specific as to how the agency will respond to such inquiries and who such inquiries will be directed to.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Forrester v. Postmaster General</span>, 05890368 (1989), the settlement agreement called for the agency to rescind a letter of warning and suspension. The complainant alleged that the agency breached the agreement by not expunging all records of the warning and suspension and by attempting to introduce evidence of the actions at a subsequent arbitration hearing. He also alleged the agency breached the agreement by referring to the actions in an investigative report involving a subsequent EEO complaint. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Forrester</span> found the agreement did not specifically call for the expungement of agency records:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, as noted above, the agency's agreement to rescind the LOW and suspension constituted an obligation to remove all record of the actions from appellant's OPF and to severely restrain the use of such records. The Commission agrees that the LOW and suspension should not have been cited in the Report of Investigation promulgated around May 1985. However, the Commission believes that the agency would not violate the settlement agreement if its records of the LOW and suspension are only collaterally used for historical purposes, such as in an accounting of appellant's and the agency's relationship or in compiling a history of appellant's EEO or grievance activities. Collateral use of records, such as EEO or grievance files, for historical purposes is proper; any use of such records for disciplinary purposes is not....</p>
<p class="noindent">In a previous complaint, the Commission found that the employee was not aggrieved by the agency's attempt to use evidence of the actions at the arbitration hearing because the arbitrator declined to admit the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Forrester v. Postmaster General</span>, 05860008 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, if the agency does agree to expunge disciplinary actions then it must remove all documents that reflect the actions from the complainant's personnel file, not just the documents officially effecting the action. The Commission found that the agency violated a settlement provision to expunge suspensions from complainant's file when it failed to remove all documents that mentioned the suspensions from the complainant's personnel file in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976313 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1 of the settlement agreement dictated an agency obligation to expunge "all two suspension actions taken" against appellant. The record reflects that the suspension actions were expunged. However, upon appellant's resignation from agency employment in June 1997, appellant discovered the existence of a memorandum in her Official Personnel Folder, dated May 28, 1996, that made reference to the two suspensions. The agency argues that the memorandum is not a "suspension document" and that the settlement agreement does not require that all references to the suspensions be expunged, merely that the two suspension actions be expunged from appellant's Official Personnel Folder. We find, however, that a reasonable interpretation of provision 1 would require expungement of the suspension actions, as well as any references to the suspension actions from other sources. We find, however, that to the extent that the agency breached provision 1 by its failure to expunge the memorandum of May 28, 1996, that breach has been cured. We specifically note that the agency has indicated that upon notification of appellant's objection to the presence of the May 28, 1996 memorandum in her Official Personnel Folder, the memorandum was removed.</p>

Secretary of Army</span>, 0120152467 (2017) (settlement provision that "any and all disciplinary records" will be purged from the complainant's OPF followed by a specific list of documents to be purged "did not negate the requirement to purge all records and related documents that had the purpose of establishing an alleged misconduct record to discipline Complainant."); <span class="Italic">Hottle v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120130135 (2013) (agreement to allow complainant to resign for medical reasons in "good standing" precluded any mention in OPF of resignation in lieu of involuntary action).</p>
<p class="noindent">The existence of records and their permitted uses, if any, are items that should be addressed in any settlement agreement involving an adverse employment action. Complainants are well advised to seek expungement of such records. If any records are to continue in existence after settlement, then the parties should specifically address what records will be kept, where they will be kept, who has access to such records and the uses that are permitted and prohibited.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A22612 (2002), the Commission found that an agreement to purge all disciplinary actions from the complainant's personnel file was violated when her supervisor testified at an MSPB hearing that the basis for a demotion was her past suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Keller v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A51768 (2006), the Commission found that the agency was not in breach where the agreement specified from which files references to a demotion and reassignment would be expunged, but the agency did not expunge references of those actions from past performance appraisals. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Keller</span> noted that "[i]f complainant wanted the agency to guarantee anything further, such as the agency placing amended performance evaluations in her personnel files, she was free to negotiate with the agency to include other provisions into the settlement agreement."</p>
<p class="noindent">As a tactical matter, complainants may not want to oppose the admission of evidence of prior disciplinary actions that have been rescinded, where it <span id="Page_368"></span>can be shown that the agency relied upon that past discipline in assessing an enhanced penalty for a present offense. In such cases, a complainant could succeed in having the present penalty mitigated by virtue of an agency's improper reliance on past discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Talbott v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05950382 (1996), the Commission held that the agency's agreement to "destroy" documents imposed upon it an obligation beyond merely removing them from the complainant's file:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the plain, ordinary meaning of the phrase "remove and destroy" would appear to indicate to the reader that all items to be removed from appellant's 971 file under the agreement would also be destroyed. The plain meaning of the term "destroy" clearly prevents an interpretation that would permit those documents "destroyed" under the agreement to be copied and thereafter reemerge whole in other agency files. Therefore, we find that to the extent that the agency has subsequently placed any of the documents that it has removed from appellant's 971, in other agency files, it must destroy them in order to comply with item 2(a) of the settlement agreement. Therefore, we will reconsider the previous decision in order to direct the agency, if it has not already done so, to fully comply with item 2(a) of the agreement by destroying any such documents.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Howard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961824 (1997), the Commission found that the agency breached a settlement agreement that provided, in pertinent part, "[e]ffective the signing of this agreement the Letter of Warning dated September 30, 1993, and issued on October 4, 1993, will be rescinded, [and] removed from the complainant's official files and records and will not be cited in any future disciplinary action." The Commission found that the agency breached the settlement agreement when it cited the letter in a notice of removal, and that the agency improperly denied the appellant's request to reinstate her complaint for further processing. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Howard</span> rejected the agency's position that the subsequent removal of the letter rendered the complaint moot. The only issue germane to the instant decision was whether the agency breached the agreement, not the agency's actions after the breach.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dupuich v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120073901 (2007), the Commission found that the agency was in breach of a settlement agreement where it agreed to expunge the complainant's personnel file of a proposed removal, last chance settlement agreement and suspension, but then left copies of those documents on a nonsupervisor's desk in plain view. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dupuich</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the agency argues that although the agreement said that the documents would be expunged from personnel files, it had no language which prohibited the agency from retaining copies. The Commission is unpersuaded by this argument. A simple reading of the agreement says the documents will be expunged, meaning removed. To that extent, by expunging the documents, the agency was agreeing to not use the documents. For the agency to argue that it removed the documents from her personnel files but retained copies and left them in plain view defeats the purpose of the agreement and is evidence of bad faith. The Commission has previously found that an agency's bad faith in implementing a settlement agreement constituted a breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Todd v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950169 (June 12, 1997);<span class="Italic"> Wong v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05931097 (April 29, 1994); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910632 (September 9, 1991). As such, the agency has breached the settlement agreement and is ordered to comply with the order set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency, however, is not required to notify the complainant in writing that the records have been expunged unless the settlement agreement specifically provides for such notification. <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01972651 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Patel v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01971929 (1998), the Commission found the agency breached a settlement agreement where it merely "whited out" a prior unsatisfactory rating and drew a line through the description of performance that accompanied the rating. Finding the intent of the agreement was to expunge the rating, the Commission had little difficulty in determining that the agency's actions in fact drew attention to the prior rating. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Aaron v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05A10038 (2001), the Commission found the agency breached a settlement agreement that raised the complainant's performance rating from "fully successful" to "highly successful" where it lined out the "fully successful" rating and made notation next to the "highly successful" rating space. The Commission also found the agency violated both the letter and spirit of the agreement by not changing the ratings on individual performance elements to be compatible with the "highly successful" rating.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Brindle v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994615 (2001), the parties entered into a settlement agreement with the following provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Management will accept Ms. Brindle's resignation. Her PS 50 will reflect resignation in lieu of termination. Ms. Brindle will provide [the Postmaster] a letter of resignation within five (5) days.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a move that was either blatantly underhanded or stupid beyond belief, the agency then copied the settlement agreement verbatim on the PS 50 to state "resignation in lieu of termination," and the complainant alleged that this was a breach. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brindle</span> agreed that there was a breach, finding that the agency's actions clearly circumvented the plain meaning of the settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it is true that the agreement stated that the PS 50 would reflect "resignation in lieu of termination" and the agency took those words verbatim from the settlement and inserted them into complainant's PS 50, that agency action does not comply with the plain meaning of the agreement as written. The phrase "resignation in lieu of termination" was not written into the agreement within quotation marks. Absent the existence of quotation marks, the plain meaning of those words is that the PS 50 would reflect the word "resignation" in place of, or instead of, the word "termination." Therefore, as the record reflects that the agency did not replace "termination" with "resignation" on complainant's PS 50, the agency is in breach of the settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency, in a settlement agreement, withdraws a removal in exchange for a voluntary resignation, the subsequent disclosure of the previous removal violates the settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. Postmaster General</span>, 01974730 (1998), the Commission found that the agency breached a settlement agreement that changed the complainant's removal to a voluntary resignation when, after the complainant was rehired by the agency, it subsequently removed him for lying on his employment application. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Nguyen</span> looked to the intent of the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 26, 1995, appellant and the agency entered into a settlement agreement to resolve appellant's formal EEO complaint. The agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Notice of Removal dated August 17, 1994, and issued to [appellant] on August 19, 1994, for Falsification of PS Form 2591 will be removed from his Official Personnel Folder and [appellant] will complete a Notice of Resignation to take it's [sic] place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that after appellant entered into the settlement agreement with the Santa Clarita Post office, he was hired by the Carpinteria Post Office, By letter dated April 22, 1996, appellant was removed from his position at the Carpinteria Post Office for falsification of his application for employment. The letter stated that appellant had lied when asked about his reasons for resigning from his position at the Santa Clarita Post Office. When asked the reason for his resignation, appellant stated that he had resigned so that he could return to Vietnam to take care of his mother.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances, we find that the agency has breached the settlement agreement. The record reflects that appellant submitted a resignation indicating that he was resigning from the Santa Clarita Post Office for "personal reasons," and his PS Form 50 was revised to reflect such. We note, however, that appellant was subsequently removed by the Carpinteria Post Office for lying about his reasons for leaving the Santa Clarita Post Office when he stated that he had resigned so that he could return to Vietnam to take care of his mother. Thus, management officials at the Carpinteria Post Office were apparently notified that appellant's resignation from the Santa Clarita Post Office was involuntary, and not merely for "personal reasons." We find that the disclosure of such information constitutes a breach of the settlement agreement because the intent of the agreement was to change appellant's personnel record and employment history to reflect that appellant's resignation from the Santa Clarita Post Office was for "personal reasons."</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Nguyen</span> case implicitly sets forth the Commission's view on a difficult question: what is the effect of a settlement agreement that rescinds a disciplinary action? The question becomes important when, after such an agreement, the employee must answer questions on job applications that inquire about previous removals or disciplinary actions. Based on the <span class="Italic">Nguyen</span> case, the Commission views such agreements as making the prior disciplinary action a legal nullity. In other words, from a legal standpoint the prior disciplinary action never happened. Clearly, that is the better view. Otherwise, such agreements make no sense from the employee's perspective.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Horton v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120403 (2002), the Commission determined that the agency did not breach an agreement calling for the agency to remove the letter of termination from the agency files and provide two letters of reference. The complainant maintained the agency breached the agreement when the agency released information to his new employing agency indicating that he was previously terminated from his job and barred from the facility. "To the extent that complainant interpreted the settlement agreement to prohibit the agency from disseminating information regarding his March 20, 2000 barment letter, such interpretation should have been reduced to writing a part of the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Eby v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120120698 (2013), the Commission found that the agency breached an agreement where the complainant agreed to resign for "Professional Opportunities" and "Personal Reasons." The agreement further provided that the terms and conditions of the agreement could be confidential, that all disciplinary actions <span id="Page_369"></span>would be expunged from the complainant's OPF, as would three annual performance appraisals. The complainant's supervisor then made several statements in response to an inquiry about complainant from another agency where she was a job candidate that revealed the existence of an agreement, indicated that the complainant resigned to deal with a family health issue and to "try something different," indicating he could not comment as to whether he would reemploy the complainant or on her reliability and dependability. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Eby</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the Chief's actions constituted breach of the settlement agreement. As to the issue of confidentiality, we find that the Chief did not explicitly state that Complainant had filed an EEO complaint and that the matter was resolved by the settlement agreement. However, the Chief clearly made an indication that there was a document that negotiated with Complainant which provided a written record of her letter of reference. We find that this statement in addition to the responses given to the FDA Official did not stay true to the confidentiality provision which limited the Agency's disclosure of the agreement to those officials who are needed to take action provided within the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as to the statements provided by the Chief, we find that they exceeded the provisions within the settlement agreement. For example, the settlement agreement stated that the reasons for Complainant's resignation were "Professional Opportunities" and "Personal Reasons." We note that the Chief's statement about family illness and his subsequent failure to comment on Complainant's "dependability" lead to a negative comment about Complainant's reasons for her resignation. In addition, the Chief was asked about Complainant's work performance. He could have merely stated that she was "fully successful" as stated in her performance appraisal as provided in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement allowed the Chief to provide information regarding Complainant's entry on duty date with the Agency; official position...; and date of resignation. Further, the Chief could have provided information that was within the letter of reference which was attached to the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Eby</span> case highlights another problem with agreements calling for expungement of records and terms about disclosure, which is the remedy for breach. Although the complainant requested reinstatement of her complaint as a remedy, in <span class="Italic">Eby</span>, the Commission found that was not possible:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agreement itself has a provision regarding breach by the Agency. The agreement provides that if Complainant wishes to continue the processing of the EEO complaint settled by the agreement, the parties must be returned to the <span class="Italic">Status Quo Ante</span>. We note that Complainant has requested reinstatement of the EEO complaint. However, if the parties return to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, Complainant would have to return to her former position; return $4,000.00 in attorney's fees; and would not receive the administrative leave provided in the settlement agreement. Therefore, we shall give Complainant the option to seek reinstatement of her EEO complaint. As there is no cure to the breach by the Agency and the Chief's reference, we note that if Complainant does not seek reinstatement, Complainant may pursue a claim of retaliation against the Chief for his reference.</p>
<p class="noindent">In other words, the only real remedy was a new complaint of retaliation. See also sections below on "<a href="0100-2023-14-045.html#sec5-45">Employment References</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-14-079.html#sec5-79">Remedies for Failure of Agency to Comply</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agreement calls for the expungement of records, it is not a violation of the agreement for the agency to retain a copy of the document that was provided by the complainant to the EEO counselor in its EEO files. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A22604 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">At a minimum, it is a good idea in settlement to specify what will become of any documents regarding actions that are being rescinded.</p>
