<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-120"><span class="space">14.</span> Light or Limited Duty</h4>
<p class="noindent">Reassigning an employee to a light or limited duty position, on either a temporary or permanent basis, can be a reasonable accommodation. But it is not a panacea for reasonable accommodation and it does not eradicate the agency's obligation to consider what accommodation or accommodations are reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jones v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880468 (1988), the Commission found the agency's "knee jerk" response of placing the complainant in a light duty status actually imposed a hardship on the employee. The complainant in that case suffered from hypoglycemia, which was controlled through diet. (As the Commission noted, when a person suffers from hypoglycemia, his or her blood sugar rises after meals, an oversecretion of insulin occurs, and the person then suffers a fall in blood glucose level between two to four hours after meals. Symptoms include headaches, blackouts, blurred vision, incoherent speech and bizarre behavior.) The complainant's diet required that she eat five meals between 6:30 am and 6:00 pm.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result of her condition, the complainant requested that the agency rearrange her break schedule so she could eat a snack when required to work more than eight hours. Her doctor later revised this to a nine-hour shift. The agency in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> declined the request for accommodation and, instead, placed the complainant on light duty status where she received no overtime:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has presented the policy of placing every employee who has a medical condition which restricts an employee from any aspect of his or her position requirements on light duty as an accommodation. In actuality, as in this case, such a policy can impose a hardship on the employee to whom it is applied, and will have an adverse effect on qualified handicapped employees such as the appellant. We find that if the agency is going to disqualify a qualified handicapped individual from opportunities for overtime which she may otherwise enjoy, the agency must show that it would be an undue hardship to accommodate the individual's handicap. <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; 29 CFR 1613.704. The agency has made no showing that it would have been a hardship to accommodate appellant, because of her handicap, by carrying her as a regular duty employee with a restriction of nine hours per work shift. The record shows that agency employees regularly, if not always, worked nine hours shifts. The record of appellant's overtime between the hearing in this case and the time of appellant's appeal shows that the appellant could work overtime with no hardship on the agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The accommodation of which we speak would be, in effect, a form of job restructuring or modified work schedule. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.704(b). In this way, appellant could have been reasonably accommodated without suffering the adverse consequences of being in a light duty status. While placing an employee in a lighty [sic] duty status can be a form of reasonable accommodation, it is not necessarily the only form of accommodation in every situation; likewise, providing reasonable accommodation should not automatically trigger light duty status in all situations.</p>
<p class="noindent">As relief, the agency was ordered to calculate the complainant's lost overtime and compensate her for it.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not easy to determine where the Commission draws the line between required job restructuring and temporary light duty assignments. However, at least under certain circumstances, an agency will not be required to restructure a job in such a way that it becomes a permanent light duty assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, where an agency has an established program of placing disabled employees on temporary light duty while it searches for a permanent accommodation, it is not required to make such temporary positions permanent. In <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03930116 (1993), the Commission rejected an argument that the complainant was entitled to a permanent light duty assignment, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner also contended that the agency could have allowed her to continue in her light duty assignment as a messenger. Testimony established that the agency had implemented a system by which it attempted to accommodate the physical restrictions of medically disqualified employees and to locate other positions to which they could be reassigned. If the agency was unsuccessful in locating another position, it then would terminate the employee. Testimony established that the amount of time that an employee spent in the SPWC depended on the employee's medical restrictions and qualifications, and also on the number and type of positions available for light duty assignments. The Commission finds that requiring the agency to continue petitioner in her light duty assignment on a permanent or indefinite basis would disrupt its system--thereby impeding its ability to accommodate other medically disqualified employees--and create an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that in the <span class="Italic">Harris</span> case the agency provided evidence establishing that if the light duty assignments were required to become permanent, it would have impacted on the overall ability of the agency to accommodate disabled employees. The result could be substantially different if an agency was not able to establish efforts to locate a permanent accommodation while the employee is temporarily assigned to light duty.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant temporarily performs a "set of miscellaneous tasks," this is not a permanent position and the agency is not required to permanently assign those tasks as a reassignment position. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Saul v. Postmaster General</span>, 01970693 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted in our prior decision remanding this case, the determination of whether an individual with a disability is "qualified" is not limited to the position actually held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held as a result of reassignment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Commerce,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03930019 (July 16, 1993). However, under the Rehabilitation Act, an agency is not required to create a position to fit complainant's medical restrictions<span class="Italic">. Manago v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03940067 (May 26, 1994). The agency is only required to offer complainant reassignment to a vacant position for which she is qualified, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> able to perform the essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. McQueen v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03930006 (May 26, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a careful review of the record, we affirm the FAD's finding that complainant's lower back disability precluded her from performing the essential functions of a rural letter carrier, with or without accommodation, and we note that this finding is not disputed by complainant. Furthermore, we agree with the FAD that the limited duty assignment complainant held prior to her termination was not an existing "position" at the Mannford Post Office, regardless of how useful the work was to the operation of the facility, as noted by the Postmaster in her affidavit. In fact, the Personnel Specialist specifically attests that complainant did not perform the core functions of any position during this time, but merely a set of miscellaneous tasks. According to the affidavits of both the Postmaster and the Personnel Specialist, when complainant was terminated, her duties were simply reassigned back to the other employees at the Post Office. In other words, her termination did not create a vacant position as it would have if she had held a funded position at the Mannford Post Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the four-hour-per-day split schedule which was offered to complainant was not an actual position, but rather, as stated in the offer, a proposal of "limited duty work" to continue "into the future pending [complainant's] recovery or the needs of the service." Although the duties are listed in the offer, and a schedule is presented, there is no position description or salary included in the offer, and it is clear from the record that these duties did not comprise an existing reserved limited duty position, but rather had been culled specifically for the purpose of providing complainant with work in the circumstances. The two-hour per day schedule, and the subsequent four-hour-per-day split schedule, were designed solely to accommodate complainant's disability, and were not actual "positions" at the Mannford Post Office. When complainant did not accept the four-hour-per-day offer, it did not result in a vacant position at the Mannford Post Office, but rather the tasks were redistributed to the existing positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the foregoing finding that there was no existing vacant position the essential functions of which complainant could perform with or without accommodation, we do not reach the issue of whether or not complainant should have been granted the two-hour-per-day schedule which she sought as an accommodation. The agency was not obligated to consider part-time work as an accommodation where such an accommodation would have required the agency to create a position consisting of the duties complainant sought to perform. Accordingly, this case is distinguishable from cases where an individual with a disability seeks to perform her currently-held position or an existing vacant position on a part-time basis as an accommodation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act</span> (March 1, 1999) at question 22.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Major D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019005750 (2021) (complainant did not demonstrate he is a qualified individual with disability where his increased physical limitations relegated him to being able only to case mail for two hours a day even with an accommodation; "The Rehabilitation Act does not require the Agency to consider accommodating complainant's restrictions by creating a 'make work' assignment because such an assignment is not a vacant, funded position.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McMullin v. Postmaster General</span>, 03930144 (1993), the Commission also rejected an argument that a temporary light duty assignment should have been the complainant's permanent accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner asserts that the agency should have reassigned him to the tasks which he performed while on limited duty in the North Pecos Station in 1984. Although it is undisputed that petitioner successfully performed his assigned duties, testimony established that these tasks were a compilation of duties normally performed by the supervisors or other employees. Agency officials uniformly testified that there was no specific position which encompassed the duties which petitioner <span id="Page_1385"></span>performed and that there was no need to create a position to perform these duties exclusively. In essence, these duties were culled from other positions to give petitioner work to do. Other testimony established that at least some of these tasks now are performed by computer, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, truck cards and vehicle utilization reports. The Commission notes that the Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to create a new position to accommodate an employee's disabling condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although not specifically articulated by the Commission in these decisions, it is likely that the difference between job restructuring and light duty revolves around the issue of the essential functions of a position. If an agency can restructure a job in such a way that the employee can perform the essential functions of the job, then it will probably be required to do so as a form of reasonable accommodation. But, the agency likely will not be required to create light duty assignments that either do not encompass the present essential duties of the employee's position, or that encompass duties that could be performed more efficiently in other ways.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency must consider accommodations beyond assigning the employee to a permanent light-duty position. In <span class="Italic">Sandberg v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952301 (1997), the Commission held, "what the agency is attempting to do is equate accommodating appellant in a carrier position with assigning her to a permanent light duty position. We find that the two options are unrelated, and that accommodating appellant in a carrier position was clearly not tantamount to reassigning her into a permanent light duty position." In a footnote, the Commission further held that the agency did not fulfill its obligation to consider reasonable accommodation solely by considering the employee for a permanent light-duty position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990280 (2002), the Commission found it was not discrimination where the collective bargaining agreement provided "rehabilitation positions" outside the competitive bidding process for employees injured on the job and permanently unable to perform their former duties, but precluded those employees from bidding on "light duty" jobs for employees who were ill or injured and temporarily unable to perform their positions. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Marshall</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ's decision is erroneous as a matter of law. The record indicates that most jobs at the agency are competitive bid positions (assigned by seniority). There are also, as the AJ found, rehabilitation positions, which are positions outside the competitive bidding process, given to employees who, because of on-the-job injuries or illnesses, are permanently unable to perform the full duties of a regular position. In addition, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) refers to "light duty assignments," which appears to be the term for duties which are performed by injured or ill employees, who are not necessarily permanently unable to perform the full duties of a regular position and were not necessarily injured at work. The CBA notes that these light duty assignments are not part of the competitive bidding system.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that the agency's practice of refusing to allow rehabilitation employees such as complainants to bid on positions without "giving up the protection of their rehabilitation positions" violated the Rehabilitation Act. While the AJ's choice of language is somewhat imprecise, a review of complainants' claims and the record as a whole indicates that complainants' contention is that they were not allowed to use their seniority to bid on positions with better days off and/or more favorable assignments which were held by other light duty employees with less seniority. Complainants contended in their affidavits that other similarly situated light duty employees were given or permitted to keep positions with favorable rest days and favorable assignments, despite the fact that these other light duty employees had less seniority than complainants did, and that this treatment was discriminatory. The AJ's factual finding that the agency's policy did in fact prevent complainants from bidding on positions with more favorable rest days and/or preferable assignments without giving up their rehabilitation positions is supported by substantial evidence. Documentary and testimonial evidence establishes that rehabilitation employees, such as complainants, were not permitted to bid on any light duty assignment, including rehabilitation positions, but instead, could only bid on those positions opened to all employees for bidding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the AJ's legal determination to the contrary, however, the agency's practice of refusing to allow rehabilitation employees to bid on light duty assignments does not violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, first, that there is no evidence that complainants were subjected to disparate treatment when this policy was applied to them, as the record establishes that the agency disallowed all employees from bidding on light duty assignments. The CBA placed these assignments outside the normal bidding process. Accordingly, complainants were treated the same as all of their co-workers when they were not allowed to use their seniority to obtain the rest days and assignments that junior employees on light duty held, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> no employee, regardless of seniority or status as an individual with a disability, was permitted to bid on a light duty assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor did complainants establish that they were denied a reasonable accommodation when this policy was applied to them. Complainants did not argue, nor does the record establish, that the policy at issue failed to provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities who successfully bid on a position open for bidding, but needed a reasonable accommodation in order to perform the duties of that position. Indeed, the AJ found that all employees, including rehabilitation employees, are permitted to bid on any position within their limitations and that finding is supported by substantial evidence, as noted above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the AJ's legal determination that the policy had a disparate impact on qualified individuals with disabilities is without support. Under the Rehabilitation Act, a qualification standard, test, or other selection criteria that screens out or tends to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, on the basis of a disability, is unlawful, unless it is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.10. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from job opportunities unless they are actually unable to do the job<span class="Italic">. See</span> Appendix to Part 1630--Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 1630.10. Here, the AJ determined that all employees, including complainants, were permitted to bid on any position within their limitations open for bidding. This finding is supported by substantial evidence, as documentary and testimonial evidence establishes that all employees were permitted to bid on jobs within the bidding process, but none were permitted to bid on light duty assignments. Accordingly, the policy in question does not exclude individuals with disabilities from job opportunities. It simply provides that no employee, whether or not an individual with a disability, may bid on a light duty assignment and that every employee may bid on any other position and have a year to qualify for that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, after a careful review of the record, including complainant's arguments on appeal, and arguments and evidence not specifically discussed in this decision, we find that complainant's failed to establish that they were subjected to disability-based discrimination and hereby AFFIRM the FAD.</p>
