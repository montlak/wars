<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-15"><span class="space">6.</span> Temporary Accommodations</h4>
<p class="noindent">The interactive process can take time whether it be because the agency is trying to understand the complainant's needs or procure the necessary equipment/resources for said accommodation. Agencies may, in the interim, provide <span id="Page_1271"></span>a temporary accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harvey G. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 2022000813 (2022) (delay in providing accommodation did not violate the Rehabilitation Act where parties were waiting to better understand what was necessary by way of accommodation until after the complainant's surgery, and the agency provided temporary accommodations until that time).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency grants an employee with a disability a temporary accommodation, such as a shift change or light duty that does not relieve the agency of its obligation to provide a permanent accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Frick v. USPS</span>, 01852127 (1987), the agency accommodated appellant's mental disability by temporarily switching him to the day shift. Sixteen months later, the agency terminated the appellant on the basis that the accommodation was temporary, appellant still was unable to work nights, and the accommodation did not constitute light duty since he was performing the same duties on the day shift. The Commission found the agency failed to demonstrate that conversion of the accommodation to permanent status would be an undue hardship--the only criterion which relieves an agency of its obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency also does not fulfill its accommodation obligation by telling an employee he is not required to perform an essential function of his position on occasions when his disability makes it difficult or impossible. <span class="Italic">Wiley v. USPS</span>, 01860672 (1987). In that case, the appellant, who suffered from an arm injury, was told that he would not have to sort mail when his arm hurt. The Commission found this was not reasonable accommodation because it prevented the employee from enjoying such employment benefits as overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has consistently held that an agency is not required to create a permanent position as part of its reasonable accommodation efforts. However, that does not mean that the agency has no obligation to make position accommodations. In <span class="Italic">Tavarozzi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942481 (1996), the Commission found that the agency had not demonstrated that it would be an undue hardship to keep the complainant in his temporary light duty position. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Tavarozzi</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency has no duty to create a new position for an employee in order to satisfy the Rehabilitation Act's requirement for reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. See Paul F. Owens v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03930129 (December 17, 1993); <span class="Italic">John W. Justice v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920067 (June 9, 1992); <span class="Italic">Charles W. Smith v. Dep't of Defense (Defense Mapping Agency)</span>, EEOC Request No. 03920009 (December 31, 1991); <span class="Italic">James C. Cadarette v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880112 (July 30, 1990) at n.3; <span class="Italic">Jessie Stots v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03830030 (July 28, 1987); <span class="Italic">See generally</span> EEOC Technical Assistance Manual on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 9.4 (January 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While federal law does not require that an agency create a new position for a disabled individual, the agency must consider reassignment to a vacant position which the individual is qualified to perform<span class="Italic">. See Mitchell v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03930164 (January 21, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With these principles in mind, we address the facts presented before us herein. In doing so, we note that appellant has repeatedly asserted that the agency must, in order to demonstrate that it has met its responsibility under the Rehabilitation Act to provide reasonable accommodation, demonstrate why the creation of an additional permanent light duty position in the postage due unit in which he can be placed would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. However, in view of the Commission precedent previously cited, we find that the agency herein is clearly not required to create an additional such permanent light duty position for appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In doing so, however, we decline to base our ruling on the agency's repeated claim that the creation of such a permanent light duty position would require it to violate the collective bargaining agreement between the mailhandler's union and agency management, in that the local agreement does not provide for a specific number of such positions to be created. Even a casual reading of the provision cited by the agency does not support this interpretation of the cited provision, in that the agreement plainly includes explicit procedures for requesting that such positions be created.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we have found that the agency had no duty under the Rehabilitation Act to create a new position for appellant, this finding does not end our inquiry. Our holding in this respect, by no means relieves the agency of its responsibility, as previously advised in EEOC Appeal No. 01930804, to provide "absolute and continuing" accommodation to appellant, "until and unless doing so becomes an undue hardship." EEOC Appeal No. 01930804, p. 8. In order to meet this obligation under the facts presented herein, the agency had the duty to consider both accommodation of appellant in his present assignment through modification of his position (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span> temporary light duty work) or reassignment to a vacant position which appellant was qualified to perform. The record indicates that the agency's Manager of Employment and Development attempted to locate a vacant permanent position within appellant's restrictions in the Providence area and at numerous other facilities in April of 1991, but was unsuccessful. While the agency's reassignment efforts were apparently unavailing, the expanded record indicates that work within appellant's medical restrictions in the form of temporary light duty has been available in the postage due unit on a continuing basis since the agency's direction to appellant on February 27, 1991, to clock out because of an unfavorable OWCP determination and the denial of his January 1991 request for permanent light duty. The agency has made no clear showing that the continuing provision of such assignments to appellant during this time period, without the creation of a permanent position, would have imposed an undue hardship on its operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the GMF Manager asserted at the administrative hearing in this matter that he repeatedly offered appellant temporary light duty throughout the processing of his EEO complaint, appellant correctly points out that the credibility of this witness has already been questioned by the Commission's AJ in his Recommended Decision. Moreover, the record herein corroborates appellant's assertion that the offers of temporary light duty cited by this official which were made at the EEO Counseling, investigative and informal adjustment levels of complaint processing, were always expressly conditioned upon the withdrawal of appellant's complaint and upon a favorable OWCP decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most significantly, the GMF Manager's undated letter to appellant (circa February 1991) which denied his request for light duty, was not specifically limited to the denial of a permanent light duty assignment, but instead clearly denied all light duty to appellant. Appellant has further credibly asserted that any early offers of temporary light duty from this official were expressly conditioned upon his withdrawal, through his physician, of his request for a permanent light duty assignment. Our careful reading of the record herein, indicates that the agency's present assertion, made after the fact by agency officials who were not clearly involved in the matter adjudicated herein, that appellant would have been afforded temporary light duty if he had merely requested it through the correct form, is wholly incredible. Therefore, we find that the agency's failure to make it clear that appellant could unconditionally remain at work in a temporary light duty capacity from February 27, 1991 until May 27, 1992 constitutes a failure to reasonably accommodate appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The circumstances under which the agency can terminate such a temporary, light duty accommodation are not clear. Presumably, it would be required to show that continuing the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, granting a temporary accommodation is not necessarily deemed the denial of a permanent accommodation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Matthews v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120083232 (2008), the complainant sought an accommodation in the form of an exemption from the plant manager's policy that supervisors wear ties. The complainant maintained he was unable to wear ties because of his panic disorder. The agency granted the complainant a temporary accommodation in the form a 60-day exemption from the policy at which time the situation would be reevaluated. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Matthews</span>, rejected the complainant's contention that the accommodation was not reasonable because it was only temporary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that complainant established he is a qualified individual with a disability, the Commission finds that complainant has not demonstrated that the agency did not provide him with a reasonable accommodation. The record shows that the agency offered to exempt complainant from the tie policy for a two-month period and consider the accommodation options available at the end of this period. Complainant argues that the temporary nature of the proposed accommodation was unreasonable because his panic disorder was permanent, and that at the end of the sixty-day period, complainant would not be permitted to wear a tie.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the record supports complainant's contention that the agency would definitively not have extended the exemption, or that the parties would not have agreed on any other proposed accommodation. Complainant himself suggests in his brief that one possible accommodation was to reassign and train him to supervise employees in a building that was not under the senior plant supervisor. Nothing in the record suggests that the agency would have rejected this, or any other proposed accommodation at the end of the sixty-day temporary exemption period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously determined that temporary accommodations can nevertheless be effective accommodations. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A23896 (November 12, 2003), the complainant, who was experiencing stress or depression, asked the agency to accommodate his request to work in a low stress environment where he did not have to interact with people who were likely to treat him in a hostile fashion or had done so in the past. The agency temporarily assigned the complainant to a project that removed him from working with the individuals he claimed caused him stress. The Commission found that the temporary assignment, which removed the complainant from working with the individuals causing him stress, amounted to an effective accommodation. In this case, the Commission finds that the agency's proposed accommodation to temporarily exempt <span id="Page_1272"></span>complainant from the tie policy for sixty-days and to consider other options afterwards to be an effective accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120132519 (2013), the Commission found that the agency's temporary provision of a wooden access ramp was not a denial of accommodation where the agency was working to have a permanent concrete ramp approved.</p>
