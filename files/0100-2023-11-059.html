<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-59"><span class="space">2.</span> Nexus Requirement</h4>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC looks at three factors to determine whether there is sufficient nexus for a continuing violation: (1) the acts should involve the same basis of discrimination; (2) the acts should be recurring in nature, as opposed separate and distinct; and (3) the acts should have a level of permanence that is so severe that the continued consequences of the acts are to be expected without being dependent on a continuing intent to discriminate. <span class="Italic">See Qualls v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01943622 (1994); <span class="Italic">Khalil v. USPS</span>, 01842045 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is often difficult to determine the difference between a series of similar, but unrelated, complaints which do not constitute a continuing violation and interrelated acts which do. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01913694 (1991), the Commission endeavored to elaborate on that distinction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, the essential ingredient is the interrelatedness of the past and present acts and not simply any similarity between them. The question thus becomes whether this relationship exists between the pertinent acts involved in each of [appellant's] allegations of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 469 F. Supp. at 27. Most importantly, in order to support a finding of a continuous violation, [appellant] must do more than show a series of unrelated and isolated instances of discrimination. She must prove a series of continuous violations constituting an organized scheme leading to a present violation. <span class="Italic">Berry v. Board of Supervisors of L.S.U.</span> 715 F.2d 971, 981 (5th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the agency's representation, the appellant alleged that she had been discriminated against as a result of her race when (1) she returned to work as a GS-4 while the white male employee returned as a GS-5; (2) unlike the white male, she was denied a steady shift; and (3) she was denied equally divided holidays in favor of the white male.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that appellant had been aware of the evidence to support allegation (1) since June 14, 1988. However, appellant assets that she was not aware of the acts alleged to be discriminatory until close to the time she contacted an EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, it appears that appellant has alleged a continuing violation. Simply, to allege a continuing violation, appellant only has to allege a series of related acts, at least one of which occurred within the thirty-day period preceding the initial EEO Counselor contact. The agency agrees that allegations (2) and (3) are timely. It is clear that all three allegations are interrelated as to the preferential treatment afforded the white male employee. Therefore, the Commission finds that there is a sufficient nexus to waive the time requirements for allegation (1) and consolidate all three allegations for processing.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Staley v. Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 05920763 (1993), the Commission further explained the essential requirement that the incidents be interrelated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the record shows, and appellant does not dispute, that allegations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 11 were not brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor within thirty calendar days as required by the Commission's Regulations. However, the previous decision accepted appellant's contention that her allegations were a part of a continuing violation, and should be accepted for processing on that basis. A continuing violation may be defined as an ongoing series of related discriminatory acts directed against an employee. When a continuing violation is properly alleged, the normal time limit for filing a formal EEO complaint is suspended. If at least one of the acts complained of falls within the limitations period, a complaint filed at any time within this period is timely for all acts which are part of the continuing violation. <span class="Italic">Clark v. Olinkraft, Inc.</span>, 556 F.2d 1219 (5th Cir. 1977), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 434 U.S. 1069 (1978); <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans</span>, 431 U.S. 553 (1977). In order to establish a continuing violation, like that alleged by appellant, a complainant must show a series of related acts, one or more of which falls within the limitations period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Valentino v. United States Postal Service</span>, 674 F.2d 56 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency accepted two of appellant's allegations, allegations 6 and 7, which were filed in a timely manner. Therefore, the issue is whether the acts which occurred within the thirty day period preceding appellant's initiation of EEO counseling are sufficiently related to the acts which occurred prior to that period and which were rejected by the agency. In <span class="Italic">Tarvesian v. Carr Division of TRW, Inc.</span>, 407 F. Supp. 336, 339-40 (D. Mass. 1976), the court stressed that an essential ingredient of a continuing violation is an analogous theme uniting the alleged discriminatory acts of the employer into a continuous pattern. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Claytor</span>, 469 F. Supp. 22 (D.D.C. 1978), the court determined that the interrelatedness between the past and present acts complained of was essential in order to establish a continuing violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission disagrees with the agency's contention that appellant has alleged distinct and isolated incidents of conduct which do not meet the test for a continuing violation. The previous decision reviewed the record and appellant's allegations and found that the allegations listed in appellant's complaint detail a progressive deterioration of conditions in the workplace and a pattern of harassment. A careful reading of the lengthy Report of Counseling reveals that this finding was correct, and that appellant's allegations set forth a pattern of interrelated and discriminatory conduct and harassment against appellant by her immediate supervisor as well as her second-level supervisor, the Chief. The record shows that appellant's supervisor and/or the Chief were named in the allegations as the two agency officials who, separately and together, were engaging in discriminatory actions, on an ongoing basis, against appellant. All of the allegedly discriminatory acts occurred following the placement of appellant's supervisor in that position in approximately December, 1989; however, appellant's specific allegations begin in July, 1990, when a White male was hired as a GS-12 Classifier and appellant's performance was suddenly compared to his in a negative manner. This was followed shortly thereafter by a performance rating which appellant considered inadequate, and allegedly discriminatory treatment when appellant challenged that rating. The Commission, after a careful review of appellant's allegations and the agency's arguments, finds that the allegedly discriminatory acts at issue were sufficiently interrelated such that they should have been accepted for processing as part of a continuing violation. The arguments presented by the agency have not persuaded the Commission that the previous decision was erroneous in this regard. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether a particular act is a discrete personnel practice or part of a series of interrelated events, the Commission focuses on the point in time when the discriminatory act occurred, and not when its consequences become most painful to the complainant. To that end, the Commission has adopted a three-pronged test. The test and its application were explained by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Defense, DIA</span>, 01954099 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a continuing violation exists, the Commission has relied on the decision in <span class="Italic">Berry</span>, wherein the court set forth three relevant factors:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_81"></span>The first is subject matter. Do the alleged acts involve the same type of discrimination, tending to connect them in a continuing violation? The second is frequency. Are the alleged acts recurring (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a biweekly paycheck) or more in the nature of an isolated work assignment or employment decision? The third factor, perhaps of most importance, is degree of permanence. Does the act have the degree of permanence which should trigger an employee's awareness of and duty to assert his or her rights, or which should indicate to the employee that the continued existence of the adverse consequences of the act is to be expected without being dependent on a continuing intent to discriminate?</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Berry</span>, 715 F.2d at 981. Incidents that are sufficiently distinct to trigger the running of the limitations period do not constitute continuing violations<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Miller v. Shawmut Bank</span>, 726 F. Supp. 337, 341 (D. Mass. 1989); <span class="Italic">Cogen v. Milton Bradley Co./Hasbro Inc.</span>, 49 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) &#x00B6; 38,894 (D. Mass 1989). In <span class="Italic">Cogen</span>, the court rejected the plaintiff's attempt to apply the continuing violation theory to, among other allegations, an assignment issue. The court stated that "discrete acts of discrimination taking place at identifiable points in time" are not continuing violations for the purpose of extending the limitations period<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 58,757; <span class="Italic">see also Edinboro v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 704 F. Supp. 364, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (demotion not a continuing violation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first and second allegations of his complaint, the record reveals that in November 1980, appellant was transferred from the Indexing Section to the Transshipping Section, and his job was reclassified. In his third allegation, appellant references several reorganizations and realignments that occurred between 1980 and March 1994, as well as in early 1995. As for allegation 4, the event at issue occurred in December 1992, when pursuant to appellant's request, he was not required to participate in the SV-3 job cross-training program. The record indicates that appellant did not contact an EEO Counselor with regard to these incidents until November 21, 1994. This contact was clearly after the expiration of the relevant limitation period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that these events should be deemed timely under the continuing violation doctrine. Based on our review of the record, the Commission finds that the theory of continuing violation is not applicable here. The first and second allegations at issue focus on single, discrete incidents. The transfer and the reclassification should have triggered an awareness of discrimination on the part of appellant and his duty to assert his rights. While appellant claims that he was unaware of the harm to his promotion potential caused by the transfer and reclassification until March 1994, when he was told that his position could not go beyond the GG-9 level, the focus is on the time of the alleged discriminatory act, not the time when the consequences of the act become the most painful to the appellant<span class="Italic">. Delaware State College v. Ricks</span>, 449 U.S. 250, 258 (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee alleges that several diverse personnel actions constitute a continuing violation, a common link can be provided by the responsible management official (RMO). As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Pangarova v. Department of Army</span>, 01832489 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question of the existence of a pattern depends upon the presence of a logical relationship, or nexus, among the allegations.... The requisite relationship need not be based on the similarity of the actions, or the continuation of a policy. In this case, the actors, appellant's supervisors, constitute the alleged link among the allegations.... Since the complaint contains the suggestion of a pattern of actions logically connected by the identities of the alleged discriminating officials, the untimely claims have been brought within the ambit of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921707 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary that the RMO be a formal participant in all selection processes involved. In <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Army</span>, 01860174 (1986), the RMO admitted participating in the nonselection of appellant in the untimely complaint but denied participation in the nonselection of appellant in the timely complaint. However, a secretary recalled that the RMO met with the selectee several times in the second case prior to selection and the RMO previously stated that he would not support appellant in his efforts to be promoted. The EEOC found the appellant stated a continuing violation, even in light of the RMO's protestations that he had not participated in the second selection.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that there are several responsible management officials does not prevent the complainant from establishing a continuing violation where the same officials repeatedly are involved in personnel actions affecting the complainant. <span class="Italic">Olivares v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 05920076 (1992). However, the number of supervisors and the range of personnel actions allegedly involved can prevent a complainant from establishing a continuing violation. <span class="Italic">Hyde v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01995532 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">While from a proof perspective such a case is more difficult, from a purely legal perspective there is nothing to prevent a complainant from alleging that a continuing violation is evidenced by an "analogous theme" in agency actions that involve different supervisors. In <span class="Italic">Jarmin v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05930019 (1993), the Commission found the complainant had alleged a continuing violation where she maintained that the agency engaged in a campaign to remove her from her supervisory position following accusations of sexual harassment by a female subordinate. In <span class="Italic">Jarmin</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After review of the record and careful consideration of appellant's allegations, we find, contrary to the agency and the previous decision, that allegations 1 through 5 above contain an analogous theme linking them to the timely allegation (the May 1990 reassignment) and requiring application of the continuing violation theory. Appellant's core allegation in this case is that the acts upon which her complaint was based all stemmed from the agency's investigation of sexual harassment charges against her and evidenced the consistent efforts of agency officials to punish and humiliate her and, ultimately, remove her from her previous supervisory position. We find that each of the unfavorable acts alleged could be construed as evidence of the agency's effort to achieve its purported goal of removing appellant from this supervisory position. Likewise, each of the acts on which appellant's complaint is based could be construed stemming from a common origin--the sexual harassment charges against appellant--and as being related by a common goal--forcing appellant out of her supervisory position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Farinas v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900840 (October 19, 1990) (continuing violation found when allegations of discriminatory harassment and denials of accommodation had the common goal of removing appellant from his position). Further, the fact that the numerous actions alleged by appellant may have been taken by a number of agency officials does not, in this case, discount their interrelatedness pursuant to this unifying theme.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, it is not necessary for the complainant to demonstrate a continuing violation in order to proceed on the theory that several independent acts constitute a pattern of discrimination or harassment. The continuing violation theory is only invoked where some of the complaints about specific incidents would otherwise be untimely. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McConnell v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910462 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, an analogous theme sufficient to constitute a continuing violation was expressed where the complainant allegedly received a poor performance evaluation because of the agency's refusal to reasonably accommodate his mental disability. In <span class="Italic">Silva v. National Credit Union Administration</span>, 01960852 (1997), the Commission found that the complainant's allegations regarding accommodation of his mental disability and his allegation regarding a low performance appraisal were "inextricably intertwined" and constituted a continuing violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that appellant has, in essence, argued a continuing violation. A review of the record reflects that appellant based his complaint on a series of events and actions directly and indirectly related to his performance evaluation, which the agency issued on December 3, 1993. The record further reflects that appellant detailed numerous incidents between 1992 and 1994. Specifically, appellant alleged that after submitting medical documentation from a psychologist regarding his mental disability, the agency failed to provide the requested accommodation within a reasonable time, hence, the reason for his "Minimally Successful" performance appraisal. Appellant, moreover, alleged that after receiving the performance appraisal the agency monitored his work too closely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the alleged discriminatory incidents, appellant's request for accommodation and the agency monitoring his work too closely, are related to and inextricably intertwined with the issue of allegation (a)--his challenge to the "Minimally Successful" performance appraisal. Consequently, we find that appellant's allegations constitute a continuing violation. Since allegations (b) and (c) have been accepted and processed as timely, we find that allegation (a) should likewise be accepted as timely. Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency improperly dismissed allegation (a) for untimely EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">When contact with the EEO counselor is timely with respect to each isolated incident, but the counselor mistakenly treats the allegations as one case involving a continuing violation, the agency errs in dismissing the case on timeliness grounds. <span class="Italic">Baynard v. Department of Interior</span>, 01863297 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Baynard</span>, the Commission found it was unfair to penalize the complainant for the error of the counselor in not issuing notices of final interview for each complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to establish a viable allegation of a continuing violation, the complainant must demonstrate some temporal proximity between the events that occurred in the past and the timely allegation of discrimination. When the events are separated by the passage of too much time, there is no demonstrated nexus between the events and, as a result, no actionable claim of a continuing violation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Muhomen v. General Services Administration</span>, 05990049 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant failed to establish a continuing violation due to the significant break in temporal proximity between the 1990 and 1991 nonselections with the accepted 1995 nonselection. This temporal break indicates a lack of nexus. Furthermore, we note that complainant does <span id="Page_82"></span>not seek to pursue the 1990 and 1991 nonselections as separate claims, but rather to use them as background in the presentation of his case on the 1995 nonselection. It is well-settled that past alleged discriminatory events, which were not the subject of timely complaints, may be used as background evidence for a timely complaint, although they otherwise have no legal consequences under Title VII<span class="Italic">. See United Airlines v. Evans,</span> 431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977). Consequently, complainant may use the 1990 and 1991 claims as background for his accepted 1995 claim.</p>
