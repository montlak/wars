<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-146"><span class="space">o.</span> $90,001-$100,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">Where a failure to accommodate led to the retirement of the complainant, the Commission upheld an award of $92,500 in damages in <span class="Italic">Bartron v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720100054, <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 0520110399 (2011). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Barton</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the hearing, Complainant testified credibly as to the causal link between the Agency's discrimination and her resultant emotional harm as well as the details of her emotional pain and suffering, inconvenience (in this case, severe financial hardship), mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, and injury to her credit standing. Complainant's testimony further demonstrates that she experienced outward manifestations of her emotional distress, including depression, family strain, humiliation, and loss of self-esteem.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">First, with respect to the causal link as well as the severe financial hardship, family strain, humiliation, and injury to her credit standing, Complainant testified credibly that had she been accommodated by the Agency, she would have stayed at the Agency and kept her house. However, due to the Agency's failure to accommodate, she had to move to a place that was cheaper to live and uproot her daughter and four grandchildren who had been living with her. Further, she testified that her house ended up going into foreclosure and she was forced to take all of her retirement money out of her TSP account to afford to move and live. In addition, Complainant testified that she suffered depression as a result of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Next, with respect to emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of self-esteem, and injury to professional standing, Complainant testified that after she left the Agency, she "basically cut off all contact with any friends" and "didn't really talk to them for [approximately] a year and a half." She further testified that in moving to Idaho, she "left behind all [of her] friends and a job that gave [her] confidence and self-esteem." Complainant testified that it was "really hard trying to find another job [she] didn't want to really disclose [her] background [as] people would prejudge...[she] felt really discouraged and like she couldn't get a job." Complainant also testified that she "felt like [she] was stupid and...the attitude that the Agency put upon [her] in the last several months really crippled [her]." Complainant testified that it was not until she got to Idaho and her life started to "settle down" that she had the confidence to get a job and that it took her five months to get a job in Idaho.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ then compared Complainant's suffering to that of the Complainant in <span class="Italic">Mack v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (June 23, 2000), where the Complainant was awarded $185,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. She found that Complainant's situation was clearly distinguishable and less severe than that of the Complainant in <span class="Italic">Mack,</span> who lived a nomadic existence for two years, lost custody of his daughter, lost many of his possessions, was twice beaten <span id="Page_1902"></span>and robbed, and became a drug user. However, she found that both cases shared a common thread of profound displacement. She also noted that Complainant in the instant case was subjected to unique circumstances as a result of the Agency's discrimination that rendered her injury significant. Complainant's house was foreclosed upon, she and her family were uprooted and forced to move, and she was forced to live off of her retirement savings. The AJ determined that, based on the facts and evidence in the instant matter, Complainant was entitled to half of the non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded in <span class="Italic">Mack.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $95,000 by the administrative judge was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Truell v. Secretary of Army</span>, 07A30056 (2003). Although the Commission's decision is short on detail, the complainant, prior his nonselection, "was a productive, well-adjusted individual...but he lost interest in life after the discrimination. The record specifically shows that the complainant suffered a loss of self esteem, depression, grief, anguish, embarrassment, anger, stress, weight loss, sleeplessness, withdrawal from friends, co-workers and family and a general loss of enjoyment of life." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Where an agency's failure to accommodate resulted in the aggravation of a leg injury and caused the complainant severe pain for over a year, the Commission found that an award of $95,000 in damages was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">DeJohn v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A20030.txt">07A20030</a> (2004), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that the AJ properly determined that complainant established a nexus between the alleged harm and discrimination. Therefore, we must review whether or not the amount of AJ's non-pecuniary award was appropriate. The AJ determined that the agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation aggravated complainant's condition. The AJ found that complainant was living with severe pain and inflammation in his lower legs when the agency ordered him to perform his duties without the aid of a chair. The AJ also found that complainant's pain continued for approximately one year, when he remained in his bid position working on the CSBCS without the use of a chair. Finally, the AJ noted that the agency's action aggravated complainant's condition, because in an effort to remain standing without resting his legs, complainant began to rely heavily on prescribed and over-the-counter pain pills to get him through his shift. The record reveals through complainant's physician's testimony that complainant's gastro-intestinal bleeding was caused by the various painkillers that complainant was using at the time. Complainant's doctor also testified that the agency's failure to accommodate complainant contributed to the exacerbation of complainant's suffering. We find that the agency argues that management's action did not cause complainant's gastro-intestinal bleeding, and that complainant's injuries were attributed to the medication he was taking to treat other medical conditions. However, we find that the record did not reveal that complainant's other medical conditions caused the gastro-intestinal bleeding. The record supports complainant's claim that his condition was exacerbated by the agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the AJ' s award of $95,000.00 is consistent with prior Commission precedent and takes into account the severity and duration of the harm suffered. The record reveals that due to the agency's failure to accommodate complainant, he was hospitalized and his condition was aggravated. The record also reveals through complainant's family's testimonies that the agency's actions impacted complainant's overall quality of life. <span class="Italic">See Brinkley v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01953977 (January 23, 1998) ($110,000 in non-pecuniary damages for the injury sustained by complainant which resulted in her hospitalization, and the various symptoms she experienced included hopelessness, loss of energy, agoraphobia, loss of interest in living, depressed mood, impaired memory and concentration, insomnia, agitation, and loss of interest in routine activities and personal self care) <span class="Italic">Leatherman v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal 01A12222 (December 14, 2001) ($100,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages as a result of the discriminatory action of the agency, complainant was hospitalized twice). Therefore, we find that the AJ properly concluded that complainant is entitled to $95,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $95,000 in <span class="Italic">Barnett v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060019 (2008), where the agency failed to accommodate the complainant by providing a smoke-free truck and that failure lead to repeated respiratory attacks and, ultimately, to his inability to work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the award itself, the record reveals complainant suffered severe emotional and physical distress due to the agency s failure to accommodate. Whenever complainant came in contact with the smoke in the truck, it created an asthmatic reaction which manifested itself in difficulty breathing, vomiting, headaches, and other extreme forms of physical discomfort. Complainant was diagnosed with Major Depression, and placed on antidepressants. Complainant suffered from difficulty with his memory and concentration, as well as insomnia. Several witnesses testified that complainant's mood changed significantly and he withdrew from family. Ultimately, complainant moved out of the room he shared with his wife, then out of the house, and then they were divorced. After a review of the record, as well as prior Commission decisions, we agree with the Ad's award and find that it is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <span class="Italic">See Foti v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30091 (October 5, 2004)($95,000.00 for Major Depression following discriminatory termination); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) (awarding $80,000.00 in compensatory damages where nonselection and denial of accommodation were found to cause severe emotional harm and substantial physical discomfort over a period of time).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cher B. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120140445 (2017), a case involving a finding of retaliatory harassment, the Commission found a $95,000 award proper where "for approximately 18 months, Complainant experienced embarrassment, stress, loss of professional standing, one panic attack, and the exacerbation of her lupus symptoms." In <span class="Italic">Finlay v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942985 (1997), the Commission awarded $100,000 in damages for severe psychological injury over four years. The harm was expected to continue for an indeterminate period of time. The complainant's symptoms included ongoing depression, frequent crying, concern for physical safety, loss of charm, lethargy, social withdrawal, concern for physical safety, recurring nightmares and memories of harassment, a damaged marriage, stomach distress, and headaches.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $100,000 in compensatory damages was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01951729 (1998). In that case, the Commission noted there was no evidence of a preexisting condition prior to the complainant's employment with the agency, that the stress rendered the complainant unable to work for a significant period of time, and that the complainant continued to suffer symptoms at the time of the hearing. The Commission also considered the fact that the agency knowingly required the complainant to work with a man who had threatened her life.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $100,000 in emotional distress damages in <span class="Italic">Chow v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01981308 (1999), where the evidence established that the complainant suffered from anxiety and depression for about two-and-a-half years at the time she submitted evidence of damages and was estimated to need another 12 to 18 months of treatment. The Commission set the level of compensation using the lower estimate of a total duration of 42 months of emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Leatherman v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A12222 (2001), the Commission awarded $100,000 in damages where the complainant expressed suicidal ideations and was twice hospitalized--once for psychiatric treatment and once to treat physical ailments related to her emotional distress. The complainant submitted evidence that her depression became so severe that she stopped bathing, combing her hair, or otherwise caring for herself and remained in bed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant continued to experience feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem five years after the agency's denial of reasonable accommodation led to a constructive discharge, the Commission awarded $100,000 in damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holland v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A01372 (2003). In that case, the Commission also noted that the discrimination exacerbated the complainant's preexisting obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ellis-Balone v. Secretary of Energy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a30125.txt">07A30125</a> (2004), the Commission upheld a damage award of $100,000 based on the testimony of the complainant and her husband. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ellis-Balone</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In awarding complainant $100,000.00 in compensatory damages for emotional pain and suffering, as well as exacerbation of physical symptoms, the AJ referenced the testimony of complainant and her husband. We note that complainant did not indicate if she was treated medically for her emotional pain and suffering. The Commission finds that although a claim for non-pecuniary damages may rest on a complainant's statement alone, we note that she did not submit evidence other than the statements of herself and her husband regarding the effects of her emotional distress on her family. Nevertheless, complainant has indicated that she experienced emotional/mental pain and suffering during the nine months that the agency discriminated against her with regard to her requests for telecommuting and advanced sick leave. The evidence does establish that based on the actions of the facility's HRM office's staff, complainant suffered discomfort and pain related to her pregnancy, had several uvitis flare-ups, and was depressed and stressed. The evidence also supports complaint's statements that she felt emotionally and physically drained by having to meet the unreasonable demands of HRM staff. Further, the AJ found that the evidence of record clearly supported a finding that the physical and emotional difficulties complainant underwent over an eight month period were related to the agency's "campaign" of harassment and discrimination. AJ's Decision at 37. As noted by the AJ, the medical evidence submitted by complainant did not support a finding that stress related to the discrimination was a proximate cause of the premature rupture of her membranes during her pregnancy, nor was the premature delivery of her daughter affected by stress related to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant presented evidence that he had suicidal ideations and depression and was so devastated by his termination that he started drinking beer and then moved to hard liquor, the Commission found an award of <span id="Page_1903"></span>$100,000 in damages was proper. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mika v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0420070001.txt">07A40113</a> (2005). The Commission also noted that the complainant started drinking so he could stay drunk and "sleep through it, [so he would not] have to worry about [being terminated]," and that he had attended both individual and group counseling sessions after the termination.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission issues more damages decisions, it relies heavily upon its previous case law in assessing damages focusing on similarities in the nature, duration and severity of the symptoms. For example, in <span class="Italic">Green v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a44490.txt">01A44490</a> (2005), the Commission awarded $100,000 in damages after comparing the harm the complainant suffered with harm complainants had suffered in previous cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although complainant had served in Vietnam, there are no indications in the record that he had exhibited any signs of PTSD prior to February 1996. In a notarized letter to the agency dated June 17, 2004, complainant stated that he had been injured in 1992, and was off from work for about two years as a result. He further stated that, during the time that he was not working, he had been seeing a psychologist for depression, but was happy when he returned to work. The record includes a report from a clinical psychologist to a treating psychiatrist dated August 23, 1994. The report indicated that things were going well for complainant at work, in that he was very pleased with his job, that the work environment was "more than satisfactory," and that complainant's co-workers and supervisors were "great to work with." The report also noted that complainant had done a good job of integrating pain management techniques into his daily routine, that he had become much less irritable and more patient, and that, "overall, he and his family [felt] that he [was] back to his old self." In addition, he had decreased his dosages of Pamelor, an antidepressant medication that he was on.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains extensive medical documentation establishing that complainant's condition worsened substantially after February 1996, and that he had continued to exhibit severe symptoms between March 1996 and May 2004. Complainant has presented reports from treating psychiatrists and psychologists, assessments from the VA medical center in Dallas, Texas, medication lists, medical records, treatment plans, and other documentation of PTSD and major depression. These conditions manifested as nervousness, sleeplessness, anxiety, irritability, low self-esteem, isolation, fear of crowds, and nightmares.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence of record thus establishes the existence of a nexus between the discriminatory change of complainant's employment status from full-time to part-time on February 27, 1996, the onset of his PTSD, and the exacerbation of his depression and his peripheral neuropathy. We now turn to the task of actually calculating the award. There is no precise formula for determining the amount of damages for nonpecuniary losses, except that the award should reflect the nature and severity of the harm and the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="Italic">Loving v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955789 (August 29, 1997). It should likewise be consistent with amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">Hogeland v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01976440 (June 14, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has ordered awards of $150,000 and above where there the harm suffered by the complainant was extremely severe and there was compelling evidence of a nexus between that harm and the agency's acts of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Glockner v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30105 (September 23, 2004) ($200,000); <span class="Italic">Mack v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (June 23, 2000), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span> EEOC Request No. 05A01058 (October 26, 2000) ($186,000); and <span class="Italic">Kloock v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01 A31159 (February 5, 2004) ($150,000). Therefore, to establish his entitlement to an award of $225,000, complainant present sufficient proof that he suffered harm comparable to the harm suffered by the complainants in <span class="Italic">Glockner, Mack,</span> and <span class="Italic">Kloock. See generally Lucas v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950161 (May 2, 1996), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available under &#x00A7; 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991</span>, EEOC Notice No. N915.002 (July 14, 1992) (it is the burden of appellant to prove that a pecuniary and/or non-pecuniary loss occurred, and that there is a causal relationship between the loss and the discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Glockner,</span> complainant was subjected to ongoing discriminatory harassment between July 1999 and June 2001, a period of nearly two years. She testified that, in addition to suffering from depression, anxiety, and exhaustion, she had been experiencing migraine headaches as well as irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal disorders. She also testified that she started to bite her cheeks and developed an irrational fibroma, which required surgery. In addition to her own testimony, the complainant presented a neurologist's report indicating that a magnetic resonance imaging scan performed in October 2000 had ruled out physiological causes of her migraines, and that as far back as 1999, the complainant's doctor had attributed her migraines to work-related stress. In addition, a staff physician working at the complainant's facility testified that he had seen complainant several times testified as to his belief that the complainant's symptoms originated from her working conditions. Other evidence included letters from complainant's doctors regarding treatment of her kidney stones and the removal of her irrational fibroma.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Mack,</span> the complainant's award was based on a finding that he had been left homeless for two years following a discriminatory termination from his employment. The complainant testified without rebuttal that, as a result of being fired after testing positive for the HIV virus, he could no longer pay rent, his lease was not renewed and he was forced to give up custody of his seven-year-old daughter. Between 1995 and 1997, he was left homeless, unable to bathe and often sleeping in the street. His belongings and those of his daughter were sold at an auction after he could no longer pay the monthly storage fees. In addition, his relationship with his daughter was irreparably damaged. Finally, his depression worsened considerably after his removal. He began to suffer from migraines and insomnia, and his emphysema had gotten worse as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, an assessment from the VA medical center in Dallas dated November 28, 1997, indicates that complainant had been a patient at the center since April 23, 1996, that he had been diagnosed with PTSD, that his social and occupational functioning had been significantly impaired, and that his prognosis was poor. A clinical psychologist's memorandum dated December 5, 1997, stated that complainant continued to display the symptom configurations associated with PTSD and major depression at severe levels. The memorandum noted that complainant's prognosis was poor and that a global functionality assessment indicated a functionality of 50, which indicated serious impairment in social and vocational functioning. He had been on various psychotropic medications to control his symptoms, including, but not limited to Gabapentin, Citalopram Hydrobromide, Clonzpen, Quetiapine Fumarate, Trazodone, Nortriptyline, and Klonopin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite extensive psychiatric treatment and evaluation, he continued to exhibit these symptoms between March 1996 and May 2004, and beyond. He reported that panic reactions would be triggered by such activities as attending church services where people would be behind him, and watching the rain. A doctor's note dated December 4, 2001, indicated that had also been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, a degenerative nerve condition, which caused him to have to walk with a cane. The doctor stated that, although complainant was first diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in 1985, the condition had been made worse by having been "coupled with his PTSD." The doctor characterized his neuropathy as, "more of a disability." The various statements from treating psychiatrists and psychologists indicate that complainant's condition is permanent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are, however, no indications in the record that complainant lost his employment, home, or property, as had the complainants in <span class="Italic">Mack</span> and <span class="Italic">Koock.</span> Moreover, complainant has not exhibited physical symptoms of his emotional distress to the same extent that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Glockner</span> had. Rather, the facts in this case are similar to those in which the Commission has awarded $100,000 in compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Hendley v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A20977 (May 15, 2003), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration dismissed,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A30962 (January 14, 2004) ($100,000 awarded where complainant was diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder, had experienced paranoia, insomnia, eating disorders, and uncontrollable crying for six years, and would require treatment for the rest of her life); <span class="Italic">Patel v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01980279 (September 26, 2001) ($100,000 awarded where, after several discriminatory nonselections, complainant required continuous medical treatment for five years, covering major depression, chest pains, palpitations, anxiety, and insomnia); and <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 ($100,000 awarded where complainant experienced depression, frequent crying, concern for her safety, lethargy, social withdrawal, recurring nightmares, a damaged marriage, stomach distress, and headaches for a period of four years, and was expected to continue experiencing those symptoms for an indeterminate time).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we will award complainant $100,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $100,000 in damages was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sorg v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0720060065 (2008), where the harm extended over a five-year period and treatment of the complainant would continue indefinitely into the future. The Commission found that the complainant suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, chronic depression and anxiety and described the complainant's physical and emotional distress as a result of the harassment as "severe."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sainz v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720030103 (2008), the Commission upheld an award of $100,000 in damages where the complainant's termination caused him to sell a gun and coin collection to pay bills:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserts that the AJ's award of $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages is "monstrously excessive." The AJ relied on the following testimony by complainant at the hearing as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">For the first time in my life I felt unsure about my abilities or what I <span id="Page_1904"></span>could do. I was humiliated being walked out of the Mint like I was some common criminal. That has taken away some confidence. And when I apply at other jobs they want to know why I left the Mint and I tell them that I was fired because I was injured and I don't get a call back and that really bothers me. Going out and having to sell part of my coin collection or currency collection or gun collection to pay my light bill so I could have just a little bit of money. Going out for weeks at a time because I was not getting the proper pay because [HR1] never answered the worker's comp request. I would eat fried egg sandwiches for two months in a row. And finally when I get money, it goes not to be able to live, but paying back everybody that I owed. And I had to max out four credit cards and I have debtors calling me every day asking when I am going to be able to pay them.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I don't--I have been isolated for so long I don't want to go out, and I can't go to the store on an everyday basis because I need to save gas in case I need to come here or go to my lawyer's office or go to a doctor's appointment. Recreation, there is none. So, I basically just sit home and watch t.v. and wait for this day. I was depressed. I gained back 40 pounds that I had lost while I was at the Mint and rehabilitating myself. I don't feel good about how I look. It is just a very degrading experience.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that in cases similar to this, the Commission has awarded non-pecuniary damages in the range of $3,000 to $12,000. In addition, the agency notes that in cases where the Commission has awarded $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages and above, the evidence of record tended to show that the emotional or psychological injuries that resulted from the agency's actions either had permanent or substantially long-term effects, or were so catastrophic that no inquiry into long-term effects was necessary. Based upon the Commission precedents, the agency argues that the instant case does not warrant a non-pecuniary award of $100,000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant is entitled to $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages based upon his ongoing depression, low self-esteem, reduction of his quality of life, financial difficulties, feelings of rejection, humiliation and isolation, and weight gain. In addition to this harm, complainant was also forced to sell a life-time collection of rare coins and currency which complainant considered irreplaceable. We note that this sum is meant to compensate complainant for the emotional distress he suffered, which was caused by the agency's discriminatory termination. Finally, this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F.2d 827 (7th Cir. 1989). <span class="Italic">See also, Truell v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30056 (September 3, 2003) (award of $95,000 in non-pecuniary damages for loss of self-esteem, depression, embarrassment, anger, stress, weight-loss, sleeplessness, withdrawal from friends, co-workers and family, and a general loss of enjoyment of life); <span class="Italic">Toro v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A20095 (September 30, 2003) (award of $85,000 in non-pecuniary damages for bouts of depression and damaged marital relationship).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sainz</span> denied the complainant's request for $32,000 in pecuniary damages for the loss on the sale of his collections as he failed to produce any documentation to support loss claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency award of $10,000 in damages to $100,000 where the psychological effects of sexual harassment dissipated to some degree after the complainant was reassigned and had no further contact with the harassing manager but still continued for a period of a few years. In <span class="Italic">Gray v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120072136 (2009), the Commission found that, even though the complainant did not prevail on all of her claims, she did establish the specific harm that resulted from the sexual harassment and disagreed with the agency that the harm should be apportioned among the claims. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission initially notes that we do not find based on the evidence, that as soon as complainant changed supervisors, her emotional distress ceased. The medical and testimonial evidence in the record suggest that complainant's emotional distress and physical problems resulting from the sexual harassment may have improved somewhat after she left the harasser's supervision, but there remained numerous significant residual effects. For instance, in a report dated July 21, 2006 (several years after the harassment had ceased), complainant's psychiatrist stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">She experienced a Major Depressive Episode during [the time of the harassment] which had a duration of more than a year with residual symptoms still present. She also developed a new diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse, as she was using alcohol as a maladaptive means of coping with her distress and anxiety. She reports dysfunction in her ability to perform her work effectively and efficiently and dysfunction in her interpersonal relationships with her boyfriend, with her daughter and with her friends. She felt less like "going to places and seeing my family, I couldn't be bothered with them."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Forensic Examination Report, at 1. Additionally, the report states "Unfortunately, by the time she was moved to a new position, [Complainant] feels that she was 'not the same person. I was nasty, ornery, angry. I had no patience."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 9. The report goes on to state "[Complainant] reports that even after being moved, problems continued in her relationship with her boyfriend. She indicates that at one point, he wanted to leave because he was so frustrated and upset over her constant reports about her boss' harassment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The report continues as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After she was placed in a new position at work, [Complainant's] symptoms gradually improved over the next year, however she reports feeling that she is still not her normal self. Sleep improved as did her energy and her attention and concentration. She now feels somewhat more confident, however she still experiences depressed mood at times and has not been able to lose the weight she gained. She still experiences decreased libido and a feeling that it is difficult to be emotionally and physically intimate with her boyfriend. She is emotionally over-reactive, not being able to appreciate when he is joking with her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In complainant's statement of May 2006, she indicates the following about the persisting symptoms:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Today, I still endure headaches and am unable to trust my supervisors. I have frequent nightmares and drink beer excessively. I want to be alone and I do not associate with my daughter and grandchildren as much as before this happened. My sex life changed drastically because I'm just not in the mood. I have severe mood changes. I gained so much weight that I have low self-esteem now. Now, whenever I go down to the 5th floor where I worked for [the harasser], just being there elevates my blood pressure to an uncontrollable level and I feel faint.... The humiliation and mental anguish I endured left me feeling nervous and distrustful. It was like an adverse roller-coaster working under [the harasser's] supervision. Not a day would pass when I did not feel depressed.... The depression I suffer feels as if it is long-term because even though [RMO] retired, I still feel depressed from the thoughts of his control and dominance. Just the mention of his name brings tears to my eyes. I lost numerous girlfriends because they asked me to bring them something back from lunch, and I yelled at them for no apparent reason other than the memory of having to pick up [the harasser's] breakfast and lunch.... Prior to the sexual harassment I did not feel depressed. Today, the least little negative thing that someone says makes me feel depressed and unappreciated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In their affidavits, complainant's witnesses all echo the fact that the sexual harassment essentially changed complainant into an emotionally different person (sad, depressed, irritable, angry, self-conscious) with physical problems (high blood pressure, weight gain, headaches, increased alcohol consumption as a "comfort"), whose relationships with those close to her deteriorated as a result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, we find that $10,000.00 is inadequate, and $185,000.00 is too high an amount to compensate complainant. We find that $100,000.00 is appropriate to compensate complainant for her more than three years of severe physical and emotional pain and suffering that resulted from the sexual harassment. We point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions. <span class="Italic">See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,</span> 477 U.S. 299, 31112 (1986) (stating that compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case). The Commission notes that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Santiago v. Department of the Army,</span> Appeal No. 01955684 (October 14, 1998) (awarding $125,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered depression and other emotional and mental disorders, and severe chest and stomach pains, digestive problems, and incidents of shortness of breath due to three years of verbal abuse and sex and age-based discrimination by her supervisor); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01951729 (July 29, 1998) (awarding $100,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where hostile work environment caused complainant to develop severe psychological injury, from which she was still suffering at the hearing); <span class="Italic">Chow v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01981308 (August 5, 1999) ($100,000.00 for physical and mental suffering due to supervisor's harassment over two-year period).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $40,000 by the agency was increased to $100,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Conrad v. Attorney General</span>, 0120090690 (2010), where the complainant endured reprisal for at least 19 months and repercussions continued for several more months. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Conrad</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, as noted above, the Commission finds that the agency properly determined that complainant established a causal nexus <span id="Page_1905"></span>between the nonpecuniary harm and the discrimination. The agency based the award largely on substantial record testimony from complainant, family members and his medical providers. The record reveals that during the period of retaliation, complainant experienced major depression, anxiety, diminished enjoyment, withdrawal from social, family and professional contacts, loss of concentration, loss of memory and weight fluctuation and a damaged professional reputation. Complainant endured the reprisal for at least nineteen months and the repercussions continued through 2002. Therefore, we will now review whether the amount was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the evidence in the record and based upon Commission precedent, we find that complainant is entitled to $100,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages. This is a reasonable and appropriate award based on the evidence before us. The record shows that complainant suffered major depression for which he was hospitalized, anxiety, diminished enjoyment of life, withdrawal from social, family and professional contacts, and loss of concentration, loss of memory and weight fluctuation and damaged professional reputation as a result of the demotion and harassment. Consequently, we modify the agency's determination of the amount because the higher amount is clearly supported by the evidence. The award is based on the actual harm experienced which was the result of the agency's actions, and it takes into account both the nature of the agency's discriminatory actions as well as the nature, duration and severity of the harm complainant experienced as a result of those actions. <span class="Italic">See Utt v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070001 (March 26, 2009) (Commission's compensatory damages award takes into account the nature of the agency's discriminatory actions).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Liz M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720180020 (2018) (increasing award from $80,000 to $100,000 where the agency delayed complainant's reassignment request for a full year after she reported being stalked, causing insomnia, nightmares and panic attacks, a fear of going anywhere alone, and her withdrawal from social activities).</p>
<p class="noindent">In two companion cases, the Commission issued awards of $100,000 and $110,000, respectively. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kann v. Secretary of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50039.txt">07A50039</a> (2005) and <span class="Italic">Turton v. Secretary of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50040.txt">07A50040</a> (2005). The interesting part of both cases is not the awards themselves, but the failure of the Commission to comment specifically on the actions of the administrative judge in awarding damages. In <span class="Italic">Kann</span>, the administrative judge awarded $365,000 in nonpecuniary damages and then applied the $300,000 statutory cap. In <span class="Italic">Turton</span>, the administrative judge awarded $380,000 in damages before applying the cap. In reducing the awards, the Commission made no comment on the judge's decision to award more than $300,000. The omission is significant because the Commission's appellate decisions have never included an award of more than $300,000. One reason this could be true is that the Commission has operated under a fundamental misunderstanding of the Statute since it first began awarding damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The statutory structure of the 1991 Civil Rights Act does not address the award of damages in the administrative process. The Statute addresses damages in the context of the Act's jury trial provisions and specifically provides that a jury may not be informed of the cap on damages. In other words, Congress did not conclude that $300,000 was the maximum amount of harm that could be sustained in an employment discrimination. It decided that $300,000 would be the extent of the employer's liability. The reason for not informing juries of the cap is that information would have the capacity to confuse a jury. The jury might reasonably believe that if $300,000 is the maximum award that amount is reserved for the most egregious cases and that, in a given case, it would have to scale an award downward from $300,000. The failure of the Commission to award more than $300,000 may be an indication that it has fallen victim to the confusion that statute was written to avoid. In <span class="Italic">Kann</span> and <span class="Italic">Turton</span>, the Commission sidestepped the issue by reducing the awards well below the $300,000 cap.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kann</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that complainant was working in the Minerals Management Service Division, Royalty in Kind (RIK) section as an accountant. The AJ found, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that complainant's supervisor, Mr. W, subjected complainant to a hostile work environment for a total of two years and ten months. The AJ found Mr. W stared at her breasts, made reference to a Korean whorehouse and prostitutes, and referred to female employees as "bitches." Mr. W told complainant he had sex with a woman who suffered female genital mutilation but he did not enjoy it because "he couldn't ring her bells." The AJ further found that Mr. W used words with non-sexual meanings to make vulgar sexual references. Specifically, Mr. W would use the word "come" to suggest ejaculate, "ball" to suggest testicle, "unzip" to suggest the unzipping of clothing, "hard" to suggest an erect penis, and "hole" to suggest a vagina.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that Mr. W, without invitation and over objection, embraced complainant under the ruse of administering a treatment for her headache. After Mr. W was removed from the area, the AJ found that he continued to stalk complainant; stared at her in the halls with a glaring, angry, hostile facial expression; and placed numerous menacing telephone calls to her home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that Mr. W referred to the RIK team as "his harem." Mr. W offered to lick whipped cream off complainant's finger after cutting a pie. The AJ found that Mr. W talked about yeast infections. After a harassment training, Mr. W told complainant she could disregard what was said at the training because it "doesn't mean anything,...you can do whatever you want to." The AJ also found that Mr. W told an inappropriate joke after the harassment training. Specifically, Mr. W asked: "What did one lesbian frog say to the other? I guess we do taste like chicken."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that an award of $365,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages was appropriate. However, the AJ reduced that amount to $300,000.00, the statutory limit. The AJ found that complainant suffered emotional distress due to the agency's discriminatory action, with some of the conditions persisting for over four and one half years. Specifically, the AJ found that complainant suffered from: avoidance of people, crowds, and intense distrust of White males; social isolation and withdrawal, including loss of friends and colleagues; joylessness and loss of sense of humor; distraction and withdrawal from family; relationship with husband severely strained; high levels of stress and anxiety; exacerbation of previously existing migraine, bronchitis, and asthma conditions; menstrual irregularities; gastro-intestinal disorders; cracking of the teeth due to excessive clenching and grinding; heart palpitations; 30 to 40 pound weight gain; foot problems; heartburn; difficulty sleeping; diagnosed with moderately severe depression and generalized anxiety; loss of appetite; diminished energy; and loss of self-esteem and self-respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues on appeal that the AJ's award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages was not consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases after considering the nature, severity, and duration of harm. The agency argues that the AJ based the award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages on insufficient medical evidence. Finally, the agency argues that the AJ did not give sufficient weight to complainant's behavior, admissions, and relative lack of credibility, and to evidence of mitigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that evidence from a health care professional is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional distress. <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining compensatory damages, the Commission strives to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases. We find that $300,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages in this case is excessive considering the nature, severity, and duration of the harm as compared to analogous cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as complainant has submitted evidence of emotional distress, we note that the Commission has awarded compensatory damages in cases somewhat similar to complainant's in terms of harm sustained. <span class="Italic">See Yasko v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A32340 (April 21, 2004) (awarding complainant $100,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages after being subjected to sexual harassment resulting in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, severe intermittent insomnia, weight gain and stress); <span class="Italic">Winkler v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01975336 (June 7, 2000) (awarding $110,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages for emotional distress after being subjected to sexual harassment and experiencing major depression, excessive sleeping, social withdrawal, anxiety, irritability, weeping, increased suicidal ideation, fright, shock, humiliation, loss of marital harmony and loss of enjoyment in life).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds these cases analogous to the above referenced cases with respect to the nature, severity, and duration of the harm. After considering the nature of the agency's action, in conjunction with complainant's testimony, we find that $100,000.00 is an appropriate amount of non-pecuniary compensatory damages to be awarded. Finally, we note that this award is not "monstrously excessive" and is consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a similarly worded decision in <span class="Italic">Turton</span>, the Commission found that $110,000 was an appropriate award.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $100,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Mohar v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100019 (2011), where the discrimination caused the complainant's PTSD. The Commission rejected the agency's arguments that the award should be reduced because part of the harm was caused by agency actions found not to be discriminatory, the death of the complainant's dog and financial concerns. The agency argued that the complainant's financial problems were brought about not by discrimination but her decision to hire an expensive attorney to pursue her case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the complainant did submit any specific medical evidence other than a report from an EAP counselor, the Commission upheld an award <span id="Page_1906"></span>of $100,000 in <span class="Italic">Small v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100031 (2012), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant's back condition resulted in a deterioration of that condition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find $100,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages awarded by the AJ appropriate. Complainant stated that, due to back pain, he can no longer pick up his toddler daughter and now she mimics his complaints of back and neck pain; he had to stop playing his favorite sports of 18 years--golf and softball; he cannot walk around as he did; he has difficulty writing or typing for any length of time, and he had to pass on many household duties to his wife. He stated that he is depressed and stressed about his inability to work and pay bills, and receives counseling. He stated that S1 denied him accommodation when she would not allow him to use a pull/push cart lo deliver mail. Complainant added that he now has permanent back damage and has had panic attacks due to the stress imposed upon him and stomach problems; and that he received psychological counseling through a private practice and the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Complainant provided a letter from an EAP counselor stating that he sought counseling on four occasions between April 2006 and February 2007, at which time he cited emotional distress related to his job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After considering Complainant's testimony, the amount of medical evidence, the duration of his ailments, and Commission precedent, we find $100,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages proper. <span class="Italic">See Villanueva v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. Appeal No. 01A34968 (August 10, 2006) (The Commission awarded complainant $90,000 in non-pecuniary damages for sleeplessness, high stress and anxiety, loss of concentration and memory, and low self esteem, as evidenced by complainant's testimony and psychotherapist visits.); <span class="Italic">Dildy v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40115 (March 24, 2005), request for reconsideration denied, EEOC Request No. 05A50787 (July 22, 2005) (The Commission awarded $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages for continued failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for more than 18 months, resulting in extreme distress, gastrointestinal issues, depression, and deteriorating health.).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission approved an award of $100,000 by the administrative judge where the complainant presented her own testimony, her husband's testimony and a supervisor's testimony in <span class="Italic">Fivecoat v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720110035 (2012), explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that her "entire life changed" and that she "cannot be made whole again.... The damage has been too great." Specifically, Complainant testified, "It [the stress from her work environment] affected me 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I didn't feel like doing anything...I'd go home on the weekends, close the door, and that's where I'd be...my entire life was work and home. That was it." In addition, Complainant testified, "I--I just lost all--to me, life was--I was hanging on, but that was about it...I couldn't enjoy anything." Further, Complainant testified that she became "morose," "haggard," "on edge," and developed "a short fuse." Moreover, Complainant testified that she experienced depression, digestive problems, sleep disturbance and nightmares, crying spells, and episodic high blood pressure. Finally, Complainant testified that the last place she was "both healthy and happy" was in Germany and that she is not currently healthy--"[M]y systems have suffered from the stresses, and it has--we have yet to reverse it."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">F1 testified that Complainant--previously a very sociable and outgoing person who enjoyed activities such as traveling, sightseeing, and quilting--became angry, anxious, depressed, fearful, and stopped participating in the activities she had once enjoyed. In addition, F1 testified that Complainant's self-esteem "went downhill" and that "the look on [her] face and the way she carried herself changed altogether." Further, F1 testified that Complainant rarely left the house, would sit around in her pajamas all the time, had "greasy" hair, and stopped cleaning her house to the point where it became "filthy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 testified that Complainant felt hopeless, slept all the time, withdrew from people, and started getting angry. In addition, S1 testified that Complainant did not make new friends and became "a recluse." Further, S1 testified that Complainant's house "looked like she had started unpacking, and she had never finished." Moreover, S1 testified that Complainant's health deteriorated and the fire department had to be called to check her blood pressure at work because it was so high.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency on appeal did not specifically dispute any of the testimony pertaining to damages, but instead argued that the alleged harm Complainant experienced did not warrant a $100,000 award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the evidence in light of the Commission's cases regarding non-pecuniary damages awarded for emotional harm, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's award of $100,000. We find that the amount is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with Commission precedent. Although the Agency argued that the award was excessive, it did not suggest a lesser amount that might be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other cases, the Commission has awarded similar amounts for emotional harm such as anxiety, depression, stress, fearfulness, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of self-esteem, sleep problems, and humiliation. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720110036 (Mar. 13, 2012) ($125,000 awarded in 19-month harassment case where complainant experienced anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep problems, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of self-esteem, damage to professional reputation, and withdrawal from relationships); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070015 (May 22, 2008) ($85,000 awarded as a result of a discriminatory hostile work environment that resulted in emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, health problems, anxiety, stress, depression, loss of self-esteem, and excessive fatigue); <span class="Italic">Morrison v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A50003 (Apr. 18, 2006) ($90,000 awarded in one-year harassment case where complainant experienced depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and where complainant's psychological trauma continued well past the date she resigned from the agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">Without much in the way of analysis, the Commission upheld the award of $100,000 by an administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Guess v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0720110029 (2012), <span class="Italic">recon. denied,</span> 0520120535 (2013), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ issued an Interim Decision on July 12, 2010, finding discrimination and instructed the parties to provide information regarding damages. The AJ also ordered EEO training for all responsible management officials involved, and the Agency was to post a notice of nondiscrimination. On March 9, 2011, the AJ awarded Complainant $100,000 in compensatory damages for humiliation, embarrassment, loss of enjoyment of life, and emotional harm as well as for physical manifestations of that harm as described by her (anxiety, depression, chest pain, shortness of breath, insomnia, crying, swelling in the eyes and weight gain and she was prescribed the antidepressant Zoloft), her family, friends, co-workers and her doctor. The AJ found that this award of nonpecuniary compensatory damages was justified by the evidence in the record and the Commissions decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $40,000 by the agency was increased by the Commission to $100,000 in <span class="Italic">Auston v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120112574 (2012), where, among other actions, the complainant, who worked as chief in the Sterile Processing Department had a suppressed immune system, was removed from his position for legitimate reasons but then assigned to a ward with ill patients. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Auston</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant provided detailed testimony as to how the Agency's failure to accommodate him placed him in an impossible situation, which caused him extreme emotional distress. Complainant testified that he suffers from immune suppression due to nerve gas exposure. Complainant states that after the Agency demoted him and reassigned him to a position with direct patient care, he went out on LWOP, but was often required to come to work until his termination, which compromised his health and traumatized him. He states as a result, he was on constant antibiotics, and increased medical evaluation to ensure he had not contracted infections. Complainant states that as a result of his reassignment to 9-West, he was treated for anxiety and depression with psychotropic medication. Complainant testified that he lost his appetite, vomited constantly, had ulcers and lost twenty pounds. He states that he suffered from worsened insomnia, irritability, and repeated asthma attacks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that he went from the main breadwinner, to being forced to borrow money to support his family. He states in addition to loans from family members, he also had to take an equity line out on his house. As a result of the financial insecurity, he states his family relations are quite strained, as his children worry about being homeless.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife submitted a statement as well. She stated that she and her husband have been through life's "up's and down's," but nothing like the time period referenced in the complaint. Complainant's wife remarked that Complainant was forced into a work situation that placed his life in danger. She states that the events have influenced their personal and marital life as well placed intense financial hardships on their family. Specifically, she states that the family went into enormous debt to keep their mortgage current and pay for their children's education. She states they no longer go on vacations, keep up their house, and their retirement is no longer secure. She states Complainant is sad and stressed, and has withdrawn from family functions. His sleep patterns and health have deteriorated, and marital friction has increased. According to Complainant's wife, Complainant no longer attends family functions, his children's sporting events, and no longer spends time with friends.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find the Agency's award of $40,000.00 is not sufficient to compensate Complainant for his emotional and physical distress caused by the Agency's discrimination. In cases such as this, where the emotional distress suffered is severe, and has lasted several years, a higher damage award is appropriate. In calculating this award, we find that Complainant did suffer from an on the job injury and car accident in the months prior to the discriminatory events, and have taken these matters into consideration when applying the Commission's <span id="Page_1907"></span>position on preexisting conditions. Nonetheless, given the Agency's discriminatory actions in this case, and the likelihood that Complainant would suffer significant emotional distress, we find an increase is necessary. In so finding, we credit the testimony of Complainant and his wife, who suggested that although Complainant has been through other difficulties in his life, the discrimination, (including the discipline, failure to accommodate and ultimate termination), made the most impact on Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find an award of $100,000.00 is warranted in this case. Our award takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Champion v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720090037 (Mar. 10, 2010) ($125,000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where Complainant suffered depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and required psychiatric treatment as a result of ongoing harassment for two years); <span class="Italic">Brown-Fleming v. Dep't of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667 (Oct. 28, 2010) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages where Complainant experienced anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, disassociation, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, and nightmares because of retaliation).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected the complainant's appeal and affirmed an agency award of $100,000 in <span class="Italic">Spence v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, 0120093196 (2012), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant led to an exacerbation of his back condition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the discriminatory actions against Complainant involved denying him use of the Health Unit for bed rest between July 1997 and January 1999; denying him a flexible work at home accommodation between February 8, 1999 and March 28, 2001; and the seven month delay beginning in January 2000, in reconfiguring Complainant's workspace. Complainant states that he suffered three lumbar herniated discs and two cervical herniated discs with impingement, cervical spinal stenosis, thoracic outlet syndrome and permanent impairment to his upper and lower extremities. Complainant lists a variety of medications that he takes for his chronic pain. Complainant states that he will experience severe pain and mental anguish for the rest of his life. Complainant further claims that the stroke he suffered was due to Vioxx that he needed to take due to pain that is linked to the Agency's discriminatory actions. Complainant further describes how he is limited in his lifestyle. Complainant states that he is unable to exercise, cannot lift more than ten pounds, has experienced a loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience and an inability to perform household chores.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the Agency's total award of $100,000 is appropriate. It is clear that Complainant has suffered significantly due to his physical condition and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. However, we observe that much of the damages claimed have not been shown to be proximately caused by the denial of reasonable accommodation. Complainant attempts to justify the magnitude of his damage claims by including Agency actions that occurred both before and after the timeframe of the discrimination. Our previous decision made it clear that there were three acts of discrimination and they occurred within a specified time period. Therefore, an attempt to argue for a damages award for events that occurred outside that timeframe is clearly unwarranted, devoid of merit and is rejected. It is evident though that the Agency's actions contributed to short-term aggravation of Complainant's painful back condition. The Agency failed to provide Complainant with a work at home accommodation for more than two years after it had received from Complainant medical documentation to support his request to work at home. This unreasonable delay and the Agency's failure during the same period of time to take measures that could have prevented Complainant's January 3, 2001, cubicle chair accident are primary events that contributed to significant short-term pain and suffering for Complainant. However, the medical evidence indicates that his degenerative back condition was preexisting, exacerbated by his obesity and was likely to worsen absent the Agency's discriminatory conduct. Further, we decline to draw the conclusion that Complainant's stroke was proximately caused by the Agency's failure to reasonably accommodate Complainant, even if the stroke was related to his use of Vioxx for pain. There is insufficient evidence that most of Complainant's physical and emotional suffering is attributable to the failure to provide him with reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon weighing the Agency's actions that were discriminatory, their overall contribution to, at a minimum, a short-term decline in Complainant's physical condition and the length of time that each act of discrimination occurred, we find that the Agency's overall award of $100,000 is proper. Accordingly, we find that an award of $100,000 is warranted in this case. Our award takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Champion v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720090037 (March 10, 2010) ($125,000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where Complainant suffered depression, anxiety, sleeplessness and required psychiatric treatment as a result of ongoing harassment for two years); <span class="Italic">Brown-Fleming v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667 (October 28, 2010) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages where Complainant experienced anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, disassociation, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships and nightmares because of retaliation).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $100,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720130010 (2013), where the complainant was subjected to rumors that she was having a lesbian relationship with another transportation security officer. In upholding the award, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the AJ primarily relied on testimony from Complainant, two of Complainant's coworkers, and her doctor as objective evidence for awarding $100,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages for emotional distress. Complainant testified that "because of everything that's transpired...it's seriously and adversely affected my health, my lifestyle, my sleep, my attitude, unfortunately. I've been depressed. I've lost sleep Complainant testified, "I had anxiety and stress and I had gone to the emergency room. I complained of chest pains and palpitations, shortness of breath...." Complainant also testified, "But then once this all started, you know with the rumors and the allegations and being removed from the shift, then I started stress eating...started eating poorly." Complainant testified that she went to her primary care physician and asked to be prescribed anti-anxiety medication. Complainant further testified that she became more introverted, lost confidence, and feels that she has stigma attached to her now.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's doctor testified that he recalled having conversations with Complainant about having stressors at work. Complainant's doctor further testified that he prescribed medication for Complainant for anxiety and high blood pressure. Complainant's coworker testified that "she ended up stressed out and just her blood pressure went up and she ended up have a lot of issues with her heart and stuff like that because of the stress that she has been on and the harassment." Another coworker described how the discrimination affected Complainant's reputation:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Q.&#x2003;As you sit here today how would you describe [Complainant's] reputation?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;Totally different. I don't think people respect [Complainant]. You know, once you get moved, you get in this kind of dog pile, if you will, where you're the trouble kid, you're a troublemaker, you know....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal the Agency contends, among other things, that Complainant was diagnosed with coronary heart disease and depression well before Complainant became aware of the alleged rumors in August 2008. We note that the Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">See Wallis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (Nov. 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.,</span> 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987)). However, the Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a complainant has a preexisting condition, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. Second, if the complainant's preexisting condition inevitably would have worsened, the agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination; the burden of proof is on the Agency to establish the extent of this entitlement. <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (citing <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981)). While Complainant had depression and heart disease previously, the record reflects that the discrimination significantly worsened Complainant's symptoms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the Agency's contentions, based on our review of the evidence in light of the Commission's cases regarding non-pecuniary damages awarded for emotional harm, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's award of $100,000. We find that the amount is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with Commission precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other cases, the Commission has awarded similar amounts for emotional harm such as anxiety, depression, stress, loss of self-esteem, sleep problems, humiliation, harm to professional reputation, and high blood pressure. <span class="Italic">See Fivecoat v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110035 (May 15, 2012) ($100,000 awarded as result of a discriminatory hostile work environment where complainant experienced depression, digestive problems, sleep disturbances, crying spells, and episodic high blood pressure); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110036 (Mar. 13, 2012) ($125,000 awarded in 19-month harassment case where complainant experienced anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep problems, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of self-esteem, damage to professional reputation, and withdrawal from relationships); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070015 (May 22, 2008) ($85,000 awarded as a result of a discriminatory hostile work environment that resulted in emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, health problems, anxiety, stress, depression, loss of self-esteem, and excessive fatigue); <span class="Italic">Morrison <span id="Page_1908"></span>v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A50003 (Apr. 18, 2006) ($90,000 awarded in one-year harassment case where complainant experienced depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and where complainant's psychological trauma continued well past the date she resigned from the agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency award of $50,000 to $100,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120132400 (2014), where the agency's failure to accommodate spanned some four years. The Commission also rejected an agency argument that the death of a niece should significantly impact the award where the niece did not die until about three and half years after the original denial of an accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has claimed that she should be awarded $300,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. Complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation from August 2008 through at least December 2012, a more than four-year period. She asserted that the Agency's denial of the reasonable accommodation further exacerbated her depressive illness; caused her to start taking antidepressants; and resulted in anxiety, increased hair loss, sleep disturbances, headaches, and more frequent visits to her physician and therapist. She averred to her need for medications for sleep and, in 2012, for muscle spasms, headaches, and related symptoms. She provided the Physician's letter to corroborate her assertions. The Physician noted that Complainant had to be placed on additional medication and that the Agency's action resulted in the worsening of her medical conditions. The Agency did not challenge the evidence provided by either the Physician or Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that, during this time, Complainant had additional stress in her personal life. Complainant became the guardian for her disabled niece in September 2008. Complainant asserted that this made the need for the accommodation even more important for her. Complainant stated that caring for her niece did not make things worse for her, and that she found it to be therapeutic. She asserted that her depression was related solely to her work situation. However, starting in late 2010, Complainant determined that she could no longer care for her niece and she was placed in an assisted living center. The niece passed away on June 25, 2012. The note from the Physician also indicated that Complainant assumed care for her disabled niece, and noted that this added to the time she needed to prepare in the mornings and supported her request for a later start time. The Physician stated that the grief from the death of her niece compounded Complainant's mood disorder, and after that her antidepressant medication was increased. As noted above, the Agency did not challenge the affidavit provided by Complainant or the letter submitted by the Physician.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that evidence supports a finding that the niece's death had impacted Complainant's medical condition. This occurred in June 2012. We note that Complainant and the Physician both cite the Agency's failure to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation as the reason for the deterioration of Complainant's medical condition. The record showed that Complainant was denied the requested accommodation from August 2008 through at least December 2012, well over four years. The death of her niece only occurred in the last six months of this time period. As such, we find that while the loss of her niece did contribute to her depression, it was the Agency's failure to accommodate Complainant that caused the greater harm to Complainant's well-being.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by Complainant, we find her request for $300,000.00 to be excessive. However, we find that the Agency's award of $50,000.00 is not sufficient in light of the length of time that the unlawful failure to accommodate continued and the extent of the harm caused. Based on the evidence of record concerning the discrimination and the harm that resulted, as well as the non-discrimination related effects of the death of her niece, the Commission finds that Complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $100,000.00. The Commission has awarded comparable amounts in other cases similar to this. <span class="Italic">See Sainz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720030103 (September 19, 2008) (complainant awarded $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages when the agency's unlawful failure to accommodate resulted in complainant's discharge from employment, which caused ongoing depression, low self-esteem, financial difficulties, humiliation and weight gain); <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. Appeal No. 01A34968 (August 10, 2006) (complainant awarded $90,000 in non-pecuniary damages for sleeplessness, high stress and anxiety, loss of concentration and memory, and low self esteem, as evidenced by complainant's testimony and psychotherapist visits.); <span class="Italic">Dildly v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40115 (March 24, 2005), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A50787 (July 22, 2005) (complainant awarded $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages for continued failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for more than 18 months, resulting in extreme distress, gastrointestinal issues, depression, and deteriorating health).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120140216 (2015), the Commission increased an agency damage award of $30,000 to $100,000 noting that it agreed with the agency's assertion that the medical conditions existed before the discrimination but disagreeing with the agency's assessment of its responsibility for the exacerbation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Agency properly determined that Complainant established a nexus between the alleged harm and discrimination. Therefore, the only issue before the Commission is the Agency's determination that Complainant was entitled to $30,000 in non-pecuniary damages. On appeal, Complainant asserted that he is entitled to an amount in excess of $175,000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the supplemental investigation, Complainant stated that he experienced humiliation and depression as a result of the Agency's discriminatory action. He also stated that after the Agency failed to act on his request for accommodation he developed stomach pain, irritable bowel syndrome, shingles, sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. Complainant contended that his medical documentation showed that his asthma worsened to the point of needing a disability retirement due to continued exposure to toxic irritants at work. Complainant also described the stress of having to live on a reduced income due to his retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife also provided a statement supporting her husband's claim that he became depressed and despondent, with little energy or interest in life, following the Agency's failure to accommodate him. She stated that he stopped hiking and riding his bicycle, no longer wanted to go out to restaurants, and began to drink more. She added that Complainant's temper would flare and their marriage became strained. She stated that although Complainant's health conditions and their marriage improved once he retired, he still blamed himself for their reduced standard of living.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In justifying its award of $30,000, the Agency determined that many of the medical conditions attributed by Complainant to the failure to accommodate were actually pre-existing. The Agency noted that Complainant acknowledged that he was diagnosed with asthma in 2001, with major depression in 2003, and with sleep disorders five or six years before he requested accommodation. However, the Agency conceded that Complainant should be compensated for any aggravation of these pre-existing conditions due to the failure to accommodate. The Agency also found that stressors other than the failure to accommodate, including the perception that he was being harassed, dealing with a variety of health problems for both himself and his wife, and the adjustment to retirement, also contributed to the non-pecuniary harms described by Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Agency's reasoning that it cannot be held responsible for the full extent of the harm described by Complainant and his wife. It is clear that the primary medical conditions described by Complainant--major depression, breathing problems, shingles and sleep apnea--all were diagnosed prior to his request for an accommodation. Therefore, we are unpersuaded that Complainant's request for $200,000 in damages should be granted. However, it is also clear from the record that these conditions, especially the breathing problems and depression, were exacerbated by the Agency's failure to accommodate Complainant's disability. The Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co</span>., 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987)). What the record does show is that the Agency, despite the recommendations of its own reasonable accommodation committee, failed to search for a suitable reassignment for Complainant and kept him working for about five months at the position where he continued to be exposed to toxic irritants. Both physical and psychological harm resulted from this inaction, especially in light of Complainant's already fragile health. We do not find that $30,000 is sufficient to compensate Complainant for this harm proximately caused by the Agency's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, we conclude that an award of $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages more appropriately compensates Complainant for the harm caused by the Agency. We find this amount is more consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Franklin v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A00025 and 01A03882 (January 19, 2001) (awarding of $150,000 where complainant and his wife testified that he became withdrawn, depressed, embarrassed, humiliated, lost self esteem, and experienced financial difficulties, after he was denied a reasonable accommodation); <span class="Italic">Durinzi v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A41946 (July 28, 2005) (awarding $120,000 in pecuniary damages where Complainant was denied reasonable accommodation which prevented her from returning to her normal work duty and she provided evidence of the Agency's actions severely impacting her physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, and financial well-being); <span class="Italic">Holland v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01372 (Oct. 2, 2003) (award of $100,000 where the statement of complainant and his psychiatrist showed that he experienced a severe emotional injury <span id="Page_1909"></span>when he continued to experience feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem after he was denied a reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Demarcus I. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120150529 (2017) (increasing an award of $25,000 to $100,000 where the complainant suffered "extreme emotional turmoil" for 14 months and for more than four years after and "marital and familial strain, severe anxiety and stress, extreme humiliation and embarrassment, feelings of dread, insomnia, and feelings of isolation and other post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms necessitating weekly therapy sessions and medication," and the record did not show that the complainant had any preexisting condition that would justify reducing his award).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission reduced a $190,000 award to $100,000 where a four-month delay in providing the complainant with a reasonable accommodation caused her condition to flare-up but other contributing factors were also at play in <span class="italic">Susan B. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020001632 (2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next address the AJ's determination that Complainant was entitled to compensatory damages due to the Agency's failure to promptly respond to Complainant's reasonable accommodation request. Our review of the record supports the AJ's determination that the Agency's violation of the Rehabilitation Act (the four-month delay in processing Complainant's reasonable accommodation request) resulted in Complainant's increased pain and stress which resulted in Complainant's December 14, 2012 departure from work on medical leave and contributed to her subsequent removal from the Agency on July 5, 2013, for inability to perform the essential functions of her position due to medical reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The evidence shows that Complainant saw a physician while she was working in Korea on September 3, 2012, who diagnosed her with CRPS. The physician testified that patients with CRPS experience pain at the same level as pain experienced in childbirth.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The physician explained that "physical and emotional stress will increase the symptom[s] of CRPS and it--the syndrome itself get worse." Accordingly, the physician indicated that the prescribed ergonomic equipment would reduce unnecessary movement and resulting pain in Complainant's arm which would ultimately reduce Complainant's continuing pain. The physician indicated that, initially, Complainant's condition was controlled with nerve block treatment, but "[b]y October, with all that stress, she was getting worse," especially in the beginning of November, and she continued to have more trouble with her hand by December 3, 2012. Complainant's pain increased so much that the physician testified that he recommended Complainant take medical leave on December 14, 2012, which she did.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, despite being on medical leave, Complainant's condition continued to worsen. On January 10, 2013, the physician noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's symptoms increased to the point where she was no longer able to tolerate the working environment and this delay did have considerable impact on her symptom aggravation. The symptoms will continue to be aggravated until her workplace has been configured to reduce physical stress of her affected arm. In addition, she has presented a state of severe emotional distress as a result of her reported struggle with her workplace to receive these accommodations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The physician also noted other factors that attributed to Complainant's emotional distress. Specifically, the physician stated that Complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">had an extreme emotional issue upon receiving a draft of her final performance appraisal and is now seeing a psychiatrist for treatment of her emotional stress related to these work issues. The psychiatrist has diagnosed her with depression and insomnia and he is treating her both clinically and medically for these issues. Therefore, it is my opinion that [Complainant] see continued care to alleviate both emotional and physical stress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The physician further testified at the hearing that Complainant "broke down a lot by January," had lack of sleep, considered having her arm amputated, developed a tremor by January 31, 2013, and by July 2013 the physician, did not believe that Complainant would ever recover from CRPS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that the Agency removed Complainant from employment, effective July 5, 2013, for "inability to perform as a result of a medical condition." Consequently, the physician stated at the hearing and indicated in his notes that "[Complainant's] "lack of accommodation was the primary cause of [the September 2012] flareup."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the physician acknowledged "other factors" attributing to Complainant's emotional stress and physical pain, the physician explained that he believed if Complainant had received the ergonomic equipment within 30 days or sooner of the September 2012 request, her condition would have stabilized, and she would not have had "any kind of problem for doing her regular work routine."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychologist testified that he first evaluated Complainant in September 2014. After evaluation, the psychologist diagnosed Complainant had major depressive disorder secondary to pain, as well as unrelated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The psychologist noted that Complainant's pain from her CRPS caused her depression, including symptoms of sadness, frustration, poor self-esteem, lack of sleep, difficulty sleeping due to pain, and difficulty concentrating. The psychologist also noted that Complainant's family members have to "walk on eggshells" around her because they do not know what mood she will be in on any particular day. The psychologist asserted that Complainant's CRPS is a very painful condition and stress can increase a severe pain problem. The psychologist also identified additional sources of Complainant's stress including her child custody battle with her ex-husband and financial issues since Complainant had not been paid for "quite some time." However, the psychologist clarified that if Complainant did not suffer from pain, "she'd still be working full-time and she wouldn't be suffering from depression and the anxiety that she's going through now."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's anesthesiologist and pain management doctor (anesthesiologist) testified that he began treating Complainant in 2014 and completed a report in April 2015 which indicated that Complainant's CRPS was caused by injury (repetitive typing) while working as a Contract Specialist. The anesthesiologist denied being aware of any intervening causes between the 2012 and August 29, 2019,9 that would have caused Complainant's CPRS flareup. The anesthesiologist clarified that Complainant was in a car accident in September 2013,10 which could have exacerbated her pain, but the anesthesiologist noted that the car accident was not the original cause of her CRPS. A copy of the anesthesiologist's May 29, 2015 evaluation states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">She has right-sided reflect sympathetic dystrophy, CRPS of the right upper extremity, depression and myofascial pain. The patient's injuries are still medically present and debilitating due to her limited response to continued treatment, she will most likely require these injections indefinitely. The patient's continued condition is not due to any preexisting condition and she developed this syndrome because of work requirements. The condition is not likely to resolve. CRPS is not a temporary condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Testimony from Complainant's mother and childhood friend further corroborate Complainant's testimony that her family relationships suffered and became strained after she was not provided a reasonable accommodation for her CRPS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency argues that the AJ's award of non-pecuniary damages was excessive and should be reduced to $30,000. The Agency reasons that Complainant's CPRS injuries occurred due to Complainant's irrational belief that "everyone was out to get her" and did not result from the lack of accommodation. The Agency further reasons that Complainant's increased stress and subsequent emotional breakdown, suicide attempt, depression, and anxiety were attributed to Complainant receiving her annual performance evaluation. Consequently, the Agency asserts that these factors were non-related to the discrimination and the non-pecuniary damages award should be reduced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We concur with the Agency that this award should only encompass the harm Complainant sustained by the discriminatory act at issue to the extent that this discriminatory act exacerbated Complainant's CRPS. In this case, it is evident from the record that Complainant was diagnosed with CRPS in 2005 and she had previously received reasonable accommodations, including the ergonomic equipment at issue, for this condition in 2005 and 2008 and was subsequently able to perform the essential functions of her position. The record supports the AJ's finding that the Agency's four-month delay in providing similar ergonomic equipment was a triggering event which further exacerbated Complainant's major CRPS flareup to the extent that she could not continue working. Additionally, the record supports that the nature of Complainant's condition is further exacerbated by stress induced by her physical pain, including frustration with the delays in processing her reasonable accommodation request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While attributing at least some Complainant's increased pain and subsequent diagnoses of anxiety and depression to the Agency's failure to timely respond to Complainant's reasonable accommodation request, the medical experts acknowledged additional contributing factors to Complainant's decline. These additional factors included significant anxiety caused by Complainant's OCD rather than the actions of the Agency, as well as a contentious child custody battle with her ex-husband. As such, we conclude that the AJ's award of $190,000 did not adequately account for these other factors unrelated to discrimination. We conclude that an award of $100,000 is more consistent with prior EEOC precedent. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Spence v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120093193 (September 12, 2012) ($100,000 awarded in compensatory damages in reasonable accommodation case where harm caused by Agency's actions and other, unrelated factors).</p>
