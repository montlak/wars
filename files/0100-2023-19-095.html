<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-88"><span class="space">C.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">DESERT PALACE</span></span>, CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND THE MIXED-MOTIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Questions continued to surface as to when the mixed-motive analysis applied in Title VII cases after passage of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and the courts of appeals split on the issue. In <span class="Italic">Desert Palace Inc. DBA Ceasars Palace Hotel &#x0026; Casino v. Costa</span>, 539 U.S. 90, 123 S. Ct. 2148 (2003), the Supreme Court resolved that question holding that the mixed-motive analysis was not confined to cases involving direct evidence. Focusing on the precise statutory language of Title VII and the 1991 amendments, the Court found that a mixed-motive analysis can be used regardless of whether the plaintiff relies on circumstantial or direct evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Desert Palace</span>, the Court explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner Desert Palace, Inc., dba Caesars Palace Hotel &#x0026; Casino of Las Vegas, Nevada, employed respondent Catharina Costa as a warehouse worker and heavy equipment operator. Respondent was the only woman in this job and in her local Teamsters bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent experienced a number of problems with management and her co-workers that led to an escalating series of disciplinary sanctions, including informal rebukes, a denial of privileges, and suspension. Petitioner finally terminated respondent after she was involved in a physical altercation in a warehouse elevator with fellow Teamsters member Herbert Gerber. Petitioner disciplined both employees because the facts surrounding the incident were in dispute, but Gerber, who had a clean disciplinary record, received only a 5-day suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent subsequently filed this lawsuit against petitioner in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, asserting claims of sex discrimination and sexual harassment under Title VII. The District Court dismissed the sexual harassment claim, but allowed the claim for sex discrimination to go to the jury. At trial, respondent presented evidence that (1) she was singled out for "intense stalking" by one of her supervisors, (2) she received harsher discipline than men for the same conduct, (3) she was treated less favorably than men in the assignment of overtime, and (4) supervisors repeatedly "stack[ed]" her disciplinary record and "frequently used or tolerated" sex-based slurs against her. 299 F.3d 838, 845-846 (CA9 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this evidence, the District Court denied petitioner's motion for judgment as a matter of law, and submitted the case to the jury with instructions, two of which are relevant here. First, without objection from petitioner, the District Court instructed the jury that "'[t]he plaintiff has the burden of proving. . .by a preponderance of the evidence "that she <span id="Page_758"></span>"suffered adverse work conditions" and that her sex "was a motivating factor in any such work conditions imposed upon her.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 858.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the District Court gave the jury the following mixed-motive instruction:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"'You have heard evidence that the defendant's treatment of the plaintiff was motivated by the plaintiff's sex and also by other lawful reasons. If you find that the plaintiff's sex was a motivating factor in the defendant's treatment of the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict, even if you find that the defendant's conduct was also motivated by a lawful reason.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"'However, if you find that the defendant's treatment of the plaintiff was motivated by both gender and lawful reasons, you must decide whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages. The plaintiff is entitled to damages unless the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant would have treated plaintiff similarly even if the plaintiff's gender had played no role in the employment decision.'" <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner unsuccessfully objected to this instruction, claiming that respondent had failed to adduce "direct evidence" that sex was a motivating factor in her dismissal or in any of the other adverse employment actions taken against her. The jury rendered a verdict for respondent, awarding backpay, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. The District Court denied petitioner's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals initially vacated and remanded, holding that the District Court had erred in giving the mixed-motive instruction because respondent had failed to present "substantial evidence of conduct or statements by the employer directly reflecting discriminatory animus." 268 F.3d 882, 884 (CA9 2001). In addition, the panel concluded that petitioner was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the termination claim because the evidence was insufficient to prove that respondent was "terminated because she was a woman."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 890.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals reinstated the District Court's judgment after rehearing the case <span class="Italic">en banc</span>. 299 F.3d 838 (CA9 2002). The <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court saw no need to decide whether Justice O'Connor's concurrence in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> controlled because it concluded that Justice O'Connor's references to "direct evidence" had been "wholly abrogated" by the 1991 Act. 299 F.3d, at 850. And, turning "to the language" of 2000e-2(m), the court observed that the statute "imposes no special [evidentiary] requirement and does not reference 'direct evidence.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 853. Accordingly, the court concluded that a "plaintiff. . .may establish a violation through a preponderance of evidence (whether direct or circumstantial) that a protected characteristic played 'a motivating factor.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 853-854 (footnote omitted). Based on that standard, the Court of Appeals held that respondent's evidence was sufficient to warrant a mixed-motive instruction and that a reasonable jury could have found that respondent's sex was a "motivating factor in her treatment."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 859. Four judges of the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> panel dissented, relying in large part on "the reasoning of the prior opinion of the three-judge panel."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 866.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>. 537 U.S. 1099 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case provides us with the first opportunity to consider the effects of the 1991 Act on jury instructions in mixed-motive cases. Specifically, we must decide whether a plaintiff must present direct evidence of discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m). Petitioner's argument on this point proceeds in three steps: (1) Justice O'Connor's opinion is the holding of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>; (2) Justice O'Connor's <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> opinion requires direct evidence of discrimination before a mixed-motive instruction can be given; and (3) the 1991 Act does nothing to abrogate that holding. Like the Court of Appeals, we see no need to address which of the opinions in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> is controlling: the third step of petitioner's argument is flawed, primarily because it is inconsistent with the text of 2000e-2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our precedents make clear that the starting point for our analysis is the statutory text<span class="Italic">. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain</span>, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992). And where, as here, the words of the statute are unambiguous, the "'judicial inquiry is complete.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 254 (quoting <span class="Italic">Rubin v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 424, 430 (1981)). Section 2000e-2(m) unambiguously states that a plaintiff need only "demonstrat[e]" that an employer used a forbidden consideration with respect to "any employment practice." On its face, the statute does not mention, much less require, that a plaintiff make a heightened showing through direct evidence. Indeed, petitioner concedes as much. Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Congress explicitly defined the term "demonstrates" in the 1991 Act, leaving little doubt that no special evidentiary showing is required. Title VII defines the term "'demonstrates'" as to "mee[t] the burdens of production and persuasion." 2000e(m). If Congress intended the term "'demonstrates'" to require that the "burdens of production and persuasion" be met by direct evidence or some other heightened showing, it could have made that intent clear by including language to that effect in 2000e(m). Its failure to do so is significant, for Congress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements in other circumstances, including in other provisions of Title 42. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)(B) (stating that an asylum application may not be filed unless an alien "demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence" that the application was filed within one year of the alien's arrival in the United States); 42 U.S.C. 5851(b)(3)(D) (providing that "[r]elief may not be ordered" against an employer in retaliation cases involving whistleblowers under the Atomic Energy Act where the employer is able to "<span class="Italic">demonstrat[e] by clear and convincing evidence</span> that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of such behavior" (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S., at 253 (plurality opinion) ("Only rarely have we required clear and convincing proof where the action defended against seeks only conventional relief ").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, Title VII's silence with respect to the type of evidence required in mixed-motive cases also suggests that we should not depart from the "[c]onventional rul[e] of civil litigation [that] generally appl[ies] in Title VII cases." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. That rule requires a plaintiff to prove his case "by a preponderance of the evidence," <span class="Italic">ibid</span>. using "direct or circumstantial evidence," <span class="Italic">Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 714, n.3 (1983). We have often acknowledged the utility of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products</span>,<span class="Italic"> Inc.</span>, 530 U.S. 133 (2000), we recognized that evidence that a defendant's explanation for an employment practice is "unworthy of credence" is "one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 147 (emphasis added). The reason for treating circumstantial and direct evidence alike is both clear and deep-rooted: "Circumstantial evidence is not only sufficient, but may also be more certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence." <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co.</span>, 352 U.S. 500, 508, n.17 (1957).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The adequacy of circumstantial evidence also extends beyond civil cases; we have never questioned the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence in support of a criminal conviction, even though proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required<span class="Italic">. See Holland v. United States</span>, 348 U.S. 121, 140 (1954) (observing that, in criminal cases, circumstantial evidence is "intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence"). And juries are routinely instructed that "[t]he law makes no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence." 1A K. O'Malley, J. Grenig, &#x0026; W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Criminal 12.04 (5th ed. 2000);<span class="Italic"> see also</span> 4 L. Sand, J. Siffert, W. Loughlin, S. Reiss, &#x0026; N. Batterman, Modern Federal Jury Instructions &#x00B6; 74.01 (2002) (model instruction 74-2). It is not surprising, therefore, that neither petitioner nor its <span class="Italic">amici curiae</span> can point to any other circumstance in which we have restricted a litigant to the presentation of direct evidence absent some affirmative directive in a statute. Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the use of the term "demonstrates" in other provisions of Title VII tends to show further that 2000e-2(m) does not incorporate a direct evidence requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i), 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). For instance, 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) requires an employer to "demonstrat[e] that [it] would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor" in order to take advantage of the partial affirmative defense. Due to the similarity in structure between that provision and 2000e-2(m), it would be logical to assume that the term "demonstrates" would carry the same meaning with respect to both provisions. But when pressed at oral argument about whether direct evidence is required before the partial affirmative defense can be invoked, petitioner did not "agree that. . .the defendant or the employer has any heightened standard" to satisfy. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Absent some congressional indication to the contrary, we decline to give the same term in the same Act a different meaning depending on whether the rights of the plaintiff or the defendant are at issue<span class="Italic">. See Commissioner v. Lundy</span>, 516 U.S. 235, 250 (1996) ("The interrelationship and close proximity of these provisions of the statute 'presents a classic case for application of the "normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Stroop</span>, 496 U.S. 478, 484 (1990))).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons stated above, we agree with the Court of Appeals that no heightened showing is required under 2000e-2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to obtain an instruction under 2000e-2(m), a plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice." Because direct evidence of discrimination is not required in mixed-motive cases, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in giving a mixed-motive instruction to the jury. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor noted that in the 1991 Civil Rights Act "Congress codified a new evidentiary rule for mixed-motive cases arising under Title VII,. . ." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has applied the <span class="Italic">Desert Palace</span> analysis to cases not involving <span id="Page_759"></span>direct evidence. For example, in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A52640 (2006), the Commission used the analysis where the administrative judge found that reprisal was one of several motives for taking actions involving the complainant. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, explained the application of the <span class="Italic">Desert Palace</span> analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Cases such as this in which there is a finding that discrimination was one of multiple motivating factors for an employment action, i.e., in which the agency acted on both lawful and unlawful reasons, are known as "mixed motive" cases. Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), an employer could avoid liability in mixed motive cases if it could show that it would have made the same decision even absent the unlawful factor. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 252 (1989). However, the CRA effectively overruled the part of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> that allowed an employer to avoid liability in this way. The CRA added Section 703 (m) to Title VII, making it clear that a violation is established when a complaining party demonstrates that "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m). A complainant is not required to present direct evidence of discrimination to prove discrimination was a motivating factor for the employment practices at issue in mixed motive cases. <span class="Italic">Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa</span>, 539 U.S. 90, 101 (2003). Once a complainant demonstrates that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action, it is the agency's burden to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor. If the agency is able to make this demonstration, the complainant is not entitled to personal relief, i.e. damages, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or back pay, but may be entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees or costs. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980504 (April 8, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reflects that complainant and Selectee did not have a positive working relationship and that Selectee was very unhappy with complainant's use of the EEO process. In particular, Selectee indicated that she had expressed displeasure with complainant's participation in the EEO process. Based on a review of the record, we agree with the AJ's determination that Selectee's statements establish that Selectee's actions were partially motivated by retaliatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the record also supports the AJ's finding that even absent the discriminatory motive, Selectee would have chosen Co-worker to be her back up, Selectee would have given complainant a counseling statement, complainant was not promised a step increase, and complainant would still have had a workplace violence complaint lodged against him. We note that, with respect to the step increase, complainant was given a performance award to help compensate complainant for money the agency was unable to give him for the time he spent as acting Clinical Director. The record also supports Selectee's testimony that she and other employees were intimidated by the complainant and that he may have acted in an inappropriate, intimidating manner towards them.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">de Armas v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720060085 (2007) (applying <span class="Italic">Desert</span> Palace to direct evidence case).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency's nonselection of the complainant was based on retaliation for EEO activity but also the complainant's lack of interpersonal skills, the administrative judge properly applied the mixed-motive analysis in <span class="Italic">Montante v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120110240 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases such as this, where there is evidence that discrimination was one of multiple motivating factors for an employment action, i.e., in which the agency acted on the bases of both lawful and unlawful reasons, are known as "mixed motive" cases.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Enforcement Guidance. Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), an employer could avoid liability in mixed motive cases if it could show that it would have made the same decision even absent the unlawful factor. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</span> 490 U.S. 228 (1989). However, the CRA effectively overruled the part of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> that allowed an employer to avoid liability in this way. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m); EEOC Compliance Manual, at 8-II(E)(1). A complainant is not required to present direct evidence of discrimination to prove discrimination was a motivating factor for the employment practices at issue in mixed motive cases. <span class="Italic">Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</span> 539 U.S. 90, 101 (2003). Once a complainant demonstrates that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action, it is the agency's burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor. If the agency is able to make this demonstration, the complainant is not entitled to personal relief, i.e., damages, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, back pay, but may be entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees or costs. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980504 (Apr. 8, 1999). Accordingly, in this case, we agree with the AJ that Complainant is not entitled to personal relief because the Agency would not have selected Complainant even if S1 had not considered Complainant's prior protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mixed-motive analysis is not proper, however, where the administrative judge determines that the agency's sole reason for acting was discriminatory or retaliatory. For example, in <span class="Italic">Detenbeck v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0720070055 (2007), the Commission rejected an argument that the judge committed legal error by not applying the mixed-motive analysis. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Detenbeck</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the present case cannot be characterized as a mixed-motive case. Here, the agency articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, namely that that complainant had a harsh and abrasive management style, but the AJ found that reason to be pretextual. He specifically found that retaliation for complainant's EEO activity was the single motivating reason for her removal, and not one of multiple reasons. Accordingly, we find that the AJ properly applied the appropriate analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission similarly rejected an administrative judge's finding that the supervisor's personal dislike for the specialist was an alternate motive sufficient to rise to the level of a mixed motive in <span class="Italic">Emery S. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120180727 (2018). The supervisor's "intense personal dislike for the complainant was so intertwined with his prior protected EEO activity as to be indistinguishable" according to the Commission in <span class="Italic">Emery S</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that substantial evidence in the record does not support the AJ's conclusion that there was evidence of multiple motivating factors for the employment actions. . . . According to the record, S1 disliked Complainant in large part because Complainant had filed an EEO complaint alleging that S1 assaulted him. Further, S1's relationship with Complainant had deteriorated following Complainant's contact with is Congressman, which included raising concerns of employment discrimination. Because we find that S1's intense personal dislike for Complainant stemmed directly from Complainant's prior protected EEO activity, S1 disliking Complainant was not a motivating reason that was separate from S1's retaliatory motive. Therefore, his intense personal dislike for Complainant was not a lawful reason for taking the employment actions against Complainant, and mixed-motive analysis does not apply. Accordingly, the burden does not shift to the Agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions even absent discrimination. Therefore, Complainant is entitled to personal relief, including reinstatement, compensatory damages, and back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of a mixed-motive case where the agency prevailed is <span class="Italic">Fulghen v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120073130 (2009). In that case, the complainant, a customer service associate, reported for work without the key to her till. The complainant waited for her supervisor to show up and assist her, but did not actually inform anyone that she had forgotten her key. Although signed in for work, the complainant instead began reading a bible. Eventually an acting manager was informed that the complainant was on the clock, but not working and was, instead, reading a bible. The acting manager called the Postal Police and asked them to meet her at the facility to deal with what she thought was an irrational employee. In speaking with the Postal Police, the acting manager specifically emphasized that the complainant was reading a bible. The acting manager and Postal Police went to the facility and the manager told the complainant she needed to end her tour and leave if she was not going to work. The complainant then told the manager that she would "pay for it." The complainant was placed on emergency leave and later issued a 14-day suspension. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Fulghen</span>, upheld the findings of the administrative judge that the agency had both a prohibited and legitimate reason for the initial decision to take her off the clock, and that the subsequent decisions to place her on emergency leave and suspend her were not motivated by discrimination or retaliation:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The AJ concluded that AM's testimony was not credible and that her behavior at the hearing was an attempt to obscure the truth in the case. The AJ further concluded that evidence supported the finding that AM made the decision to remove complainant from the workplace when she learned that complainant was reading a Bible instead of working. The AJ concluded that AM was motivated to remove complainant from the work-place in part because of the fact that she was reading a Bible, which was evidenced by the statements she made to the Postal Police. The AJ concluded, based upon the credible testimony provided by the Postal Police, that AM had made the decision to remove complainant before she arrived at the facility and that AM emphasized complainant's reading of religious material.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The AJ noted that AM testified that she did not bring the Postal Police to complainant's work area to have her removed from the building. Rather, AM stated that she called the Postal Police to have complainant's badge deactivated. The AJ found this explanation for bringing the Postal Police not credible. The AJ concluded that in order to believe AM's explanation, he would have to believe that AM intended to deactivate complainant's identification badge but leave her in place at the work site. The AJ did not credit this explanation and concluded that the preponderance of the evidence shows that AM was motivated, in part, by complainant's religious activity and her failure to work while on the clock. The AJ further concluded that the latter is a legitimate factor in her decision but the former <span id="Page_760"></span>is not. Moreover, the AJ noted that AM testified that she made the decision to place complainant on emergency placement because complainant threatened her. However, the AJ concluded that the credible evidence shows that AM had already made the decision to put complainant out of the work place before she arrived at the Penobscot facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Accordingly, the AJ concluded that AM articulated a legitimate reason for placing complainant off of the clock, which complainant did not show as being a pretext for discrimination. Accordingly, because the AJ concluded that the record established both legitimate and non-legitimate motives for placing complainant off of work, the AJ determined that a "mixed motive" analysis was appropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Cases such as this, in which there is a finding that discrimination was one of multiple motivating factors for an employment action, i.e., in which the agency acted on both lawful and unlawful reasons, are known as "mixed motive" cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Revised <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory</span>, N-915.002, 21 (July 14, 1992). Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), an employer could avoid liability in mixed motive cases if it could show that it would have made the same decision even absent the unlawful factor. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 252 (1989). However, the CRA effectively overruled the part of Price Waterhouse that allowed an employer to avoid liability in this way. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m); EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8: Retaliation (May 20, 1998), at 8-II(E)(1). A complainant is not required to present direct evidence of discrimination to prove discrimination was a motivating factor for the employment practices at issue in mixed motive cases. <span class="Italic">Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa</span>, 539 U.S. 90, 101 (2003). Once a complainant demonstrates that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action, it is the agency's burden to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factor. If the agency is able to make this demonstration, the complainant is not entitled to personal relief (i.e., damages, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or back pay) but may be entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees, and/or costs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980504 (April 8, 1999); <span class="Italic">Dearmas v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060085 (July 26, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Here, the AJ concluded that the preponderance of evidence established that AM would have taken the same action even if she had not considered the discriminatory factor. The AJ also concluded that complainant's statement to AM that she would pay for her actions constituted a threat. In addition, the AJ noted that since that threat was made after AM had already made her decision to place complainant off duty, the evidence is after-acquired. Moreover, the AJ concluded that the probative evidence in the case establishes that the agency would normally place an employee who makes a threat in a non-duty status. Accordingly, the AJ concluded that while the agency is liable for discriminatory conduct, its liability is limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">With respect to the second claim, the AJ concluded that complainant was not able to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency retaliated against her by issuing her a 14-day suspension because she has failed to come forward with evidence to show that the agency's reason for suspending her was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the AJ noted that the agency proffered credible evidence to establish that it suspended complainant for threatening AM. The AJ concluded that complainant had not presented sufficient evidence showing that management's articulated reason was false or was motivated by retaliatory motives. Therefore, the AJ concluded that complainant did not prove that the agency retaliated against her by issuing the 14-day suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Secretary of Homeland Security,</span> 0720090031 (2010), the agency did not prevail where it did not raise a mixed-motive defense at the hearing. In that case, the administrative judge found that the complainant was subjected to increased work scrutiny, issued a letter of warning and had a document surreptitiously appended to her performance appraisal in retaliation for protected EEO activity. The judge specifically found the action were motivated in part by retaliation and in part by the number of mistakes that the complainant made in her work. Although characterizing the case as one involving the mixed-motive analysis, the judge awarded $15,000 in compensatory damages. On appeal, the agency argued that the judge could not award damages in a mixed-motive case. In rejecting the agency's argument in <span class="Italic">Gomez</span>, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Agency's argument that the damages awarded in this case are contrary to law, in that this case was characterized as a mixed-motive case and therefore Complainant should not be allowed personal damages. The Agency is correct in arguing that compensatory damages are not awarded in mixed-motive cases; however, the Commission finds that this case was mischaracterized as a mixed-motive case. For example, the evidence shows that Complainant argued that her work was excessively scrutinized. The Agency explained that her work was excessively scrutinized because she made a lot of mistakes. The AJ found that the excessive scrutiny of Complainant's work was due in part because of reprisal from S1 and in part because Complainant made a lot of mistakes. The question before us, however, is whether the Agency was unlawfully motivated by Complainant's sex, age, physical disability, and/or retaliation for prior EEO activity when it excessively scrutinized Complainant's work as compared to others, when she received a written warning, and when the surreptitious attachment was made to her performance appraisal. The AJ found that S1 was motivated by Complainant's prior EEO activity. We find that the Agency, on appeal, has not shown this finding to be in error. Moreover, the Commission notes the Agency's acknowledgment that it did not consider this to be a mixed-motive case. In its appeal brief, the Agency indicates that it "neither argued for nor intended to put forth evidence of a mixed motive at hearing."</p>
