<h2 class="h2">INAPPROPRIATE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">It's too bad that you can't wave a magic wand and have everyone in your work unit behave in an appropriate manner. However, people are people and instances of inappropriate conduct will inevitably surface. As a federal manager, you know this all too well. But some behaviors do not rise to the level necessitating immediate adverse or disciplinary action, but they do need to be addressed and documented for potential use in the chain of progressive discipline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some of the more common forms of inappropriate workplace behavior will be covered in this section. While circumstances and employee issues will be unique to each incident of inappropriate conduct, the following information will offer you practical guidance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Consistency is key.</b> One of the most important things you can do as a manager when confronted with inappropriate behavior is to be consistent in your response. Find the right balance because:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Being too lenient toward some employees may be perceived as favoritism and draw formal or informal complaints against you.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Being too harsh at the first sign of minor misconduct will earn you a reputation as being unreasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">By acting consistently, you clearly establish the boundaries of workplace conduct. It also serves to lay the foundation for increased discipline if necessary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even though the incidents described here may seem relatively minor, be sure to consult your HR department if you have any doubt or questions about a consistent and appropriate response. You want to handle it properly now to avoid problems down the road.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Bullying in the workplace</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Being the target of a bully is a difficult situation. Confronting a bully is intimidating and reporting this behavior may result in worse bullying, or even being ostracized by peers. So victims often suffer in silence, or leave the work unit or agency without explanation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the workplace, bullying can hurt your employees and have a negative impact on their performance and the agency bottom line. Managers need to be able to spot it and act against it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>What is bullying?</b> Bullying has many forms, but the basic types are emotional, verbal, and physical. In the workplace, a person may be exposed repeatedly to negative acts from coworkers, supervisors, or subordinates over a period of time. Bullies employ a number of tactics that include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Open verbal abuse (shouting, public humiliation, offensive remarks, name-calling, ridiculing, teasing).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Hidden verbal abuse (false rumors, attack on reputation, withholding vital information).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pulling practical jokes.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employing subtle methods of coercion such as intimidation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Excluding others or socially isolating them.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Holding, impeding, or blocking movement.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Following and stalking.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Touching or any other physical contact or advances.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Excessively micromanaging employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Blaming others without justification.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Setting impossible goals for subordinates to reach.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Recognize bullying.</b> It is unlikely that you will personally observe many incidents of bullying. Most people are smart enough to alter their behavior when the boss is around. Those who do observe it will usually do nothing. If the bully faces no objection from observers, they will take it as permission to continue behaving badly. And since nobody wants to tattle on a coworker, an incident of bullying will probably not be reported directly to you.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That's why it's important for you to closely monitor staff behavior to detect bullying. For instance, you may notice a particular employee is:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Often excluded from social gatherings.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Teased repeatedly.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Gossiped about.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Frequently absent or late.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Unhappy at work.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">These can all be signals that something is wrong. Don't ignore the signs. Be the manager who follows up on any suspicion that bullying is taking place. Your employees will appreciate it and your work environment will benefit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Supervisors who bully.</b> Bullies aren't always coworkers. It is not uncommon for some in management to abuse their power and bully their subordinates. It may also be one of the more difficult types of bullying to detect since many supervisors work with a degree of autonomy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees are also afraid to report supervisor bullying because they fear retaliation. As bad as coworker bullying may be, a supervisor who browbeats subordinates is probably more hurtful to the individual and detrimental to the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> It would be easy to categorize an assertive supervisor as a bully. Keep in mind that every supervisor/employee working relationship is unique. A supervisor who is trying to get the work done may be perceived as a bully by a subordinate who does not like to be held accountable. If you are asked to investigate an allegation of supervisor bullying, be sure to examine it from every aspect, including the trail of documentation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Confront the behavior.</b> Before going it alone or assuming you know the right approach, consult your HR office for guidance on how to deal with bullies. You don't want to make a bad situation more volatile. There also may be union issues and EEO concerns you need to know about.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At the heart of a bully's behavior is a sense of low self-esteem. Because they have such a low opinion of themselves, they strike at others in a desperate need to increase their own self-importance. From a managerial standpoint, it is critical that you confront their conduct. In almost all cases, they will be taken aback by a frank discussion. The biggest mistake you can make as a manager is ignoring the bullying until it results in a crisis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are two techniques to help you confront the behavior:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r"><b>1.</b></span> <b>Set up a meeting with the bully in your office and talk one-on-one.</b> Be direct -- but not confrontational or emotional. Don't personalize the issue. You're not asking the bully to change their personality. Rather, you're insisting they curb the speech or actions that are adversely affecting you or their coworkers. In other words, the bully's behavior must change. During this conversation, be specific about the conduct that is impacting you or others. Too often we confuse the person with their conduct. Steer clear of sweeping generalizations.</li>
<li><span class="num-r"><b>2.</b></span> <b>Ask for the bully's thoughts of the situation.</b> Those who study bullies in the workplace report that you may be in for a pleasant surprise. Rather than arguing, getting confrontational, or attempting to "bully back," their demeanor often softens. This is because you are catering to their need for self-importance. Asking for the bully's thoughts conveys your value of their opinion and assessment. Feeding the bully's ego in this manner may be your best strategy to help them like themself better and not feel the need to lash out at others.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Why you must act.</b> Failure to act on a case of bullying may expose your agency to EEO liability. If bullying is based on gender, includes sexual harassment, or involves, for example, ethnic slurs, it creates a hostile work environment. The liability exposure is even more serious if the bully is a supervisor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Upon the first instance of bullying, counseling is usually employed explaining why the behavior is unacceptable, with full documentation. Bullying can be noted in a performance appraisal and to lower a performance rating, if there is an appropriate standard, such as cooperating with others.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the bullying continues, be prepared to pursue progressive discipline. Continuous bullying makes it more difficult to get the work done. This clearly has a negative effect on the efficiency of the service, the first requirement for discipline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> If you haven't already consulted HR about a bullying situation, now is the time to do so. HR can advise you on the best path to take.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Preventive measures.</b> Your behavior and leadership style will set the tone for bullying in your office. A passive or non-reactive approach will send the message that bullying is condoned or not a big deal. On the other hand, immediately investigating and acting decisively when warranted will convey that bullying will not be tolerated. If you want to prevent bullying and avoid a hostile or unhealthy work environment, take the latter approach. You can also:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Seek employee input and participation.</b> Remember that everyone likes to feel important, especially office bullies. Ask for their opinions or participation on appropriate matters.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Be consistent and predictable.</b> Employees who are unsure of expectations can become frustrated. Your consistency will ease anxiety, which may contribute to inappropriate behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Set employee relationship limits.</b> Engaging in relationships with employees that are personal or too informal can lead to misunderstandings and can lead to other employees feeling alienated. Be aware of those relationships and either scale them back or establish them with your entire unit.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Gather all the facts from all the parties.</b> Your employees must know that you will not pass judgment at the first mention of bullying. If it is understood that you will investigate the incident and collect the facts from all parties, there is a lower likelihood that actual bullying and false reports of bullying will occur.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Find things to compliment.</b> Aside from your own behavior, this is perhaps the most important preventive measure of all. Praising would-be bullies feeds their need to be valued and important. Find things they are doing right and tell them so. Be sure the compliments are genuine because insincere flattery will be transparent and counterproductive.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Texth"><b>Set up mandatory training.</b> A particularly effective measure to prevent bullying is mandatory staff training on the topic. This will:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Educate staff on the various forms of bullying.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Bring the issue to the forefront, so staff can openly discuss it.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Serve notice that such behavior will not be tolerated.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Demonstrate that respect is a valued component in work relationships.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Empower employees to report it when encountered or observed.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Document staff awareness of agency policy or practice if the "ignorance" defense surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Check with your HR office to find out what is available to you and be proactive to get training scheduled before you are faced with bullying behavior or before a victim of bullying leaves your unit.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Use of profanity</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">While many think it's fun to use profanity or that it's a good way to put an exclamation point on their statement, it does nothing more than "dumb down" the individual using it and create an image of unprofessionalism for your agency. It can also be offensive to coworkers, and those who use it are generally not considered articulate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When used by a manager, cursing is crass and rarely serves to motivate staff. However, it is definitely a means by which to intimidate others. This is not exactly the best management style to model.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">All federal agencies generally require employees to keep their language in check, but the boundaries are not specific. While the occasional dirty word can be harmless, if it gets out of hand, and involves insubordination or threats, it can provide the basis for discipline and even removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Use common sense.</b> What's important is the comfort level of your staff. If you and your employees don't mind the occasional curse word or colorful comment, then there's little for you to do. However, if the language is starting to bother members of your staff, you should intervene. Use your common sense and act accordingly.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Keep in mind that instilling general respect in the workplace is one of the foundations of EEO laws. When management does nothing to curtail foul language, morale and productivity may suffer, and EEO complaints frequently result.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Curb the cussing.</b> While it may be an attractive option, washing out the mouths of the offending parties with soap will cause you even more problems than their use of foul language. But as the manager, you dictate the atmosphere in your office. Your inaction sends a clear message that there are no limits to profane language. The last thing you need is to foster an offensive or hostile work environment, so here are a few pointers to get everyone on the same page.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The reality is that every office has staff members who use profanity, regardless of your efforts. Make it known what the tolerance level is. When an employee uses language that's too strong, take them aside and let them know.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Distinguish between profanity used harmlessly or to blow off steam and profanity that's directed at a person. If the language is directed at someone, you should intervene, and discipline might be in order.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Make sure everyone is comfortable with the use of profanity -- even if it's mild. People who are offended by profanity may be hesitant to speak up.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Set an example. If you want to curb the use of profanity in the office, cut back yourself. Try substituting profanity for words or phrases that are less offensive, such as "darn," "shoot," or "Judas Priest"!</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> If suggestions and mild intervention fail to change the behavior, some discipline may be required. If the problem persists, the level of discipline should be increased accordingly. Check with your HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Policy enables consistency and action.</b> Policies that emphasize basic respect for all employees are necessary and can go so far as to specifically prohibit the use of profanity. Know your agency's policy and ensure your employees know it too. Don't assume they know the difference between acceptable and unacceptable language. With a diverse and multi-generational federal workforce, the differences may be expansive. Then, be consistent in following the policy and taking action. This clear understanding by everyone and corrective action by you may prevent future incidents from occurring.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Permissible profanity.</b> The labor relations law gives union officials protected status when they are performing representation functions, such as pursuing grievances and other activities. This protected status means that a loud voice, aggressive presentation of issues, and foul language do not exceed the bounds of protected activity. This is considered robust debate and must be tolerated by managers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your refusal to deal with a union representative simply because they spouted profanity may constitute an unfair labor practice. Check with your labor relations specialist to gain a complete understanding of the union rep's legally protected behavior before you act against their use of profanity.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Gossip</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The office grapevine exists in every workplace. It's an underground network for circulating news and can actually be a healthy form of communication. Employees are going to chat with each other about work-related issues, as well as personal and mundane stuff.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, all too often, a dark side of the grapevine emerges -- gossip. Gossip takes advantage of grapevine news and often puts a malicious spin on it, then passes it on. Gossip usually carries a negative tone directed at individuals or groups. Once gossip takes hold, the grapevine news is not news at all and may require managerial action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your role as manager is to make sure the work gets done and your staff has an environment they're comfortable working in. It is essential that you have a healthy balance of social networking and productivity in your workplace. If inappropriate gossip is tilting that balance, you need to address it before it creates a hostile work environment or leads to discriminatory harassment. If you take no action once you become aware of the gossip, there is the possibility of agency liability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One way to get a handle on gossip is to know what is going on in your unit. This will require you to step away from your desk and stroll through the workplace. Grab a cup of coffee in the lunchroom or take the long way to your office to get a general idea of what is happening, whether it is good, bad, or neutral.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you establish a regular presence, you will learn about your employees through observation and discussion. You will realize which employee always works through lunch or who always seems to be chatting with other employees. You will also get a sense of how your employees interact with one another and their working environment. There is no need to write down notes, but being visible gives your employees the opportunity to approach you if rumors or gossip need to be dispelled or clarified. Your presence will serve as a resource to your employees which may help keep gossip in check.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Gossip victimizes.</b> Individuals, groups, and even your work unit are potential victims of gossip. For example, the grapevine may pass on the word that Maria is in line to get the next promotion in the unit, even before the manager makes the announcement. Gossip would editorialize and add, "probably because she's a brown-noser."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Gossip in the workplace is intended to sway people against a target and often results in taking sides, ganging up on, or isolating people. These camps or cliques within an office are counterproductive to an inclusive workforce and can be detrimental to the workplace culture you want to nurture.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Reacting to gossip about you.</b> Since you are a manager, gossip will inevitably be about you. From rumors that you are playing favorites to theories that you are blacklisting certain employees. Instead of dismissing a rumor or immediately going after the source, try to determine if there is any fraction of truth behind it. Remove the emotion and ask yourself:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Do I play favorites?</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Am I withholding promotional opportunity from an employee who filed a complaint against me?</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Am I part of a certain office clique?</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Do I practice what I preach?</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> What would cause such gossip?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Your best reaction is to take a moment to rationally and objectively think it through and then respond accordingly.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Reacting to gossip about others.</b> As the manager, it is up to you to take action as soon as gossip reaches your desk. If you don't act, negative consequences may seep in. Gossip can:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Affect employee work.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Create workplace hostility.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Promote distrust.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Distract employees from their jobs.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Ruin morale.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Affect your authority.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Create liability issues if not acted on by you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Beyond the obvious course of modeling acceptable behavior yourself, you can react to office gossip by:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Speaking to the involved employees individually, not as a group.</b> Let them know that you're aware of what's going on and you won't tolerate it. Your clear instruction will form the foundation for progressive discipline, if the incident is repeated.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Remembering your position.</b> Everyone enjoys a chat about subjects of common interest, but remember, you are the boss, and you are held to a higher standard. Your casual remarks are given greater weight because of your position. Employees may take your behavior as a model for the workplace.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Gathering information.</b> It's unrealistic to think you can stop people from gossiping -- you can't. But even as distasteful as it is, you need to pay attention to what is said. Gossip is your link to what your employees really think. Avoid taking offense when you hear true things expressed informally. The information you gather can reveal problems of which you were unaware. Once you separate truth from fiction, you can examine the concerns of your staff and act accordingly.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Stopping inappropriate gossip.</b> Do not permit, let alone encourage, sexual banter and gossip harmful to particular workers or expressing any form of prejudice. These things lead to harassment, grievances, and EEO complaints. They also hurt individual and unit performance.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Getting ahead of negative rumors.</b> When gossip carries rumors that may hurt your mission, take action to see your employees are properly informed and understand what they need to do in any situation. A manager usually isn't accountable to subordinates, but explaining certain decisions can go a long way toward preventing harmful and malicious gossip.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The discipline step.</b> In most instances, gossiping ceases following a counseling session between the manager and the offending employee. But if you give an employee documented notice to cut out the gossip, and if the employee is afterward shown to have disregarded those instructions, there exist good grounds for discipline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> Gossip in general, like the grapevine on which it feeds, is probably inevitable, and you can't expect to wipe it out. What you can do is put employees on notice that particularly harmful gossip is off limits, and that those who persist will be disciplined.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Time pilfering</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Personal emailing, chatting, phone calls, Web surfing, social networking, smoking and coffee breaks, and excessive late arrivals and early departures result in lost productivity and are common forms of time pilfering. Some managers may not view them as anything serious, but would the taxpayers agree?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There's nothing wrong with allowing an employee to be late every now and then, or excusing an overly long lunch when the employee has a good reason. Employees will always have a need to handle personal matters while at work. However, you should not allow infractions, even minor ones, to become a standard practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Don't look the other way.</b> Ignoring unproductive behavior will give your staff the idea that it's acceptable, especially if you take no action to correct it. If employees know that they can routinely arrive late or take as much time as they want for lunch, they will become inclined to do so. Boundaries have to be established and you must apply the rules consistently to all employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You would be wise to remind your employees that using time, for which they are being paid to do the government's work, for their personal benefit or pleasure will not be tolerated. Make expectations, and exceptions, clear, and immediately address any inappropriate behavior with employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Know your own policy on work breaks.</b> It is critical that you know your agency's policy on work breaks during duty time, and you must ensure that your workers know it as well. There is no governmentwide policy on breaks. However, most agencies and facilities have policies at various levels that determine how much duty time workers can use for breaks, when they should occur, and the like. These may be governed by negotiated agreements that apply to bargaining unit employees. HR has the particulars.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is up to you to enforce these policies. You certainly may use your discretion -- such as when employees are working under harsh conditions and common sense suggests a break is a good idea. But your employees may want to do things like save their breaks and then take a longer lunch or quit early -- or they may want to take breaks at irregular times most convenient to them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some flexibility from time to time may be OK, but be careful. If your employees are in a bargaining unit, you may create a "past practice" that is as binding as the agreement your agency negotiated with the union.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is best to:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Make your break policy specific.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Follow the advice of HR.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Communicate the policy to your employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Enforce it consistently.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> Fatigue and sleepiness can cause employees to take unscheduled breaks at their workstations. Generally, you can insist that your employees remain productive during paid duty time and use breaks and lunch to deal with fatigue. Check with HR if this is an ongoing problem.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Be creative in order to encourage a full day of productivity.</b> Enforcement of regulations and rules is only part of the solution to time pilfering &#x2013; the negative part. As with most management issues, you are better off if you can also use positive incentives that make people want to focus on their work and lead them to avoid abuse of time and of the flexibilities you may grant them. Here are positive actions you can take to encourage a full day of productivity:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Value the contributions of employees.</b> If employees feel the value of their work is not recognized, they are more likely to slack off and shift their focus to anything other than work. Expressing the value of their contributions should be part of your leadership strategy.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Encourage teamwork and explain the mission.</b> Show employees how their work affects the jobs of their coworkers and fits into your unit's mission, so they will understand the negative consequences of wasted time.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Organize jobs optimally.</b> Make sure your employees are not being frustrated by unclear duties, confusing chains of command, and other organizational problems that hurt job motivation and lead to disinterest and time pilfering.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Let them know you're paying attention.</b> A manager who has no interest in their employees will send a clear message that what employees do during the day is not important. Stop in on each employee at least once per day to see how they're doing. Ask about what they're working on and engage in a little conversation. If they know that you may pop in at any time, they may be less likely to goof off and stay focused on their work. Plus, it lets them know you care, which reinforces their value to the agency.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Try to obtain the resources your employees need.</b> One reason employees are tempted to pilfer time is a perception that their jobs cannot be done well with the time, staff, and material resources available. They may feel they'll never catch up, so it's best to just avoid everything. Do your best to alleviate real problems, and let your employees know that you see their difficulties and are trying to obtain relief. When you can't provide more resources, or don't believe they are needed, work with your employees to determine how they can do the best job possible with the resources at hand.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Be flexible and generous in granting leave requests and excusing unavoidable absences.</b> Your employees must be able to balance their personal and professional lives. Grant legitimate leave requests whenever possible and be flexible when employees ask for leave at the last minute. The more your employees can see that you do your best to accommodate their personal needs, the less likely they are to abuse your flexibility. But don't overdo it and be sure you're consistent with all employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Above all, set a good example.</b> Many managers who are quick to criticize the time wasted by their employees are slow to examine their own behavior. If you come to work late, take two-hour lunch breaks, have a card game viewable to all on your monitor, or bombard staff with emails containing jokes, links, and videos unrelated to work, your employees will notice and model their behavior after yours. Be the model of productivity and never engage in, promote, or condone any form of time pilfering.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Playing by the rules.</b> Allowing employees to regularly break the rules only sets you up for discipline problems. Enforcing the rules lets employees know what is and is not acceptable. It places your employees on notice that tardiness, long lunches, and other minor infractions will not be allowed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But punishing violators does not mean throwing the book at them. In fact, it's better to consider the minimum penalty necessary to correct the misconduct. Consult with your HR department to learn your options and stay consistent with past incidents of a similar nature.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Responding to infractions.</b> There are a number of ways you can respond to those who pilfer time. Depending on the type, pattern, history, and severity of the infractions, your options are wide-ranging. Counseling is usually a good starting point, and you may even allow a "pass" on the first infraction. Just be aware that your response sets the precedent and it will be expected thereafter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prior to reacting to infractions, be careful to ensure that the incident isn't covered by any applicable collective bargaining agreement. You certainly don't want to take action against permitted behavior. For questions, consult with your labor relations specialist.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Two of the most common infractions occur when employees engage in social communication and abuse attendance. These are evident in practically every government and private industry office. There are ways in which you can deal with them, which are illustrated below.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Social communication</b> infractions consist of things such as personal emails, chats, phone calls, instant messaging, Web surfing, and social networking. Consider the following response actions:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Disallow the personal communication device in the workplace.</b> Barring an employee from bringing her smartphone or tablet to the workplace can hinder personal social networking. At the very least, it eliminates the overt use of such devices for that purpose.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Pull the phone records.</b> If your agency provides government-issued cell phones to employees for their job, talk to HR about pulling the phone records so you can examine the incoming and outgoing call logs. A little investigative work will tell you how much time is being spent on personal vs. government business. You can either bring abusive patterns to the employee's attention or rescind the phone.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Visit social networks.</b> Once you've determined that your employee is chatting during work hours and you have counseled them about it, examine their activity by visiting their social networking sites to examine new posts. If you're able to gain access, you can determine if comments were posted during work hours, and then respond appropriately.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Monitor usage.</b> Work with HR and your agency's information technology office to install computer usage monitoring software that will show websites being visited by your employee. There are several free versions available. If there is an ongoing problem, this will pinpoint it.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Restrict access.</b> Blocking access to certain Internet sites will reduce time spent away from the government's work. Many blocking programs also have category filters to tailor your needs. Just be sure that you don't hinder your business purpose with the use of these programs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Attendance infractions</b> consist of late reporting to work, slow start of the workday, extended breaks or lunch periods, preparing to leave well before the shift ends, and disappearing to places unknown for lengthy periods of time. Consider the following response actions:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Use a tracking system.</b> Whether it's a time clock, sign-out board, or building badge reader system, keep track of comings and goings of staff, not only in and out of your office, but also throughout the building.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Have employees report directly to you.</b> When they arrive to work, return from lunch, take breaks, and leave work, have them personally check in or email you. It may be a hassle, but it will keep employees honest and conscientious about their time in the office.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Walk around.</b> You won't know if an employee is sitting at their desk 30 minutes before the end of their workday, with their coat on and computer off, unless you observe it with your own eyes. Take a stroll through your workspace and see if people are where they should be, doing what they're supposed to be doing.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Charge leave or AWOL.</b> Require the abusive employee to submit leave for the pilfered time or charge them as AWOL. Employees can even be charged as AWOL if they are at their workplace but not at their workstation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Inappropriate workplace behavior makes everyone uncomfortable. As a manager, you have an obligation to address each instance to avoid a greater escalation of the problem and keep your work unit functioning without distraction. The tips below may help you.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore inappropriate workplace behavior.</b> Failure to act may expose your agency to EEO liability and a discontent workforce.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Try to change a bully's personality.</b> Focus instead on changing their behavior.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Use profanity in your daily speech.</b> It creates an unprofessional image and may intimidate your employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Permit inappropriate gossip.</b> Set limits and don't allow any form of prejudice, sexual banter, or harmful gossip to permeate staff. This will ensure that individuals and unit performance are not hurt.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Am I expected to keep track of every minor incident of misconduct?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You are not only expected to keep track of each incident, but you are also expected to address every incident of misconduct that you become aware of. If you ignore the problem, you will be inviting EEO complaints and potentially create a hostile work environment, which is a poor reflection on your ability to lead and manage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I have an employee who needs close supervision and deadlines to keep him on track. Is this considered bullying?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. Trying to get the work done by holding employees accountable is not considered bullying. If you have a legitimate reason, such as performance, for your close supervision, then execute it without fear of being labeled a managerial bully.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I sometimes join in the fun of teasing one of our quiet employees. He laughs along with us and doesn't seem to mind, so surely it can't be considered bullying, right?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Wrong. Your behavior sets the tone for bullying in your workplace, and teasing an employee crosses the line. You are sending the message that it is OK for everybody to tease that particular employee. You also may be opening yourself and your agency to a harassment complaint. Now would be a good time to change your behavior.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. When I'm arguing my position with subordinates, I use profanity to accentuate my point. It's just the way I talk and they are more responsive when I curse. If it works, why change?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> It works because you're intimidating staff by using profanity. Your subordinates already defer to your authority. There is no need to further intimidate them by using foul language. Try to refrain from profanity the next time you're engaged in a discussion. You will be better served making your argument successful on its merit rather than scaring your employees into submission. They will also feel more comfortable to share their valuable ideas and opinions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Gossip -- who needs it?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Actually, you may need it. Gossip can be your link to employee opinions and buzz around the office. Use it to your advantage to find out about real problems so they can be corrected. But be careful to repudiate gossip that is harmful to individuals or unit performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are there things I can do to discourage time pilfering besides threatening discipline?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Your employees may be wasting time because they feel undervalued or are frustrated by organizational problems or lack of resources. Find out what's really behind the time wasting and misuse. You can also set a good example in your own work habits.</p>
