<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-48"><span class="space">2.</span> Regarded as Disabilities and Working</h4>
<p class="noindent">One area that had been especially problematic for the Commission and the courts in terms of the major life activity of working was in cases involving regarded as or perceived disabilities. These are cases where the complainant's impairment, in fact, was not a substantial limitation on any other major life activities, but an agency's perception of the impairment, or belief that the complainant had an impairment that he or she did not have, served to disqualify the complainant from a job. Prior to the ADAAA, most courts to confront the question had found that the complainant was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working because he or she was only denied a particular job and not disqualified from working in an entire class of jobs of a broad range of jobs across various classes. The Commission, as discussed below, took a different approach often finding that the complainant was substantially limited in the major life activity of working because if other employers adopted the same attitude the complainant would be disqualified from a class of jobs or broad range of jobs across various classes. The ADAAA resolves this conflict, in part, by changing the definition of what it means to be regarded as having a disability to cover actions taken by an employer on the basis of an actual or perceived impairment, even if the actual or perceived impairment does not substantially limit a major life activity, as discussed immediately above.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, it was the <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> case that was the catalyst for the ADAAA changes. In addition to contending that they were individuals whose visual impairment constituted a substantial limitation on the major life activity of seeing, the plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> also contended that United Airlines regarded them as being substantially limited in the major life activity of working when it declined to hire them as global airline pilots because of their myopic eye condition. Writing for the majority in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, Justice O'Connor rejected that argument:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion that petitioners have failed to state a claim that they are actually disabled under subsection (A) of the disability definition does not end our inquiry. Under subsection (C), individuals who are "regarded as" having a disability are disabled within the meaning of the ADA. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 12102(2)(C). Subsection (C) provides that having a disability includes "being regarded as having," &#x00A7; 12102(2)(C), "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual," &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A). There are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definition: (1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. In both cases, it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the individual--it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting. These misperceptions often "resul[t] from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of...individual ability." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12101(7). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">School Bd. of Nassau Cty.</span> v. <span class="Italic">Arline,</span> 480 U.S. 273, 284 (1987) ("By amending the definition of 'handicapped individual' to include not only those who are actually physically impaired, but also those who are regarded as impaired and who, as a result, are substantially limited in a major life activity, Congress acknowledged that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment"); 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(l) (explaining that the purpose of the regarded as prong is to cover individuals "rejected from a job because of the 'myths, fears and stereotypes' associated with disabilities").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that petitioners are physically impaired. Petitioners do not make the obvious argument that they are regarded due to their impairments as substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing. They contend only that respondent mistakenly believes their physical impairments substantially limit them in the major life activity of working. To support this claim, petitioners allege that respondent has a vision requirement, which is allegedly based on myth and stereotype. Further, this requirement substantially limits their ability to engage in the major life activity of working by precluding them from obtaining the job of global airline pilot, which they argue is a "class of employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> App. 24-26, Amended Complaint &#x00B6; 38. In reply, respondent argues that the position of global airline pilot is not a class of jobs and therefore petitioners have not stated a claim that they are regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Standing alone, the allegation that respondent has a vision requirement in place does not establish a claim that respondent regards petitioners as substantially limited in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">See</span> Post-Argument Brief for Respondent 2-3 (advancing this argument); Post-Argument Brief for the United States <span class="Italic">et al.</span> as <span class="Italic">Amici Curiae</span> 5-6 ("[U]nder the EEOC's regulations, an employer may make employment decisions based on physical characteristics"). By its terms, the ADA allows employers to prefer some physical attributes over others and to establish physical criteria. An employer runs afoul of the ADA when it makes an employment decision based on a physical or mental impairment, real or imagined, that is regarded as substantially limiting a major life activity. Accordingly, an employer is free to decide that physical characteristics or medical conditions that do not rise to the level of an impairment--such as one's height, build, or singing voice--are preferable to others, just as it is free to decide that some limiting, but not <span class="Italic">substantially</span> limiting, impairments make individuals less than ideally suited for a job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering the allegations of the amended complaint in tandem, petitioners have not stated a claim that respondent regards their impairment as <span class="Italic">substantially limiting</span> their ability to work. The ADA does not define "substantially limits," but "substantially" suggests "considerable" or "specified to a large degree." <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280 (1976) (defining "substantially" as "in a substantial manner" and "substantial" as "considerable in amount, value, or worth" and "being that specified to a large degree or in the main"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 17 Oxford English Dictionary 66-67 (2d ed. 1989) ("substantial": "[r]elating to or proceeding from the essence of a thing; essential"; "of ample or considerable amount, quantity or dimensions"). The EEOC has codified regulations interpreting the term "substantially limits" in this manner, defining the term to mean "[u]nable to perform" or "[s]ignificantly restricted." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i),(ii) (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the major life activity under consideration is that of working, the statutory phrase "substantially limits" requires, at a minimum, that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs. Reflecting this requirement, the EEOC uses a specialized definition of the term <span id="Page_1146"></span>"substantially limits" when referring to the major life activity of working:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC further identifies several factors that courts should consider when determining whether an individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of working, including the geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access, and "the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within the geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified." &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(A), (B). To be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, then, one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the parties accept that the term "major life activities" includes working, we do not determine the validity of the cited regulations. We note, however, that there may be some conceptual difficulty in defining "major life activities" to include work, for it seems "to argue in a circle to say that if one is excluded, for instance, by reason of [an impairment, from working with others]...then that exclusion constitutes an impairment, when the question you're asking is, whether the exclusion itself is by reason of handicap." Tr. of Oral Arg. in <span class="Italic">School Bd. of Nassau Co.</span> v. <span class="Italic">Arline,</span> O. T. 1986, No. 85-1277, p. 15 (argument of Solicitor General). Indeed, even the EEOC has expressed reluctance to define "major life activities" to include working and has suggested that working be viewed as a residual life activity, considered, as a last resort, <span class="Italic">only</span> "[i]f an individual is not substantially limited with respect to <span class="Italic">any other</span> major life activity." 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j) (1998) (emphasis added) ("If an individual is substantially limited in <span class="Italic">any other</span> major life activity, no determination should be made as to whether the individual is substantially limited in working" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming without deciding that working is a major life activity and that the EEOC regulations interpreting the term "substantially limits" are reasonable, petitioners have failed to allege adequately that their poor eyesight is regarded as an impairment that substantially limits them in the major life activity of working. They allege only that respondent regards their poor vision as precluding them from holding positions as a "global airline pilot." Because the position of global airline pilot is a single job, this allegation does not support the claim that respondent regards petitioners as having a <span class="Italic">substantially limiting</span> impairment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i) ("The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working"). Indeed, there are a number of other positions utilizing petitioners' skills, such as regional pilot and pilot instructor to name a few, that are available to them. Even under the EEOC's Interpretative Guidance, to which petitioners ask us to defer, "an individual who cannot be a commercial airline pilot because of a minor vision impairment, but who can be a commercial airline co-pilot or a pilot for a courier service, would not be substantially limited in the major life activity of working." 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioners also argue that if one were to assume that a substantial number of airline carriers have similar vision requirements, they would be substantially limited in the major life activity of working. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the adoption of similar vision requirements by other carriers would represent a substantial limitation on the major life activity of working, the argument is nevertheless flawed. It is not enough to say that if the physical criteria of a single employer were <span class="Italic">imputed</span> to all similar employers one would be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working <span class="Italic">only as a result of this imputation</span>. An otherwise valid job requirement, such as a height requirement, does not become invalid simply because it <span class="Italic">would</span> limit a person's employment opportunities in a substantial way <span class="Italic">if</span> it were adopted by a substantial number of employers. Because petitioners have not alleged, and cannot demonstrate, that respondent's vision requirement reflects a belief that petitioners' vision substantially limits them, we agree with the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the dismissal of petitioners' claim that they are regarded as disabled.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission took a decidedly different approach in its first "regarded as" case decided under the ADAAA, <span class="Italic">Elden R. v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120122672 (2017). The complainant applied and was selected for a position as a Wildlife Refuge Specialist contingent upon his passing a physical examination. Before accepting the position, the complainant disclosed to a human resources representative that he lacked the ability to sit and touch his toes without lifting his calves off the ground and was assured that his limitations would not affect his ability to pass the physical examination. During an initial medical examination, the complainant was asked and able to bend over and touch his toes. The complainant passed the examination and the physician cleared him for the position, writing that the complainant was qualified to perform the duties of the position. The complainant began working roughly a month before having to participate in the physical exam. In an effort to increase his flexibility and prepare for the exam, the complainant asked his supervisor for permission to invoke an agency policy allowing for employees to use one hour three days a week to workout. His request was denied. The complainant passed the exam except for the "sit and reach" portion which measured his ability to reach over his toes while sitting with his legs straight. The physical fitness coordinator recommended that he invoke the agency work out policy to work on his flexibility, but the complainant's second request was again denied. The complainant alleged that at a meeting with his supervisor to discuss the issue, his supervisor said "that he was highly disappointed in him because he did not reveal his disability when he was interviewed, and he was more concerned with getting someone in the position that could perform the job than he was with Complainant." The complainant failed to pass the "sit and reach" portion of the exam a second time and requested a waiver of that requirement. The agency did not respond to his waiver request, but instead terminated him. Before the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Elden R</span>., the complainant alleged that the agency "regarded" him as having a disability, and the Commission agreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleges that the Agency perceived him as an individual with a disability when he was terminated from his position due to his back impairment. Complainant asserts that his physical impairment substantially limits his major life activities of sitting, bending, and reaching. In contrast, the Agency asserts that Complainant did not establish that he is an individual with a disability because he has not established that his physical impairment limits one or more major life activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations implementing the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), 42 U.S.C. 12101, <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., which amended Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and as a result, the Rehabilitation Act, state:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The primary purpose of the ADAAA is to make it easier for people with disabilities to obtain protection under the ADA. Consistent with the Amendments Act's purpose of reinstating a broad scope of protection under the ADA, the definition of "disability" in this part shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability under this part should not demand extensive analysis. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.1(c)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADAAA altered the interpretation and application of the critical statutory term "individual with a disability" in fundamental ways. Pursuant to the EEOC regulations implementing the ADAA, an individual with a disability is one who: (i) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (ii) has a record of such an impairment; or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph (1) of this section. This means that the individual has been subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA, as amended, because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both "transitory and minor." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the regulations explain that the following principles also apply under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability above:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in &#x00A7; 1630.15(f), an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual is subjected to a prohibited action because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not that impairment substantially limits, or is perceived to substantially limit, a major life activity. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to refusal to hire, demotion, placement on involuntary leave, termination, exclusion for failure to meet a qualification standard, harassment, or denial of any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Except as provided in &#x00A7; 1630.15(f), an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" any time a covered entity takes a prohibited action against the individual because of an actual or perceived impairment, even if the entity asserts, or may or does ultimately establish, a defense to such action.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Establishing that an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" does not, by itself, establish liability. Liability is established under title I of the ADA only when an individual proves that a covered entity discriminated on the basis of disability within the meaning of section 102 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12112. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Coverage under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability should not be difficult to establish. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 House Judiciary <span id="Page_1147"></span>Committee Report at 17 (explaining that Congress never expected or intended it would be a difficult standard to meet). Under the third prong of the definition of disability, an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual is subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not "transitory and minor." Appendix to Part 1630 Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act (Interpretive Guidance) at Section 1630.2(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability was originally intended to express Congress's understanding that "unfounded concerns, mistaken beliefs, fears, myths, or prejudice about disabilities are often just as disabling as actual impairments, and [its] corresponding desire to prohibit discrimination founded on such perceptions." 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9; 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 17 (same). In passing the original ADA, Congress relied extensively on the reasoning of <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline,</span> 480 U.S. 273, 282-83 (1987) "that the negative reactions of others are just as disabling as the actual impact of an impairment." 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9. The ADAAA reiterates Congress's reliance on the broad views enunciated in that decision, and Congress "believe[s] that courts should continue to rely on this standard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; Interpretive Guidance at Section 1630.2(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the ADA Amendments Act broadened the application of the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability. 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9-10. In doing so, Congress rejected court decisions that had required an individual to establish that a covered entity perceived him or her to have an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. This provision is designed to restore Congress's intent to allow individuals to establish coverage under the "regarded as" prong by showing that they were treated adversely because of an impairment, without having to establish the covered entity's beliefs concerning the severity of the impairment. Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 3; Interpretive Guidance at Section 1630.2(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that Complainant was injured during Desert Storm while serving in the military. Complainant suffered an injury to two herniated disks in his neck (C5/6 and C6/7) and two herniated disks in his lumbar region (L4/5 &#x0026; L5/51). As a result, his back impairment prohibits him from bending over and touching his toes while in a seated position. The record also reveals Complainant was terminated from his position because he could not meet the Agency's PEB "sit and reach" standard due to his back impairment. Accordingly, we find Complainant has established he is an "individual with a disability" because the Agency took prohibited action by applying a qualification standard and terminating him as a result of his back impairment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(iii). Further, there is also anecdotal evidence in the record that S1 perceived Complainant as an individual with a disability when, after his first unsuccessful attempt at meeting the Agency's flexibility standard, S1 allegedly remarked that he was "highly disappointed" that Complainant was not more honest during his interview about his having a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon a finding that Complainant is an individual with a disability, the next inquiry is whether Complainant is a "qualified individual with a disability." The term "qualified," with respect to an individual with a disability, means that the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals that Complainant met all the qualifications of the position except for the requirement that he be able to "sit and reach." The Agency stated that the physical demands of the Wildlife Refuge Specialist position are as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Work involves standing, bending, walking, and sometimes heavy exertion in rough, rocky terrain. About 50% of the incumbent's work is performed outdoors, often in difficult terrain, with the remainder in meetings or office environments. Work requires above average agility and stamina. Incumbent may be required to lift objects over 50 pounds. (Standard Position Description, Wildlife Refuge Specialist, Exhibit 16).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports Complainant's assertions that he can perform all of the physical demands described for the position. This is supported by the physician who filled out Complainant's medical certification, in which he stated that Complainant could perform all of the functions of the position, including strenuous work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record shows that Complainant was successfully performing the duties of the position, including law enforcement duties, for many months before he was terminated. The record contains a performance appraisal of "Fully Successful" with only positive comments written throughout, such as Complainant "works very hard to do a thorough job with all assigned tasks," Complainant "made good use of time," Complainant "did a great job of acquiring the required training to fully perform his job duties," and Complainant "did an outstanding job making sure that himself and others working around him worked safely!" As a result, we find that Complainant was qualified for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Is the Agency's "Sit and Reach" Requirement Job-Related and Consistent with Business Necessity?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question now is whether the "sit and reach" requirement that Complainant failed is consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. If the standard itself fails to meet the "job-related and consistent with business necessity" requirement, or if the Agency failed to apply the standard in an appropriate way (for example, by failing to determine whether performance could be achieved through reasonable accommodation) Complainant has a valid claim. <span class="Italic">See Nathan v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070014 (July 19, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act prohibits a covered entity from engaging in discrimination against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in, among other things, hiring. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). Such discrimination includes "using qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability...unless the standard, test, or other selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(6); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10 (making unlawful a covered entity's use of qualification standards that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability unless such standard is job related and consistent with business necessity); <span class="Italic">Nathan v. Dep't of Justice, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "qualification standard" is not defined in the statute. The regulations define "qualification standard" as "the personal and professional attributes, including the skill, experience, education, physical, medical, safety, and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(q).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is nothing in the record that would lead us to conclude that the "sit and reach" requirement was job-related for the position in question and also consistent with business necessity. We note that not one management official, human resources official, physical fitness official, law enforcement official, or coworker was able to state in the record how a Wildlife Refuge Specialist's ability to reach over his toes while sitting down with his legs outstretched was related to any of the functions of the position. Nowhere in the record did the Agency include a single scenario where a Wildlife Refuge Specialist may need to reach over his toes while sitting down with his legs straight out and against the ground. Instead, all witnesses generally stated that it was required because it was part of the PEB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record reflected that, while management officials in Region 6 generally stated that the PEB requirements must be strictly adhered to for law enforcement positions, the Agency's Region 4 waived the PEB "sit and reach" requirements for an individual in a substantially similar law enforcement position. Finally, while Wildlife Refuge Specialists are required to pass the PEB when they are first hired, they are never required to pass the PEB again during their employment. We note that even on appeal the Agency did not link the "sit and reach" requirement to a specific job duty of the position. As a result, we find that the Agency failed to meet its burden of proof with regard to establishing that the "sit and reach" requirement was job-related to the Wildlife Refuge Specialist position, or that it was consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that, with regard to safety requirements that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, an employer must also demonstrate that the requirement is job related and consistent with business necessity. The regulations provide that an Agency can meet this standard by showing that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the "direct threat" analysis set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). 29 C.F.R. 1630 App. 1630.15(b) and (c). However, the Agency provided no argument or evidence suggesting that Complainant posed a direct threat to the health or safety of himself or others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find the Agency's application of the PEB standard in this case was discriminatory and the Agency failed to carry its burden of proving the standard was job related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disparate Treatment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In analyzing a disparate treatment claim under the Rehabilitation Act, where the Agency denies that its decisions were motivated by Complainant's disability and there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the Commission applies the burden-shifting method of proof set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S 792 (1973). <span class="Italic">See Heyman v. Queens Village Comm. for Mental Health for Jamaica Cmty Adolescent Program</span>, 198 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Swanks v. WMATA</span>, 179 F.3d 929, 933-34 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Under this analysis, in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, Complainant must demonstrate that: (1) he is an "individual with a disability"; (2) he is "qualified" for the position held or desired; <span id="Page_1148"></span>(3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) the circumstances surrounding the adverse action give rise to an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Lawson v. CSX Transp., Inc</span>., 245 F.3d 916 (7th Cir. 2001). The burden of production then shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the Agency is successful, the burden reverts back to Complainant to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency's reasons were a pretext for discrimination. At all times, Complainant retains the burden of persuasion, and it is his obligation to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency acted on the basis of a prohibited reason. <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502 (1993); <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Serv. Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 715-716 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Complainant has established that he is an individual with a disability, that he is qualified for the Wildlife Refuge Specialist position, that he was subjected to an adverse employment action when he was removed from the position, and that the circumstances surrounding the adverse action give rise to an inference of discrimination. Therefore, Complainant has established his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency articulated that Complainant was terminated from his position because he cannot meet the physical requirements for the position. Specifically, Complainant was tested for flexibility on December 8, 2010, and again on January 11, 2011, and in both instances he was unable to meet the minimum requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have found the Agency did not carry its burden of establishing that the "sit and reach" flexibility standard was job-related and consistent with business necessity, we find that the Agency failed to establish that it terminated Complainant for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Additionally, the record shows that Agency officials have been employing this discriminatory practice at least throughout all of Region 6. As a result, we find that Complainant established that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it terminated him from his position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Among other things, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Elden R</span>. ordered the agency to offer the complainant a permanent Wildlife Refuge Specialist or equivalent position and to consider taking disciplinary action against the responsible management officials, being careful to note that the Commission did not consider training as disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the ADAAA, when a single employer deemed the complainant unable to perform a specific job, a complainant could still establish a substantial limitation on the major life activity of working if he or she could show that if other employers adopted the same view of the complainant's impairment, he or she would be disqualified from variety of jobs and, thus, a broad range of jobs across various classes. A good demonstration of the Commission's approach prior to the ADAAA is <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120054928 (2007), where the complainant's impairment of flat feet did not substantially limit his ability to walk or stand, but the agency's perception of the impairment disqualified the complainant from a broad range of jobs. As is typical with many of these cases, the agency ignored information submitted by the complainant's podiatrist and based its decision solely on the opinion of its own physician. The case also stresses the need for an individualized inquiry in each case, which is one way an agency can avoid findings based on a perceived disability. To a degree, cases involving regarded as disabilities under the original ADA are no longer relevant to the extent that they require the complainant to demonstrate that the agency viewed them as being substantially limited in a major life activity. That requirement has been eliminated by the ADAAA. The cases do, however, remain relevant because a common thread is the agency's failure to conduct an individualized assessment of the condition is what ultimately leads to the perception that the complainant was substantially limited in the major life activity of working. Because, under the ADAAA, an agency will need to demonstrate that its action is job-related and consistent with business necessity when acting on the basis of an actual or perceived impairment, that individualized assessment remains critical. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, however, that the agency regarded complainant as having an impairment which substantially limits the major life activity of working. The agency determined that complainant's condition was not compatible with the requirements of the Rural Carrier position, which involved standing for more than eight hours per day, and that complainant was at risk for injury if hired. The Commission has determined that an agency regards an individual as substantially limited in the major life activity of working if the agency thinks the individual has an impairment that significantly restricts him or her from currently performing a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3); <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A45134 (June 1, 2006) (regarded as disabled in working manual labor jobs); <span class="Italic">Gaynor v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A33909 (June 1, 2006) (regarded as disabled in working jobs that required heavy lifting, continuous standing, pushing, pulling, bending and reaching); <span class="Italic">Daniel McManaway v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal 01993233 (August 23, 2002). We note that as in all cases, determinations regarding whether a complainant is an individual with a disability must be made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">See Long v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A01062 (September 26, 2002). Further, no one set of facts is dispositive, rather, the determination as to whether the agency regarded someone as disabled is to be based upon the totality of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency determined that because of the recommendations of its Orthopedic Surgeon, complainant could not perform the duties of the Rural Carrier position or the Casual Automations Clerk position in which he had worked for the prior six months, or the Mailhandler position to which he was about to be assigned. Moreover, the Human Resources Specialist averred that complainant was unable to perform all of the other positions to which he applied, including the Mark-Up Clerk, Flat Sorter Machine Operator and Clerk Carrier positions. We find, therefore, that the agency regarded the complainant as unable to perform a class or broad range of jobs because of its perception that he could not stand or walk for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find that complainant was "qualified" for the Rural Carrier position, the Mailhandler position and the Automations Clerk position. The record reveals that complainant was found to be eligible for the Rural Carrier position, and he had worked as an Automations Clerk for the prior six months. Indeed, the Manager of Distribution Operations averred that complainant had worked satisfactorily during his employment. Accordingly, we find complainant was a qualified individual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find the only bar to his employment was the agency's misperception that he was unsuitable because of his flat feet. As the Supreme Court has noted, "[T]hese misperceptions often "resul[t] from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of...individual ability." <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Airlines Inc.,</span> 527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S. Ct. 2139 (1999). <span class="Italic">See also School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline,</span> 480 U.S. 273, 284, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed.2d 307 (1987). Likewise, in this case, the agency failed to consider complainant's actual performance in the job when it terminated him. The record shows that complainant has no current physical limitations or restrictions that would have precluded him from performing the duties of the job. Indeed, complainant had been successfully performing the Automations Clerk position for the prior six months without incident. Specifically, the record reveals that between May and June 2004, complainant worked for the agency on 25 days and averaged 7.7 hours per day. Both the Rural Carrier position to which he applied and the Automations Clerk position have virtually the same physical requirements, including standing for more than eight hours per day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining that complainant would have had difficulty performing the duties of the position on a day-to-day basis, the agency does not appear to have considered medical documentation from complainant's podiatrist. Nor is there any evidence that complainant was afforded the opportunity to provide such documentation to the agency. Rather, the agency relied only on the Orthopedist's opinion that complainant could incur injury in the future. In order to exclude an individual with a disability on the basis of possible future injury, the agency bears the burden of showing there is a significant risk, i.e., high probability of substantial harm. A speculative or remote risk is insufficient. The agency must show more than that an individual with a disability seeking employment stands some slightly increased risk of harm. <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A45134; <span class="Italic">Rogelio Perez v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A20117 (July 23, 2003), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A31197 (September 25, 2003). Moreover, such a finding must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk, (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm, (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). A determination of significant risk cannot be based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation. Rather, the agency must gather, and base its decision on, substantial information regarding the individual's work and medical histories. <span class="Italic">McManaway, supra.</span> The agency failed to do this. On appeal, complainant submits a note from his physician who reports that complainant is capable of performing physical activity without limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency made its decision to find complainant unsuitable for employment based on the Orthopedic Surgeon's assessment that complainant posed a risk of injury if required to stand for more than eight hours a day. This determination was made without the identification of any specific injury that complainant was supposedly susceptible to, other than a generalized risk or fear of injury in the next six months. Although the opinion states that he reviewed records brought by complainant, the opinion does not specify the nature of those records or their findings. Accordingly, we cannot find that the agency's determination was made on "substantial information" regarding complainant's work and medical history. <span class="Italic">See McManaway, supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having carefully considered the evidence of record, the Commission finds that the agency failed to meet its burden of showing a high probability of substantial harm. The agency's finding of unsuitability was not explained in any detail, nor did it include any individualized assessment addressing the duration of the risk posed by complainant's conditions, the nature and <span id="Page_1149"></span>severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. Since the Commission finds that there is no evidence to support the agency's conclusion that complainant posed a direct threat, we conclude that the agency's denial of employment to complainant was in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly in <span class="Italic">Vavrek v. Attorney General</span>, 07A40068 (2007), the Commission found that disqualifying a complainant with a heart murmur from a police officer's job amounted to a perception that the complainant was substantially limited in the major life activity of working. In doing so, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Vavrek</span>, focused on the effect that the agency's perceptions, if adopted by other employers, would have on limiting the availability of jobs for the complainant. This would seem to be the very rationale rejected in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Vavrek</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant does not argue that he is an individual with a disability. However, the Commission finds that the agency regarded complainant as having an impairment which substantially limited the major life activity of working. An agency regards an individual as substantially limited in the major life activity of working if it thinks the individual has an impairment that significantly restricts him or her from currently performing a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i). The inability, however, to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the agency found that complainant was medically disqualified based on the recommendations from Dr. #4 and Dr. #5. The record contains a health evaluation form dated August 4, 1999, from Dr. #4 stating: "[a]lthough [complainant] may be symptom-free: he should be advised to avoid sudden or severe isometric efforts because of the danger of exertion induced syncope or collapse."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The position description requires:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">considerable and strenuous physical exertion such as frequently climbing stairs and ladders; lifting weapons, other objects, and people weighing over 50 pounds; crouching, crawling, and/or running in pursuit of violators and trespassers; walking and running over rough terrain; and defending oneself and others against physical attack.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency regards an individual as substantially limited in a major life activity when it concludes that the individual has an impairment that significantly restricts him or her from currently performing a major life activity, even though the individual's impairment does not in fact substantially limit his/her ability to perform a major life activity; the impairment is substantially limiting only as a result of the attitude of others; or the individual has no impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(l). Here, the agency perceived him as only being able to work in positions that do not require strenuous activity. <span class="Italic">See McManaway v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01993233 (August 23, 2002) (complainant was regarded as having an impairment which substantially limited his ability to work in a broad range of jobs in various classes requiring heavy lifting, continuous standing, pushing, pulling, bending and reaching); <span class="Italic">De Los Santos v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01974430 (May 23, 2001) (complainant was regarded as having an impairment which substantially limited her ability to work in a broad range of jobs in various classes requiring heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, repetitive stretching, reaching and bending, prolonged standing, and time restraints); <span class="Italic">Mateo-Ortiz v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01992867 (November 13, 2000) (complainant was regarded as substantially limited in the ability to work based on the agency's perception that complainant could not perform any strenuous activity).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency further argues on appeal that being medically disqualified for one position does not automatically disqualify complainant from a broad range of jobs. We find that the instant case is analogous to <span class="Italic">McManaway</span> in which an agency determination that a complainant was medically disqualified for a particular job (Distribution Clerk) because of complainant's inability to stand, stretch, reach, or lift up to 70 pounds, amounted to a determination that the agency regarded complainant as unable to perform a broad range of jobs in various classes requiring heavy lifting, continuous standing, pushing, pulling, bending, and reaching. <span class="Italic">McManaway,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01993233. In the instant matter the agency determined that complainant was medically disqualified for the Police Officer position because of complainant's inability to perform the requirements of the position which according to the vacancy announcement includes considerable and strenuous physical exertion. The instant matter is distinguishable from the agency's litany of circuit court cases that concern medical disqualifications based on narrow specific functions of a position. For instance, the agency cites <span class="Italic">Fultz v. City of Salem,</span> 51 Fed. Appx. 624 (9th Cir.) (Sept. 13, 2002) (this case was not selected for publication in the Federal Reporter), in which the defendant found plaintiff to be disqualified from a police officer position because of his injured finger because plaintiff was unable to perform "forcible arrests and become involved in potentially combative situations." The instant complainant, however, was found to be disqualified for performing a much broader range of functions involving strenuous activity. We thus conclude that the agency regarded complainant as having an impairment which substantially limited his ability to work in a broad range of jobs in various classes that require strenuous activity, of which a police officer is only one position. Examples of such classes of jobs, as noted by the AJ, include: construction workers, lumberjacks, commercial fisherman, oil well worker, longshoreman, and any number of blue collar jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cordero v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963946 (1997), the Commission found that the agency perceived a mild case of asthma as disqualifying the complainant for employment as a part-time letter carrier. Upholding the recommended decision of its administrative judge, the Commission found that the agency perceived the complainant as substantially limited in the major life activity of working because the perceived disability disqualified the complainant from "a broad range of jobs requiring no specialized training or skills." As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Cordero</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 7, 1996, the AJ issued a decision finding that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to offer the appellant the desired job for which she was otherwise qualified because several agency officials' testimony established that they regarded her as disabled. The AJ found that the record did not establish that the appellant's mild asthmatic condition substantially limited her ability to perform any major life activity, nor did the appellant's prior Veterans' Administration record of a mild asthmatic condition qualify as a record of a disability on which the agency had partly relied in denying her the job opportunity. However, the AJ found that the agency had violated the Rehabilitation Act by regarding the appellant as disabled in the major life activity of working. The AJ found that the denial of a job requiring outdoor work on the ground that the appellant may be exposed to occasional outside environment that may trigger an asthmatic episode, disqualified the appellant from a broad range of other jobs requiring no specialized training or skills. The AJ found that the use of the same criterion (mild asthma) would disqualify the appellant from such varied jobs as a garbage collector, a landscaping assistant, a construction laborer, and a door-to-door salesperson. The AJ further found that the appellant was otherwise a qualified individual to be a letter carrier because she had met all agency requirements for the position and was in fact offered the job subject to a medical clearance. Lastly, the AJ found that because the appellant's asthmatic condition was only mild and occasional, and it was well regulated by medication, her employment as a letter carrier did not pose a significant risk of substantial harm to herself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ ordered the agency to take corrective action, such as, retroactive placement as a letter carrier with appropriate back pay and benefits, training for identified agency officials, and the posting of a notice of violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 15, 1996, the agency issued a timely FAD pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.110. The FAD rejected the AJ's finding. The agency's position is that the appellant was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working as evidenced by the fact that the appellant remained on the agency's active register for clerical employment after being denied the letter carrier's job, and she was subsequently hired as a data conversion operator in July 1995. We reject the agency's position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Cook v. State of Rhode Island, Dept. of Mental Health Retardation and Hospitals</span>, 10 F.3d 17, 25-26 (1st Cir., 1993), the court correctly observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By way of illustration, suit can be brought against a ware house operator who refuses to hire all turquoise-eyed applicants solely because he believes that people with such coloring are universally incapable of lifting large crates, notwithstanding that other warehousemen might hire the applicants--or that the recalcitrant firm itself might hire them for other, sedentary posts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Section 902.8(f) (March 14, 1995), gives the following as an example of a situation where an employer would be deemed to have unlawfully denied employment to an individual by regarding him or her as substantially limited in the major life activity of working:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">CP, a bank teller, has a mild form of clinically diagnosed depression. The depression does not substantially limit any of the CP's major life activities. R, CP's employer, learns of CP's clinically diagnosed depression and assumes that the depression will prevent CP from working well with customers and other members of the public. There is no factual basis to R's assumption. Nevertheless, R reassigns CP to a clerical position in a back office. In this case, exclusionary criterion--the requirement that employees be able to work well with members of the public--does not pertain to a unique aspect of the job or work site. Rather, since a wide variety of jobs involves working with the public, the exclusionary criterion applies to a broad range of jobs. By disqualifying CP from the teller position on the basis of a criterion that applies to a broad range of jobs in various classes, R has demonstrated that it finds CP to be unsuitable <span id="Page_1150"></span>for work in a broad range of jobs. Accordingly, R regards CP as substantially limited in the ability to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, although the agency deemed the appellant eligible to work in an indoor clerical position, the fact remains that the exclusionary criterion used (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, ability to do physical work involving extensive walking and carrying in the out-of-doors where one would be exposed to allergens and to cold weather) to disqualify the appellant for an outdoor letter carrier position also would disqualify the appellant from a broad range of other outdoor positions. Moreover, the exclusionary criterion is not unique to the position of a letter carrier. Therefore, we affirm the AJ's determination that the agency regarded the appellant as substantially limited in the ability to work despite evidence that the agency was willing to and did subsequently hire her for a different job.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission denied reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Cordero v. Postmaster General</span>, 05970685 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Cannon-Stokes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12088 (2002), the Commission found that a complainant who was unable to deliver mail in a residential route after being assaulted by a patron did not substantially limit her in the major life activity of working. The Commission contrasted that case with its holding in <span class="Italic">Cordero</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Indeed, there has been some risk that agencies could turn impairments that were not actually substantially limiting into disabling conditions by the restrictions they placed on workers. For example, in <span class="Italic">Coco v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991473 (2002), the Commission found that the complainant's heart condition was not substantially limiting where his only symptom was angina and he could operate a motor vehicle for eight to 12 hours a day. However, the agency regarded the complainant as substantially limited by his heart condition because of the work restrictions it imposed on him. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Coco</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the AJ, there is no evidence that complainant either had a substantially limiting impairment or had a record of such. The record shows that, at most, complainant experienced symptoms of coronary artery disease, specifically angina. Complainant's cardiologist (Dr. G) noted, in September 1995, that complainant's condition did not appear to be disabling, and that complainant could operate a motor vehicle for 8 to 12 hours per day. Another physician (Dr. L) also opined that complainant was not disabled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, as stated by the AJ, the record shows that the agency regarded complainant as having a substantially limiting impairment. In order to be considered substantially limited in the major activity of working, an individual must be significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to others having comparable training, skills, and abilities. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(j)(3)(i). Further, several factors may be considered when determining whether an individual is substantially limited with regard to working, including the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills, or abilities, within the geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(j)(3)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is noted that, during a routine physical examination by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in August 1995, complainant was found not qualified for a commercial drivers license. Nevertheless, the DMV physician indicated that he had requested records from complainant's cardiologist. A second DMV physician then found complainant to be qualified to operate a commercial vehicle on September 23, 1995. At the time complainant's driving privileges were suspended in August 1995, an agency physician (Dr. C) concluded that complainant's medical condition would disqualify him from holding a commercial drivers license. Dr. C continued to hold this opinion at least through February 1996, and the agency never reinstated complainant's driving privileges. In fact, the agency posted complainant's position for bid approximately 10 days after his driving privileges were suspended. It is clear from the record that while complainant's physician and the second DMV doctor found complainant capable of operating a commercial vehicle in September 1995, the agency continued to view complainant as unable to do so. We find the operation of a commercial vehicle to encompass a broad range of jobs, including driving a truck, bus or van and would apply to jobs in the federal and private sectors. Further, complainant had been driving commercial vehicles since being hired by the agency in 1981. Thus, we agree with the AJ that the agency regarded complainant as being unable to perform a class of jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The sole rationale offered by the agency for suspending complainant's driving privileges was his inability to hold a commercial drivers license. Complainant, however, was found qualified to do so by the DMV on September 23, 1995. Further, the record shows no problems with complainant's performance in the Motor Vehicle Operator position. In fact, as noted by the AJ, the agency instructed complainant to drive a commercial vehicle on at least two occasions after suspending his driving privileges. Thus, the agency has not provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action, and the AJ properly concluded that complainant had been subjected to disability discrimination.</p>
