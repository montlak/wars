<h2 class="h2">TRAVEL, TDY, PCS, AND PER DIEM</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal employees often need to travel on weekends, holidays, or after normal duty hours in order to meet the mission. And when they travel, they rack up expenses, most of which they expect to be reimbursed. How travel time is accounted for makes a big difference to both the employee and the agency. Will it be compensated as work time, overtime, or not at all? The questions are complex.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The same complexity surrounds the reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses while an employee is engaged in official travel for purposes of temporary duty, temporary change of station, or training.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One reason for official travel is relocation, or "permanent change of station." When PCS is in the interest of the government and properly authorized, moving expenses, subsistence expenses, and real estate transaction costs may be reimbursed &#x2013; again in accordance with some complex rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your employees may rely on you to explain travel rules to them, and, as a supervisor, you generally must authorize the reimbursement of expenses. But your authorization will not override the limits to compensation and reimbursement imposed by law and regulation. It is crucial that travel be planned with care, both for your employees and for yourself, to avoid unpleasant surprises when payrolls are audited and expense claims are examined.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your best bet is to consult closely with HR and never assume that your signature on a travel document alone is a sufficient authorization.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Fly America Act</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Fly America Act requires government agencies to ensure that their employees fly on U.S.-flag air carriers whenever one is available, if the transportation is between a place in the U.S. and a place outside the U.S., or if the transportation is between two places outside the U.S. This is the case even if it's cheaper to travel by a foreign air carrier. When it comes to reimbursement, it makes no difference whether a traveler was unaware of the provisions of the act when they use a foreign air carrier. An employee will not be reimbursed for transportation costs for which they improperly used a foreign air carrier.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an actual case example, two government special agents booked their own flights for official travel from Los Angeles to Costa Rica. They selected the most cost-effective and economical airfare they could find, which included a return flight from Costa Rica to Los Angeles on Avianca Airlines, which is the national airline of Colombia and is not a U.S.-flag air carrier.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency properly denied $497.31 of each employee's air travel reimbursement claim because their return flight violated the requirements of the Fly America Act since Avianca Airlines was a foreign flag air carrier. It did not matter that they were unaware of the requirement to fly only on U.S.-flag air carriers and that no one told them about the statute or that they were doing anything in violation of its requirements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your employees may not like all the answers you give them, but it's better that they know what the rules are before they travel, rather than be hit with bad news later.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Travel time</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">All federal employee travel that takes place during the employee's regular tour of duty is compensated as hours of work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> Sally's regular tour of duty is Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. If she leaves work at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday to catch a flight to her agency headquarters and arrives in Washington at 5:30 p.m., she will be compensated for her travel time between 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. because those hours are within her regular tour of duty. The extra hour that she spent in a travel status is not compensable because it does not fall within her regular tour of duty, although comp time may apply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees should be scheduled to perform official travel during their regular tours of duty to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some agency policies or labor agreements may require an employee's travel orders be annotated with an explanation if travel cannot be scheduled during the employee's regular duty hours.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> The Comptroller General held that it is contrary to good public policy and government fiscal responsibility to authorize employees two or more days of extra per diem so as to allow federal employees to travel on duty time. This means employees cannot travel on Friday to a temporary duty assignment scheduled to begin Monday morning, even if they will have to travel on their own time on Sunday. However, they may be eligible for comp time. With enough advance notice of the travel requirement, supervisors may be able to temporarily change an employee's tour of duty to include the period of travel within the employee's regular tour of duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> In the situation above, Sally's supervisor could temporarily change her tour of duty on Tuesday to 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. in order to have her entire travel time covered by her regular tour of duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> Kevin's regular tour of duty is Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. He's going to a three-day training seminar from Wednesday through Friday and cannot make his return travel until Saturday. If feasible, his supervisor could temporarily change Kevin's tour of duty so that his regular tour of duty that week is Tuesday through Saturday, in order to have his time covered by his regular tour of duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you are going to change the employee's tour of duty to accommodate a travel schedule, be careful to consider the effect of night pay for GS employees (between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.). Similarly, be aware of the impact of making a majority of a Federal Wage System employee's regular tour of duty fall within the 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. or 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. time bands. Doing so will entitle the employee to night differential pay. And watch out for holiday and Sunday premiums. Sometimes changing an employee's tour of duty will end up costing more in the long run. You'll be better off with comp time, if it is available.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What about time left over between the end of a trip and the end of the employee's tour? Suppose your employee arrives back home at 2:30 p.m., and the normal end of the workday is 4:30. Does the employee have to report to work or take leave? Some agencies give supervisors the authority to excuse this time without charge to leave. It may be impractical to have the employee report for duty for such a short period. Be sure to find out what your agency's practice is in these situations.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The Fair Labor Standards Act</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">In situations where employee travel during the regular tour of duty -- or altering the tour of duty -- is impractical, it is imperative you know the status of your employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees who are exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act typically occupy executive, administrative or professional positions at the GS-7 level and above. Federal employees stationed in many foreign countries are also exempt from the FLSA. These employees are often simply referred to as "exempt."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> Don't rely on this brief description to determine your employee's FLSA status. You need to know it. FLSA status is determined by your human resources office during the classification process for the position. It should be indicated on the employee's position description. If you feel that "job drift" has changed your employee's duties to the point where the position description no longer fits, contact HR and discuss rewriting the description.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Travel for FLSA-exempt employees is considered compensable hours of work when it occurs within the employee's regular tour of duty. Travel for FLSA-exempt employees outside the employee's regular tour of duty is compensable as hours of work only when one of these situations occurs:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The employee is involved in the actual performance of work while traveling.</b> This applies mainly to employees whose primary duties involve traveling, such as operating a vehicle, transporting goods or people, or patrolling a large area. Reviewing papers and performing such similar work tasks en route to a temporary duty assignment is generally not considered the performance of work while traveling, as such work can be performed at other times. However, if it can be shown that the only possible time the employee could have performed this work was while traveling, such time might be compensable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The travel undertaken by the employee is incident to the performance of work while traveling.</b> If an employee performs work while traveling, the return travel from that travel is also considered hours of work, even though the employee may no longer be performing work. This is often referred to as "deadhead" travel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The travel is carried out under such arduous conditions that the travel is inseparable from the work.</b> These situations must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Generally, it is arduous if it requires travel over unusually adverse terrain or during severe weather conditions. Weather delays in airports do not fit the definition, however long or unpleasant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The travel results from an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively, including travel by an employee to the employee's official duty station.</b> If a training course is offered in another city by a nongovernment source, the government had no hand in the scheduling, and it starts early Monday, Sunday travel would fall under this category. If it's a government course or offered under a government contract, that won't work, even if the course is scheduled by another agency, since the government could have scheduled it differently.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the travel can be claimed as hours of work, an FLSA-exempt employee who travels directly between home and the temporary duty location may be paid only for the travel time that exceeds the travel time to and from the employee's permanent duty station.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Nonexempt employees</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees not exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act typically occupy Federal Wage System positions and clerical, technical and other positions at grades GS-7 and below. Such employees are often referred to simply as "nonexempt."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Travel for FLSA-nonexempt employees is considered compensable hours of work when it occurs within the employee's regular tour of duty. Travel for FLSA-nonexempt employees outside of the employee's regular tour of duty is compensable as hours of work only when one of these situations occurs:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is required to drive a vehicle or perform other work while traveling. <b>Note:</b> An employee who travels from home before the regular workday begins and returns home at the end of the workday is engaged in normal "home to work" travel, or commuting. Commuting is not considered hours of work under the FLSA.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is a passenger on a one-day assignment away from the permanent duty station.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee travels on an overnight assignment on a non-workday during a time period that corresponds to regular duty hours.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> Sharon's regular tour of duty is Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. She travels to the temporary duty location on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. She is entitled to compensation for the travel time between 11 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. because these hours correspond to her regular tour of duty. Even though she spent more time traveling, the additional time is not compensable because it does not correspond to her regular duty hours.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee chooses to travel using an alternate mode of travel or to travel at another time than that offered or selected by the agency. The employee will receive the lesser of either the actual travel hours or the estimated hours of travel using the agency's authorized mode of travel.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Example:</b> Kim is authorized by her agency to travel to a temporary duty location on Monday morning via commercial air carrier. The total travel time would be three hours. Kim decides she would rather take her own vehicle to the temporary duty location and drives there on Sunday instead. The trip takes her eight hours to complete. Even if her entire travel period on Sunday corresponded to her regular work hours, only three hours would be considered hours of work, because that is the amount of time she would have been otherwise entitled to receive as travel time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If none of the above applies, the law provides that FLSA-nonexempt federal employees may consider travel time as hours of work if the travel time would be considered hours of work for an FLSA-exempt federal employee.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Comp time for travel</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Otherwise-non-compensable time spent in a travel status away from the employee's official duty station may be compensated with comp time, in increments of one-tenth of an hour (six minutes) or one-quarter of an hour (15 minutes). Each agency is responsible for its own administrative procedures, so be sure to check with HR.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comp time may be granted subject to the following limitations:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee is engaged in travel that has been authorized by the agency for work purposes. Only time actually spent traveling (including "usual waiting time" that precedes or interrupts such travel) counts. The employee's FLSA status is immaterial. The comp time provisions exclude members of the Senior Executive Service, Foreign Service officers, wage grade employees, and certain others.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> "Extended" waiting periods are not creditable as segments of travel status. Unusually long wait times, including unexpected overnight stays due to severe weather, etc., are not credited. According to the OPM, the distinction between a "usual" waiting period and an "extended" one turns on whether the employee is free to rest, sleep or otherwise use the time for their own purposes.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Normal commuting time must be deducted. The amount of time that would normally be spent traveling to and from the official duty station must be deducted from the period of creditable travel. Thus, an employee whose normal commute from home to the official duty station is one hour is entitled to one hour of compensatory time when making a two-hour trip from home to the airport to travel on temporary duty. When the airport (or other transportation terminal) is within the limits of the employee's official duty station, traveling to it from home is considered normal commuting time and is not creditable toward compensatory time off. However, traveling to a transportation terminal from a work site (outside regular working hours) is creditable as time in travel status, without need of an offset for normal commuting time.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> No limits. There are no limits on the amount of comp time for travel an employee may accrue.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Use it or lose it. Employees must use their accrued comp time off by the end of the 26th pay period after the pay period in which it was earned. With few exceptions, failure to use it within that time results in forfeiture. Likewise, employees who separate from service or transfer to other agencies forfeit their accrued time off. Comp time may be held in abeyance for employees who return following a period of service in the uniformed services or who resume service after an on-the-job injury.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Holidays. Since holiday time is paid, travel on holidays does not entitle employees to compensatory time off, unless it is in excess of the time compensated (eight hours).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> PCS and union travel. Relocation travel required by a permanent change of station is not included. Neither is travel for union activities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Comp time is credited on a one-to-one basis. One hour of comp time may be granted for one hour of creditable travel time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> There are areas of ambiguity in the comp time rule. Stick closely to your own agency's implementation practices. Consult HR to find out what these are.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Do not be tempted to grant "unofficial comp time." This is illegal, and if it is discovered in an audit, the employee may be obligated to repay the government for the value of the improper time off, either through payroll collection or an annual leave offset. If legal comp time is not appropriate, you could consider recommending the employee for an incentive award of time off (if your agency permits it), provided that the employee did something during the assignment that justifies recognition.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Characterize assignment before reimbursement</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">When employees travel away from their permanent duty stations on agency business, the expenses they incur for lodging, transportation, meals and incidental expenses may be reimbursable. The determination of just what is reimbursable depends on whether an assignment is properly characterized as "temporary duty," "temporary change of station," or "travel for training." Once an assignment has been accurately tagged, there are options for calculating reimbursement for those situations that permit it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In general, traveling employees are subject to a "prudent person rule." That is, an employee traveling on official business is expected to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business and expending personal funds.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees will be responsible for excess costs and any additional expenses incurred for personal preference or convenience. Excess costs, circuitous routes, delays, or luxury accommodations and services unnecessary or unjustified in the performance of official business are not acceptable under this standard. But there may be gray areas. Agencies cannot be overzealous and should make allowances for the uncertainties of travel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> Don't rely on this section alone to determine whether, and how, to authorize reimbursement for employees' expenses while they are away from their official stations. Your employees should be able to depend on you for advice and accurate information. If you err, it could end up costing your employees hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars from their own pockets. Even if you authorize reimbursement, the employee will not receive it if the regulations do not allow for it. Consult with HR and check the regulations yourself. Never authorize reimbursements "on your own authority" and assume that your agency will back you up. This goes for your own travel expenses, as well as those of your employees. Expense reimbursements are audited, and the rules are strict.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Temporary duty travel</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Temporary duty assignments, universally known in the federal government as TDY, entitle employees to reimbursement for lodging, transportation, meals, and incidental expenses. The agency is responsible to determine the most economical way of meeting its obligation to compensate the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be reimbursable, the travel must be "essential to the transaction of agency business." If so, the employee is eligible for either a per diem allowance or "actual expenses."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Per diem is a predetermined daily allotment. The amount depends on the city to which the employee is traveling. Periodically, the government issues bulletins reflecting current per diem rates.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "actual expense method" of reimbursement may be authorized at the agency's discretion. Guidelines are published at 41 CFR 301. The daily rate under this method is capped at 300 percent of the applicable maximum per diem allowance. Employees must supply receipts and will be reimbursed for the amount they actually spend, up to the maximum rate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note on air travel:</b> A cardinal rule in the Federal Travel Regulation requires federal employees to use coach class seating when flying on official business. After all, it's an often-stated goal of the government to increase public trust and confidence in its ability to perform efficiently and with a minimum of waste.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Premium class travel (any class above coach) may only be authorized when:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> No lesser accommodations are provided on regularly scheduled flights.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The mission is urgent and can't be postponed, and no coach seats are available on flights that would enable the traveler to complete it.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The traveler requires this class of service to accommodate a disability or other special need.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Security concerns or "exceptional circumstances" necessitate this class of seating.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Coach-class accommodations on approved foreign air carriers do not provide adequate sanitation or health standards.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The use of "premium class other than first-class" service produces an overall cost savings by avoiding additional subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive time while awaiting the availability of coach-class seating. (41 CFR 301-10.124.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Even fewer situations warrant the use of first-class seating. Under 41 CFR 301-10.123, first class is properly authorized only when no lesser grade of seating is reasonably available, when the traveler's disability cannot be accommodated by any other class, or when "exceptional security circumstances" make first-class travel essential. The regulation gives detailed guidance about each of these special circumstances. "The traveler is too important to travel coach" is not mentioned.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Special need travel.</b> Agencies can pay for additional travel expenses to accommodate a special physical need that is either clearly visible and discernible or substantiated in writing by a competent medical authority. Agencies have discretion to determine if a request based on a physical need is reasonable. Here are two examples of when a special need travel accommodation may be appropriate:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A very tall employee (a trait that is clearly visible and discernible) may be authorized to upgrade to extra-fare seating on an airplane, such as an exit row seat.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee who has a chronic medical condition that may not be visible, but requires the help of an assistant, provides a letter from a competent medical authority to substantiate their request for travel expenses for the assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Employees who breastfeed.</b> Special need travel may include employees who breastfeed. The General Services Administration has issued guidance explaining that to avoid forcing an employee to make a choice between nursing or fulfilling work duties, agencies may recognize that an employee who breastfeeds has a special need. This determination may mean that a spouse, nanny, or other attendant can accompany the employee on the trip at government expense to watch the child in between the employee's reasonable break periods to breastfeed while working at the temporary duty station. If no attendant is necessary, an employee may still need to use services to safely store and ship milk to the child while on travel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">GSA made several points about a special need designation for breastfeeding:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> There is no absolute limit on the length of time breastfeeding should be considered a special need, but the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least one year, the first six months exclusively with breast milk.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Any labor costs related to taking an attendant or caregiver for the infant on TDY travel are the responsibility of the employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Any extra costs associated with the infant's travel generally should be assumed by the employee. However, the agency can make the final determination as to what is prudent to reimburse.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Expenses that may be reimbursed to accommodate a nursing employee's special need may include, but are not limited to, reasonable commercial shipping fees, excess baggage, disposable storage bags or non-durable containers, cold shipping packages, refrigeration, and transport.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Temporary change of station</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">A temporary change of station is relocation to another official station for a long-term assignment. When the TCS assignment is completed, the employee returns to the original official station.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When it is most economical, agencies have the option of classifying long-term assignments of six to 30 months as TCS. Employees on TCS are ineligible for TDY per diem and may not elect it instead of TCS payment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, a TCS per diem is payable under this mode of travel. TCS allows for the payment of transportation costs for the employee and immediate family. Employees on TCS status are also eligible for transportation and storage of household goods and vehicle shipping fees, among other expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When TCS assignments exceed 30 months, the agency:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Must either permanently assign to the temporary duty station or return the employee to the original duty station;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> May not pay for extended storage or property management services incurred after the last day of the 30th month; and</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Must pay the expenses of returning the employee and immediate family and household goods to the previous official station unless permanently assigned to the temporary official station.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Travel for training</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Training travel is in a separate class. It is a hybrid, borrowing from guidelines established for TDY and permanent change of station transfers. Payment of expenses for periods of training is governed by the Government Employees Training Act, 5 USC 4109.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under this scheme, training is defined as "a planned, prepared, and coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or routine of instruction or education, in scientific, professional, technical, mechanical, trade, clerical, fiscal, administrative, or other fields which will improve individual and organizational performance and assist in achieving the agency's mission and performance goals."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is sent away on a qualified training mission, the agency may pay for family travel to the training site. It may authorize shipping and temporary storage of household goods. However, before authorizing such expenses, the agency must perform a cost comparison. It must determine whether "the estimated costs of transportation and related services are less than the estimated aggregate per diem payments for the period of training." The effect of this requirement is to limit "travel for training" to extended training periods. Shorter training travel periods, such as a week to attend a seminar, are covered by TDY rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Depending on the outcome of the cost comparison, the employee is entitled to receive either per diem while in attendance or reimbursement for the costs of transporting dependents and shipment of household goods to the training location, if this would be less than per diem.</p>
<h3 class="h3">PCS expenses</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">When employees are issued orders for permanent change of station, they become eligible for payment or reimbursement of many expenses associated with relocation. This section will help you understand the basics of PCS entitlements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> Don't rely on this section alone to determine how to authorize payment of PCS expenses. Consult carefully with HR and check the regulations. The rules are strict, and with the government's increasing scrutiny of these expenditures, it is quite possible you will be required to scrupulously back up each authorization.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees may qualify for reimbursement differently, depending on their status and location. For instance, new appointees enjoy fewer entitlements than existing employees. Employees will also experience variations in the way relocations are treated, depending on whether or not they occur within the continental United States. This section addresses the only categories of payment available to existing employees transferring within the continental United States.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With limited exceptions, agencies may authorize payment of relocation expenses when the transfer of their employees from one duty station to another is deemed to be in the interest of the government.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To qualify for payment of relocation expenses, employees must satisfy certain criteria:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee must sign a service agreement.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The new official duty station generally must be at least 50 miles away from the old one.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Unless granted an extension, the employee must complete all aspects of the relocation within two years of the effective date of the PCS order.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">When an agency determines that an employee is entitled to relocation expenses, it must pay transportation costs and per diem for the employee and all immediate family members. The agency should determine the most cost-effective means of travel. Except for the fact that costs generated by the employee's family members are included, payment of transportation costs and per diem is the same for PCS travel as for travel associated with TDY.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The relocation benefits that employees receive when they transfer from one permanent duty station to another are generally considered taxable income. To cover the increased tax liability resulting from receipt of these benefits, agencies may pay an additional sum, called a relocation income tax allowance, to transferred employees. The RIT offsets the extra income taxes that employees incur because they must declare certain relocation benefits as taxable income. Check with HR for details.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> Be aware, however, that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 suspended qualified moving expense deductions along with the exclusion of employer reimbursements and payments of moving expenses for tax years 2018 through 2025. This means that employees who relocate for work must pay taxes on relocation expense reimbursements, such as those for shipping household goods, storage-in-transit, non-temporary storage charges, lodging expenses while en route, and mileage for using a privately owned vehicle to travel to a new duty station. Consult HR for assistance on counseling employees on this tax matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>House-hunting trips.</b> Agencies have discretion to authorize payment of expenses incurred during house-hunting trips. This means the agency may -- but need not necessarily -- agree to pay such expenses when they are deemed to be in the government's best interest. House-hunting trips do not qualify for payment if the employee's purpose in making the trip is to determine whether to accept the appointment. The employee must have already accepted before the trip begins.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may authorize only one round-trip for you and/or your spouse for the purpose of house-hunting. House-hunting employees are entitled to their actual transportation costs, as well as either a fixed payment or a per diem for subsistence expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be eligible, the employee's transfer must be pursuant to PCS orders (not training missions governed by 5 USC 4109). The distance between the old and new official duty stations must be at least 75 miles. The trip may be designed to seek either rental housing or a home for purchase. Only those expenses incurred by the employee and the employee's spouse are reimbursable. In addition, eligibility for a house-hunting trip allowance is limited to a transferring employee whose old and new official duty stations are located within the U.S.</p>
<h3 class="h3">TQSE</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may authorize payment of temporary quarters subsistence expenses for transferring employees and their immediate families, if it is in the government's interest to do so. TQSE covers subsistence expenses (lodging plus meals and incidentals) associated with occupying temporary quarters. It does not extend to the cost of local transportation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">TQSE may be authorized in increments of 30 days or less, not to exceed 60 consecutive days. In "compelling" circumstances, the agency may authorize up to 60 additional consecutive days, but the regulation prohibits any more than 120 total days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the employee elects the "actual expense" method of payment, rather than per diem, the maximum allowable period is 30 days and no extensions are permitted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency should carefully assess whether individual situations warrant TQSE allowances. In evaluating an employee's need for such an allowance, the agency is to consider whether other alternatives might be more economical. For instance, a house-hunting trip might be less expensive and enable the employee to locate permanent quarters more efficiently than in a TQSE situation. Employees who have had other opportunities to arrange permanent housing in the area of the new duty station -- for instance, because a long-term temporary assignment at the duty station ended just before the PCS orders were issued -- may not merit a TQSE allowance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees transferring from one duty station to another, either in TCS or PCS status, are eligible for payment of costs to transport and temporarily store their household goods.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Included are the costs of packing, crating, weighing, picking up, and delivering HHG. The maximum weight of HHG for which the government may pay these costs is 18,000 pounds. The employee must reimburse the agency for any excess charges associated with goods weighing more.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Beyond HHG, there is a separate category of personal property: "professional books, papers, and equipment." Although PBP&#x0026;E is normally included in the 18,000-pound limit, if the weight of these objects causes the HHG to exceed 18,000 pounds, the agency may ship the PBP&#x0026;E separately, as an administrative expense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Goods may be stored for 90 days. The designated agency official may authorize an extension of 90 days, but temporary storage may never exceed 180 days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency has discretion in determining how to authorize payment for the covered services. It may pay actual expenses to the service providers directly. In that case, all arrangements for moving and storage are to be made by the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Alternatively, under the "commuted rate" method, the employee personally arranges for the packing, weighing, transportation and storage of HHG. Under this method, the employee may receive an advance of funds to pay for the services or may seek reimbursement later. Documentation, including weight tickets and receipts, is required. The maximum payment available to the employee is found in the commuted rate schedules published by the Household Goods Carriers' Bureau.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency also may authorize transportation of a privately owned vehicle upon determining it is in the government's interest for the employee to have access to a POV at the new duty station. In making the assessment, the agency should consider such factors as whether the employee's use of a POV will make the employee more effective on the job. Also, the suitability of the particular POV for use in the local conditions should be considered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency's cost analysis may lead it to determine that the most economical method of transporting the POV to the new duty station is for the employee to drive it there. If so, an adjustment in the employee's travel per diem will be made to account for this method of transportation.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Residence transactions</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees transferring pursuant to PCS orders are eligible for certain residence transaction expenses associated with selling their old homes and buying new ones. Also included in this scheme are expenses associated with settling unexpired leases at the old duty station.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Normally, an employee must complete the qualifying transactions within two years of the effective date of the transfer to be eligible for reimbursement. However, the agency has discretion to extend that time by up to two years.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's entitlement to recover residence transaction expenses turns on whether sellers or buyers customarily pay such expenses in the area where the home is located. The agency is responsible to review the submitted expenses to ensure they meet this and all criteria before approving reimbursement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If appropriate, this category authorizes payment of a laundry list of expenses related to the sale or purchase of homes. The most prominent are: costs of appraisal and advertising; broker's fees or commissions related to the sale of a residence; the cost of title insurance policies; and loan origination fees. Administrative fees connected to the preparation and transmission of documents are generally recoverable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Anything resembling a finance charge is generally not payable as a residence transaction cost. Nor are charges for interest, maintenance costs, property taxes, or fees that, while otherwise recoverable, are "inflated or higher than normally imposed for similar services in the locality."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees who sell their homes via "home sale programs" are eligible for incentive payments. A home sale program is one in which a private relocation services company purchases the employee's residence at fair market value and then independently markets the home itself. The employee plays an integral role in locating a bona fide purchaser for the property.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency is responsible to determine whether to offer employees home marketing incentive payments. In assessing whether it is in the government's interest to do so, the agency should look at the potential savings associated with using the services of a relocation company as compared to traditional means of selling homes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may authorize limited payment for various miscellaneous expenses associated with discontinuing occupancy at the prior residence and establishing occupancy at the new one. Examples of such expenses include vehicle registration fees, fees for connecting or disconnecting utilities, and the costs of transporting pets.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Per diem</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Per diem is the allowance for lodging (excluding taxes), meals, and incidental expenses. Per diem rates are set by fiscal year, effective Oct. 1. GSA establishes the per diem rates for the lower 48 continental United States (CONUS), which are the maximum allowances that federal employees (excluding federal contractors) are reimbursed for expenses incurred while on official travel away from their local duty station or areas defined by their agency. The State Department establishes the foreign travel rates (for example, Russia, Aruba, Bahamas, Europe, etc.). The Department of Defense (Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee) establishes non-foreign rates such as Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The CONUS per diem rate for an area is actually three allowances: the lodging allowance, the meals allowance and the incidental expense allowance (M&#x0026;IE). Most of the CONUS (approximately 2,600 counties) are covered by the standard CONUS per diem rate. If the destination city and the county are not listed in the per diem rate list, then that area receives the standard CONUS location rate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In FY 2023, there are 316 non-standard areas (NSAs) that have per diem rates higher than the standard CONUS rate. NSAs are frequently traveled by the federal community and are reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The M&#x0026;IE reimbursement rate for the first and last travel day is 75 percent of the total M&#x0026;IE rate for the temporary duty travel location (not the official duty station location).</p>
<h3 class="h3">FY 2023 results:</h3>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The standard CONUS per diem rate increased to $157. This consists of $98 for lodging and $59 for M&#x0026;IE.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> NSA lodging per diem rates are at or above FY 2022 levels. The standard lodging per diem rate increased to $98.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The M&#x0026;IE reimbursement rates were revised and range from $59-$79, with the standard M&#x0026;IE rate unchanged at $59.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">There are no new NSA locations for FY 2023, and three locations that were NSAs in FY 2022 moved into the standard CONUS rate category. FY 2023 per diem rates are available at:</p>

<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Travel time is difficult and sensitive, and employees can easily get the idea they're being treated unfairly. Avoid these common mistakes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Increase per diem by more than one day to avoid travel outside of duty time.</b> The Comptroller General held that this is contrary to good public policy and government fiscal responsibility.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Increase costs when you change tours of duty to allow employees to travel on duty time.</b> Be aware of the effect of night pay, night differential pay, and holiday and Sunday premium pay.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Grant "unofficial comp time."</b> This is illegal, and if it is discovered in an audit, the employee may be obligated to repay the government for the value of the improper time off, either through payroll collection or an annual leave offset. When appropriate, you can use the comp time rules to grant legal comp time (check with HR on your current agency policy).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore your employee's FLSA status.</b> Exempt or nonexempt? It makes a big difference when it comes to travel time compensation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Authorize reimbursement of expenses that are not permitted by travel regulations.</b> An expense that is not allowed by law or regulation will not be reimbursed, even if you "authorize" it with your signature, and an employee who is unexpectedly paying out of pocket will not thank you.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore the relative costs of travel.</b> You cannot authorize more expensive means of travel or lodgings simply because an employee wants you to. Nor can you authorize it for your own travel. This includes air travel in classes higher than coach. There are special circumstances that permit premium-class travel (such as accommodation of disabilities and seat availability), but "the traveler is too important to fly coach" is not one of them.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to consider the "interests of the government" in PCS moves.</b> Just because an employee relocates doesn't mean there is an automatic entitlement to PCS expense reimbursement. The transfer should serve a definite government purpose. An employee who moves just because another job or location is more desirable may not be properly entitled to government support.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I change an employee's tour of duty to include travel time?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes, you can. But be careful to consider the effect of night pay, night differential pay, and Sunday and holiday premium pay. You may be better off with comp time, if it is available.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I authorize travel early and pay more per diem to allow for travel on duty time?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> If it's just one day, yes, but the Comptroller General held it is contrary to good public policy and government fiscal responsibility to increase per diem by more than one day to avoid travel outside of duty time. (56 Comp. Gen. 847, 77 FPBR 1158 (1977).)</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. If employees are delayed by bad weather, can they be paid for the delay?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> If travel is carried out under such arduous conditions that it is inseparable from work, the time may be compensated, but this applies to such things as long drives over adverse terrain or through very bad weather. It does not apply to weather delays in airports, however long or unpleasant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can comp time be used for travel time?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes, but look out for limitations. The use of comp time applies only to employees as defined by 5 USC 5541(2). This excludes wage grade employees, SES, Foreign Service, and certain others. There are many restrictions on which time may be compensated. Check with HR for the application of the new regulations in your agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I grant "unofficial comp time" for travel?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> This is a bad idea. It is illegal, and if it is discovered in an audit, the employee may have to pay it back, either through payroll collection or an annual leave offset. Legal comp time is available to cover many situations, so don't be tempted to go the "unofficial" route.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I compensate for travel with an incentive award?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Sure, if the employee did something noteworthy while away. Showing up at a conference or training course probably doesn't qualify.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I authorize specific TDY expenses on my own authority?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Not if they are not permitted by law or regulation. Expenses are audited, and the employee may wind up unexpectedly paying out of pocket. Don't expect thanks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I authorize business-class air travel for senior employees?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Generally, no. There are some conditions under which you may authorize business-class, or even first-class travel. These include accommodation of disability, urgency of travel, seat availability, and favorable total cost comparisons. But "the traveler is too important to fly coach" is not one of these conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I authorize a house-hunting trip for an employee considering a transfer?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. The employee must accept the new job before a house-hunting trip can be authorized.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I authorize PCS transportation of household goods above the 18,000-pound limit?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Generally the HHG limit of 18,000 pounds is absolute. However, it is possible to authorize the transportation of a separate category of personal property: "professional books, papers and equipment." PBP&#x0026;E may be shipped separately by the agency as an administrative expense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are relocating employees always entitled to ship their POVs at government expense?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Not always. The agency should consider whether it is in the government's interest that the employee have a privately-owned vehicle at the new duty station and if the particular POV is suited to conditions at the new station. And the agency's cost analysis may determine that the most economical method of transporting the POV to the new duty station is for the employee to drive it there. In this case, an adjustment in travel per diem should be made.</p>
