<h4 class="h4" id="sec19-27"><span class="space">1.</span> Numerosity</h4>
<p class="noindent">The class agent must establish that the number of potential class members is sufficiently large to make consolidation of the individual complaints impractical. The practicality of consolidating complaints takes into account the number of potential complainants, as well as factors such as "geographic dispersion, ease with which the class may be identified, the nature of the action, and the size of each claim." <span class="Italic">Crazythunder</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no set number of class members that is required to meet the numerosity requirement. Each potential class must be assessed on an individual basis and the geographic distribution of the class should be considered in determining whether joinder is possible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01964128 (1998); <span class="Italic">Ferrich v. USPS</span>, 01873302 (1988) (joinder possible where the class consists of 29 members, all of whom work at agency facilities in the same region).</p>
<p class="noindent">The class representative bears the burden of proving that the members of the class are too numerous for consolidation. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of Navy</span>, 01821973 (1982) (class of 20 blacks does not meet the numerosity prerequisite). A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Fontana v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A20184 (2003), where the Commission held that it would not be impractical to consolidate the complaints of 20 employees at the same facility whose jobs were abolished. The Commission has ruled that a potential class of 35 members does not meet the requirement. <span class="Italic">See Wood v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01831449 (1983). However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Valentin P, et al. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120113722 (2016), held that a list of 20 putative class members and a statement by the class agent providing evidence that the potential class could be as large as 800 was enough to provisionally meet the numerosity requirement. A class of between 70 and 90 members is sufficient for certification. <span class="Italic">See Johnson-Feldman v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01953168 (1997); s<span class="Italic">ee also</span> <span class="Italic">Jeffries v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A02227 (2003) (77 past and present employee sufficient for class certification); <span class="Italic">Thockmorton v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A03994 (2003) (class of 74 meets numerosity requirement); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01990384 (2000) (60 employees are sufficient for class certification). A class of 1,600 potential employees fulfills the numerosity requirement, even if further refinement of the class definition eliminated some class members. <span class="Italic">See Sylvester v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01840318 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether to certify the class, the administrative judge must not only consider the named complainants, but the potential class as defined in the complaint. Eighteen named complainants are not sufficient to form a class, but a potential class of 342 members, located throughout the agency worldwide, meets the numerosity requirement. <span class="Italic">Wirkler v. Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 01881849 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">To establish a "potential class" number, a class representative need only show that there is numerosity in the number of class members "who possibly could have been affected" by the at issue agency action. <span class="Italic">Tessa L. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0720170021 (2017). In that case, the Commission found that the class was properly conditional certified where, among other things, the class representative established that 40 deaf and hard of hearing employees could have possibly been affected by the agency's decision to decentralize interpreting services. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Tessa L</span>. explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The numerosity prerequisite states that the potential class must be sufficiently numerous so that a consolidated complaint by the members of the class, or individual, separate complaints from members of the class is impractical. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.2014(a)(2)(i). The focus in determining whether the class is sufficiently numerous for certification is the number of persons affected by the Agency's alleged discriminatory practice(s). <span class="Italic">See White, et al. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A42449 (Sept. 1, 2005). The Commission has held that the relevant factors to determine whether the numerosity requirement has been met are the size of the class, the geographical dispersion of the class, the ease with which class members may be identified, the nature of the action at issue, and the size of each member's claim. <span class="Italic">Carter, et al. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A24926 (Nov. 14, 2003). In determining whether the class is sufficiently numerous, the AJ needs to consider the number of persons who possibly could have been affected by the agency's discriminatory practices and who, thus, may assert claims. <span class="Italic">Simon V., et al. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110008 (Sept. 15, 2015). While there are no specific numerical cut-off points, most courts are generally reluctant to certify a class with thirty or fewer members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's assertion, Class Agent was not required to prove that each of the 40 deaf and hard of hearing employees she had spoken to have a viable claim. Rather, she only has to show that there were 40 deaf and hard of hearing USDA NCR employees who possibly could have been affected by DM's decision to decentralize interpreting services and who, thus, may assert claims. We agree with the AJ that Class Agent did that. Class Agent stated that she had a list of 40 deaf and hard of hearing individuals who had come to her in her capacity as the USDA Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) President to express concerns about the decentralization of interpreting services and its impact on their ability to do the essential functions of their positions. There is no requirement that these 40 employees file individual claims before they can be counted for the purpose of numerosity. We agree with the AJ that numerosity has been demonstrated by the existence of multiple filed claims and the approximately 40 deaf and hard of hearing employees who have expressed concerns and/or complaints about DM's decentralization of interpreting services.</p>
<p class="noindent">Numerosity could not be determined in <span class="Italic">Illa S. v. EEOC</span>, 0120172769 (2017), where the class representative identified the potential class members as "bilingual investigators," because as the Commission explained bilingual persons are not a protected class:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant maintains that all 142 Bilingual Investigators employed nationwide by the Agency comprise the potential class. However, in order to constitute a viable EEO claim, Complainant must assert that discrimination against a protected class has occurred. In this case, Complainant ostensibly alleges discrimination based on national origin, but Bilingual Investigators can be of various national origins, including the United States. Further, a bilingual individual is not of necessity bilingual in a language associated with that individual's national origin. Complainant has not provided any information regarding the national origins of the Bilingual Investigators in the proposed class. To the extent that Complainant attempts on appeal to narrow the class to only Bilingual Investigators of Hispanic national origin, she still has not stated even an estimate of the number of Bilingual Investigators that fit into this category. As a result, we find that the total number of the class cannot be approximated. <span class="Italic">See Joel P. v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120181 (Oct. 13, 2017) (numerosity not established where Complainant asserted that thousands could be in proposed class but provided no evidence to support his assertion); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A34535 (Sept. 23, 2004) (while class agent alleged 34 class members, no evidence showed that class members and class agent had similar bases and issues; putative class therefore could not be approximated and class agent failed to establish numerosity). Consequently, we find that Complainant has failed to establish the numerosity requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Klein v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01880956 (1988), the Commission offered the following explanation of the numerosity requirement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant bears the burden of demonstrating that the class is so numerous that a consolidated complaint of the members of the class is impractical (known as the numerosity requirement). <span class="Italic">Beasley v. Kroehler Mfg. Co.</span>, 406 F. Supp. 926 (N.D. Tex.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">mem</span>., 538 F.2d 897 (5th Cir. 1976). Courts have considered, as indices of whether or not joinder is impractical, the number of class members, the location and dispersion of class members, the ease of identifying the class members and any other factors which would indicate a substantial hardship in the class members' participation in the complaint<span class="Italic">. Garcia v. Gloor</span>, 618 F.2d 264 (5th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 449 U.S. 1113 (1981). There is no specific number of class members which will demonstrate numerosity. <span class="Italic">General Tel. Co. of Northwest v. EEOC</span>, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980) ("The numerosity requirement requires examination of the specific facts of each case and imposes no absolute limitations."); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Joint Legislative Comm.</span>, 637 F.2d 1014, 1022 (5th Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 456 U.S. 960 (1982) ("The proper focus is not on numbers alone, but on whether joinder of all members is practicable in view of the numerosity of the class and all other relevant factors.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1624"></span>In the same case, the Commission, adopting the findings of most courts, held that employees who may be affected in the future cannot be used to establish the numerosity requirement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Scott v. University of Delaware</span>, 601 F.2d 76, 89 (3rd Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 444 U.S. 931 (1979); <span class="Italic">Fewlass v. Allyn Bacon, Inc.</span>, 83 F.R.D. 161, 165 n.6 (D. Mass. 1979).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920003 (1991), the Commission appeared to retreat somewhat from that position, and took into account the number of class members affected by the agency's policy between the filing of the complaint and the decision of the administrative judge on class certification.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, the appellant challenged an agency policy requiring employees with physical disabilities to be given a choice between a modified job offer or leave without pay. The appellant alleged that the modified job offers were used in lieu of attempts at reasonable accommodation and, therefore, violated the Rehabilitation Act. The agency rejected a recommended decision by the administrative judge to certify the class, finding the complainant failed to meet the prerequisites of numerosity, commonality, and typicality. On reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, the Commission reversed, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether the members of a class are so numerous that consolidation is impractical depends upon the size of the class, the ability to identify the members of that class and their addresses, the facility of making service, and the geographic dispersion of the class members<span class="Italic">. Garcia v. Gloor</span>, 618 F.2d 264, <span class="Italic">rehearing denied</span>, 625 F.2d 1016 (5th Cir. 1980). In the present case, the class oriGINAlly contained 34 members, however, it was predicted to increase in size due to the nature of the allegation, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, additional employees would require limited duty and, consequently, be subjected to the agency's alleged discriminatory policy. By the time the AJ rendered her decision recommending certification, the class had grown to 60 members. In its previous decision, the Commission found no evidence to show that joinder would be impossible since all the employees were at the same facility and could be easily identified. In her request to reopen, appellant presents evidence that additional employees have been effected by the disputed policy as recently as September 1991, supporting her assertion that the class is ever-increasing in size. The Commission finds that appellant's complaint has met the numerosity requirement and due to the size of the class at the time of the AJ's certification decision <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, 60 members, and due to the impracticality of consolidating the members' complaints due to the nature of the class, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, its constantly increasing size. Furthermore, we note that there appears to be a question of the scope of the policy, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether the disputed policy is limited to the Cincinnati Division or whether it is applied throughout the agency. Clearly, the answer to this question could have a substantial impact on the size of the class involved. (footnote omitted). Therefore, the agency is hereby directed to obtain information for the record regarding the scope of the policy in question.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, the Commission can take into account the fact that the class is likely to continue to increase in size. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Attorney General</span>, 05960870 (1998) (in determining whether the class has fulfilled the numerosity requirement, the class should not be limited to the complainants identified in the complaint; potential complainants identified during the course of discovery also should be included).</p>
<p class="noindent">It also is critical that the potential class be properly defined in order to determine whether it meets the numerosity requirement. The class must be defined not only by the basis of discrimination alleged, but also by the policy or personnel practice at issue. The proposed class members, therefore, must share common characteristics and must have been subjected to the same policy or practice. In <span class="Italic">Moten v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 05910504 (1991), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further argues that the previous decision erroneously found that appellant had met the numerosity requirement for class certification by utilizing the number of black professionals employed at the Agency, rather than the number of black professional employees who applied for and were denied promotions to positions in the Agency. On this point, we find that the Agency is correct. While the exact number of class members need not be shown prior to certification, the correct focus in determining whether the class is sufficiently numerous for certification purposes is on the number of persons affected by the Agency's allegedly discriminatory practices and who thus may assert claims. We specifically note the <span class="Italic">Lilly v. Harris-Teeter Supermarket</span> decision cited by the previous decision acknowledges that those persons to be counted for even a tentative class certification should be those who were affected by the employer's alleged discriminatory actions. <span class="Italic">Lilly v. Harris-Teeter Supermarket</span>, 720 F.2d at 333, n.5 (4th Cir. 1983). In this regard, the sheer number of black professionals employed at the Agency does not satisfy this element, as was emphasized by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bettee Charles</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Rowe</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Nor does the Commission find the "statement of support" submitted by appellant sufficient to indicate that an adequate number of class members (black professional employees GS-9 and above) were actually affected by the Agency's alleged discriminatory practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that while appellant asserts in her response to the Agency's request, that her claims of subjective discriminatory evaluation and training policies can also be viewed as independent claims, appellant has not shown that a sufficient number of black professional employees at the Agency have been negatively affected by such policies and would thus be members of any such class. Finally, while appellant asserts that the Agency's personnel policies could have had a chilling effect on black employees who did not bother to apply for positions because of knowledge of the alleged discriminatory system, no such actual effect is yet demonstrated. Nor has appellant demonstrated how she has been injured by such policies in the manner typical of other alleged class members.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission determined that the administrative judge's request to the appellant for more specific information regarding the number of class members was phrased in general terms and did not put the class agent on notice regarding the specific types of information that would be required in order to meet the numerosity prerequisite. The complaint was remanded to the administrative judge for further development of the record. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Moten v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 05960233 (1997) (finding that 47 potential class members put class on the "cusp" of failing to meet the numerosity requirement, but further development of the factual record was needed).</p>
<p class="noindent">A critical numerosity factor involves not only the actual number of class members, but the difficulty that joinder of the complaints would entail. In <span class="Italic">Hines v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01931776 (1994), the Commission found a proposed class of 80 members had fulfilled the numerosity requirement, particularly where the class members were geographically dispersed. Moreover, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Hines</span> rejected the agency's argument that the administrative judge should not consider individual claims that may have been resolved by the agency when making the certification decision on numerosity.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's failure to provide the information requested by the administrative judge to refute the complainant's assertion of numerosity properly results in a finding that the requirement has been met, at least conditionally. <span class="Italic">See Durnford v. Attorney General</span>, 01971933 (2000). On the issue of numerosity, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Durnford</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the agency failed to respond to the AJ's request for information, which could have corroborated the arguments in the FAD regarding the actual number of 1995 applicants for the Position, as well as the breakdown of the applicant pool into sub-sets of class characteristics, the complainant was able to carry his burden of proof with the evidence he submitted. Given the agency's failure to submit any evidence in its favor, the AJ correctly determined that complainant would likely be able to obtain the evidence of numerosity he needed, which is maintained by the agency, during post-certification discovery. In other words, if the agency had contrary evidence to offer, it would have done so, and its failure to do so strongly suggests that the evidence that it does have in its possession supports the complainant's claim that the numerosity requirement is satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Durnford</span> noted that if the complainant was unable to provide evidence of numerosity following discovery, the administrative judge could use his authority to decertify the class.</p>
