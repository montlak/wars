<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-199"><span class="space">Q.</span> PUNITIVE DAMAGES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The 1991 Civil Rights Act makes it clear that federal agencies are not subject to the punitive damages provision. However, in 1996, a U.S. district court held that the U.S. Postal Service was subject to the punitive damages provision of the 1991 Civil Rights Act. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Runyon</span>, 922 F. Supp. 1296 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (<span class="Italic">Baker I</span>). That ruling was reversed on appeal. Since then, all courts of appeals have held that the Postal Service is not subject to liability for punitive damages. There remains, however, one district court decision finding that the Postal Service can be liable for punitive damages. These cases are discussed below. Ultimately, it is a question upon which the Supreme Court may have to rule, if a conflict among the circuits develops.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1963"></span>The district court and appellate court decisions in the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> cases are reviewed below because they develop the arguments for and against finding that the Postal Service is subject to the punitive damage provision of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Baker I</span>, the court found that the "sue and be sued" provision of a 1970 Postal Service reorganization act constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity. Because of the waiver of sovereign immunity, the court reasoned, the Postal Service was subject to the punitive damages provision of the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The opinion in <span class="Italic">Baker I</span>, 9222 F. Supp. at 1297-1300, written by a U.S. magistrate judge, reads substantially as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ordinarily, sovereign immunity protects the federal government from suit. <span class="Italic">Loeffler v. Frank</span>, 486 U.S. 549, 554, 108 S. Ct. 1965, 1969, 100 L. Ed.2d 549 (1988). This immunity, however, may be waived. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act ("FTCA"), the government is liable for tort claims but retains its immunity from liability for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages. 28 USC &#x00A7; 2674. Congress has also waived the sovereign immunity of some federal entities by providing, in their enabling legislation, that they may sue and be sued. <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span>, 486 U.S. at 554, 108 S. Ct. at 1969. The Supreme Court has explained that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">such waivers by Congress of governmental immunity...should be liberally construed.... Hence, when Congress establishes an agency, authorizes it to engage in commercial and business transactions with the public, and permits it to 'sue and be sued,' it cannot be lightly assumed that restrictions on that authority are to be implied. Rather if the general authority to 'sue and be sued' is to be delimited by implied exceptions, it must clearly be shown that certain types of suits are not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme, that an implied restriction of the general authority is necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function, or that for other reasons it was plainly the purpose of Congress to use the 'sue and be sued' clause in a narrow sense. In the absence of such a showing, it must be presumed that when Congress launched a governmental agency into the commercial world and endowed it with authority to 'sue and be sued,' that agency is not less amenable to judicial process than a private enterprise under like circumstances would be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">F.H.A. v. Burr</span>, 309 U.S. 242, 245, 60 S. Ct. 488, 490, 84 L. Ed. 724 (1940), quoted in <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span>, 486 U.S. at 554-55, 108 S. Ct. at 1969. The defendant herein, the Postal Service, is subject to just such a "sue-and-be-sued" clause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When Congress created the Postal Service in 1970, it empowered it "to sue and be sued in its official name." <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 401(1). This was part of Congress' intent that the Postal Service "be run more like a business than its predecessor, the Post Office Department." <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span>, 486 U.S. at 556, 108 S. Ct. at 1969. Congress saw to it that the Postal Service cast off its "cloak of sovereignty and assumed the status of a commercial enterprise." <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span>, 486 U.S. at 565, 108 S. Ct. at 1974. In <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span>, the Court found this waiver of sovereign immunity opened up the Postal Service to interest awards. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 557, 565, 108 S. Ct. at 1970, 1975. With respect to the Postal Service, then, there has been a full waiver of sovereign immunity that would allow a recovery of punitive damages where they would be available from a private commercial enterprise. Defendant does not appear to argue otherwise. (1) Thus, the inquiry becomes "whether the source of substantive law upon which the claimant relies provides an avenue for relief." <span class="Italic">F.D.I.C. v. Meyer</span>, 510 U.S. 471, __, 114 S. Ct. 996, 1004, 127 L. Ed.2d 308 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Sue-and-be-sued entities are presumed to have fully waived immunity unless there is a clear showing that the type of suit is not consistent with the statutory scheme, that a limitation is necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function, or that it was plainly the purpose of Congress to use the sue-and-be-sued clause in a narrow sense. <span class="Italic">F.D.I.C. v. Meyer</span>, 510 U.S. 471, __, 114 S. Ct. 996, 1003, 127 L. Ed.2d 308 (1994). The defendant herein does not make such a showing but, instead, discusses the general policy considerations that weigh against assessing punitive damages against the government. This tactic essentially ignores the sue-and-be-sued waiver and begs the question of whether the Postal Service is the same as "the government."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Ignoring those failings for the moment, the concerns regarding punitive damages defendants raise--essentially those discussed in <span class="Italic">City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.</span>, 453 U.S. 247, 266-270, 101 S. Ct. 2748, 2759-2761, 69 L. Ed.2d 616 (1981)--are not as relevant to the Postal Service as they are to the federal government itself or other governmental entities. The central concern regarding the assessment of punitive damages against a government entity is that it would punish taxpayers as opposed to the entity. <span class="Italic">Newport</span>, 453 U.S. at 267-268, 101 S. Ct. at 2759-2760. In this case, however, the Postal Service is not supported by tax dollars and has not tax-levying authority. Punitive damages against the Postal Service would be more akin to a judgment against a major utility than a government entity. Such an award might filter down to citizens, but would do so through increased rates--not taxes. Another traditional concern is the prejudicial effect that a government's taxing authority would have on a jury's fixing of the amount of punitive damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 270-271, 101 S. Ct. at 2761-2762. In this case, once again, the Postal Service does not have the kind of taxing authority discussed in <span class="Italic">Newport</span>. Furthermore, there is a cap in the amount of damages available in this case. 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3). Defendant has not addressed these distinctions, choosing instead to simply equate the Postal Service with the federal government itself, essentially ignoring the sue-and-be-sued nature of the Postal Service that sets it apart from other governmental entities and the federal government itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiff's claim for punitive damages herein was created by the 1991 Act. Under the 1964 Act, Title VII relief was limited to "equitable" remedies--primarily backpay. 1964 Act, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g); <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244, __, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1490, 128 L. Ed.2d 229 (1994). The 1991 Act significantly expanded the monetary relief potentially available, to include compensatory damages for future pecuniary loss, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses. 1991 Act, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3); <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 1491. In addition, the 1991 Act made punitive damages available as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A complaining party may recover punitive damages under this section against a respondent (other than a government, government agency or political subdivision) if the complaining party demonstrates that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">42 USC 1981a(b)(1). The question here is whether the Postal Service is exempted from exposure to punitive damages as a "government, government agency or political subdivision."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To defendant, it is self-evident that the Postal Service is exempt from punitive damage liability under &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(1), because it is a federal entity that is part of the federal government. It is, in fact, "an independent establishment of the Executive Branch of the government of the United States...." 39 USC &#x00A7; 201. We are not as unhesitatingly convinced that an "independent establishment" is the same as a "government, government agency or political subdivision." Defendant does little to support its contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The cases upon which defendant relies are less than convincing. In <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 887 F. Supp. 63 (E.D.N.Y. 1995), the question of the Postal Service's status was not litigated, but conceded by the plaintiff therein. 887 F. Supp. at 66. In <span class="Italic">Suhr v. Runyon</span>, No. 95 C 50087 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 12, 1995) 1995 WL 617478, the court found that a suit against the Postal Service was "in essence a suit against a federal agency," <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Beth v. Espy</span>, 854 F. Supp. 735, 737 (D. Kan. 1994). <span class="Italic">Beth</span> dealt with a suit against the Department of Agriculture which, unlike the Postal Service, actually is a government agency and is quite unlike a "sue-and-be-sued" entity in that it had sovereign immunity from punitive damages prior to the 1991 Act. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. American Nat. Red Cross</span>, 847 F. Supp. 643, 648 (W.D. Wis. 1994) (distinguishing federal instrumentalities from federal agencies); <span class="Italic">Greenberg v. Republic Federal Savings &#x0026; Loan Ass'n</span>, 94 C 3789 (N.D. Ill. May 1, 1995) 1995 WL 263457 (noting same distinction). As already noted, Congress relinquished the Postal Service's sovereign immunity in 1970.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Beyond these citations, and its own tautologous recitations, the defendant offers little to show that the Postal Service qualifies as "a government, government agency or political subdivision." For example, defendant notes that the legislative history of the 1991 Act shows that Congress intended that the remedies available under Title VII did not exceed those available under 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. City of Fort Lauderdale</span>, Fla., 903 F. Supp. 1520, 1528 (S.D. Fla. 1995). Arguing that "governmental entities" are not liable for punitive damages under &#x00A7; 1981, defendant suggest that the Postal Service is, therefore, not liable for punitive damages in this case. Once again, however, defendant fails to address the "sue-and-be-sued" commercial nature of the Postal Service. The Postal Service simply cannot be equated with the municipalities and political subdivisions dealt with in the cases upon which defendant relies. <span class="Italic">See Poolaw v. City of Anadarko</span>, 738 F.2d 364 (10th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Heritage Homes, Inc. v. Seekonk Water Dist.</span>, 670 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Defendant also refers to Congress' mention of the Postal Service along with executive agencies in 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). When Congress extended Title VII's proscription against discrimination in employment to government agencies, it referred to "executive agencies" in addition to the Postal Service. 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). Defendant argues that this evinces Congressional intent to treat the Postal Service the same as other agencies. We can accept that premise with regard to Title VII liability, but not with regard to the punitive damage liability Congress created in the 1991 Act. While &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) treats the Postal Service the same as an executive agency, it also treats it the same as a military department and <span id="Page_1964"></span>the Library of Congress. The provision does not define the Postal Service as an agency, however, anymore than it defines it as a military department or the Library of Congress. The fact that Congress felt it necessary to specifically mention the Postal Service in addition to executive agencies in &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) indicates--to the contrary of defendant's position--that Congress considered the Postal Service something other than an agency. When, in the 1991 Act, Congress exempted "government, government agency, or political subdivision," it did so without mention of the Postal Service. If the Postal Service was not considered a governmental agency in the drafting of &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a), it does not follow that the Postal Service became an agency--thereby included in the exemption from punitive damages--sometime prior to the drafting of the 1991 Act. If Congress had wanted to exempt the Postal Service from punitive damages in the 1991 Act, it would have mentioned it along with governmental agencies in the same fashion it did in &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). Defendant's statutory construction argument, then, is no more convincing than his other offerings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue that defendant continues to leave unresolved is the effect of the Postal Service's "sue-and-be-sued" nature on defendant's assertions of general propositions against the imposition of punitive damages on the sovereign. None of these arguments do anything to convince the court that the Postal Service and the sovereign are one and the same. Indeed, outside this courtroom, the Postal Service spends a fair amount of money in advertising, through the likes of George C. Scott, to convince us otherwise, touting the fact that the Postal Service receives no support through tax dollars whatsoever. While admirable, this fact, like the arguments defendant advances herein, undermines rather than supports defendant's claim of immunity from punitive damages.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Indeed, one test to determine the applicability of sovereign immunity--that is, whether a suit is against the sovereign--is whether a "judgment would expend itself on the public treasury." <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Rural Elec. Convenience Co-Op. Co.</span>, 922 F.2d 429, 433 (7th Cir. 1991) (quoting <span class="Italic">Dugan v. Rank</span>, 372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S. Ct. 999, 1006, 10 L. Ed.2d 15 (1963)). Although defendant makes no mention herein of the degree to which the Postal Service is divorced from the treasury, it would appear that, to the extent it is unsupported by tax dollars, a judgment against it would not draw from the public treasury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he arguments defendant advances against Postal Service liability might support the exemption of governmental agencies in general, but fail to address the Postal Service's status as a "sue-and-be-sued" entity. We cannot accept the analogies defendant draws between the Postal Service and municipalities, water districts, or the Department of Agriculture. Congress intended the Postal Service to be a commercial enterprise wholly unlike those entities. Nor can we accept defendant's suggestion that Congress' mention of the Postal Service along with executive agencies defines the Postal Service as an executive agency anymore than the Postal Service's mention with military departments defines it as one of those. In the end, the defendant has failed to touch on the significance of the Postal Service as a "sue-and-be-sued" entity and, consequently, we are unconvinced that the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages should be stricken.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course it is worth noting that the <span class="Italic">Baker I</span> decision did not open the Postal Service to liability for punitive damages in every Title VII case. The plaintiff still had to meet the statute's requirement, demonstrating that the Postal Service engaged in discriminatory conduct "'with malice or reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1298, (quoting 42 USC 1981a(b)(1)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Having ruled that punitive damage awards were permissible against the Postal Service, the court, in a separate decision, proceeded to award the plaintiff $50,000 in punitive damages in <span class="Italic">Baker v. Runyon</span>, 922 F. Supp. 1300 (N.D. Ill. 1996) <span class="Italic">(Baker II</span>). The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Baker</span> originally pursued her claims of sex discrimination and sexual harassment administratively. After a hearing, the EEOC administrative judge issued recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of the plaintiff. The administrative judge recommended a compensatory damage award of $50,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency accepted the recommended decision, including the recommended damage award. However, unsatisfied with the award, the plaintiff filed an appeal with OFO. When the case was still pending before OFO nine months later, the plaintiff filed an action in U.S. district court. The Postal Service admitted liability and the only question remaining before the court was the amount of damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff, a female, started receiving harassing phone calls that she suspected were from a female coworker regarding their mutual involvement with a male coworker. Plaintiff's workstation also was tampered with, and the plaintiff brought these complaints to her supervisors. Instead of acting on plaintiff's complaints, her supervisors joked about the matter over an office intercom and one of the supervisors propositioned her. More complaints by the plaintiff brought no action on the part of her supervisors, but did provoke sexual remarks in response. The plaintiff was also assigned the heaviest routes and threatened with suspension when she could not complete the routes. Ultimately, the plaintiff was suspended for seven days.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, on a very cold day, the plaintiff was assigned to deliver mail in an unheated vehicle. When plaintiff complained, her supervisor laughed at her. The plaintiff ended up with frostbite on her feet, which worsened into a condition that required surgery. After that, the plaintiff had medical restrictions that required light duty. However, the plaintiff was often still assigned the heavier mail routes and required to work outside of her medical restrictions. As a result of the emotional distress she suffered, the plaintiff also sought counseling for depression.</p>
<p class="noindent">Against this backdrop, the court awarded $75,000 in compensatory damages. Turning to the award of punitive damages, the court in <span class="Italic">Baker II</span>, 922 F. Supp. at 1305-06, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn to the assessment of punitive damages. Punitive damages are appropriate in case of callous disregard for a plaintiff's rights<span class="Italic">. Smith v. Wade</span>, 461 U.S. 30, 51, 103 S. Ct. 1625, 1637, 75 L. Ed.2d 632 (1983) cited in <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Balistrieri</span>, 981 F.2d 916, 936 (7th Cir. 1992). Punitive damages are awarded to punish the defendant for outrageous conduct and deter him and others like him from similar conduct in the future<span class="Italic">. Smith</span>, 461 U.S. at 54, 103 S. Ct. at 1639. Defendant disputes the availability of punitive damages in this case based on 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(1), but we have addressed and rejected defendant's argument in a separate order. As the conduct herein, already described above, clearly evinced a callous disregard for plaintiff's rights, all that remains is to arrive at an appropriate amount for an award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiff's request for punitive damages in this case has varied from $25,000 to $50,000. Because defendant does not believe punitive damages are available, he does not address the appropriate amount of punitive damages. In arriving at our assessment, we take note of the cap for total damages in this case under 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D): $300,000<span class="Italic">. Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc.</span>, 69 F.3d 1344, 1355 (7th Cir. 1995). Given our assessment of $75,000 in compensatory damages, the maximum award of punitive damages available would be $225,000. This maximum award must be reserved for only the most egregious cases<span class="Italic">. Hennessy</span>, 69 F.3d at 1355-56. We also look to other cases for guidance. In the case defendant cited as an example of an adequate award of compensatory damages, for example, the Seventh Circuit upheld an aggregate punitive damage award of $150,000--three times the compensatory damage award--against an individual and the corporation of which she was the owner and chief officer<span class="Italic">. EEOC v. AIC Security Investigations, Ltd.</span>, 55 F.3d 1276, 1287 (7th Cir. 1995). Some other punitive damage awards from this circuit have ranged from $20,000 in <span class="Italic">Sassaman v. Heart City Toyota</span>, 879 F. Supp. 901, 911 (N.D. Ind. 1994), to a total award of $300,000 in <span class="Italic">Emmel v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Chicago, Inc.</span>, 904 F. Supp. 723, 729, 740-41 (N.D. Ill. 1995), of which just $7,325 represented compensatory damages. In <span class="Italic">Hennessy</span>, the court remanded the case for a reduction of a $100,000 award, which was the maximum available under the cap in that case. 69 F.3d at 1355-56.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Hennessy</span> involved some instances of unwelcome sexual advances, but turned on the disparate treatment of plaintiff due to her pregnancy. The <span class="Italic">Emmel</span> case, unlike the instant case, involved sexual discrimination in promotions<span class="Italic">. Sassaman</span> is most analogous to the instant case. A sexual harassment case, it involved a course of conduct by several individuals, some whom were in management, encompassing insulting language and questioning, unwelcome touching, and differential treatment, all culminating in the plaintiff's termination<span class="Italic">. Sassaman</span>, 879 F. Supp. at 908-909. Plaintiff's case is similar to <span class="Italic">Sassaman</span>, but distinguishable in two respects: plaintiff was not discharged, and the course of harassment in <span class="Italic">Sassaman</span> did not result in physical injury and the ignoring of medical restriction resulting from that injury. Thus the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Sassaman</span> did not have a threat of physical pain and exacerbation of an injury hovering over her head each day. In addition, <span class="Italic">Sassaman</span> does not appear to have involved the pervasive atmosphere, condoned and encouraged by supervisors, in which an individual is treated as the sport of an entire workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is one additional factor we consider before arriving at our assessment. Defendant appears to be unrepentant for all that has occurred. The supervisory personnel involved have not been disciplined because, according to defendant, the ALJ "did not direct the Postal Service to discipline the supervisors and managers, but rather ordered training for these management employees." If the Postal Service requires an order to discipline the type of conduct that occurred here, there is every threat that it will allow it to occur in the future if undeterred. Hopefully, awarding punitive damages may well have a salutary effect in this regard. The defendant's attitude evinces a callous disregard of plaintiff's rights that echoes that of his supervisory personnel. Accordingly, considering the $20,000 award in <span class="Italic">Sassaman</span>, the additional exacerbating factors present in this case, and plaintiff's own quantification of punitive damages at $25,000 to $50,000, we find a punitive damages award of $50,000 to be appropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1965"></span>In <span class="Italic">Baker v. Runyon</span>, 114 F.3d 668 (7th Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">Baker III</span>), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed <span class="Italic">Baker I</span>, finding that the Postal Service was a "government agency" for the purposes of Title VII. The court in <span class="Italic">Baker III</span>, 114 F.2d at 669-72 explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress, in enacting section 1981a, exempted all government agencies from the Act's punitive damage provision, with no articulated exceptions. Because Baker has conceded that the Postal Service is a "government agency," there would therefore appear to be little for this court to decide. Not surprisingly, Baker does not view this case as quite that simple. It is her contention, a view shared by the district court, that it can be inferred from Congress' historical treatment of the Postal Service as a quasi-commercial entity, from Congress' waiver of the Service's sovereign immunity, and from the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, that Congress did not intend to exempt the Postal Service from punitive damages. We cannot agree that this is an appropriate inference to draw.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Baker faces an uphill battle in arguing that Congress intended to subject the Postal Service to punitive damages. She is asking this court to read into the Act an exception to Congress' blanket exemption, despite the absence of any textual support for such an exclusion, because, according to Baker, this is what Congress intended. It is, however, axiomatic that "the plain language of a statute is the most reliable indicator of congressional intent." <span class="Italic">Time Warner Cable v. Doyle</span>, 66 F.3d 867, 876 (7th Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. denied, Doyle v. Time Warner Cable</span>, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 974, 133 L. Ed.2d 894 (1996); <span class="Italic">see also Director, OWCP v. Forsyth Energy, Inc.</span>, 666 F.2d 1104, 1107 (7th Cir. 1981). "[C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there." <span class="Italic">Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain</span>, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149, 117 L. Ed.2d 391 (1992). We therefore presume that Congress would have said that all government agencies, except the Postal Service, are exempt from punitive damages, if this is what it intended.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This presumption that a statute means what it says is a difficult one to overcome. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, ordinarily the "judicial inquiry is complete." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 254, 112 S. Ct. at 1149-50; <span class="Italic">see also In the Matter of Lifschultz Fast Freight Corp.</span>, 63 F.3d 621, 628 (7th Cir. 1995) (plain language of statute ordinarily conclusive). "The statutory language should be conclusive except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters...[or] lead to absurd results...." <span class="Italic">Time Warner Cable</span>, 66 F.3d at 876 (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Grzan v. Charter Hosp. of Northwest Ind.</span>, 104 F.3d 116, 122 (7th Cir. 1997) (legislative history of statute examined "only for the limited purpose of determining whether it reflects a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary"). This is not such a case. In mounting her attack on the plain meaning of section 1981a, Baker has produced no evidence of a clear intent by Congress to saddle the Postal Service, despite its governmental nature, with judgments for punitive damages. Nor has she demonstrated that exempting the Service from punitive damage awards is "demonstrably at odds" with the goals of Title VII. As discussed below, the inferences Baker would draw from the various statutes and excerpts of legislative history cannot counter section 1981a's clear language.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first address Baker's contention that Congress, because it intended the Postal Service to operate in a manner similar to a commercial entity, must have intended to subject the Service to punitive damages. We do not believe that it is possible to make the leap in logic Baker suggests. The Postal Service may be run in a manner similar to a private commercial entity, but it is not a private commercial entity. <span class="Italic">See Silver v. United States Postal Service</span>, 951 F.2d 1033, 1035 (9th Cir. 1991) ("Congress could not have made its intention more clear that the Postal Service was to remain a part of the U.S. Government and to perform executive branch functions within the government."); <span class="Italic">Friedlander v. United States Postal Service</span>, 658 F. Supp. 95, 101 (D.D.C. 1987) ("Congress did not intend to create a private business, rather, it desired a more efficient government agency."). While this court, as well as the Supreme Court, has recognized the quasi-commercial nature of the Postal Service on several prior occasions, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Loeffler v. Frank</span>, 486 U.S. 549, 556, 108 S. Ct. 1965, 1969-70, 100 L. Ed.2d 549 (1988); <span class="Italic">Standard Oil Div., Am. Oil Co. v. Starks</span>, 528 F.2d 201, 203 (7th Cir. 1975), neither court has ever held that the Postal Service is anything other than a federal agency, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., United States v. Bardsley</span>, 884 F.2d 1024, 1027-28 (7th Cir. 1989) (false statements made to Postal Service are false statements to government agency); <span class="Italic">McGuinness v. United States Postal Service</span>, 744 F.2d 1318, 1322-23 (7th Cir. 1984) (only proper defendant in Title VII suit is head of agency). Congress may have vested the Postal Service with significant powers in order to increase its independence and autonomy, <span class="Italic">see Standard Oil</span>, 528 F.2d at 202-03 (listing powers granted to Postal Service), but it also provided that the Postal Service is part of the executive branch of government, that its employees are part of the federal civil service, and that it possesses certain powers unique to governmental entities, such as the authority to exercise the power of eminent domain in the name of the United States. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 201, 1001(b) &#x0026; 401(9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the suggestion of appellee, it would be illogical to assume that Congress, because it granted the Postal Service considerable autonomy, intended to grant the agency the status of a private actor. Congress knows how to create entities and confer upon them non-governmental status when it is Congress' intention to do so. In establishing Amtrak and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, for example, Congress explicitly provided that they were not agencies or establishments of the United States Government.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 47 USC &#x00A7; 396(b) (providing that Corporation for Public Broadcasting "will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government"); 45 USC &#x00A7; 541 (providing that Amtrak "will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government") (repealed). Because Congress lodged the Postal Service within the federal government, the more logical inference is that it did not intend to subject the agency to punitive damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Baker next points to Congress' waiver of the Postal Service's sovereign immunity to support her assertion that Congress intended to subject the Postal Service to punitive damages. As is true of many other federal agencies, the Postal Service's charter contains a "sue-and-be-sued" clause that permits the Postal Service to be sued. The presence of this clause, however, does little to advance Baker's argument. If anything, it supports the position of the Postmaster General. This waiver of sovereign immunity is necessary solely because the Postal Service is a government agency. <span class="Italic">See Western Securities Co. v. Derwinski</span>, 937 F.2d 1276, 1280 (7th Cir. 1991) ("The 'sue or be sued' clause...operates as the necessary waiver of sovereign immunity, permitting the suit to go forward notwithstanding that it is a suit against a federal agency.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That Congress has waived the Postal Service's sovereign immunity does not answer the question of whether plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages under section 1981a. As the Supreme Court has explained, in determining whether an individual can recover damages against the federal government, there are "two analytically distinct inquiries." <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer</span>, 510 U.S. 471, 484, 114 S. Ct. 996, 1004, 127 L. Ed.2d 308 (1994) (internal quotation omitted). "The first inquiry is whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity. If there has been such a waiver, as in this case, the second inquiry comes into play--that is, whether the source of substantive law upon which the claimant relies provides an avenue for relief." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The magistrate judge in the instant case appears to have conflated these distinct inquiries. Although Congress has waived the Postal Service's sovereign immunity, the substantive law relied upon by appellee in the instant case, Title VII, provides that punitive damages are not available against governmental entities. Baker is therefore back where she started, arguing that the Postal Service is subject to punitive damages, despite the fact that it is a government agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, Baker points to nothing in Title VII itself to suggest that exempting the Postal Service from punitive damages would be "demonstrably at odds" with the purposes of that statute or "lead to absurd results." <span class="Italic">See Time Warner Cable</span>, 66 F.3d at 876. While we would agree with appellee that it is clear from the legislative history of the amendments to the Civil Rights Act that Congress intended to enact stricter measures to deter discrimination, we do not agree that this necessarily leads to the conclusion that Congress intended to subject the Postal Service to punitive damage awards. If anything, the legislative history supports the opposite conclusion, that it was Congress' intention to exempt all federal agencies from such awards. <span class="Italic">See</span> 137 CONG. REC. S29023 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 1991) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) ("Clearly, it was our intent that the limitation on punitive damages would apply to Federal, State and local governments."); 137 CONG. REC. H9527 (daily ed. Nov. 7, 1991) (interpretive memorandum of Rep. Edwards) (The damage provision "reinforces the clear statutory intent that compensatory damages are available against federal, state and local governmental defendants to the same extent that they are available against private sector defendants; punitive damages are not.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Supreme Court has explained, punitive damages, when awarded against governmental entities, do not serve their intended deterrent purpose. <span class="Italic">See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.</span>, 453 U.S. 247, 266-67, 101 S. Ct. 2748, 2759-60, 69 L. Ed.2d 616 (1981). "[A]n award of punitive damages against a [government agency] 'punishes' only the taxpayers, who took no part in the commission of the tort." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 267, 101 S. Ct. at 2759. Such awards are "in effect a windfall to a fully compensated plaintiff, and are likely accompanied by an increase in taxes or a reduction of public services for the citizens footing the bill." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This rationale applies with equal force to the Postal Service. Although the Postal Service is a "self-funding" entity, this is not to say that it is divorced from the United States Treasury. The Postal Service is self-funding only in the sense that Congress has appropriated to it all of the Postal Service's own revenues. 39 USC &#x00A7; 2401(a). It nevertheless is "operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States...and supported by the people." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00A7; 101(a). Even in areas in which post offices are not self-sustaining, postal service is guaranteed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00A7; 101(b). Any deficiency in these revenues would require either increased postal costs, a reduction in postal services, or, instead of raising the costs of stamps, additional appropriations by Congress. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at &#x00A7; 2401(b) <span id="Page_1966"></span>(listing appropriations, in addition to Postal Service revenues, required to operate Service in various years).</p>
<p class="noindent">The majority of courts have agreed with the Seventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">Baker III</span> that the Postal Service is a "government agency," and therefore punitive damages are not available in discrimination cases against the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Runyon</span>, 149 F.3d 507 (6th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Ausfeldt v. Runyon</span>, 950 F. Supp. 478 (N.D.N.Y. 1997); <span class="Italic">Cleveland v. Runyon</span>, 972 F. Supp. 1326 (D. Nev. 1997); <span class="Italic">Boyajian v. Runyon</span>, 1998 WL 229921 (D. Conn. 1998); <span class="Italic">Tuers v. Runyon</span>, 950 F. Supp. 284 (E.D. Cal. 1996); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Runyon</span>, 932 F. Supp. 276 (M.D. Ala. 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, there remains one case holding that punitive damages are available against the Postal Service in cases of intentional discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. In <span class="Italic">Roy v. Runyon</span>, 954 F. Supp. 368 (D. Me. 1997), the magistrate judge relied on the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Baker I</span> and the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Loeffler v. Frank</span>, 486 U.S. 549, 108 S. Ct. 1965, 100 L. Ed.2d 549 (1988), in finding the Postal Service open to liability for punitive damages. The <span class="Italic">Roy</span> opinion agreed with the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Baker I</span>, which was subsequently reversed in <span class="Italic">Baker III</span>, as discussed above. The court in <span class="Italic">Roy</span>, 954 F. Supp. at 382-83, provided the following analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I conclude that the view articulated in <span class="Italic">Baker</span> is the more reasoned one. As did that court, I begin with certain observations made by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Loeffler v. Frank</span>, 486 U.S. 549, 108 S. Ct. 1965, 100 L. Ed.2d 549 (1988), which stands for the proposition that the Postal Service is liable for prejudgment interest on a Title VII sex discrimination claim, notwithstanding principles of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 565, 108 S. Ct. at 1974-75. The Court noted that when Congress created the Postal Service in 1970, it empowered the new entity "to sue and be sued in its official name," as part of a general congressional design to cause the Postal Service to be run more like a private business than was its departmental predecessor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 555-56, 108 S. Ct. at 1969-70 (<span class="Italic">quoting</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 401(1)). Accordingly, the sue-and-be-sued clause "must be liberally construed and...the Postal Service's liability must be presumed to be the same as that of any other business." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 556, 108 S. Ct. at 1970 (citation omitted). Therefore, "Congress is presumed to have waived any otherwise existing immunity of the Postal Service" absent a convincing basis for departing from this rule of liberal construction of the enabling legislation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Against that backdrop, Congress created the punitive damages remedy in Title VII cases (and cases such as this one, where a claim under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act entitles the plaintiff to Title VII remedies) but stressed that a complaining party may not recover such damages from "a government, government agency or political subdivision." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(1). The question thus reduces to whether the Postal Service is a "government agency" within the meaning of section 1981a. Addressing that issue, the defendant here catalogs certain of the rights and responsibilities vested in the Postal Service through its enabling legislation, correctly pointing out that many of them are traditionally considered functions of the sovereign, involve the use of public funds and generally cause the Postal Service to resemble and be treated like an organ of the federal government. This begs the question already decided in <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span>, which is whether an entity bearing such characteristics will enjoy the presumption of sovereign immunity in light of its unique legislatively created status.<span class="Italic"> Loeffler</span> was binding precedent well before the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and the court can only infer that Congress was aware of the liberal construction rule articulated therein but did not choose to make clear that the Postal Service is a government agency and thus not subject to punitive damages under section 1981a. In other words, I agree wholeheartedly that "[i]f Congress had wanted to exempt the Postal Service from punitive damages in the 1991 Act, it would have mentioned it along with governmental agencies" as it did, for example, at 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a).<span class="Italic"> Baker</span>, 922 F. Supp. at 1299.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The recent authorities to the contrary are not persuasive. <span class="Italic">Tuers</span> characterizes the problem as a "fairly straightforward exercise in statutory interpretation," <span class="Italic">Tuers</span>, 950 F. Supp. at 285 n.1, but does not explain how the Postal Service can be a "government agency" within the meaning of section 1981 given the rule set forth in <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span>. Rather, the <span class="Italic">Tuers</span> court concludes that <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span> can be "easily distinguished" because the prejudgment interest at issue there is not subject to the kind of express limitation to which punitive damages, an "extraordinary remedy," are subject via the express language in section 1981a. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 285-86. While I agree with the observation in <span class="Italic">Tuers</span> that it "cannot readily be inferred" from the sue-and-be-sued clause of the Postal Service's authorizing legislation that the defendant is amenable to punitive damages, it is my view that the <span class="Italic">Tuers</span> court interprets the wrong statute. Whether or not <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span> can be distinguished, it establishes a presumption that lower courts are obliged to follow in the interpretation of section 1981a and any other congressional efforts to define the limits of the Postal Service's civil liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Ausfeldt,</span> by contrast, reaches the same result as <span class="Italic">Tuers</span> but based entirely on a determination that "Second Circuit precedent impels the finding that the Postal Service is in fact immune from punitive damages."<span class="Italic"> Ausfeldt</span>, 950 F. Supp. at 488. This court is bound by precedents of the First Circuit Court of Appeals and therefore is unable to rely on the reasoning set forth in <span class="Italic">Ausfeldt</span>. Finally, <span class="Italic">Miller</span> relies on a variety of circuit precedents, none of them from this circuit, to conclude that "[c]ourts regularly treat the [Postal Service] as a governmental agency for the purposes of Title VII," and therefore the <span class="Italic">Miller</span> court determined that the Postal Service is a "government agency" within the meaning of section 1981a without even discussing the rule set out in<span class="Italic"> Loeffler</span>. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 932 F. Supp. at 277 (citations omitted). None of these three cases alters my view that Congress could have and would have explicitly exempted the Postal Service from amenability to punitive damages under Title VII had it intended to make the defendant immune from this remedy in connection with discrimination claims.</p>
