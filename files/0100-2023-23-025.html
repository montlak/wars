<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-26"><span class="space">2.</span> Substantial Limitation and the <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Sutton</span></span> Trilogy</h4>
<p class="noindent">Prior to 1999, the EEOC had taken the view that whether a disabling condition substantially limits a major life activity should be determined without regard for the effects of medications or assistive devices that mitigate the symptoms of a condition. The Commission's position was succinctly stated at 29 CFR Part 1630, app. 1630.2(j):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity must be made on a case by case basis, without regard to mitigating measures such as medicines, or assistive or prosthetic devices....</p>
<p class="noindent">In the Commission's view, whether an individual with poor eyesight was considered to be an individual with a disability was to be determined by the person's eyesight without the use of glasses or contact lenses. The focus, according to the Commission, was on whether a major life activity would be substantially limited in the absence of medication or other artificial means of controlling the symptoms of the disease. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. H &#x0026; W Contracting Co.</span>, 102 F.3d 516 (11th Cir. 1997) (crediting the Commission's interpretation of the effect of mitigating measures and medications and reversing the lower court's holding that an employee's medical condition did not limit a major life activity because it was controlled through medication).</p>
<p class="noindent">That view, however, was rejected by the Supreme Court in three cases decided in July 1999, which also further restricted the definition of substantially limited--<span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Airlines</span>, 527 U.S. 471 (1999); <span class="Italic">Albertsons, Inc., v. Kirkingburg</span>, 527 U.S. 555 (1999); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. United Parcel Service</span>, 527 U.S. 516 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, two severely myopic plaintiffs who applied for jobs as global airline pilots brought suit under the ADA when United Air Lines refused to hire them for failing to meet minimum vision requirements for the job. The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed the claims and the Tenth Circuit upheld the dismissals on appeal. 130 F.3d 893 (10th Cir. 1987). The plaintiffs, twin sisters, had 20/200 or worse vision in their right eyes and 20/400 or worse vision in their left eyes. With the use of corrective lenses, however, each plaintiff had 20/20 or better vision. Airline requirements for global pilots consisted of 20/100 or better uncorrected vision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> upheld dismissal of the claims after considering and specifically rejecting the EEOC's guidance on mitigating measures. By considering the impact of the Suttons' mitigating measures, eyeglasses, the Court found that the sisters were not substantially limited and, therefore, were not individuals with disabilities and had no standing to bring suit. First, the Court, 119 S. Ct. at 2146-47, held that an impairment is not substantially limiting when corrected by mitigating measures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Three separate provisions of the ADA, read in concert, lead us to this conclusion. The Act defines a "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities" of an individual. &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A). Because the phrase "substantially limits" appears in the Act in the present indicative verb form, we think the language is properly read as requiring that a person be presently--not potentially or hypothetically--substantially limited in order to demonstrate a disability. A "disability" exists only where an impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity, not where it "might," "could," or "would" be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken. A person whose physical or mental impairment is corrected by medication or other measures does not have an impairment that presently "substantially limits" a major life activity. To be sure, a person whose physical or mental impairment is corrected by mitigating measures still has an impairment, but if the impairment is corrected it does not "substantially limi[t]" a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The definition of disability also requires that disabilities be evaluated "with respect to an individual" and be determined based on whether an impairment substantially limits the "major life activities of such individual." &#x00A7; 12102(2). Thus, whether a person has a disability under the ADA is an individualized inquiry. <span class="Italic">See Bragdon v. Abbott</span>, 524 U.S. 624, ___, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed.2d 540 (1998) (declining to consider whether HIV infection is a <span class="Italic">per se</span> disability under the ADA); 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j) ("The determination of whether an individual has a disability is not necessarily based on the name or diagnosis of the impairment the person has, but rather on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency guidelines' directive that persons be judged in their uncorrected or unmitigated state runs directly counter to the individualized inquiry mandated by the ADA. The agency approach would often require courts and employers to speculate about a person's condition and would, in many cases, force them to make a disability determination based on general information about how an uncorrected impairment usually affects individuals, rather than on the individual's actual condition. For instance, under this view, courts would almost certainly find all diabetics to be disabled, because if they failed to monitor their blood sugar levels and administer insulin, they would almost certainly be substantially limited in one or more major life activities. A diabetic whose illness does not impair his or her daily activities would therefore be considered disabled simply because he or she has diabetes. Thus, the guidelines approach would create a system in which persons often must be treated as members of a group of people with similar impairments, rather than as individuals. This is contrary to both the letter and the spirit of the ADA. The guidelines approach could also lead to the anomalous result that in determining whether an individual is disabled, courts and employers could not consider any negative side effects suffered by an individual resulting from the use of mitigating measures, even when those side effects are very severe. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Johnson, <span class="Italic">Antipsychotics: Pros and Cons of Antipsychotics</span>, RN (Aug. 1997) (noting that antipsychotic drugs can cause a variety of adverse effects, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome and painful seizures); <span class="Italic">Liver Risk Warning Added to Parkinson's Drug</span>, FDA Consumer (Mar. 1, 1999) (warning that a drug for treating Parkinson's disease can cause liver damage); Curry &#x0026; Kulling, <span class="Italic">Newer Antiepileptic Drugs</span>, American Family Physician (Feb. 1, 1998) (cataloging serious negative side effects of new antiepileptic drugs). This result is also inconsistent with the individualized approach of the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court went on to find that if mitigating measures were not considered, the estimated number of Americans with disabilities would soar well beyond that envisioned by Congress in passing the ADA. In the end, this section of <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> was emphatically rejected by Congress in passing the ADAAA and it made clear that it envisioned the Act to be interpreted broadly and in favor of inclusion whenever consistent with the general provisions of the ADA and its amendments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., Sec. 2(b)(5). As the Court in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> explained its position at 119 S. Ct. 2147-49:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, and critically, findings enacted as part of the ADA require the conclusion that Congress did not intend to bring under the statute's protection all those whose uncorrected conditions amount to disabilities. Congress found that "some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities, and this number is increasing as the population as a whole is growing older." &#x00A7; 12101(a)(1). This figure is inconsistent with the definition of disability pressed by petitioners.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the exact source of the 43 million figure is not clear, the corresponding finding in the 1988 precursor to the ADA was drawn directly from a report prepared by the National Council on Disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> Burgdorf, <span class="Italic">The Americans with Disabilities Act: Analysis and Implications of a Second-Generation Civil Rights Statute</span>, 26 Harv. Civ. Rights-Civ. Lib. L. Rev. 413, 434, n.117 (1991) (reporting, in an article authored by the drafter of the oriGINAl ADA bill introduced in Congress in 1988, that the report was the source for a figure of 36 million disabled persons quoted in the versions of the bill introduced in 1988). That report detailed the difficulty of estimating the number of disabled persons due to varying operational definitions of disability. National Council on Disability, <span class="Italic">Toward Independence</span> 10 (1986). It explained that the estimates of the number of disabled Americans ranged from an overinclusive 160 million under a "health conditions approach," which looks at all conditions that impair the health or normal functional abilities of an individual, to an underinclusive 22.7 million under a "work disability approach," which focuses on individuals' reported ability to work. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 10-11. It noted that "a figure of 35 or 36 million [was] the most commonly quoted estimate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 10. The 36 million number included in the 1988 bill's findings thus clearly reflects an approach to defining disabilities that is closer to the work disabilities approach than the health conditions approach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This background also provides some clues to the likely source of the figure in the findings of the 1990 Act. Roughly two years after issuing its 1986 report, the National Council on Disability issued an updated report. <span class="Italic">See On the Threshold of Independence</span> (1988). This 1988 report settled on a more concrete definition of disability. It stated that 37.3 million individuals have "difficulty performing one or more basic physical activities," including "seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, using stairs, lifting or carrying, getting around outside, getting around inside, and getting into or out of bed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 19. The study from which it drew this data took an explicitly functional approach to evaluating disabilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, <span class="Italic">Disability, Functional Limitation, and Health Insurance Coverage</span>: 1984/85, p. 2 (1986). It measured 37.3 million persons with a "functional limitation" on performing certain basic activities when using, as the questionnaire put it, "special aids," such as glasses or hearing aids, if the person usually used such aids. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1, 47. The number of disabled provided by the study and adopted in the <span id="Page_1111"></span>1988 report, however, includes only noninstitutionalized persons with physical disabilities who are over age 15. The 5.7 million gap between the 43 million figure in the ADA's findings and the 37.3 million figure in the report can thus probably be explained as an effort to include in the findings those who were excluded from the National Council figure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, <span class="Italic">Data on Disability from the National Health Interview Survey 1983-1985</span>, pp. 61-62 (1988) (finding approximately 943,000 noninstitutionalized persons with an activity limitation due to mental illness; 947,000 noninstitutionalized persons with an activity limitation due to mental retardation; 1,900,000 noninstitutionalized persons under 18 with an activity limitation); U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, <span class="Italic">Statistical Abstract of the United States 106</span> (1989) (Table 168) (finding 1,553,000 resident patients in nursing and related care facilities (excluding hospital-based nursing homes) in 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regardless of its exact source, however, the 43 million figure reflects an understanding that those whose impairments are largely corrected by medication or other devices are not "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA. The estimate is consistent with the numbers produced by studies performed during this same time period that took a similar functional approach to determining disability. For instance, Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., drawing on data from the National Center for Health Statistics, issued an estimate of approximately 31.4 million civilian noninstitutionalized persons with "chronic activity limitation status" in 1979. <span class="Italic">Digest of Data on Persons with Disabilities</span> 25 (1984). The 1989 Statistical Abstract offered the same estimate based on the same data, as well as an estimate of 32.7 million noninstitutionalized persons with "activity limitation" in 1985. <span class="Italic">Statistical Abstract, supra</span>, at 115 (Table 184). In both cases, individuals with "activity limitations" were those who, relative to their age-sex group could not conduct "usual" activities: <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, attending preschool, keeping house, or living independently. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Center for Health Statistics, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Vital and Health Statistics, <span class="Italic">Current Estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, 1989</span>, Series 10, pp. 7-8 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, nonfunctional approaches to defining disability produce significantly larger numbers. As noted above, the 1986 National Council on Disability report estimated that there were over 160 million disabled under the "health conditions approach." <span class="Italic">Toward Independence, supra</span>, at 10; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> Mathematica Policy Research, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 3 (arriving at similar estimate based on same Census Bureau data). Indeed, the number of people with vision impairments alone is 100 million. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Advisory Eye Council, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, <span class="Italic">Vision Research--A National Plan: 1999-2003</span>, p. 7 (1998) ("[M]ore than 100 million people need corrective lenses to see properly"). "It is estimated that more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing." National Institutes of Health, <span class="Italic">National Strategic Research Plan: Hearing and Hearing Impairment</span> (1996). And there were approximately 50 million people with high blood pressure (hypertension). Tindall, <span class="Italic">Stalking a Silent Killer</span>; Hypertension, Business &#x0026; Health 37 (August 1998) ("Some 50 million Americans have high blood pressure").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because it is included in the ADA's text, the finding that 43 million individuals are disabled gives content to the ADA's terms, specifically the term "disability." Had Congress intended to include all persons with corrected physical limitations among those covered by the Act, it undoubtedly would have cited a much higher number of disabled persons in the findings. That it did not is evidence that the ADA's coverage is restricted to only those whose impairments are not mitigated by corrective measures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissents suggest that viewing individuals in their corrected state will exclude from the definition of "disab[led]" those who use prosthetic limbs, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 2153-2154 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), <span class="Italic">post</span>, at 2161 (opinion of BREYER, J.), or take medicine for epilepsy or high blood pressure, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 2158, 2159 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). This suggestion is incorrect. The use of a corrective device does not, by itself, relieve one's disability. Rather, one has a disability under subsection A if, notwithstanding the use of a corrective device, that individual is substantially limited in a major life activity. For example, individuals who use prosthetic limbs or wheelchairs may be mobile and capable of functioning in society but still be disabled because of a substantial limitation on their ability to walk or run. The same may be true of individuals who take medicine to lessen the symptoms of an impairment so that they can function but nevertheless remain substantially limited. Alternatively, one whose high blood pressure is "cured" by medication may be regarded as disabled by a covered entity, and thus disabled under subsection C of the definition. The use or nonuse of a corrective device does not determine whether an individual is disabled; that determination depends on whether the limitations an individual with an impairment actually faces are in fact substantially limiting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this reading of the Act to the case at hand, we conclude that the Court of Appeals correctly resolved the issue of disability in respondent's favor. As noted above, petitioners allege that with corrective measures, their visual acuity is 20/20, App. 23, Amended Complaint &#x00B6; 36, and that they "function identically to individuals without a similar impairment," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, at 24, Amended Complaint &#x00B6; 37e. In addition, petitioners concede that they "do not argue that the use of corrective lenses in itself demonstrates a substantially limiting impairment." Brief for Petitioners 9, n.11. Accordingly, because we decide that disability under the Act is to be determined with reference to corrective measures, we agree with the courts below that petitioners have not stated a claim that they are substantially limited in any major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, however, in the wake of <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, found that the use of a mitigating device did not necessarily mean the complainant was not substantially limited. For example, in <span class="Italic">Evey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01970918 (2000), the Commission found the complainant was substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing despite the use of a hearing aid because she still had difficulty understanding speech without the use of visual cues.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> case specifically dealt with mitigating devices, such as corrective lenses, it also included within its scope mitigating measures such as medication. In <span class="Italic">Murphy v. United Parcel Service</span>, 527 U.S. 516, 119 S. Ct. 2133, 144 L. Ed.2d 484 (1999), the Court followed <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> to find that a plaintiff whose high blood pressure was controlled through medication did not have an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. The Commission relied upon <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> in finding the complainant in <span class="Italic">Fox v. Postmaster General</span>, 03A00062 (2001), was not substantially limited by his hypertension because the condition was controlled through medication and a reduction in stress.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Berman v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, 01975726 (2000), the Commission found that a complainant who suffered from depression was a qualified individual with a disability even though she took medication for the condition. The Commission specifically noted that the complainant's symptoms continued to grow worse even with medication and that the depression "even in the medicated state, substantially limits her cognitive functioning and ability to interact with others." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Philippe v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A12653 (2003), found that the complainant's seizure medications, which had side effects and only partially controlled her condition, contributed to the complainant's impairment to substantially limit her.</p>
<p class="noindent">The final case in the Supreme Court trilogy was <span class="Italic">Albertsons, Inc. v. Kirkingburg</span>, 527 U.S. 555, 119 S. Ct. 2162, 144 L. Ed.2d 519 (1999), the Court found its <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> holding applied to compensating behaviors that an individual develops to minimize the effects of an impairment unless the impairment substantially limits a major life activity even given the compensating behaviors. In that case, the Court found that individuals with monocular vision could develop compensating behaviors that would prevent the impairment from substantially limiting the major life activity of seeing. The Court noted that many, if not most, individuals with monocular vision would still be disabled within the meaning of the ADA, but that an individualized inquiry was required.</p>
<p class="noindent">In contrast to <span class="Italic">Albertsons</span>, in <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01976372 (2000), the Commission found the complainant was substantially limited in the major life activity of speaking where, as a result of sarcoidosis, he had a portion of his tongue removed. Because of that operation, the complainant had to stop and think about how to position his tongue in order verbalize certain syllables. The Commission found that, even with this compensating behavior, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Turner</span> was substantially limited.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a further twist on <span class="Italic">Albertsons</span>, the Commission found that a complainant who suffered from monocular vision was substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing even though he used his hearing to compensate for the impairment. In <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A10035.txt">07A10035</a> (2003), the Commission found the complainant's mitigating behavior still left him with a substantial limitation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ordinarily, people with monocular vision will meet the definition of disability as set out in the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12010 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (ADA), as the absence of an eye is an obvious physiological condition that appears to substantially limit an individual's ability to see<span class="Italic">. Albertson's Inc. v. Kirkingburg</span>, 527 U.S. 555, 564, 567 (1999). However, when evaluating the effect of the impairment on the major life activity, one must take into account mitigating measures, taken with either artificial aids or the body's own systems, for these mitigating measures may reduce the effect of an impairment on the major life activity so that it is no longer substantially limiting<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 565-66; <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Airlines</span>, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 482-83 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, individuals with monocular vision must demonstrate that they have a disability "by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation in terms of their own experience, as in loss of depth perception and visual field, is substantial." <span class="Italic">Albertson's,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 567.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that complainant has satisfied this requirement. While complainant had good visual acuity (his vision in his right eye was 20/15), he had no vision in his left eye. A consequence of having no vision in one eye is a diminution of peripheral vision (loss of visual field) and of stereopsis (depth perception). Complainant and the doctors testified that <span id="Page_1112"></span>complainant used hearing to make up for the loss of his peripheral vision. However, hearing as a compensation technique cannot compensate for the loss of a visual ability, since hearing does not improve an individual's ability to see peripherally. For that reason, we conclude that complainant's use of hearing did not mitigate his diminished peripheral vision. Additionally, while complainant used shadows and highlights to help him judge depth, he did not dispute the agency's expert's assertion that an individual with diminished stereopsis would have difficulty seeing aberrations in low light. Thus, we cannot conclude that complainant's use of visual clues adequately compensated for his diminished depth perception. Because complainant had no visual abilities that helped him overcome his visual limitations in peripheral vision and depth perception, we conclude that diminished peripheral vision and depth perception are not mitigated, and that complainant's monocularity substantially limits the major life activity of seeing. Complainant is an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">On reconsideration, in <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05a30898.txt">05A30898</a> (2005), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that its previous decision meant that monocular vision was <span class="Italic">per se</span> substantially limiting and, thus, contrary to <span class="Italic">Albertson's</span>. The Commission on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Spencer</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While an individual missing an eye has a physiological condition that 'ordinarily' will meet the definition of a disability, consideration of whether complainant's impairment substantially limits or significantly restricts his ability to see must necessarily include any mitigating measures used by complainant to reduce the impact of his impairment, whether an artificial aid or one or more of the body's own systems. <span class="Italic">See Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg,</span> 527 U.S. at 567 (individuals with monocular vision must "prove a disability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation in terms of their own experience, as in loss of depth perception and visual field, is substantial"); <span class="Italic">also see Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc.,</span> 527 U.S. 471, 482 (1999); 29 CFR Part 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j) ("The determination of whether an individual has a disability is not necessarily based on the name or diagnosis of the impairment the person has but rather on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated in the previous decision, we find that complainant has shown that the effect of his impairment on his life renders him a person with a disability. The evidence shows that complainant had good visual acuity, i.e., complainant's vision in his right eye was 20/15, but, because he had no vision in his left eye, he had less peripheral vision (loss of visual field) and stereopsis (depth of perception). While he testified that he used his sense of hearing to ameliorate the absence of vision in his left eye, particularly to make up for the loss of his peripheral vision, hearing as a mitigating measure does not compensate for the loss of visual ability, in that, it does not allow him to see peripherally. Also, complainant's use of visual clues does not fully compensate his loss of depth perception. Thus, our previous decision correctly concluded that complainant's diminished peripheral vision and depth perception are not mitigated and that complainant's monocularity substantially limits the major life activity of seeing; thus, complainant is an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, the agency argued that complainant's impairment did not substantially limit any major life activity, because his mitigation techniques were sufficient to allow him to perform all daily life tasks, and, therefore, complainant was not an individual with a disability. In making this argument, the agency relied on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Toyota Motors Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams,</span> 534 U.S. 184 (2002), contending that proof of a substantial limitation in a major life activity must consider the effect on the individual's daily life tasks and show how s/he is substantially limited in daily life tasks. In the instant matter, the agency contended that complainant had sufficient compensating techniques to make up for his loss of sight in one eye to allow him to perform daily life tasks and thus was not substantially limited in a major life activity. The agency argued that the previous decision ignored the impact of complainant's mitigating techniques on his performance of daily life tasks, and it erroneously concluded that complainant was an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency, however, misreads the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Toyota.</span> As reflected in the opinion in <span class="Italic">Toyota,</span> which involved the impairments of carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis, the Supreme Court was concerned only with what substantially limited meant in terms of the performance of manual tasks, which was the major life activity affected by the plaintiff's impairments in that case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 197-98. The Supreme Court's analysis regarding the impact of the disability relevant in that case on the ability to perform basic tasks does not apply to what is required to show a substantial limitation in such major life activities as seeing or breathing. <span class="Italic">See Albert v. Smith's Food &#x0026; Drug Centers, Inc.,</span> 356 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the agency contended that, in finding that complainant was an individual with a disability, the Commission ignored complainant's mitigation techniques. In fact, the previous decision recognized that complainant had developed methods to reduce the impact of his impairment through sight cues and use of hearing. However, while complainant uses shadows and highlights to help him judge depth, he does not dispute the agency's evidence that an individual with diminished stereopsis would have difficulty seeing aberrations in low light; complainant's use of hearing as a compensation technique does not improve his ability to see peripherally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also argued that the Commission's distinction between those measures or devices that compensate for the loss of an individual's ability to perform a major life activity and those that enable an individual to perform a major life activity is not consistent with Supreme Court precedent. In fact, the Supreme Court, itself, noted the distinction when it discussed mitigating measures, pointing out that an individual who uses a wheelchair, while mobile, may still be disabled because of a substantial limitation in the ability to walk. <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Airlines,</span> 527 U.S. 471, 488 (1999). This distinction is equally applicable when the measure undertaken to compensate for the inability or diminished ability to perform a major life activity involves the body's own systems rather than an assistive device. <span class="Italic">See Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, supra,</span> at 565-566 ("we see no principled basis for distinguishing between measures undertaken with artificial aids, like medications and devices, and measures undertaken, whether consciously or not, with the body's own systems."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(i). In its decision, the Commission applied this same distinction to complainant's use of hearing to compensate, at least to some extent, for his monocular vision. Complainant's use of his hearing is like the use of a wheelchair to compensate for the inability to walk. It did not improve his peripheral vision; it compensated for the fact that he lacked peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether an individual has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity is made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j); Interpretive Guidance, Section 1630.2(j); <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Airlines,</span> 527 U.S. 471, 483 (1999); <span class="Italic">see, generally</span>, Section 902: Definition of the Term "Disability," EEOC Compliance Manual (March 1995) (Section 902). An impairment rises to the level of disability if the impairment substantially limits an individual's major life activity(ies). A person is not an individual with a disability merely because s/he has been diagnosed with a certain condition: instead, the determination rests on the effect of that impairment on the major life activities of the individual. The symptoms of an impairment and its impact likely vary from person to person, and an employee must present evidence to show the substantial limitations of his/her impairment. <span class="Italic">See Sutton v. United Airlines, supra; Albertson's, Inc., v. Kirkingburg, supra,</span> at 565-566; <span class="Italic">Murphy v. United Parcel Service,</span> 527 U.S. 516, 521-523 (1999); <span class="Italic">Petty v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A05440 (March 27, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the agency's contention that our finding that complainant was an individual with a disability would establish monocular vision as a <span class="Italic">per se</span> disability; such a conclusion would drop the individualized assessment at the heart of the law. In <span class="Italic">Albertson's,</span> the Court expressed doubt that monocularity would fall into a class of impairment that invariably causes a substantial limitation of a major life activity, in that, the degree of visual acuity in the weaker eye, the age at which they suffered their vision loss, the extent of their compensating adjustments in visual techniques, and the ultimate scope of the restrictions on their visual abilities are variables that "are not the stuff of a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule." <span class="Italic">Albertson's, supra,</span> at 566.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> and <span class="Italic">Albertsons</span>, on July 26, 1999, the Commission issued <span class="Italic">Instructions for Field Offices: Analyzing ADA Charges After Supreme Court Decisions Addressing "Disability" and "Qualified."</span> The <span class="Italic">Instructions</span> were intended to provide interpretation of those decisions, as well as of <span class="Italic">Bragdon v. Abbott</span>, 524 U.S. 624, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed.2d 540 (1998) and <span class="Italic">Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp.</span>, 526 U.S. 795, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed.2d 966 (1999). Although none of the Commission's guidance in the <span class="Italic">Instructions</span> directly contradicted the Supreme Court's holdings, it did stress the need for an individualized inquiry in each case and specifically precluded a finding that an individual is not substantially limited in a major life activity because of mitigating measures or compensating behavior. The <span class="Italic">Instructions</span> also stressed that the Commission would continue to take a "broad" and "expansive" view of the terms "substantial limitation" and "major life activity." The <span class="Italic">Cleveland</span> case, which deals with disability retirement, is discussed below under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-23-073.html#sec14-71">Effect of Disability Retirement</a>."</p>
