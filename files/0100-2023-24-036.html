<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-25"><span class="space">14.</span> Medical Exams and Inquiries</h4>
<p class="noindent">A question that frequently arises in conjunction with direct threat determinations is whether the agency has made an improper request for medical documentation or conducted an improper medical examination under the ADA. The issue of fitness-for-duty examinations is discussed fully in Chapter 14 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-23-137.html#sec14-135">Fitness-For-Duty Examinations: Performing Essential Functions and Direct Threat."</a> It is, however, worth mentioning again here that requests for medical information and medical examinations may be conducted by an agency only if they are job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency must have what the Commission refers to as "objective evidence" that the complainant poses a direct threat to herself or someone else. "Objective evidence" does not mean medical evidence. For example, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120111954 (2013), the Commission found that the request for medical information in advance of a fitness-for-duty examination did not violate the ADA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act places certain limitations on an employer's ability to make disability-related inquiries or require medical examinations of employees. The inquiry may be made or the examination ordered only if it is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 1630.14(c). Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination of an employee may be job-related and consistent with business necessity when an employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the ADA</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, Question 5 (July 27, 2000). Objective evidence is reliable information, either directly observed or provided by a credible third party, that an employee may have or has a medical condition that will impair her ability to perform essential job functions or will pose a direct threat. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is the burden of the employer to show that its disability-related inquiries and requests for medical examination are job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Direct threat" means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The determination that an individual poses a "direct threat" shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reflects that the Agency placed Complainant on administrative leave on January 6, 2009 and required her to submit medical documentation for a fitness for duty examination. Moreover, the record reflects that the Agency did so after receiving written statements from two employees in the EEO Office concerning Complainant's behavior during meetings on December 29 and 30, 2008. In a December 30, 2008 memorandum for the record regarding a meeting with Complainant on December 29, 2008, Complainant's EEO Counselor stated the following: (a) Complainant commented that she "always felt alone with no one to turn to" at work and at home and that her workplace was making her more depressed than she was before; (b) Complainant appeared "frightened, depressed, and despondent" and began crying several times during the meeting; and (c) based on his conversation with Complainant, he recommended that she return on December 30, 2008 to speak with the Manager of the Informal Complaint Division (M1). In a December 30, 2008 memorandum for the record regarding a meeting with Complainant earlier that day, M1 noted that Complainant "stated that she was suicidal this past spring and still has thoughts that it is not worth going on."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the Agency required Complainant to submit medical documentation for a fitness for duty examination because it had a reasonable belief, based on the best available objective evidence, that she would pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. Specifically, we find that the Agency's action on January 6, 2009 was based on reliable information, provided by Complainant's EEO Counselor and M1, that Complainant only a few days earlier had said she was depressed and having suicidal thoughts. Thus, we find that the Agency's request for Complainant to obtain medical documentation was job-related and consistent with business necessity, and did not violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1298"></span>The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140480 (2015), where the complainant threatened to kill herself when speaking to her supervisor about a potential agency downsizing. The Commission found that the agency was warranted in requiring medical documentation that she was not a threat:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that the Agency contacted the Postal Inspection Service after speaking to Complainant on the phone regarding the downsizing of the agency. During the conversation, Complainant got emotional and threatened to kill herself. For that reason, the agency contacted the Postal Inspection Service and put Complainant on Emergency Placement. Furthermore, the Agency did not permit Complainant to return to work until she provided medical documentation from a psychologist or psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the agency did not act improperly when it put Complainant on Emergency Placement after the telephone conversation. "When a need arises to question the ability of an employee to do the essential functions of his/her job or to question whether the employee can do the job without posing a direct threat due to a medical condition, it may be job-related and consistent with business necessity for an employer to make disability-related inquiries or require a medical examination." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span> (July 27, 2000) (web version) (Guidance), at 14. This requirement is met when the employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that (1) an employee's ability to perform the essential job functions is impaired by a medical condition; or (2) that an employee poses a direct threat due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 15. Objective evidence is reliable information, either directly observed or provided by a credible third party, that an employee may have or has a medical condition that will interfere with his/her ability to perform essential job functions or will result in direct threat. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, Complainant suggested that she was suicidal during an emotional conversation with her supervisor. We find this is objective evidence that Complainant may have posed a direct threat, justifying the Emergency Placement and medical documentation request.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant, who suffered from migraine headaches, was observed confused and disoriented, the Commission found that the agency was justified in removing the complainant from Iraq for further medical evaluation. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120102910 (2014), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to claim 4, we find that the AJ erred as a matter of law. We find that this claim should have been addressed as an allegation of disability discrimination when the Agency removed him from Iraq due to concern of his own safety for further medical evaluation. The record is replete with statements that NP recommended that Complainant return to American for further evaluation, because she was concerned he might have a brain tumor, and that the war zone was not a safe place for Complainant. As such, we find that the Agency perceived that Complainant was a direct threat to himself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Rehabilitation Act, medical examinations and disability-related inquiries of employees must be job-related and consistent with business necessity. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c). An examination or inquiry is job-related and consistent with business necessity when the employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that the employee's ability to perform essential functions will be impaired by a medical condition or that the employee will pose a direct threat to themselves or others because of a medical condition. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span>, EEOC Notice 915.002 (July 27, 2000) (<span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Employee Inquiries and Examinations</span>). "Direct threat" means a significant risk of substantial harm that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record shows that the Agency had a reasonable belief that Complainant posed a direct threat to himself if he remained in Iraq. Specifically, the record reveals that Complainant was unable to obtain more medication for his migraines, which persisted. Further, Complainant was observed confused, incoherent, and not able to clearly communicate when he did seek medical attention for his migraines. The record shows that Complainant was returned to America to seek treatment from his physician since the NP testified that her clinic did not handle chronic ailments. The NP testified that it was presumed that chronic conditions would be under control prior to deployment. Further, the AJ found that the testimony that Complainant was observed confused or lost to be credible. Although Complainant offered some testimony that this was not the case, we find that the evidence provided to support the Agency's position was substantial because numerous witnesses provided testimony that Complainant was observed as confused or lost.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Complainant's assertions that he provided medical documentation that should have resulted in his reinstatement to Iraq, we find that the medical documentation was not sufficient. The documentation he provided consisted of only two letters that contained a short paragraph from his physicians stating that Complainant was not suffering from neurological or psychological issues. The PA provided testimony that he would have required a full psychological evaluation and notes from a psychologist regarding Complainant's current condition. This clearly was not provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we find that the AJ's ultimate finding that Complainant failed to establish that he was discriminated against and harassed is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with other determinations under the Rehabilitation Act, the direct threat assessment must be based on "individualized inquiry" that focuses on the specific medical condition and how it affects the complainant and the specific position he or she has or desires. That inquiry must rely on current medical information. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120120665 (2014), the Commission reversed a grant of summary judgment for the agency where it had not conducted an individualized inquiry into the complainant's seizure condition prior to denying him a job as an expeditor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Manager of In-Plant Support denied Complainant the Expeditor position, feeling the safety of Complainant as well as other employees would be at risk. ROI, 79-80. The Manager pointed to Complainant's medical conditions and his history of epileptic seizures in denying him the bid. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, we note that Complainant stated that his epilepsy is well-controlled on medication and that his last epileptic episode was four years prior. Complainant's Response, at 2. We note that there is no evidence in the record that Complainant experienced an episode while on duty, which would have substantiated the Manager's concern. Further, with respect to the individualized assessment required from the Agency, Complainant maintains that the Agency neither asked him to submit to a Fitness for Duty examination nor requested his doctor's opinion in its determination that he could not perform the Expeditor position safely. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It appears that the Manager alone made the subjective determination that Complainant could not safely perform the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that this case contains conflicting evidence as to whether the Agency's failure to place Complainant in the Expeditor position constitutes a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. In sum, there are simply too many unresolved issues which require an assessment as to the credibility of the various management officials, co-workers, and Complainant himself. We and that the record is not adequately developed, in that there are disputes of material fact with regard w whether Complainant was "qualified" for the Expeditor position, and if so, whether he would pose a direct threat to himself or others if placed in such position. <span class="Italic">See Boland v. Dep't of State</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120065043 (Sep. 30, 2009) (AJ erred issuing decision without a hearing where genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether complainant was qualified and would pose a direct threat if placed in position sought); <span class="Italic">Mason</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A30377 (genuine issues of material fact existed whether complainant was qualified, and if so, posed a direct threat). As such, we find that a decision on the merits of Complainant's complaint is improper at this juncture. We find the AJ erred in issuing a decision without a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Whitmoyer v. Postmaster General</span>, 05870390 (1988), the Commission, citing <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline</span>, 480 U.S. 273, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed.2d 307 (1987), found that an agency was justified in ordering a psychiatric fitness-for-duty examination where the complainant had been found unfit for military duty because of possible homicidal and suicidal tendencies and had threatened his supervisor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court noted that to determine whether an individual is qualified in most cases would require an "individualized inquiry and...appropriate findings of fact." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the context of assessing whether an elementary school teacher with tuberculosis posed a significant risk of spreading the disease to her pupils, the Court called for:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[findings of fact], based on reasonable medical judgments given the state of medical knowledge, about (a) the nature of the risk..., (b) the duration of the risk..., (c) the severity of the risk (what is the potential harm to third parties), and (d) the probabilities the disease...will cause varying degrees of harm." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1131. The Court made clear that employers need not subject others to significant risk. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1131 n.16. The Court also indicated in dicta that if the medical evidence supports a finding that an employee poses a significant risk, the employer must then determine whether there is a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate the risk without imposing an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Arline</span>, 107 S. Ct. at 1131, n.16, 17 and 19.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission also found that it was prohibited discrimination for the agency to require the complainant to undergo periodic psychiatric examinations where the original evaluation found that the complainant was fit for duty and not in need of treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the other hand, when past fitness-for-duty examinations concluded the complainant poses no risk of harm to himself or others, an agency is justified in <span id="Page_1299"></span>reevaluating that position when the complainant introduces violent ideation into conversations with his supervisor. In <span class="Italic">Verzeni v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972586 (1999), the agency did not discriminate against the complainant when it terminated him after giving him the option of leave for psychiatric treatment, disability retirement or termination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Verzeni</span> explained that the</p>
<p class="noindent-1">condition substantially limits appellant's ability to interact with others, as demonstrated by his relationship with his neighbors and his fear that others are seeking to cause his death; the record also reflects that his condition has continued, relatively unabated, since at least 1988. Thus, the Commission finds that appellant's condition is severe enough and of sufficient duration to result in a substantial limitation of a major life activity. Accordingly, we find that appellant meets the criteria of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1)(I)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency essentially concedes that appellant performed his duties in a satisfactory manner, the agency asserts that appellant is not a qualified individual with a disability because his impairment endangers the health or safety of others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that officials at the Allentown Post Office were aware that appellant had been diagnosed as having a paranoid disorder-persecutory type and that he had been ordered to undergo FFD examinations in the recent past, all of which found that he did not pose an imminent danger to the health and safety of himself or others. However, in his discussion with the Postmaster, appellant stated that the community water supply was spiked with "No-Doz" in order to keep him awake; that someone had rammed his vehicle while he was at the Dover Post Office; that his neighbors were trying to scare him into vomiting while sleeping so that he will choke to death; and that he was hearing voices at his home on a daily basis, which awoke him at times which he related to the caliber of weapons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Inasmuch as appellant introduced the violent ideation of weaponry, the Commission believes that, even considering his record as having a paranoid disorder-persecutory type and his prior history as having been found not to pose a threat to himself or others, these statements gave officials a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that a psychiatric examination was "job-related and consistent with business necessity." EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span> (March 25, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having received a report from a board certified psychiatrist which stated that, due to appellant's delusional belief in his persecution and his ownership of weapons, "there is a real possibility that he may be of danger to others," to such an extent that "serious consideration [should] be given to his involuntary commitment," the agency acted appropriately in refusing to permit appellant to return to duty at that time<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Nori v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960866 (August 29, 1996). Appellant was offered assistance in obtaining treatment and offered annual or sick leave, or leave without pay for the period of treatment. Furthermore, when appellant sought such psychological testing and treatment from Psychologist B, the report submitted by Psychologist B in August 1994, also found that appellant was not fit for duty in that he presented a high risk for acting out inappropriately on an aggressive level due to his active auditory hallucinations and deeply ingrained delusional system of persecution....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the reports submitted by Psychiatrist A and Psychologist B, the Commission finds that the agency acted appropriately when it determined in August 1994, that appellant was then not fit for duty and, therefore, advised him that he had the option of seeking psychiatric treatment, applying for disability retirement or resigning. When appellant failed to exercise any one of these options, the agency issued the letter notifying appellant that he would be terminated effective October 22, 1994. After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that this termination decision did not constitute discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is justified in placing an employee on administrative leave and requiring a psychiatric fitness for duty examination where the employee has a past history of mental illness and complains of receiving "communications" that interfere with his performance and further requests a firearm permit in order to deal with the "communicables." <span class="Italic">Rubin v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05880699 (1989). Under those circumstances, the Commission found the agency had a reasonable fear that the complainant might do harm to others and pursued a reasonable course of not disciplining the complainant prior to a medical evaluation of his fitness for duty. The Commission also found that the agency was justified in terminating the complaint when he failed to submit to the psychiatric fitness for duty examination.</p>
