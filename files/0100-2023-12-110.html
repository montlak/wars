<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-109"><span class="space">9.</span> Military Departments</h4>
<p class="noindent">On its face, Title VII applies to civilian employees in military departments, as defined in 5 USC 102. This includes the Departments of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Military personnel are not included within the scope of Title VII. Because of the special nature of the military departments, a question arises when a civilian employee complains about an action that involves "military affairs," as opposed to a civilian personnel decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Doviak v. Department of Navy</span>, 01860381 (1986), the Commission took jurisdiction over a complaint by a civilian employee that she had been prohibited from taking part in sea trial operations of a submarine because of her sex. The agency argued that its refusal to allow the employee on-board was not a personnel action within the meaning of Title VII and that, in any event, the Commission could only review the claim under the confines of <span class="Italic">Mindes v. Seaman</span>, 453 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1971). The <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> case involved the separation of an Air Force officer who sought judicial review on alleged constitutional violations. The Court of Appeals determined that limited judicial review is available if "(1) there has been an allegation that the military agency has acted in violation of applicable statutes, <span class="Italic">and</span>, (2) all available inter-agency corrective measures have been exhausted." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission in <span class="Italic">Doviak</span> first determined that a work assignment, or non-assignment, was a personnel action within the meaning of Title VII. The Commission then assumed, but did not decide, that the <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> doctrine applied to EEOC review of the case. It also found that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Doviak</span> had met the threshold requirements because she alleged the agency violated the statutory provisions of Title VII and she exhausted the agency EEO process when her complaint was dismissed on the grounds of being outside the EEO purview:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Presuming that the two threshold elements have been proven, the <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> court outlines four factors for consideration to determine if a military decision was judicially reviewable. Those four elements are: (1) the nature and strength of the [appellant's] challenge to the military determination, (2) the potential injury to the [appellant] if review is refused, (3) the anticipated interference with the military function, and, (4) the extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion is involved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the Commission is bound by the <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> guidelines (and it is not clear that we are), we find that the appellant has alleged an agency statutory (Title VII) violation and has, up to this point, exhausted her available corrective measures. As for the four <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> factors of consideration, we find that: (1) the appellant's case is sufficiently strong that an <span class="Italic">agency</span> Investigator found that she had proven her case of sex discrimination and it cannot, therefore, be considered tenuous or specious, (2) if this matter is not reviewed the appellant's injury will include not only lost overtime pay but, more significantly, impede her opportunity for promotion, (3) the anticipated interference with the agency's military function will be minimal or non-existent in that the sea exercise in question is scheduled largely for the evaluation of work performed by civilian employees, and, (4) military expertise or discretion is involved to a limited degree, if at all, in that this is not a combat or military patrol, but a test of repairs and reconditioning performed by civilians. Even if the EEOC were subject to the <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> standards, we would hold that all of the necessary factual elements are present to make this matter reviewable by the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission concluded that the appellant was the victim of sex discrimination. On reconsideration, the Commission rejected the notion that <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> is controlling precedent because that decision applied to uniformed personnel and the Commission's jurisdiction extended only to civilian personnel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doviak v. Department of Navy</span>, 05860295 (1987). On reconsideration, the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Doviak</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We generally recognize that the military enjoys wide latitude in making decisions concerning national defense and national security. The power of commanding officers to exclude civilians from the area of their command is not challenged nor is it an issue in this case. The EEOC has no interest in substituting its judgment for that of the Secretary of the Navy. The agency has characterized our decision as violating the authority of its officers. Because this characterization misstates the Commission's role in this matter, we are compelled to address this issue in more detail. As we have previously stated, Congress has not exempted from Title VII coverage personnel actions regarding civilian employees of military departments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency maintains that the Commission's lack of expertise regarding submarines and military matters militates against Commission review. It is true that the Commission is not comprised of experts in Navy sea trials and submarine embarkations. However, the main focus of inquiry here is not the sea trial, but the allegation of discrimination on the basis of sex, and it is this area of law in which the Commission is uniquely qualified. In rendering such a determination, of course, it is necessary <span id="Page_214"></span>for the Commission to have an understanding of the underlying actions.... Accordingly, the Commission's Regulations...provide for a procedure encompassing a thorough investigation before a finding is made on the complaint of discrimination.... It is through this procedure...that the agency is given the opportunity to apprise the Commission of any information necessary for a proper review of the matter in question.</p>
<p class="noindent">A special situation involving military departments also arises with military reserve personnel, who are a hybrid between military and civilian personnel. The EEOC will take jurisdiction only over those matters that are related to the civilian aspects of the employment. <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01850498 (1986). The EEOC has no jurisdiction over the military portions of their duties. The Commission makes its determinations in this area on a case-by-case basis on a review of all of the facts. In the <span class="Italic">Simmons</span> case, the Commission declined jurisdiction because the claim related to a reserve requirement having to do with the complainant's military functions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that a reserve technician has been subjected to sexual harassment sufficiently involves the complainant's civilian employment to make the claim viable under Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Conley v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01945532 (1995), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts have held that, unlike civilian employees, military personnel of any branch of the armed forces, including military personnel within the reserve components, are not covered under Title VII<span class="Italic">. See Johnson v. Alexander</span>, 572 F.2d 1219 (8th Cir. 1978). The Commission has recognized, however, the "dual status" of federal technicians in the reserves, noting that those individuals are considered both uniformed military personnel, as well as civilian employees<span class="Italic">. Brazil v. National Guard Bureau</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01891698 (June 22, 1989). Thus, the Commission has held that federal technicians are covered by Title VII when the alleged discriminatory action arises from their capacity as civilian employees, but are not covered by Title VII when personnel decisions affect their capacity as uniformed military personnel<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Accordingly, it is necessary to review the facts in each case to determine whether the alleged discrimination took place in the context of the individual's capacity as a federal civilian employee or uniformed member of the military unit in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the above legal standards to the facts of this case, we find that the alleged discrimination affected appellant not only in her capacity as a military employee but also in her civilian capacity as well. Although the file indicates that appellant worked for the agency in an ART position, it also indicates that she retained her civil service status as a civilian employee and was employed and compensated as a civilian. The record further indicates that appellant asserted that Employee A subjected her to continuous sexual harassment and, after she filed her first complaint, retaliated against her, ultimately forcing her resignation. Therefore, based upon the facts of this case, the Commission finds that appellant's complaints are within the scope of 29 CFR Part 1614, and, as such, state claims sufficient to warrant an investigation on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC has adopted the position that if the challenged action is "inherently military" in nature, it is not within the coverage of Title VII. The Ninth Circuit has also adopted this position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lutz v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 944 F.2d 1477 (9th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Webb</span>, 838 F.2d 1357 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">The High Year Tenure requirement--a requirement that an Air Force reserve technician retire at age 60 or after 33 years of service, whichever comes first--is outside the EEO purview. The requirement is strictly military even though one component of the reserve position is civilian. <span class="Italic">Priest v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01950759 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Middleton v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01961539 (1996), the Commission held that the appellant's reenlistment arose from her status as a uniformed military member and therefore involved a matter that was exclusive to the military. The Commission noted that the complainant's civil service employment was dependent upon her continued status as a military member and that the denial of her military reenlistment resulted in her separation from civil service employment. However, because the decision to deny reenlistment arose out of her status as a military member, the Commission lacked jurisdiction over the allegation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dalton</span>, 107 F.3d 705 (9th Cir. 1997), the court rejected an argument that 29 CFR 1614.103(d)(1), excluding military personnel from Title VII coverage, was in conflict with 42 USC 2000e-16, which specifically references the military departments. Rejecting multiple arguments by the plaintiff, the court in <span class="Italic">Hodge</span>, 107 F.3d at 708-12, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hodge is an active-duty member of the Marine Corps and is thus a uniformed member of a military department. He is therefore explicitly excluded from coverage by EEOC regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103(d). However, Hodge contends that the EEOC regulation is invalid. Hodge argues first that the regulation conflicts with &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a); and second, that &#x00A7; 1614.103(d)(1) was invalidly promulgated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 1614.103(d)(1) does not conflict with &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a)</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a), Title VII protection is extended to employees in "military departments" and "executive agencies." In &#x00A7; 1614.103, the EEOC has interpreted Title VII to not apply to uniformed members of the military departments. Hodge argues that the EEOC's interpretation conflicts with &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) and is therefore invalid. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Army</span>, 718 F.2d 926, 928 (9th Cir. 1983), this court held that the term "military departments" in &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) "include[s] only civilian employees of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and not both civilian employees and enlisted personnel." In reaching this conclusion, we compared the definition that Congress had given "armed forces" with the definition that Congress had given "military departments." We noted that Congress had defined "armed forces" in 10 USC &#x00A7; 101 as "the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This definition differed from the definition that Congress used for "military departments" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 102. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We concluded that "[t]he two differing definitions show that Congress intended a distinction between 'military departments' and 'armed forces,' the former consisting of civilian employees, the latter of uniformed military personnel."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> We then examined the legislative history of &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) and concluded that the legislative history also provided "a strong inference that section [2000e-16] was not intended to extend Title VII coverage to enlisted and commissioned members of the armed forces in active service."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">All other circuits to address the issue have also held that Title VII is inapplicable to uniformed members of the military. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Doe v. Garrett</span>, 903 F.2d 1455, 1461-62 (11th Cir. 1990) (barring naval reserve member's Rehabilitation Act claim that his release from active-duty military was due to discrimination based on his handicap), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 499 U.S. 904 (1991); <span class="Italic">Roper v. Department of Army</span>, 832 F.2d 247, 248 (2d Cir. 1987) (barring army reserve member's claim that she was not promoted due to racial and sexual discrimination); <span class="Italic">Stinson v. Hornsby</span>, 821 F.2d 1537, 1541 (11th Cir. 1987) (barring national guard member's claim that his discharge was due to racial discrimination), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 488 U.S. 959 (1988); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Jones</span>, 653 F.2d 1193, 1200 (8th Cir. 1981) (barring national guard member's claim that she was demoted due to racial discrimination); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Alexander</span>, 572 F.2d 1219, 1223-24 (8th Cir.) (barring army applicant's claim that he was rejected due to racial discrimination), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 439 U.S. 986 (1978). This interpretation of &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) is consistent with &#x00A7; 1614.103(d)(1), which excludes uniformed members of the military departments from coverage. Therefore, &#x00A7; 1614.103(d)(1) does not conflict with &#x00A7; 2000e-16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hodge also argues that because "MWR is a program operated by the U.S. Navy largely out of non-appropriated funds, using largely civilian employees," it is "thus a 5 USC Sec. 105 military dept." This argument is negated by the plain language of the relevant statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2000e-16(a) provides coverage for employees or applicants for employment in "military departments as defined in section 102" or in "executive agencies as defined in section 105...(including employees and applicants for employment who are paid from nonappropriated funds)...." The plain language of &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) makes it clear that a "military department" must come under the definition of &#x00A7; 102 to be covered by Title VII. Section 102 does not distinguish between military departments operated out of appropriated funds and those using nonappropriated funds. Furthermore, &#x00A7; 105 defines an executive agency as: "an Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment." The term "military department" is never used in &#x00A7; 105. Therefore, the plain language of &#x00A7; 105 does not cover military departments. Finally, although the MWR is apparently operated largely out of nonappropriated funds, &#x00A7; 2000e-16's parenthetical discussion of nonappropriated funds modifies the definition of "executive agencies"; it does not modify the definition of "military departments."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, Hodge argues that <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span> and the other cases interpreting &#x00A7; 2000e-16 are inapposite to his case because those cases relied upon the assumption that the relationship between a uniformed member of the armed forces and the military services is distinct from a traditional employer-employee relationship. In contrast, he argues that his claim does not arise out of his military relationship with the Navy, but rather arises out of his part-time employment conditions with a component of the Navy that is neither related to nor dependent upon his military status. In support of this argument, Hodge relies upon <span class="Italic">Mier v. Owens</span>, 57 F.3d 747 (9th Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 116 S. Ct. 1317 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Mier</span>, the plaintiff worked as a technician for the Army National Guard. His job was a hybrid position, combining both military and civilian aspects. He served in a civilian capacity as a full-time supply management officer and in a military capacity as a commissioned officer not on active duty. To hold the civilian position, the plaintiff was required to be a member of the National Guard and to hold the commensurate military position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 748. The issue before this court was whether the technician, whose job was a hybrid military-civilian position, could maintain a Title VII employment discrimination action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]n some circumstances, personnel actions are not integrally related to the military's structure. Concerns regarding military hierarchy and discipline may not be at issue in suits alleging discriminatory conduct on the part of peers or subordinates. In addition, actions <span id="Page_215"></span>affecting civilian employees may not involve matters considered military in nature. Because Guard technicians are in a hybrid job entailing both civilian and military aspects, we conclude that Title VII coverage of civilians employed by the military encompasses actions brought by Guard technicians except when the challenged conduct is integrally related to the military's unique structure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 750. We held that the claimed discriminatory actions--failure to promote, suspension from the civilian job, and retaliation--were integrally related to the military's structure and therefore were not within Title VII coverage. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 751.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hodge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Mier</span> is misplaced. First, in <span class="Italic">Mier</span>, we explicitly stated that although Title VII protects civilian employees of the military from employment discrimination, it does not protect military personnel. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 749. It is undisputed that Hodge is "military personnel." Second, the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Mier</span> was a hybrid military-civilian; the plaintiff was not on active-duty status. Hodge, in contrast, is not a military-civilian hybrid; he is an active-duty member of the military. The fact that a civilian could hold the part-time position in which he is employed at the enlisted club does not change his status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the action in the present case involves conduct which is integrally related to the military's unique structure. The MWR where Hodge works part-time is governed by a military chain of command. The MWR was under the direct supervision of Colonel Richard Crawford, Commander of the Air Station. Therefore, although the Secretary of the Navy is the named defendant as required under 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c), the real party in interest in the present action is the installation commander as the operator of the club system. Thus, this action involves a legal challenge to a senior Marine Corps Officer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The doctrine of intramilitary immunity, or "the <span class="Italic">Feres</span> doctrine," lends further support to the conclusion that Hodge is not covered by &#x00A7; 2000e-16. Under this doctrine, members of the armed forces may not bring an action against the Government or armed service personnel for injuries during activity under the control or supervision of a commanding officer. <span class="Italic">McGowan v. Scoggins</span>, 890 F.2d 128, 132 (9th Cir. 1989). The doctrine is generally raised in Federal Tort Claims Act ("FTCA") cases applying <span class="Italic">Feres v. United States</span>, 340 U.S. 135 (1950).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Feres</span>, there were three separate causes of action: two for medical malpractice by military doctors and one for maintenance of unsafe barracks. 340 U.S. at 137. The Court held that none of these claims was sufficient to establish a cause of action under the FTCA. The Court stated: "[T]he Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 146 (emphasis added). "The presence of direct military control is sufficient to establish the activity as incident to military service."<span class="Italic"> Bon</span>, 802 F.2d at 1096.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the doctrine of intramilitary immunity is generally applied in connection with the FTCA, its applicability is not limited to FTCA cases. The doctrine is instead applicable whenever a legal action "would require a civilian court to examine decisions regarding management, discipline, supervision, and control of members of the armed forces of the United States." <span class="Italic">McGowan</span>, 890 F.2d at 132 (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Shearer</span>, 473 U.S. 52, 57 (1985)). <span class="Italic">See also Chappell v. Wallace</span>, 462 U.S. 296 (1983) (applying intramilitary immunity doctrine to both a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action and a claim under 42 USC &#x00A7; 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, although Hodge's immediate supervisors were apparently civilian, the military chain of command retained direct control over MWR and its employees. The MWR was required to abide by regulations from higher headquarters within the military chain of command. Regulations governing operation of the MWR were issued by Headquarters Marine Corps, the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense. These regulations from higher headquarters are mandatory on each MWR throughout the Marine Corps. Furthermore, each installation issues its own regulations governing various aspects of the MWR. These local regulations, called Base Orders, are issued under the authority of the Commanding General of the Base. Hodge, as an active-duty member of the military, was at all times "subject to military discipline for any violations of these rules, regulations, and guidelines." <span class="Italic">Bon</span>, 802 F.2d at 1093. <span class="Italic">See also Mariano v. United States</span>, 605 F.2d 721, 723 (4th Cir. 1979) ("All military personnel, whether patrons or employees, were subject to discipline under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for their conduct in the [Officer's] Club."). Thus, Hodge's employment at the MWR was subject to "direct military control" and as such was "incident to military service." <span class="Italic">Bon</span>, 802 F.2d at 1096. Therefore, Hodge's employment falls within the doctrine of intramilitary immunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This conclusion is not inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Johnson v. United States</span>, 704 F.2d 1431 (9th Cir. 1983). In <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, we held that the <span class="Italic">Feres</span> doctrine did not bar a cause of action by an Air Force noncommissioned officer who was injured in an automobile accident near a military base. The plaintiff was injured during his off-duty time, after working at his on-base job as a bartender at the Noncommissioned Officers Club ("NCO Club"). He, along with some friends, had a party at the club after closing hours. The plaintiff was injured after he left the party when the car in which he was riding crashed into a tree. We held that the doctrine of intramilitary immunity did not bar recovery under the FTCA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, at the time the government's negligence occurred, Johnson was not subject in any real way to the compulsion of military orders....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that Johnson was not under military control easily distinguishes the other cases that have concluded that activities in NCO clubs are incident to military service. In <span class="Italic">Mariano v. United States</span>, 605 F.2d 721 (4th Cir. 1979), for example, the plaintiff was employed during his off-duty hours as night manager of a Club. Plaintiff was injured while attempting to break up a fight between two patrons. In holding that the <span class="Italic">Feres</span> doctrine barred plaintiff's suit, the court emphasized that official military regulations made the night manager responsible for maintaining order in the Club. Thus, the plaintiff in Mariano was subject to direct military control and was assigned specific duties as night manager by military regulations. Conversely, Johnson was not subject to any such direct control at the time the negligent act occurred. Indeed, Johnson was injured because the NCO Club remained open in clear violation of Air Force regulations and state law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, at the time of the government's negligence, Johnson was subject to military discipline only in the very remotest sense. Because Johnson was off-duty and working at a non-military second job, his activities were "purely personal." <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 704 F.2d at 1439-40 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The distinctions made in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> are directly relevant to the present case. The alleged discrimination against Hodge occurred in the course of his employment at the MWR. The MWR is in the chain of military command and is subject to military rules, regulations and policies. Therefore, unlike Johnson, Hodge was subject to direct military control and discipline at the time the alleged discriminatory act occurred. Thus, the doctrine of intramilitary immunity applies and gives additional support to the conclusion that &#x00A7; 1614.103(d)(1)'s bar to Hodge's suit is consistent with &#x00A7; 2000e-16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Section 1614.103(d)(1) was validly promulgated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title 5 USC &#x00A7; 553 provides the statutory notice and opportunity for comment requirements which an agency is to follow in promulgating substantive rules. It provides that an agency must publish a proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register unless persons subject to the rules are named and are either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof. 5 USC &#x00A7; 553(b). After the required notice is given, the agency must give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submissions of written data, views, or arguments. 5 USC &#x00A7; 553(c). After the agency has considered the relevant matter presented, the agency is required to incorporate in the rules that it adopts a "concise general statement of their basis and purpose."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the EEOC published a "Notice of Proposed Rulemaking" and requested public comment on its proposed regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 54 Fed. Reg. 45747 (October 31, 1989). The EEOC did not propose language specifying that uniformed members of the armed forces were not covered by Title VII. However, a comment was received regarding the coverage of uniformed members. In response to this comment, and after reviewing case law that addressed the coverage of uniformed members, the EEOC issued a final regulation that explicitly exempted uniformed members of the military departments from Title VII coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 12634, 12642 (April 10, 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Hoffman</span>, 424 F. Supp. 490 (E.D. Mo. 1977), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom., Johnson v. Alexander</span>, 572 F.2d 1219 (8th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 439 U.S. 986 (1978)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hodge argues that &#x00A7; 1614.103(d)(1)'s exclusion of uniformed members from Title VII coverage is not valid because it was not promulgated properly. In support of this argument, Hodge points to the fact that the exclusion was not included in the EEOC's final notice of rulemaking. We reject this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A new opportunity for comment is not generated every time the agency reacts to comments that it receives. <span class="Italic">City of Stoughton, Wis. v. EPA</span>, 858 F.2d 747, 753 (D.C. Cir. 1988). A final regulation that varies from the proposal, even substantially, will be valid as long as it is "in character with the oriGINAl proposal and a logical outgrowth of the notice and comments." <span class="Italic">Rybachek v. EPA</span>, 904 F.2d 1276, 1288 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.103(d)(1) was promulgated pursuant to an explicit congressional grant of authority to the EEOC to implement and enforce &#x00A7; 2000e-16. The legislative history of &#x00A7; 2000e-16 indicates that Congress did not intend to vest the EEOC with the power to review the hiring and employment practices of the armed forces. <span class="Italic">See Roper</span>, 832 F.2d at 248; <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>, 718 F.2d at 928. In promulgating &#x00A7; 1614.103(d)(1), the EEOC was simply making explicit what was already implicit in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 2000e-16 and what was already understood to be the law. Thus, although &#x00A7; 1614.103(d)(1) was not specifically listed in the proposed rulemaking, the regulation is "in character with the oriGINAl proposal and a logical outgrowth of the notice and comments," and was therefore validly <span id="Page_216"></span>promulgated<span class="Italic">. Rybachek</span>, 904 F.2d at 1288. <span class="Italic">See also General Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus</span>, 742 F.2d 1561, 1565-66 (D.C.
