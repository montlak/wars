<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-148"><span class="space">q.</span> $125,001-$150,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cook v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950027 (1998), the Commission awarded $130,000 in emotional distress damages where racial harassment totally disabled the employee for future employment. The Commission awarded $80,000 in damages for daily harassment that lasted about 14 months and sporadic incidents of harassment that occurred over the next 14 months. The Commission also awarded $50,000 in emotional distress damages caused by the complainant's future inability to work. In making the damage award, the Commission did consider that the complainant prolonged her own recovery by failing to take prescribed medication. The award also was tempered by the fact that more than half of the total period of harassment--33 months--occurred before the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $130,000 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Burton v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0720050066 (2007), where the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment on the basis of race and sex that included removing her from several projects and interfering with her work. The complainant suffered from major depression, post traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks and memory loss and, at the time of the hearing some three years later, still had suicidal thoughts and was withdrawn from family and friends. The complainant's emotional distress also caused several physical problems, such as non-epileptic seizures, migraine headaches, stomach problems, nervousness and trembling. The complainant's testimony was corroborated by her husband and by medical records, including medical records from a related workers' compensation claim that was approved.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $130,000 in damages was also upheld in <span class="Italic">Fellows-Gilder v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720070046 (2008), even though the complainant had significant preexisting conditions. The Commission in upholding the award in <span class="Italic">Fellows-Gilder</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That complainant suffered from a preexisting emotional condition is well documented by the record. In her testimony, complainant discussed that she suffered abuse by her parents, stress encountered while working as a paramedic, prior sex discrimination, as well as the death of her fiance, which, predictably, seems to have caused complainant significant distress. Indeed, complainant's psychiatrist testified that complainant may have reported experiencing suicidal thoughts in 1999 prior to her termination, but was not worried about it because complainant had other means to cope with her anxiety. (Hearing Transcript 2 [HT2] at p. 10, 11).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, prior to the termination from the agency, complainant had not fallen to the levels she did following the termination. She had been terminated from jobs before, but had not cut herself, as she began to do following the termination in 2000. (Hearing Transcript 1 [HT1] at p. 55, HT2 at p. 77). Although complainant may have had suicidal thoughts prior to the termination, after the termination she was hospitalized because she had actually written a suicide note, and had a plan to carry it out. This behavior led to complainant's first admission to a psychiatric hospital. (HT1 at p. 58). At her admission to the hospital, job difficulties and financial matters were noted as stressors at the time. (Complainant's Exhibit K at p. 17). Because of her financial problems precipitated by the discrimination, complainant was forced to seek public assistance and had to move to a remote location in Vermont because it was all she could afford. Complainant testified about the shame and embarrassment this caused her to feel. Prior to the termination, complainant had not been forced to seek public assistance such as food and housing subsidies. (HT1 at pp. 46-47, 129). Furthermore, prior to the termination, complainant had engaged in social activities, and had friends, interests and hobbies. After the termination, however, complainant moved to a remote area of Vermont, and a friend, who has worked for the INS for over twenty years, credibly described complainant as a "hermit." (HT1 at p. 95).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that complainant is not credible, and that factors unrelated to the discrimination caused her significant emotional distress. The evidence does support the agency's position that factors unrelated to the discrimination were noted during her counseling sessions both before and after her termination. However, we find support for the AJ's finding that complainant's anxiety and depression was significantly exacerbated by the discrimination, as evidenced by the above. She began to cut herself, which she had not done before, and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital under' a suicide watch. Most significantly, after the discrimination, complainant sought public assistance for the first time in her life, and lost her health insurance. Complainant's health insurance was a link to a support network that provided her with funding for prescription medication and therapy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the agency failed to satisfy its burden of establishing the second exception in that the agency failed to show that complainant's condition would have naturally worsened to the point it did.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the agency contends that the AJ erred when she cited as a source of stress, complainant's statement that she continues to be stressed as of 2006, due to unemployment with active legal action against employer." AJ Decision at 10. The agency argues that this evidence establishes that complainant suffered emotional distress due to the litigation, which is not compensable. We disagree with the agency's characterization of this evidence. Rather, we find the statement reveals complainant was in fact still experiencing work related stress and financial stress in 2005-2006, years after the termination. (See Exhibit L.). The fact that complainant reported that she had initiated legal action does not, in of itself, reveal that she was experiencing stress in 2006 from the litigation only.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Terban v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0720040117 (2008), the Commission rejected the agency's attempt to reduce a $130,000 damage award by the administrative judge noting that while the agency argued for reduction, it offered no alternative damage award and cited no case law in support of a lowered damage award. Also rejecting arguments that expert medical evidence was necessary to support the award, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Terban</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There was extensive testimony at the hearing by complainant, his wife, and others about the emotional and physical impact the discrimination had on complainant. The AJ summarized this testimony as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">there was tension in the marriage and that complainant had become withdrawn, moody, and depressed as a result of the discrimination. Complainant was hospitalized, considered suicide, subjected to electro shock treatment, and to this day takes medicine and sees a psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "tension in the marriage" referred to by the AJ included the very serious deterioration of complainant's relationship with his young children. Before the onset of the discriminatory harassment to which complainant was subjected, the evidence shows that complainant had a close relationship with his children and was regularly involved in family functions and celebrations. That ended when the harassment at work began. Complainant testified that his supervisor's purpose in subjecting him to the harassment was to force him into early retirement. According to complainant, the prospect of forced early retirement sent him into a deep depression. This was because early retirement would result in a substantial reduction in his income, require him to sell the family residence and move to a less expensive area and would prevent his children from attending college. When his children learned of this prospect, they reacted very negatively to complainant. This was a source of great distress to complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency criticizes the damages award on various grounds. With respect to pecuniary compensatory damages, the agency suggests that complainant's proof is inadequate because some the medical records he produced conflicted with his view of the case. There is no merit to this argument. The question we must decide is whether there is substantial evidence to support the AJ's award. There is both medical and lay evidence supporting the damage award. The fact that some of the medical records might not support complainant's damages theory does not invalidate the AJ's determination if there was substantial evidence to support it. While the existence of conflicting evidence prevents an AJ from issuing a decision without a hearing, <span class="Italic">see Miles v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A04665 (Oct. 31, 2002) (noting that if a case can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence, rendering a decision without first holding a hearing would be inappropriate), in this case a hearing was held. Following a hearing, it is the function of the AJ to resolve conflicting evidence. Here the AJ has resolved those conflicts in favor of complainant. Similarly, with respect to non-pecuniary compensatory damages, the agency argues that some of complainant's witnesses were unable to support his claim that he became depressed as a result of being harassed. Assuming that to be the case, it does not invalidate the AJ award if it is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also argues that the award of $130,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages is excessive, although it does not suggest a lesser amount that might be appropriate. The agency suggests, without citation to authority, that complainant's failure to adduce any medical <span id="Page_1917"></span>evidence concerning his non-pecuniary compensatory damages invalidates the award. This is incorrect. The Commission has held that such evidence is not a prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Lawrence v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995). Courts also have held that "expert testimony ordinarily is not required to grant money damages for mental anguish or emotional distress." <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co.,</span> 37 F.3d 712, 724 (1st Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">citing Wulf v. City of Wichita,</span> 883 F.2d 842, 875 (10th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Busche v. Burkee,</span> 649 F.2d 509, 512 n.12 (7th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 454 U.S. 897 (1981). A complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can suffice to sustain his/her burden in this regard. <span class="Italic">See U.S. v. Balistrieri,</span> 981 F.2d 916, 932 (7th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 114 S. Ct. 58 (1993) (housing discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">Jeffry R. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020002824 (2021), the Commission found that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the complainant in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, which led to his "inability to perform the duties of his position and the reduction/elimination of his work hours." The agency awarded $35,000 in compensatory damages. On appeal, the complainant maintained that the agency's failure to accommodate led to three years of suffering and requested $300,000. The Commission awarded $140,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we consider Complainant's request for an increase in the Agency's award of $35,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages, to the maximum permitted by statute ($300,000). Complainant maintains that the Agency's failure to accommodate him for three years caused him to experience the following symptoms: insomnia; confusion; anxiety; hopelessness; depression; isolation; and feeling insufficient as a man. Complainant further asserts that his psychological symptoms physically manifested as backpain and that his experience led him to question whether he should go on with life. Complainant also maintains that the Agency's discriminatory actions caused him severe financial strain, which rendered him so unable to meet his child support obligations that he had go to court to request a reduction. Complainant emphasizes that his inability to support his non-custodial children affected not only his confidence and self-esteem, but also his relationship with his children and other family members. While Complainant acknowledges that the record contains limited medical evidence, he contends that his assertions are corroborated by statements from his family members, coworkers, and friends. Complainant emphasizes that he had no psychiatric conditions prior to the Agency's discriminatory actions, even after his stroke, as the support that he received from his family and friends helped him to recover from the stroke both physically and emotionally. He maintains that he continues to suffer from the effects of his discriminatory unemployment to this day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant cites to the following four Commission decisions in support of his request for increased nonpecuniary compensatory damages: <span class="italic">Sainz v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720030103 (Sept. 19, 2008) (awarding $100,000.00 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages for three years of harm to complainant who was removed from federal service during his probationary period after sustaining an on-the-job injured his knee at work; <span class="italic">Blount v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (Oct. 21, 2000) (upholding AJ's award of $200,000.00, where agency's failure to accommodate complainant resulted in complainant's inability to work, led to complainant being sued by his ex-wife for child custody, and led to "state legal action" against him); <span class="italic">Munno v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A01734 (Feb. 8, 2001) (upholding agency's final decision, which awarded complainant $250,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages related to her non-promotion); and <span class="italic">Alene S. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720150038 (Apr. 6, 2016) (reducing AJ's award of $300,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages to $200,000 on the grounds that complainant's disabilities were preexisting, despite AJ's finding that agency's failure to accommodate rendered complainant completely disabled and unable to work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the evidence in the record and Commission precedent, we find that Complainant is entitled to $140,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="italic">See Holland v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A01372 (Oct. 2, 2003) (affirming AJ's award of $100,000.00 where statements from complainant and his psychiatrist showed that the agency's discriminatory actions exacerbated complainant's preexisting psychiatric condition and caused him severe emotional injury for a period of five years as a result of the agency's failure to accommodate him; present day value: $147,569.19), <span class="italic">req. for recons. den.</span> EEOC Request No. 05A40191 (June 29, 2004); <span class="italic">Durinzi v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A41946 (July 28, 2005) (increasing agency's award of $10,000.00 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages to $120,000.00 because statements from complainant and her family members showed that complainant suffered severe harm to her physical, emotional, and financial wellbeing, as a result of the agency's failure to accommodate her for a period of six years; present day value: $167,657.93), <span class="italic">req. for recons. den</span>. EEOC Request No. 05A51158 (Oct. 19, 2005); and <span class="italic">Emiko S. v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120161130 (July 19, 2016) (increasing award of $50,000.00 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages to $150,000.00, where the agency's failure to accommodate complainant's visual disability led to revocation of complainant's job offer and subsequently led to approximately seven years of professional, emotional, and financial insecurity until the EEOC ordered her reinstatement; present day value: $170,181.57), <span class="italic">req. for recons. den</span>. EEOC Request No. 0520160486 (Nov. 2, 2016). We have adjusted our award to reflect key differences between the instant case and the three cases cited above, to include consideration of the duration of the harm, the present day value of the awards, and our determination that Complainant's emotional distress did not exist prior to the discrimination. After careful consideration of these factors, we conclude that an award of $140,000.00 is warranted.8</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering the cases referenced by Complainant, <span class="italic">Blount</span>, <span class="italic">Munno</span>, and <span class="italic">Alene S., supra</span>, we find the facts before us include some significant distinctions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="italic">Blount</span>, the complainant lost custody of his child and faced "state legal action" against him. While we recognize that Complainant alleges that the Agency's discrimination brought him to the brink of financial ruin and caused him to seek a reduction in his child support payments, we do not find these circumstances to be equivalent to losing custody of a child and being sued by the state. Given these differences, we find that <span class="italic">Blount</span> to be distinguishable from the instant case. <span class="italic">See Blount v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (Oct. 21, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Munno, we note that the Commission did not make any independent findings regarding the emotional harm that complainant suffered or whether the agency's award of $250,000.00 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages was warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, in that case, the Commission discussed whether the agency's refusal to implement the AJ's recommendation to promote complainant to a Senior Executive Service (SES) position was justifiable given the complainant's emotional state. Since the Commission did not discuss the adequacy of the agency's award of $250,000.00 in <span class="italic">Munno</span>, we find Complainant's reliance on that case to be unpersuasive. <span class="italic">See Munno v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A01734 (Feb. 8, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="italic">Alene S.,</span> the agency's discriminatory actions exacerbated the complainant's preexisting conditions to such an extent that she was rendered completely disabled and unable to work. Here, however, the record clearly shows that Complainant was able to return to work and perform the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to considering Complainant's arguments for an increase to the Agency's award, we also evaluated the Agency's reasoning in granting less than requested by Complainant. As noted above, the Agency pointed to a lack of medical documentation to justify the reduction. We find, however, that Complainant has provided sufficient non-medical documentation to support a greater award. <span class="italic">See Franklin v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A00025 and 01A03882 (Jan. 19, 2001) (awarding complainant $150,000.00 (present day value: $233,868.93) in nonpecuniary compensatory damages despite his failure to adduce any medical evidence, as the record showed that after he was forced into disability retirement, he suffered "extensive symptoms of emotional distress, resulting in changes in complainant's personality, the ending of his marriage, severe strains in his relationships with those close to him, including his children, and diminished enjoyment of life").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we find that an award of $140,000.00 takes into account the nature, severity, and duration of Complainant's suffering, is consistent with other nonpecuniary compensatory damages awards given in similar cases and is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone or derived from passion or prejudice.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reduced an award of $195,000 by the administrative judge to an award of $150,000 in <span class="Italic">Booker v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 07A00023 (2000), where the complainant, as a result of the discrimination, suffered from depression and increased alcohol consumption, attempted suicide three times and was hospitalized. Although the award was reduced as excessive, the Commission still awarded substantial damages in <span class="Italic">Booker,</span> finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that both complainant and his brother [as well as a co-worker] testified that it was the all consuming and deteriorating situation at work which was causing complainant to suffer emotionally and that the agency did not provide any evidence, beyond its mere assertion, that complainant must have been affected by other stressful circumstances...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ, who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, considered the severity of the harm caused by the agency's action; discounted the value he assigned to it for any pre-existing condition that may have existed or was exacerbated by other stress factors in his life; and determined that $195,000.00 was a reasonable amount to compensate complainant. Upon review, the Commission finds that although complainant did not present evidence concerning the duration of his depression, his three attempts at suicide and his voluntary hospitalization for observation <span id="Page_1918"></span>support the AJ's finding that the severity of the emotional harm sustained by complainant warranted a large monetary award. We are unpersuaded by the agency's argument that the credible testimony provided at the hearing was insufficient to establish the causal relationship between the agency's discriminatory action and complainant's emotional distress or that other personal problems played a significant role in the deterioration of complainant's emotional health. However, the Commission finds that the AJ's award is excessive compared with awards given in cases where complainants have experienced similarly severe emotional distress. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $150,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Franklin v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A00025 (2001), the Commission awarded $150,000 in nonpecuniary damages even without medical testimony. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Franklin</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Commission recognizes that complainant did not adduce medical evidence of any diagnosis or treatment for his alleged depression, the record reveals that the agency's conduct caused extensive symptoms of emotional distress, resulting in changes in complainant's personality, the ending of his marriage, severe strains in his relationships with those close to him, including his children, and diminished enjoyment of life.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, based on testimony by complainant and his wife, the AJ found that when the craft transfer was denied, complainant was devastated. At age 37, his life career choice of working for the agency was over, and his whole world had been built around this job. Prior to denial of reassignment to a Craft position, complainant exhibit[ed] a good sense of humor, enjoyed being around people, spent time outdoors, and had fun with [his] two children. Following his disability retirement, however, he became withdrawn, gloomy, purposeless, and depressed. In addition, notwithstanding his extensive job search, which included sending out literally thousands of job applications for private sector and government positions, complainant was unable to find comparable work at the same salary he earned while employed at the agency. He was unemployed from June through October 1995 and for three weeks in August 1997, and during the other periods took various night or part-time jobs at a lower salary than he earned at the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ further found that the impact of his loss of employment on his marriage and family life was devastating to complainant. His wife became the sole wage earner, and even after complainant found employment, his wife's wages remained the major source of family income. According to complainant's wife, his daughters, born in 1982 and 1983, did not understand why complainant could not find a "dad" job as opposed to a "college kid" job, and complainant was embarrassed and humiliated by his inability to support his family. The AJ found that complainant blamed himself for this outcome and experienced shame and a loss of self esteem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that complainant, his wife, and children attended family counseling, but that because of the strained family relationship, complainant and his wife separated. Since financial constraints prevented him from moving out of family home, complainant relocated to a separated part of the house from his wife and their children. The AJ noted that "[t]he demeanor of the complainant and [his wife] persuasively demonstrated their sincerity and the devastating impact of the agency's conduct on their lives, including the break-up of their marriage of seventeen years." The AJ further concluded that complainant's severe emotional distress arose immediately following the discrimination and was proximately caused thereby, and that the agency failed to establish that any other events or conditions contributed to the distress experienced by complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the objective evidence reviewed above, we find that complainant proved he experienced significant emotional distress which was caused by the agency's failure to consider reassignment and complainant's resulting medical retirement. Contrary to the agency's contention that the AJ erred in awarding significant non-pecuniary compensatory damages in the absence of medical testimony, we note that evidence from a health care provider is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional distress<span class="Italic">. Economou v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983435 (August 5, 1999); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998). Complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case can suffice to sustain his burden, but the absence of supporting evidence may affect the amount of damages deemed appropriate in a particular case<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Moreover, an award of compensatory damages for non-pecuniary losses, including emotional harm, should reflect the extent to which the agency's discriminatory action directly or proximately caused the harm and the extend to which other factors also caused the harm<span class="Italic">. See Johnson v. Department of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961812 (June 18, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an agency's discriminatory removal of the complainant resulted in his having to withdraw support of his son's ambitions to become a professional hockey player and the complainant ultimately told his son to leave home, the Commission awarded $150,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Kloock v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A31159.txt">01A31159</a> (2004), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted evidence of non-pecuniary damages through his affidavit, as well as affidavits from a friend and his son. In addition, complainant provided several psychological reports. The uncontroverted evidence shows that prior to May 1994, complainant was a stable, well-adjusted and relatively happy individual. Complainant described his relationship with his son before May 1994 as exceptional and had good friendships and a rewarding life. Just prior to May 1994, complainant was in the process of buying a new home and had been pre-approved for a mortgage. Prior to May 1994, complainant had been very active with his union and the local youth hockey community.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After complainant was ordered not to return to work in May 1994, his attempts to buy a home had to be suspended. In addition, his relationship with his son suffered severe problems. Complainant had been his son's hockey coach throughout his teens. His son wanted complainant to assist him in developing a training program that could give him a possibility of turning professional. Complainant had coached state championship teams and several players that he had coached had gone on to win Junior Nationals as well as to play for various colleges and semi-professional teams. Complainant explained that when his son demonstrated to him that he was serious about wanting to play professional hockey, complainant set him up with a practice schedule and pledged his support. According to complainant, during the summer of 1993, complainant's son was holding his own against semi-professionals and Division One college players. Complainant put his son on a rigorous weight training program and practice schedule through the 1993-1994 season. The plan was for complainant's son to attend semi-professional camps during the summer of 1994. However, because complainant was ordered not to return to work, in May 1994 his finances became tight and he became depressed. Complainant no longer could assist his son with his hockey dreams. Complainant's relationship with his son greatly deteriorated and he eventually told his son to leave his home. Complainant states that before May 1994, he encouraged his son to pursue his dreams and he pledged to support him. However, complainant feels that at the moment when his son was succeeding, he let him down.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also states that he lost his health benefits as a result of the agency's discriminatory actions. Complainant was very concerned about his lack of health insurance, since he was at risk of a heart attack and was unable to afford routine medical examinations. In addition, complainant states that the physical pain associated with his herniated disc increased after May 1994, since he was unable to afford chiropractic care after that time. In August 1994, complainant suffered a relapse related to the herniated disc and was hospitalized and placed in traction for three days. According to complainant, chiropractic care could have greatly reduced the pain associated with the relapse and could have reduced his recovery time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further affirmed that in September 1994, he had to give up his apartment and reluctantly had to move in with his brother (B1) in order to preserve his remaining assets. Complainant states that he was very depressed and his relationship with B1 became strained. Thereafter, in November 1994, complainant moved in with his other brother (B2) until May 1995, when he moved back in with B1. Thereafter, complainant moved into a friend's one-room hunting cabin that had no running water. In December 1995, complainant moved in with his son. Complainant felt useless living off his son and sold his last remaining assets (his 20-acre property) and cashed in his thrift savings account to pay his own way. According to complainant he had planned to retire on his 20-acre property some day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to a 1999 report by P1, complainant suffered moderate to severe depression as a result of the agency's adverse treatment. In addition, complainant was suffering from guilt, despondency, anxiety, sleeplessness, weight gain and other physical problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to P1, as of July 2002, complainant remains highly depressed, struggles with his own anger and tendencies to act out such anger, suffers from a sleep disorder, has been unable to lose weight that he gained after May 1994, has anticipatory anxiety at work, is on edge, feels persecuted and is preoccupied with somatic or physical complaints. In addition, P1 states that complainant's paranoia has increased. As of July, 2002, P1's prognosis for significant improvement is not good. According to P1, "given that the symptoms reported in 1999 and those in 2002 are fairly similar, it suggests that they have become a rather consistent part of [complainant's] personality make-up and most resistant to change." While P1 noted that while "complainant appears to be better able to cope with [work stresses], some level of clinical symptomology is likely to remain and a return to pre-morbid functioning is highly unlikely." P1 recommended continued psychological treatment and anti-depressant medication.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that complainant established a causal connection between the discriminatory action and the resulting harm. Several witnesses including complainant's psychologist connected complainant's emotional distress to the agency's adverse employment actions which began in May 1994.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1919"></span>We also find that complainant presented sufficient evidence establishing that the agency's actions caused him depression, social withdrawal, weight gain, anxiety, sleeplessness, feelings of hopelessness, anger, paranoia, victimization, humiliation, constant fear of unjustified job loss, loss of self-esteem, severe financial strain, loss of his home and future home, familial strain, added physical pain associated with his herniated disc, and the loss of his hockey coach career. In addition, many of these symptoms lasted for at least 8 years and are expected to last indefinitely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the evidence, and considering the nature and severity of the harm to complainant, we find that complainant is entitled to $150,000 in non-pecuniary damages. We find this case most similar to that of <span class="Italic">Franklin v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00025 (January 10, 2001) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages where discriminatory constructive discharge resulted in extensive symptoms of emotional distress, including withdrawal, acting gloomy, purposeless, depression, inability to find comparable work at comparable salary, marital strain leading to divorce, humiliation, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem and shame, but no medical evidence of diagnosis or treatment for depression.); <span class="Italic">Mack v. Department of Veteran Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01982317 (June 23, 2000) ($185,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant was stripped of all his worldly goods, including his home, which resulted in his being twice beaten and robbed, succumbing to the lure of illegal drugs and having increased depression and worsened emphysema requiring multiple medications); <span class="Italic">See</span> also <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (October 14, 1998) ($125,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered depression and other emotional and mental disorders, and severe chest pains and stomach pains, digestive problems, and incidents of shortness of breath); <span class="Italic">Cleland v. Department of Veteran Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970546 (August 9, 2000) (award of $125,000 in non-pecuniary damages based on physical and emotional harm for 5 years and expected to continue into the indefinite future); and <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Veteran Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951729 (July 29, 1998) ($100,000 awarded where complainant was subjected to hostile work environment that caused her to develop significant levels of anxiety, nervousness and depression, which were manifested by nightmares, cognitive inefficiencies, periods of tearfulness, and suicidal ideation, and where complainant remained out of work for nearly 3 years); <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971851 (October 23, 1998) ($75,000 awarded where discriminatory discharge caused complainant significant pain and suffering over four years, including feelings of psychological numbness, anger, insomnia, depression, flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive bad thoughts and less confidence on the job, and a constant fear of unjustified job loss). Accordingly, based upon awards in similar cases and after considering the nature, severity and duration of complainant's harm, we find that an award of $150,000 is proper and not monstrously excessive.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant remains able to work, even at a relatively stressful job, does not preclude a large damage award though it may affect the amount of the award. In <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40037_r.txt">07A40037</a> (2004), the Commission reduced a damage award of $200,000 by the administrative judge to $150,000, because the judge had not accounted for the fact that despite his mental condition, the complainant was able to successfully train as a firefighter/EMS and complete his probationary period. In <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, the complainant presented evidence that he would continue to require psychiatric treatment and medication for depression, anxiety disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder for some five years after the close of the hearing. However, the Commission reduced the award because there was no evidence that those conditions interfered with his training or subsequent job performance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award by an administrative judge of $150,000 in damages where the complainant's daughter and coworkers corroborated the complainant's testimony about the effect of the discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Furch v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 07A40094 (2005), the complainant experienced stomach problems and was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder. The administrative judge also made specific findings that the complainant suffered from depression, loss of enjoyment of life, interference with family relationships and a permanent diminishment of her quality of life.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Goodridge v. Social Security Administration</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0720050026.txt">07200500261</a> (2006), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 0520070216 (2007), the Commission upheld an award of $150,000 by an administrative judge for harm the complainant suffered as the result of a nonpromotion and hostile environment. Although somewhat short on detail, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Goodridge noted:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that following her non-selection and being subjected to a hostile work environment, complainant suffered anxiety, depression, humiliation, sleep deprivation and began a medication regimen which included Valium, Prozac, Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Hydroxyzine. Even at the time of the hearing, complainant testified that she still suffered from crying spells, saw no relief in sight, and had withdrawn socially from friends and family.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's husband, sister, and friend corroborated complainant's testimony and reported complainant suffered from anxiety, depression, and was no longer the outgoing person she had been. Complainant submitted medical records from her physicians, and noted that she had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. After a review of the testimony and medical records, the AJ found complainant established a link between her non-selection and hostile work environment claims and the resulting emotional distress. The AJ awarded complainant $150,000 in damages to compensate her for the discrimination. Specifically, the AJ found complainant suffered from depression, loss of enjoyment of life, interference with family relationships, permanent diminishment in quality of her life, and physical symptoms.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $150,000 to a victim of sexual harassment was deemed appropriate where the complainant was especially sensitive to such treatment given that, as a child, she had been witness to the sexual abuse of a sister by her grandfather, and possibly a victim of abuse herself. In <span class="Italic">Tyner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070032 (2007), the complainant's psychiatrist also testified that the complainant was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and agoraphobia. The complainant's father also testified that the complainant became more withdrawn and depressed and, on visits home, spent most of her time in bed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $150,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Estate of Nason v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01563 (2001), where the complainant, after two suicide attempts, successfully committed suicide and left behind a note that blamed the Post Office for "all the stress that they have caused me leading to this action." Because the author cannot justify giving so little value to a life, the Commission explained its decision in <span class="Italic">Estate of Nason</span>, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.,</span> 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987). The Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a complainant has a pre-existing condition, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. Second, if the complainant's pre-existing condition inevitably would have worsened, the agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination, the burden of proof being on the agency to establish the extent of this entitlement. Wallis, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (citing <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States,</span> 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997). The Commission notes, however, that complainant is entitled to recover damages only for injury, or additional injury, caused by the discriminatory action<span class="Italic">. Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996); EEOC Notice No. N 915.002 at 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Complainant's Evidence</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant committed suicide by overdosing on prescription medication sometime between July 11 and July 13, 1994. She had attempted suicide once before on June 10, 1994, and contemplated suicide on July 8, 1994<span class="Italic">.</span> In her suicide note, she stated, "I blame the Bandon Post Office for all of my stress and I hope compensation as a result of all the stress that they have caused me leading to this action. Due to the Postal Service I'm drowning financially and emotionally."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's husband (CH) testified that complainant's work situation was the all-consuming factor in her life and the cause of her loss of the ability to interact with him and her children. For example, complainant would ignore her children when they tried to interact with her because she wanted to discuss the difficulties she was having at work. CH further testified that matters worsened for complainant when she was reassigned to the Coquille Post Office. CH stated that complainant felt that she had been blamed by management for the problems that existed at the Bandon Post Office and that her career hopes with the Postal Service were lost. CH also described complainant as feeling "hopeless" after her reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's co-worker (CW) also testified that complainant was extremely depressed. CW stated that complainant would call her, often when she had been drinking, to discuss the problems she was having at work. During one conversation, complainant told CW that she believed that the events that occurred at the Bandon Post Office followed her to the Coquille Post Office, and that information had been shared between the two Post Offices. CW further testified that complainant told her that the Postal Service had taken such a toll on her that she could no longer function as a good wife or good mother. Complainant explained to CW that she moved out of her marital home for this reason.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's mother (CM) testified that complainant was extremely depressed and upset on a constant basis. CM described complainant as a "nervous wreck," and stated that CM had to help care for complainant's children because complainant was having difficulty coping with her work situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the objective evidence reviewed above, we find that <span id="Page_1920"></span>complainant's estate proved that she experienced significant emotional distress which was caused, in part, by her reassignment. We note that evidence from a health care provider is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional distress<span class="Italic">. Economou v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983435 (August 5, 1999); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998). Along with the circumstances of a particular case, complainant's testimony can suffice to sustain her burden, but the absence of supporting evidence may affect the amount of damages deemed appropriate in a particular case<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Commission recognizes that complainant's estate did not adduce medical evidence of any diagnosis beyond the FFDE report, the record reveals that the agency's conduct caused extensive symptoms of emotional distress, resulting in severe strain to her relationships with those close to her and diminished enjoyment of life, and ultimately contributed to her decision to commit suicide. We note that complainant's husband, mother and co-worker testified that the situation at work became the all-consuming factor which caused complainant to suffer emotionally. We find, however, that complainant was having some marital problems which also contributed to her emotional distress. Even though complainant blamed the Bandon Post Office for all of her marital problems, we find that the two problems likely contributed to each other. HE at C-12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ, who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, considered the severity of the harm caused by the agency's action, discounted the value he assigned to it for any pre-existing condition that may have existed or was exacerbated by other stress factors in complainant's life, and determined that $150,000 was a reasonable amount to compensate complainant. Accordingly, after analyzing the evidence which establishes the emotional injuries sustained by complainant and upon consideration of damage awards reached in comparable cases, we find that the AJ's award of non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $150,000 was consistent with the evidence in the record as well as Commission precedent<span class="Italic">. See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Franklin v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00025 (January 19, 2001) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages awarded where as a result of agency's actions, complainant experienced extensive symptoms of emotional distress, resulting in changes in complainant's personality, the ending of his marriage, severe strains in his relationships with those close to him, including his children, and diminished enjoyment of life); <span class="Italic">Booker v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00023 (August 10, 2000) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages awarded where as a result of agency's actions, complainant experienced severe depression, resulting in three suicide attempts).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a decision awards a high amount of damages does not necessarily mean the Commission will scrutinize that award on appeal. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720070021 (2007), the Commission upheld a $150,000 damage award by the administrative judge with virtually no mention of the facts that led to that award and the simply notation that it found no basis for disturbing the judge's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a hostile environment case that resulted in a constructive discharge, the Commission upheld an award of $150,000 in damages by an administrative judge. In <span class="Italic">Solomon v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0720070071 (2008), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ based her award of $150,000.00 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages on the testimony of complainant, complainant's daughter, a close friend, and her psychiatrist. Complainant testified that before working under RMO, she "had a sense of humor and good outlook on life." After working for RMO, she lost her self-confidence, withdrew from friends, and felt that her reputation had been soiled. Complainant contends she was depressed, and described symptoms that included: migraines, disturbed sleep and crying.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's daughter described hearing her mother, in the middle of the night, crying in the kitchen. When she asked her mother why she was upset, complainant referred to the abuse at work. Complainant's daughter also testified that complainant no longer wanted to go out, and instead stayed home, and was quiet. Additionally, she stated that complainant's relationship with her grandchildren deteriorated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, complainant's friend of over twenty years reported that complainant appeared more stressed. Complainant explained to her friend her frustrations with work, and the friend observed that it "began to take a toll on her personality...on her emotions and her stress level."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychiatrist diagnosed complainant as having depression and anxiety. He noted that she may have had major depression, that was somewhat controlled by medications prescribed earlier by her family practitioner. He described problems with sleep, appetite and migraines. The psychiatrist testified that complainant's "work problems were clearly the predominant issue for her." At her second and final visit, complainant had decided to leave her job and the doctor noticed marked improvement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency argues that the AJ's award of compensatory damages is excessive. The agency argues that because the harassment occurred for four months, complainant only required brief psychiatric treatment, and she experienced severe stress from other sources, the award should be reduced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that because there is no precise formula by which to calculate nonpecuniary damages, AJ's are necessarily afforded broad discretion in determining such damages awards. To be sustained on appeal an award of nonpecuniary damages should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) <span class="Italic">(citing Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F.2d 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the AJ's award of $150,000.00 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages was not excessive. There is no evidence that the amount is "monstrous" or the result of passion or prejudice. The Commission has awarded comparable amounts in other cases where the discrimination caused depression and other adverse psychological and physical conditions. <span class="Italic">See Tyner v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720060032 (October 23, 2007) ($150,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered from major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, with symptoms that included problems sleeping, problems with appetite, feeling sad and tearful, and problems with self-esteem) <span class="Italic">citing, Furch v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40094 (August 5, 2005) ($150,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered from depression, loss of enjoyment of life, interference with family relationships, permanent diminishment in quality of life, and physical symptoms.); <span class="Italic">Goodridge v. Department of Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720050026 (November 15, 2006) ($150,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered from depression, loss of enjoyment of life, interference with family relationships and physical symptoms).</p>
<p class="noindent">Substantial evidence of harm does not necessarily require medical proof. The complainant's testimony and that of his wife's was enough to support a $150,000 award in <span class="Italic">Miquel G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020000182 (2020). In that case, the complainant was not clinically diagnosed with depression nor did he submit documentary evidence to support his claim for compensatory damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to denial of accommodation in Claim 1, the AJ found Complainant credibly testified that he was "extremely nervous" and sweating, while trying to do the best he could. After the interview, Complainant was "exhausted" and "overwhelmed," aware that it was not his best interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for his discriminatory non-selection in Claim 2, the AJ found that Complainant experienced much more long term and deep emotional distress. The AJ noted that "[a]n otherwise articulate and confident man throughout his testimony, [Complainant] observably experienced trouble speaking and finding the words to express himself when asked about the emotional aspects of this case. The change in his speech and demeanor told of the emotional suffering brought on particularly by the non-selection, which hurts him deeply to this day."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant credibly testified that soon after learning of his non-selection, he drafted a suicide note and walked to a mineshaft intending to end his life, but his love of his wife stopped him, and he threw out the note. Complainant testified that the impact of the non-selection was ongoing, as he experienced depression, argued with his wife like he never had before almost ending their marriage of 35 years, and stopped participating in family activities. He went to the doctor at his wife's insistence and was prescribed blood pressure medication.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife credibly testified that Complainant changed from a man who rarely got angry to one who had "explosive outbursts." She explained that his change in character permanently impacted their marriage, stating, "we won't get back to where we were because there's this crack in our relationship [and] 95 percent of this is the non-selection." At the time of her testimony, she and Complainant had been married for 40 years, yet she said the impact of the rejection and resulting emotions were still present in Complainant. Even after Complainant's voluntary retirement, his wife testified that his mood did not fully improve.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the AJ noted that Complainant had not been clinically diagnosed with depression, and there was no documentary evidence of his doctor visit and blood pressure medication, he found Complainant and his wife's testimony sufficiently credible to establish both conditions existed and arose from his non-selection. Given the severity and duration of Complainant's emotional distress, the AJ awarded $150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency subsequently issued a Final Order adopting the AJ's finding that Complainant proved that the Agency subjected him to discrimination as alleged, as well as the AJ's order of equitable relief, back pay, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The Agency simultaneously <span id="Page_1921"></span>appealed the portion of the AJ's order regarding non-pecuniary and past pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the existence of medical evidence, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Miquel G</span>. upheld the AJ's award of $150,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After establishing entitlement to an award of compensatory damages, there is no precise formula for determining the amount of damages for non-pecuniary losses, except that the award should reflect the nature and severity of the harm and the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="Italic">See Loving v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01955789 (Aug. 29, 1997). It should likewise be consistent with amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Hogeland v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01976440 (June 14, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission points out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the Agency for its discriminatory actions. Furthermore, compensatory damages should not be motivated by passion or prejudice or "monstrously excessive" standing alone but should be consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that evidence from a health care provider is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Carpenter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (Jul. 17, 1995). Courts also have held that "expert testimony ordinarily is not required to ground money damages for mental anguish or emotional distress." <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co</span>., 37 F.3d 712, 724 (1st Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">citing Wulf v. City of Wichita</span>, 883 F.2d 842, 875 (10th Cir. 1989). A complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can suffice to sustain his/her burden in this regard. Nonetheless, the absence of supporting evidence may affect the amount of damages deemed appropriate in specific cases. <span class="Italic">See Lawrence v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that Complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary compensatory damages, however the Agency argues that the AJ's award of $150,000 is "excessive and inconsistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases." Specifically, the Agency identifies prior non-pecuniary damages awards where the complainant obtained medical treatment, including hospitalization and psychiatric care as evidence of complainants suffering more "severe" harm than Complainant yet receiving less compensation. The Agency also notes that unlike some of the prior complainants to receive awards of $150,000, Complainant remained employed after his non-selection, and, while they had marriage troubles resulting from his emotional distress caused by the non-selection, ultimately Complainant and his wife did not get a divorce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the AJ's compensatory damages award is supported by the substantial evidence of the record and is consistent with case precedent. We have previously awarded $150,000 in non-pecuniary damages for emotional distress without documentary evidence of medical treatment or diagnosis. <span class="Italic">See Franklin v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A00025; 01A03882 (Jan. 19, 2001) ($150,000 for emotional distress and caused by denial of reasonable accommodation, despite lack of diagnosis of documentation testimony by Complainant, his friends, and family, including testimony of his wife on the break-up of their marriage, established that the agency's action caused complainant to become depressed, which affected his relationships and his personality, and decreased his enjoyment of life, and experienced humiliation at not being able to find a comparable job which caused him such shame and despair that interaction with his family became strained); <span class="Italic">Goodridge v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720050026 (Nov. 15, 2006); <span class="Italic">Estate of Nason v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A01563 (Jun. 21, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ explains that in this case, $150,000 was warranted because Complainant's distress was severe, noting that he contemplated ending his life and that the manifestations of his emotional distress nearly resulted in the dissolution of a 35-year marriage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly, the AJ took into consideration that Complainant had no prior medical condition or pre-existing marital problems, and had not experienced the mood swings, depression and high blood pressure until his non-selection. <span class="Italic">See Booker v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A00023 (Aug. 10, 2000) (decreasing award of $195,000 to $150,000 in non-pecuniary damages where, based on credible testimony from Complainant, his brother, and coworker, the AJ determined that as a result of agency's actions, complainant experienced severe depression, increased alcohol consumption, three suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization, and a troubled home life, taking into account preexisting conditions and personal problems). In assessing severity, the AJ also considered the prolonged nature and impact of the emotional distress. <span class="Italic">See Emiko S. v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120161130 (Jul. 19, 2016) (increasing non-pecuniary damages from $50,000 to $150,000 where the denial of reasonable accommodation resulted in the complainant not receiving a position for which she had been conditionally selected, causing her to suffer severe, long-term emotional, social, and financial hardship, including loss of enjoyment of life and damage to her relationships over seven years) (citing <span class="Italic">Franklin</span> and <span class="Italic">Booker</span>); <span class="Italic">Furch v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40094 (Aug. 5, 2005) ($150,000 in non-selection case where complainant suffered from depression, loss of enjoyment of life, interference with family relationships, "permanent diminishment in quality of life" and physical symptoms); <span class="Italic">see also Russel v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720110025 (Nov. 17, 2011) ($175,000 for emotional distress, without evidence from a health provider or expert, but based on sworn statements from Complainant and her husband, mother, and daughter, that Complainant was formerly a cheerful, outgoing, energetic, and fun-loving person but, because of the Agency's actions, she suffered severe emotional distress and is now quick to anger, moody, depressed, and not trusting of others. Further, the AJ found that Complainant was "forever changed" by this ordeal and that, therefore, some of her symptoms may persist indefinitely.) We find the record evidence and the AJ's explanations support an award of $150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission specifically rejected an agency argument that the duration of the harm was not adequate to sustain an award of $150,000 in damages by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Estate of James R. Roop v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090056 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we turn to the Agency's appeal of the AJ's award of $150,000 in compensatory damages. We note that it does not challenge Complainant's alleged harm nor the evidence offered in support of his claim for damages. Rather, the Agency disputes the AJ's award based on the duration of complainant's losses. The Agency reasons that Complainant was harmed for a two year period and in prior Commission cases of similar duration a much lower award (i.e. $25,000) was granted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The amount awarded should reflect the extent to which the Agency's discriminatory action directly or proximately caused harm to the complainant and the extent to which other factors may have played a part. EEOC Notice No. N 915.002, Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (July 14, 1992) (Guidance) at 1112. The amount of non-pecuniary damages should also reflect the <span class="Italic">nature and severity</span> of the harm to the complainant, and the duration or expected duration of the harm (emphasis added), Guidance at 14. While the cases cited by the Agency may be of similar duration, they do not share the severity of the harm suffered by Complainant. For example, in <span class="Italic">Beck v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal 01283326 (March 30, 2000), the Agency noted that the complainant in that case suffered from fatigue, appetite disturbance, and impaired concentration. In the instant case, the Complainant attempted suicide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ cited to the record extensively in detailing the harm to Complainant. For example, Complainant lost twenty pounds, could not keep food down, and had episodes of vomiting. His emotional and mental anguish was also exacerbated by the severe financial hardship resulting from the Agency's actions. Complainant and his family had no income for a time, forcing them to seek food from social organizations, not heat their home in the winter, and go without prescription medications. Feeling that his family would be better off without him, Complainant intentionally overdosed on high blood pressure medication in an effort to cause a heart attack and end his life.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $150,000 was also considered appropriate by the Commission in a case where the complainant was subjected to racial harassment and termination. In <span class="Italic">Brown-Fleming v. Attorney General</span>, 0120082667 (2010), the Commission found that even with preexisting conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency's discriminatory termination was the proximate cause of her emotional and physical problems. Specifically, the record shows that Complainant suffered from depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, disassociation, crying spells, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, short-term memory loss, nightmares, panic, worsening abdominal pain, worsening hypertension, dramatic weight-loss, and worsening psoriasis brought on by stress. Supplemental Investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered some seven years of harassment, the Commission increased an award of $35,000 by the administrative judge to $150,000. In <span class="Italic">Lopez-Rosende v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120102789 (2010), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant provided detailed testimony regarding the effects of the harassment on her life. For instance, Complainant testified that seven years of harassment destroyed her in every way. "I can't concentrate. I can't think. I'm a nervous wreck," Complainant testified. Complainant further testified that the harassment has made it difficult for her to sleep, made her depressed, resulted in nightmares, and caused her to scream and yell at her children. Complainant further testified that the harassment destroyed her friendships because people were tired of hearing her incessantly talk about the harassment, affected her romantic relationships, and made her not want to have "any involvement with people." "And it has just made me feel dirty. I mean, I feel like I've run away <span id="Page_1922"></span>from society and I want to be away from people," Complainant testified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, Complainant testified that she experienced chest pains, sought counseling with an Agency psychologist, went to a physician, and had to take medication for anxiety because of the harassment. Complainant further testified that she was unable to take medication to alleviate the depression and anxiety because it made her ill.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A co-worker (CW1) testified that Complainant "was constantly worried about" the threat of the harasser coming into her work area and harassing her and told CW1 on several occasions that she was scared of the harasser. "I had to help her out of the building before because she was so stressed out from it that she was weak and feeling dizzy," CW1 testified. Another co-worker (CW2) testified that Complainant was "distraught" and "extremely upset" because she was continuously subjected to harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the review of the evidence, we find that the AJ's award of $35,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages is inconsistent the record in this case and contrary to what the Commission has awarded in cases where complainants have suffered emotional harm that is similar in severity and duration to the emotional harm complainant suffered in the instant case. Complainant, CW1, and CW2 provided ample compelling testimony that Complainant suffered extreme, prolonged emotional distress and harm because of the Agency's seven-year failure to promptly and effectively address the harassment. Further, as noted by the AJ, "[T]he cumulative effect of Agency managers' callousness and retaliation on Complainant's psyche" extended well beyond the workplace into every facet of Complainant's life, including church, friendships, therapy sessions, and romantic relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where victims of discrimination suffered harm that was of similar degree and duration to that suffered by Complainant, the Commission has awarded non-pecuniary compensatory damages that ranged from $100,000 to $200,000. <span class="Italic">See Glockner v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30105 (Sept. 23, 2004) ($200,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where complainant was subjected to harm for five years and she suffered humiliation, depression, significant fears, and her professional reputation was damaged); <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Dep't of the Army</span>, Appeal No. 01955684 (Oct. 14, 1998) ($125,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where complainant suffered depression and other emotional and mental disorders, and severe chest and stomach pains, digestive problems, and incidents of shortness of breath due to three years of verbal abuse and sex and age-based discrimination by her supervisor); <span class="Italic">Deidra Brown-Fleming v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667 (Oct. 28, 2010) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant experienced anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, disassociation, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, nightmares, and worsening psoriasis because of retaliation); <span class="Italic">Hendley v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A20977 (May 15, 2003), request for reconsideration dismissed EEOC Request No. 05A30962 (Jan. 14, 2004) ($100,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory awarded where complainant experienced paranoia, insomnia, eating disorders and uncontrollable crying for six years and would required treatment for the rest of her life); <span class="Italic">Franklin v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A00025 (Jan. 19, 2001) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where as a result of the agency's actions, complainant experienced extensive symptoms of emotional distress, resulting in changes in complainant's personality, the ending of his marriage, severe strains in his relationships with those close to him, including his children, and diminished enjoyment of life).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the testimony of Complainant and her co-workers, along with the particular circumstances of this case, compel us to find that an award in the amount of $150,000 is more appropriate in this case. We note that, contrary to the Agency's assertions, medical documentation or medical expert testimony is not always necessary to warrant an award of this amount. <span class="Italic">Franklin v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A00025 and 01A03882 (Jan. 19, 2001) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where, despite lack of medical evidence, testimony of complainant and his wife established that he was withdrawn, depressed, embarrassed, humiliated, lost self esteem, and experienced relationship strains). Consequently, we modify the Agency's final order because the AJ's award of $35,000 non-pecuniary compensatory damages is clearly not supported by substantial evidence. Our award is based on the actual harm experienced which was the result of the Agency's actions, and takes into account the nature, duration, and severity of the harm Complainant experienced as a result of those actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Utt v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720070001 (Mar. 26, 2009).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Coopwood v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120083127 (2012), the Commission increased an agency award of $35,000 to $150,000 where the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment based on race that resulted in her reassignment to another agency facility. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Coopwood</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Emotional Pain and Mental Anguish</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the hostile work environment harassment caused Complainant to suffer severe emotional pain and mental anguish in that she (1) developed severe depression, (2) vomiting in the office, (3) cried uncontrollably, (4) had difficulty concentrating because she felt like crying all the time, (4) experienced frequent panic attacks, (5) feared for her safety after learning about the two nooses, and (6) had nightmares and insomnia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence of severe depression in the record includes the affidavit of Complainant's counselor, who testified that she saw Complainant weekly or bi-weekly for two years, from the start of 2000 to the end of 2001. The counselor averred that Complainant appeared to be extremely depressed, rating 90 out of 95 on the Taylor-Johnson depression scale.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In describing her emotional pain and mental anguish, Complainant averred that during her first week at Knoxville, she vomited in the bathroom due to the tension she felt from her coworkers. She also testified that she left the workplace facility "at least a dozen times" to cry outside or in her car. During those times, she tried to control her inconsolable weeping by repeating to herself, "Don't cry." When this did not work, she took sick leave and went home. She took so much leave to deal with her emotional distress that she eventually had to take leave without pay on many occasions. Because she often felt like crying, she had difficulty focusing and concentrating at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant averred that from 2002 to 2003, she had panic attacks on a weekly basis, sometimes two to three times per day. At least twice on her way to work, she pulled her car over because she was crying uncontrollably, feeling overwhelmed by the panic of having to endure another day of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that she began to fear for her safety (feeling intimidated, scared, and terrified) after she learned about the two nooses in January 2003. Given that she had previously reported that her coworkers had held a lottery to wager how long it would take to get rid of her, Complainant felt increasingly targeted by the display of two nooses, and viewed such actions as an escalation in the threats against her. She became paranoid, obsessively checking her home alarm system, and inspecting her car for signs of damage or tampering with the gas tank. She had nightmares and insomnia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that Complainant could not have feared for her safety after learning about the two nooses because she did not receive a specific threat from a particular coworker or supervisor. The presence of a hangman's noose evokes an image, particularly among African Americans, of extreme racial violence and a direct threat to life. <span class="Italic">Tootle v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40127 (Feb. 21, 2006). Given that unknown persons in Complainant's workplace specifically targeted her twice by displaying an inherently violent symbol, we find it imminently reasonable to conclude that the nooses caused Complainant to fear for her safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Loss of Enjoyment of Life</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The affidavits of Complainant's neighbor and brother indicate that Complainant had been an outgoing, adventuresome, articulate, and confident person, with a wonderful sense of humor. But the hostility she experienced at work made her quiet and withdrawn. She lost her sense of self worth and no longer socialized or volunteered for community service events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Injury to Professional Standing and Reputation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant suffered significant injuries to her professional standing and reputation as an air traffic controller, in that her trainer tried to treat her like a child in front of coworkers by making her do childish tasks, like pointing up and down; her coworkers viewed her as an operational risk and liability; and the Agency portrayed her lack of facility certification as a failure on her part to complete training, rather than as a result of her being subjected to two and a half years of hostile work environment harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her affidavit, Complainant described how a trainer had humiliated and degraded her in front of her coworkers by making her stand in the middle of the tower and having her point to north, south, up, and down. During Complainant's time at Knoxville, the union representative reported several incidents in which her coworkers had questioned Complainant's competence and skill, such as circulating a petition that named Complainant as the "next operation error in this facility." And the Agency indicated in its June 2, 2003 memorandum that the reason why Complainant was being transferred out of Knoxville was because she had failed to successfully complete training there.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Overall, we find that Complainant suffered significant harm to her professional standing among her coworkers and trainers at Knoxville, and significant harm to her professional reputation when the Agency faulted her for not completing facility-specific training in its June 2, 2003 memorandum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Loss of Health</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record includes an April 2001 medical history and physical form, in which Complainant indicated that she had, among other things, difficulty <span id="Page_1923"></span>swallowing, sleeping, and concentrating; was depressed, had memory loss. Although Complainant maintained in her affidavit her belief that the workplace stress exacerbated her difficulties in swallowing and contributed to other health concerns, we find that there is insufficient evidence in the record to suggest that the discriminatory conduct caused or proximately caused the worsening of those physical ailments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency acknowledged in its final decision that the discriminatory harassment caused Complainant's weight to change significantly. We are also persuaded that the stress Complainant experienced while at Knoxville exacerbated her stomach problems: irritable bowel syndrome, stomach pain, loose bowel movements, and diarrhea. In her affidavit, Complainant explained that she had stomach problems from 2000 to 2006, and her neighbor corroborated the existence and seriousness of those stomach and digestive ailments. For example, the neighbor averred that Complainant had been hospitalized for her stomach ailments; she had picked Complainant up from the hospital and helped her recover from the ongoing digestive problems. On some days when Complainant was too sick, the neighbor averred that she would take care of Complainant and fix her evening meals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Commission finds that the discriminatory conduct caused Complainant to experience dramatic changes in her weight, and exacerbated various stomach-related ailments over the course of several years, in addition to the severe depression, anxiety, and insomnia mentioned above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">f <span class="Italic">Amount of Non-Pecuniary Compensatory Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that over the course of several years, Complainant suffered from severe depression, bouts of vomiting in the office, uncontrollable crying spells, difficulty concentrating, frequent panic attacks, fear for her safety; nightmares and insomnia; withdrawal from relationships and social isolation; significant injury to her professional standing and reputation; dramatic weight change; and the worsening of several stomach-related ailments. Given the persistent duration and severity of the emotional, physical, and professional harms she suffered, the Commission finds it appropriate to award Complainant $150,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find this award to be consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases and not "monstrously excessive" or the product of passion or prejudice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brown-Fleming v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667 (Oct. 28, 2010) (awarding $150,000 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who suffered from depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, disassociation, crying spells, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, short-term memory loss, nightmares, panic, worsening abdominal pain, worsening hypertension, dramatic weight-loss, and worsening psoriasis brought on by stress); <span class="Italic">Yasko v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A32340 (Apr. 21, 2004) (awarding complainant $100,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages after being subjected to sexual harassment resulting in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, severe intermittent insomnia, weight gain and stress).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $125,000 by the administrative judge was increased to $150,000 in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Attorney General</span>, 0120122033 (2013), a class action case that resulted in findings of both disparate impact and disparate treatment sex discrimination in selections for foreign assignments and promotions. Note that compensatory damages are not available in cases of disparate impact discrimination but that did not reduce the award where there was an independent finding of disparate treatment or intentional discrimination. In making the award to the class representative in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the entire record, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's finding that CR is entitled to compensatory damages for emotional distress and other non-pecuniary harm. CR established that she was repeatedly subjected to discrimination in foreign assignment opportunities from 1990 to 1992. CR stated that after the repeated non-selections, her emotional distress manifested in anger, frustration, sadness, anxiousness, humiliation, and embarrassment. Submission in Support of Class Agent Ann Garcia's Claim for Individual Relief (IR) at 2. CR stated that she changed for the worse, turned inward, and cut herself off from her coworkers, friends, and family. IR at 13-18. CR stated that she had depression and referred to it as "a form of hell on earth." IR at 2. She described a "psychological meltdown" beginning in 1992, where she was at the "bottom, the depths of depression." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. She stated that the discrimination she encountered undermined her professional accomplishments and produced deep wounds in her life. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. She stated that she was unable to think of anything else, and her relationships with family and friends suffered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CR also suffered from physical manifestations as a result of the discrimination. CR stated that beginning in 1992 she began to suffer from severe gastro-intestinal problems. IR at 4. Despite medical procedures in 1995 and 2000, CR continued to suffer from these problems. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6. CR stated that even after her retirement in 2008, she would have severe stomach episodes whenever she was confronted with strong reminders of the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. CR also suffered from lack of sleep, fatigue, migraines, and frequent crying. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 7, 21. Further, CR experienced hair loss, which caused her a great deal of embarrassment and self-consciousness in her appearance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One of CR's coworkers testified that she noticed a dramatic change in CR after the discrimination, and CR's focus on the discrimination took over her personality. IR, Exhibit 4. She stated that CR's body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice all manifested her anger, frustration, bitterness, and confusion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. She stated that CR appeared very sad, disheartened, and depressed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Another coworker testified that after the discrimination CR was no longer fun to be around, and all she would talk about was her work problems. IR, Exhibit 5. She stated that CR was no longer enthusiastic or happy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CR's mother testified that CR had an obvious change in personality after the discrimination, and she was very anxious, frustrated, worried, and happy. IR, Exhibit 3. She said that the happy person CR used to be went away. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CR's husband stated that at home CR would only talk about her situation at work and the ongoing effects of the discrimination. IR, Exhibit 2. He stated that CR was obsessed with her problems at work and it was making her absolutely miserable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. He stated that the discrimination was particularly damaging on their marriage, and their interactions were one sided and always about her work problems. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. CR's husband stated that because of these issues, they were on the brink of formal separation many times. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the record reveals that CR endured pain, suffering, anxiety and depression for more than nineteen years. Specifically, CR stated that her condition only improved when she retired in May 2008, and even after retirement she has the same awful feelings when she is reminded of the discrimination. IR at 3. The record also reflects that CR continued to have physical manifestations when reminded of the discrimination in the form of severe stomach episodes even after her retirement in 2008. The record does not support the Agency's assertion that the non-pecuniary damages should be limited to the class period of 1990-1992, as the record establishes that the harm Complainant suffered as a result of the discrimination lasted at least until the time of the hearing. <span class="Italic">See Fonda-Wall v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal Number 0720060035 (July 28, 2009) (Complainant established that her harm continued even after the harassment stopped, and the long term and continuing impact of the Agency's actions were evident during the hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Neville v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720110023 (2013), the Commission increased an award of $92,500 to $150,000 where the assignment of full duties instead of light duty resulted in physical as well as emotional injuries. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Neville</span> described the harm:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant suffered physical harm as a result of the Agency's discrimination. Specifically, because the supervisor assigned her full duty work instead of light duty work because of her gender, Complainant severely injured her back and knees and suffered extreme long-term pain. At the time of the hearing in 2010, almost three years after the injury, Complainant continued to experience significant pain, particularly in her back. Complainant could not sit down without experiencing numbness in her arms and legs, and she had a constant burning sensation in her back. Complainant had trouble sitting through even one day of the hearing without experiencing extreme pain and discomfort. The AJ found Complainant's testimony credible when she stated that she had been living in severe pain with little to no improvement since her injury. Complainant's doctor told her that she had reached maximum medical improvement, and the AJ was persuaded that Complainant will continue to experience significant pain and physical limitations for an indeterminate amount of time in the future. The AJ also found that Complainant's current pain is not from a pre-existing condition, because Complainant was well on her way to recovery from her surgery when she was injured on the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also suffered emotional harm as a result of the Agency's discrimination. The AJ found that "the effects of Complainant's injury on her personal life and emotional well-being cannot be overstated." Complainant testified that she developed anxiety attacks and as a result now has a service dog accompany her in order to make her feel less vulnerable when she ventures out of the house. Complainant lost self confidence, lost her independence, and saw herself become a burden to those around her as she depended on others to clean her house and bring her food, Eventually, Complainant's friend and children who were living with her moved out of the house because the burden of them having to do everything around the house was too much for them. Complainant's relationships with family and friends deteriorated, she was no longer a social person, and she testified that since the discrimination her world consisted of her house and her dogs, and she stated "I have no life." Complainant believed her future was hopeless. She stated that she took great pride in her job and in her dedication to serve her country, and since she cannot work anymore and had to take a medical retirement <span id="Page_1924"></span>she feels like she is not productive, is not responsible, and can no longer contribute to society.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2008 Complainant was diagnosed with depression and was referred to a psychiatrist. Complainant began taking prescribed anti-depressant, anti-anxiety, and anti-pain medications. The medication made her sleepy and interfered with her ability to drive, which resulted in her rarely leaving the house. After her injury, because Complainant could no longer bend, lift, or squat, she stopped participating in her business of breeding, grooming, and training dogs, which was an activity that she was passionate about and was very successful at doing. The AJ found that "Complainant's world was substantially diminished and narrowed, and she experienced significant distress and great loss of enjoyment of her life."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's friend testified that she and her children lived with Complainant for many years, and before her injury Complainant was very active and social. However, after her injury Complainant changed drastically and "was a shell of the woman she use to be" and she "hardly looked anybody in the eye." She testified that Complainant became withdrawn, her personality changed, her temperament changed, and she began to have anxiety attacks and required the assistance of a service dog. Complainant's friend testified that Complainant became homebound, secluded, and her interpersonal relationships deteriorated. She testified that Complainant withdrew from all of the things that she cared about after the injury. She testified that Complainant could no longer take care of the house, the property, or even prepare a meal for herself. Her friend had to take on extra jobs to help financially support them, which caused stress on their relationship. Ultimately her friend and her friend's children moved out of the house because of the burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find an award of $150,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Lemons v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102516 (November 16, 2011) (Complainant was awarded $175,000 for non-pecuniary damages where discrimination caused physical injury and emotional harm that lasted for many years, including neck and back pain, depression, severe anxiety, a fear of leaving the house, and strained relationships); <span class="Italic">Franklin v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A00025 and 01A03882 (Jan. 19, 2001) (Complainant was awarded $150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where testimony of Complainant and his wife established that he was withdrawn, depressed, embarrassed, humiliated, lost self esteem, and he experienced financial difficulties, emotional distress, personality changes, and severe strain on relationships); and <span class="Italic">Goodridge v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050026 (Nov, 15, 2006) (Complainant was awarded $150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where testimony of Complainant's family and friends established that the hostile work environment caused Complainant to be withdrawn socially, suffer anxiety and depression, he had difficulty maintaining relationships, he lost enjoyment of life, he had a diminished quality of life, and he displayed physical symptoms). Accordingly, we conclude that an award of $150,000 will adequately compensate Complainant for the physical and emotional harm she suffered as a result of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $150,000 to a class agent in a sex discrimination case where the effects of the discrimination continued for some 19 years. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0520130561 (2014), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that much of the distress was the result of the complainant's role as class agent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that the appellate decision erred in awarding CA compensatory damages for the time between her 1993 complaint of discrimination and the 2009 hearing. Specifically, the Agency asserted that there was no basis to support the finding that CA suffered from the effects of the 1990-1992 discrimination for more than 19 years and that, to the extent CA continued to suffer pain and distress, it derived from her stressful role as a class agent, for which she was not entitled to compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the Agency failed to demonstrate clear error. Citing CA's affidavit, the appellate decision found that CA suffered emotional harm (pain, suffering, anxiety, depression) and physical harm (severe gastro-intestinal problems) for more than 19 years--from 1990 until (at least) the time of the hearing--as a result of the Agency's discriminatory actions. Complainant testified in her May 2011 affidavit to the continuing nature of the harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The discrimination I experienced at DEA cast my life into a form of hell on earth... In truth, this was the most depressing period of my life, and it improved only when I retired in May 2008.... By the time of my retirement in May 2008, I was finally able to move away quickly from the stress and anxiety that pervaded my life. But I still am not over it. The depression, anger, and frustration are just below the surface, and many times a thought or memory will remind me all over again what DEA did to me. That is when all those miserable feelings flood back over me again. "Time heals"--I believe that. But my wounds are not healed yet.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency, in its request for reconsideration, failed to identify anything in CA's affidavit where CA clearly attributed the harm to her prosecution of the class complaint. The Agency's mere speculation on this matter is insufficient to show clear error.</p>
<p class="noindent">Two years of harassment and a failure to accommodate led the Commission to increase an agency award of $13,000 in damages to $150,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141161 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant had requested that the Agency provide him with $175,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages. In our previous decision, we found that Complainant was subjected to harassment nearly every day for almost two and a half years. We note, significantly, that the constant harassment was perpetrated not only by co-workers, but also by management officials, who should have been the ones preventing workplace harassment. In addition, Complainant was sought reasonable accommodation that would allow him to use his hearing amplifier in the workplace without disrupting his co-workers. The Agency failed to do so. Complainant provided an affidavit along with his family members in support of his claim for pecuniary damages. Based on the evidence provided by Complainant and the Agency's supplemental investigation, we determine that Complainant experienced embarrassment, humiliation, panic attacks, anxiety, withdrawal from co-workers and family, and sleeping problems. His wife provided an affidavit supporting Complainant's statements about how the discrimination affected him. She noted that he would withdraw from the family in order to prepare for the "torture to come." She also indicated that Complainant would fill in for a manager in the workplace. However, she stated that Complainant began to reject the temporary manager assignment because he felt that assignment exposed him to further "torture." Complainant's wife also averred that although the harassment stopped in August 2011, he still experienced the negative effects in October 2013, when she provided the affidavit. Based on the evidence in the supplemental investigation, we find the Agency's award of $13,000.00 to be insufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, based on our review of the evidence in the record and based upon Commission precedent, we find that Complainant is entitled to $150,000.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages. This amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent.</p>
