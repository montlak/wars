<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-51"><span class="space">1.</span> Commission Interpretation of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Hicks</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">For several months after the <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> decision, the Commission appeared to ignore it. Without any comment on the decision, or whether it required any change in its own position, in <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01933274 (1993), the Commission cited <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>. The Commission simply noted "appellant bears the burden of establishing that the agency's articulated reasons are a pretext for discrimination. Appellant can do this by showing that a discriminatory reason motivated the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> By and large, the Commission routinely cited <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> for the proposition that a complainant can prove pretext by showing "that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the [agency] official or by proving that the stated reasons are unworthy of credence." <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Byler v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01923010 (1993). Pretext can be shown where the complainant is qualified to perform a position at a higher grade level than the selectee and the selection is based on different assumptions about the respective qualities of the candidates without any factual basis for making the assumptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is error, under <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, for the administrative judge to determine that the complainant has not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and then go on to hold that the agency's reasons are pretextual. Once the complainant fails to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the inquiry ends. <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Attorney General</span>, 07A20008 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In one early case, <span class="Italic">Guyton v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01931099 (1993), the Commission explained how a disbelief of the agency's proffered reasons, along with the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, could result in a finding of discrimination under <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not support the agency's stated reason that the selectee is more qualified for the position than appellant. The record does not demonstrate that (a) the selectee has industrial carpentry experience as iterated by the SO, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the selectee does not describe the use of the procedures and tools listed by the SO, (b) the selectee has the greater breadth of experience and independence between the two, and (c) the appellant lacks carpentry experience in the industrial sector. The selectee's description of his carpentry experience shows that he acted in an assistant capacity, while appellant often served as a task leader or performed the work himself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SO and his subordinates could not specifically point to qualities that rendered the selectee the better choice or support the SO's claim that appellant's experience lay primarily in residential building. The SO was more critical of the appellant, e.g., noting that his skill with stair treads was not useful, but not making the same observation of the selectee, who also listed experience in installing stair treads. Further, both the selectee and the appellant had experience in residential construction and past experience in the military. The record shows, however, that the appellant had the greater and more recent training and experience, while the selectee's only recent activity was in assisting the carpentry unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note the selection panel's determination that appellant ranked significantly higher than the selectee and among the highest ranked candidates. While the panel's information on all the candidates is not contained in the file, we know that the selectee and four other candidates scored 20 points, while appellant and two others scored between 28 and 30 points, accounting for all but three of the candidates. The fact that appellant's score was so much higher than the selectee and among the highest raises considerable questions concerning the final selection process. The two subject matter experts, employees of the Engineering Service, considered appellant (and at least two others) much the superior candidate to the selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The panel's rating, coupled with the agency's inability to articulate the specific qualities that directed the choice of the selectee over appellant, result in our disbelief of the agency's stated reasons for appellant's nonselection. This, in conjunction with the elements of appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, lead us to conclude that the agency engaged in intentional discrimination, and we so find<span class="Italic">. See Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2749.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a series of cases in 1994, the Commission clearly held that <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> did not mean that pretext was insufficient, as a matter of law, to carry the complainant's ultimate burden of proof. In <span class="Italic">Daly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933546 (1994), the Commission rejected an agency argument that the complainant had not met his burden of proving discrimination by demonstrating the selecting official's explanation was unworthy of credence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency asserted that casting doubt on the SO's explanation is insufficient evidence to demonstrate intentional discrimination, a recent Supreme Court decision suggests otherwise. <span class="Italic">See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749 (1993) (when an employer's articulated reason is shown to be untrue, a finding of liability for intentional discrimination is permissible, even though it is not compelled as a matter of law). In this regard, we recently found discrimination in a case premised merely on the determination that the agency's reasons were not worthy of credence<span class="Italic">. See Abdo v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920685 (June 29, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Papas v. Postmaster General</span>, 01923753 (1994), the Commission further clarified its current position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to prevail, appellant must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's reasons were a pretext for discrimination<span class="Italic">. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 256. At all times, appellant retains the ultimate burden of persuasion, and it is her obligation to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency acted on the basis of a prohibited reason<span class="Italic">. St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749 (1993), <span class="Italic">citing U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983) and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 256. In this regard, disbelief of the reasons put forward by an employer, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, may suffice to show intentional discrimination<span class="Italic">. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2749.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that appellant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's reasons for issuing the removal notice were pretexts for retaliation. We note at the outset that while we have found herein that appellant was unable to perform the essential functions of her position, the Acting Supervisor (who signed appellant's removal notice) explicitly stated that prior to appellant's removal she did not consider appellant disabled because appellant was "perfectly capable" of performing her job duties. We find that the agency's stated reasons for removing appellant are simply not supported by the evidence, and are therefore not worthy of credence. The Acting Supervisor admits in her affidavit that prior to the effective date of appellant's removal, acceptable medical documentation was, in fact, provided by appellant for the period that she was on AWOL status. That this medical documentation was acceptable is further shown by the fact that the Acting Supervisor marked each of appellant's leave slips for the entire AWOL period as "approved." Although there is a period of absences for which there are no premedical clearance return to work forms, there is other medical documentation in the record for this period that clearly shows appellant's inability to work, including an October 16, 1990 letter from appellant's psychologist and an October 18, 1990 letter from appellant's neurologist. Moreover, appellant's leave slips for this period are, likewise, marked "approved." In the face of such substantial medical documentation, we find that the agency officials' sweeping statements about appellant's failure to provide any medical documentation for her absences evidence an intent to discharge appellant regardless of the documentation actually submitted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, documentation in the record shows that rather than avoiding contact with the agency during this period, as the agency claimed appellant had in its notice of removal, appellant allowed agency officials into her home so that she could sign leave slips and wrote to agency officials expressing her willingness to comply with their requests. Appellant also, during the period of her absence, provided to agency officials a form granting consent to have her medical records sent to them. Additionally, there is no evidence that appellant failed to report for two appointments with the Postmaster. Rather, the record shows that appellant canceled one appointment due to her illness. The record lacks information regarding another appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we find that the reasons cited by the agency in support of appellant's removal lack credence. This finding, in conjunction with the involvement of both responsible officials in appellant's prior sexual harassment complaint, (footnote omitted) supports a conclusion that appellant was subjected to unlawful retaliation for prior EEO activity<span class="Italic">. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2749. Accordingly, we find that appellant established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency's reasons for removing her were pretexts for unlawful retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a number of cases, the Commission has focused on language in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> to <span id="Page_728"></span>the effect that it is not sufficient for the factfinder to disbelieve the employer's proffered reason; the factfinder must "believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Bradford v. Secretary of Defense, DLA</span>, 01940712 (1994) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 2749). By the same token, in these cases, the Commission appears to interpret the language in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> to require only that the factfinder believe the agency's explanation is pretextual. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bradford</span>, after quoting the language in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the Commission specifically found that the complainant had not persuaded it that the agency's reasons were pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent">The most important factor in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is that the factfinder must believe the complainant has been the victim of intentional discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Montoya v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01940999 (1994), the Commission noted that whether that belief can be premised on a showing of pretext, standing alone, is an issue that must, of necessity, be decided on a case-by-case basis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At this point, appellant bears the burden of establishing that the agency's articulated reasons are a pretext for discrimination. Appellant can do this by showing that a discriminatory reason motivated the agency<span class="Italic">. St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993). In <span class="Italic">St. Mary's</span>, the Court held that a fact finder is not required, as a matter of law, to find discrimination whenever it finds that the employer's explanation for its actions is not credible. The Court further made clear that a fact finder may find discrimination in such circumstances. The critical factor is that a fact finder must be persuaded by the complainant that it was discrimination that motivated the employer to act as it did<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2749. It is not sufficient, the Court stated, "to disbelieve the employer; the fact finder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 2754.</p>
<p class="noindent">As applied by the Commission, <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> does not require a showing of motive to be established through direct evidence demonstrating the motive of the alleged discriminating official. Like pretext, motive can be established by circumstantial evidence. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mihalakelis v. Attorney General</span>, 01944792 (1996), the Commission found that, in addition to establishing pretext, the complainant had demonstrated that his EEO history was well known by the selecting official. He further showed that, although three positions were advertised, the selecting official filled only two of the positions. The Commission reasoned that it appeared the selecting official wanted to "avoid selecting someone he believed to be a 'troublemaker.'" This additional circumstantial evidence was enough so that not only did the factfinder disbelieve the agency, the factfinder also believed the complainant's explanation that he was not selected because of prior EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in a very curious decision that does not cite <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the Commission found that the complainant did not prove discrimination, even though the agency failed to articulate a legitimate reason for its actions. In <span class="Italic">Hammons v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01955704 (1997), the Commission found that the complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and the agency failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscrimination reason for its actions. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hammons</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ppellant has initially demonstrated a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of racial discrimination, as she is a member of a protected class of persons (Black), she has been subjected to adverse employment actions having to do with work assignments, working conditions and leave, and a similarly situated employee (SSE) not of appellant's group (Hispanic/White) has been treated more favorably by the RMO (Black) under similar circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must now articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. To that end, we find the RMO's testimony not credible. For example, while the RMO maintains that she did not recall giving field assignments on the same day closure was due, testimony from neutral employees indicates that this occurred often. Also, while the RMO attempted to minimize her relationship with the SSE, other credible testimony indicated that the RMO and the SSE were friends, which resulted in the SSE receiving favorable treatment to the detriment of appellant and the other employees. The SSE also contradicted the RMO by testifying that she and the RMO were personal friends who had been friends prior to the RMO becoming a supervisor. Although the SSE denied that she was being treated favorably, the balance of the evidence indicates otherwise. We find that the RMO's testimony was evasive and contradicted by other more credible testimony. Consequently, the RMO's credibility is undermined and we choose to disregard her testimony. We, therefore, conclude that the agency has failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, appellant, having the ultimate burden of proving discrimination, has failed to show that the RMO's actions were motivated by discriminatory animus. The credible evidence clearly indicates that any favorable treatment received by the SSE was occasioned by her friendship with the RMO and not the result of appellant's race.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem is that even <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> states quite clearly that an employer will lose when, in response to a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, it fails to articulate a legitimate reason. Under <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case establishes a rebuttable presumption of discrimination that disappears when a legitimate reason is advanced. But in the absence of a legitimate reason, the presumption entitles the employee to judgment. The <span class="Italic">Hammons</span> decision, which is brief and short on legal analysis, makes it unclear whether the Commission continues to subscribe to the premise that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is sufficient to establish discrimination in the absence of an employer asserting a legitimate reason. In all likelihood, <span class="Italic">Hammons</span> is merely a case where the Commission has misapplied the law and does not signal any change in the Commission's interpretation of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dukart v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956135 (1997) (upholding finding of reprisal where complainant presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and agency failed to produce a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McCoy v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01956826 (1997), the Commission reiterated its interpretation that a finding of discrimination can be based on a showing of pretext, and noted that this is the majority interpretation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the agency, citing <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993), contends that the AJ erred in his ultimate finding in this case because a conclusion that discrimination has occurred cannot be drawn solely from "the much different and much lesser finding that the employer's explanation of its action was not believable." The Commission finds that the agency misunderstands the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The vast majority of the circuit courts have interpreted <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, like the AJ in the instant matter, to mean that evidence sufficient to discredit an employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, taken together with the complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, may be sufficient to support a finding of discrimination<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., EEOC v. Ethan Allen, Inc.</span>, 44 F.3d 116, 120 (2d Cir. 1994) ("A finding of pretextuality allows a juror to reject a defendant's proffered reasons for a challenged employment action and thus permits the ultimate inference of discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours &#x0026; Co.</span>, 100 F.3d 1061, 1066-67 (3d Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("[T]he elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and disbelief of the defendant's proffered reasons are the threshold findings, beyond which the jury is permitted, but not required, to draw an inference leading it to conclude that there was intentional discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Data Gen. Corp</span>., 12 F.3d 1310, 1316 (4th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chems. Co.,</span> 29 F.3d 1078, 1083 (6th Cir. 1994) ("[T]he only effect of the employer's nondiscriminatory explanation is to convert the inference of discrimination based upon the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case from a mandatory one which the jury must draw, to a permissive one the jury may draw, provided that the jury finds the employer's explanation 'unworthy' of belief."); <span class="Italic">Perdomo v. Browner</span>, 67 F.3d 140, 146 (7th Cir. 1995) ("The district court found Perdomo's [direct] evidence of racial discrimination unpersuasive, but. . .such evidence is not required; the trier of fact is permitted to infer discrimination from a finding that the employer's proffered reason was spurious."); <span class="Italic">Gaworski v. ITT Commercial Fin. Corp</span>., 17 F.3d 1104, 1110 (8th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 115 S. Ct. 355 (1994) ("The elements of the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case are thus present and the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to reject the defendant's non-discriminatory explanations. The 'ultimate question' of discrimination must therefore be left to the trier of fact to decide."); <span class="Italic">Washington v. Garrett</span>, 10 F.3d 1421, 1433 (9th Cir. 1993) ("If a plaintiff succeeds in raising a genuine factual issue regarding the authenticity of the employer's stated motive, summary judgment is inappropriate, because it is for the trier of fact to decide which story is to be believed."); <span class="Italic">Combs v. Plantation Patterns,</span> (11th Cir. 1997) (". . .we have interpreted it [<span class="Italic">Hicks</span>] to mean that evidence sufficient to discredit a defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, taken together with the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, is sufficient to support (but not require) a finding of discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Barbour v. Merrill</span>, 48 F.3d 1270, 1277 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("According to<span class="Italic"> Hicks,</span> a plaintiff need only establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and introduce evidence sufficient to discredit the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons; at that point, the factfinder, if so persuaded, may infer discrimination.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Moore v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12397 (2002), the Commission found discrimination where the agency asserted it had not selected the complainant for an acting supervisor position because of his poor attendance. Although the agency submitted evidence of the complainant's attendance, the Commission found the record did not, on its face, demonstrate poor attendance and the agency submitted no evidence on the attendance of other selectees. "Since the agency failed to rebut complainant's claim concerning his supervisor's statement that 'things would be different' if he withdrew his EEO complaints and because there is simply no un-controverted, independent evidence to establish that management was not motivated by retaliatory animus, we find that complainant proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency retaliated against him for his prior participation in the EEO process." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Pretext always has consisted of two distinct prongs, though the tendency too often is to regard them as one prong. Pretext can be one of two things: the complainant can demonstrate that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the agency, or that the agency's proffered explanation is not credible. <span class="Italic">See Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 253. The distinction can be subtle, yet significant. For example, it is entirely possible for the employer to articulate a reason for its actions that is true but is not the real reason the employer acted. <span id="Page_729"></span>That scenario is different from the employer who advances a reason which is untrue.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the latter situation, the complainant's evidence will be directed to disproving the reason. If, for example, in a selection case, the agency contends it selected the best qualified candidate, the complainant will try to prove that the selectee is, in fact, not the best qualified candidate. Assuming the complainant succeeds, that still may leave the complainant with a <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> problem. That is, even though the complainant has discredited the employer's reason, he still may have to convince the factfinder that discrimination motivated the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the former situation, the complainant's evidence will not be directed to trying to disprove what is true. Rather, it will be directed to trying to demonstrate the real motivation of the employer. Because the evidence is directed at the employer's motivation, there is no <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> problem.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Koch v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01945546 (1996), the complainant did not dispute that her performance was unsatisfactory. Instead, she focused on how similarly situated employees with unsatisfactory performance were treated. In <span class="Italic">Koch</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for placing appellant in remedial training<span class="Italic">. See Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 253. Specifically, agency officials testified that appellant was given remedial training because she was evaluated as unsatisfactory for the briefings she gave on April 28, 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to establish that the agency's articulated reason is pretextual, appellant must either show that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the agency or that the agency's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence<span class="Italic">. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 253. We find that appellant has shown that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated RO 2 in his decision to place appellant in remedial training. Although appellant does not dispute that her briefings were less than satisfactory, the record is replete with evidence concerning RO 2's inability to get along with women employees in general, and appellant in particular. The record also indicates that remedial training was not necessary to correct the problem: refresher training or a discussion of appellant's shortcomings, as was done in the Comparative's case, could have been used to address the situation. Furthermore, we note that when RO 2 was questioned about why the Comparative did not receive remedial training, his answers were evasive and he admitted that he did not know why the Comparative was treated differently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, however, that it is not sufficient "to disbelieve the employer; the fact finder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2754. We find that appellant has met this burden; the agency's failure to provide any training to the Comparative or to discuss appellant's shortcomings with her prior to placing her in remedial training, coupled with RO 2's egregious treatment of appellant, leads us to conclude that RO 2 intentionally discriminated against appellant because of her sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem is that even the Commission does not acknowledge that although it analyzes both the pretext and <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> elements separately, it uses the exact same evidence to support its findings. In reality, the Commission should acknowledge that, as a matter of law, if a complainant succeeds in demonstrating the first prong of <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer--then addressing <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is unnecessary. An examination of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> only becomes necessary when the second prong of <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> is invoked.</p>
<p class="noindent">The impact of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> still is very difficult to qualify in terms of individual cases. As noted, the Commission held, on numerous previous occasions, that "[d]isbelief of the reasons put forward by the employer, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, may suffice to show intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Canady v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01940947 (1994), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2749. Clearly, there remain cases where the showing of pretext is so strong that it results in an inference of discrimination even in the absence of any affirmative proof of motive. However, there are other cases where the showing of pretext will not suffice. In the final analysis, it may well be that the significance of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is to refocus the courts and the Commission on the oriGINAl holding of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> that a person claiming discrimination "must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence <span class="Italic">that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision."</span> (emphasis added) In other words, a complainant must make some showing that the agency's proffered reasons are pretext for discrimination, and not merely a pretext to cover-up some other reason for its actions. Most likely the other reasons would relate, as in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, to personal animosity between the employee and the supervisor that is not grounded in discriminatory intent.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Finklea v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940134 (1994), the Commission specifically rejected an agency attack on a finding of discrimination based on <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>. The agency argued that a finding of pretext could not support an ultimate finding of discrimination and the Commission erred when, once it found pretext, it revisited the elements of the complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to additionally support its finding of discrimination. The Commission held that the agency misinterpreted <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> and noted "the Court expressly held that once the trier of fact rejects the employer's proffered reasons, no additional proof is required." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In any event, the Commission noted it found discrimination based on a finding of pretext "coupled with evidence of the comparatively unfavorable treatment of appellant <span class="Italic">vis a vis</span> two similarly situated white coworkers."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There still is no clear-cut guidance on how <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> applies when the factfinder determines that an agency's articulated reason is pretextual. But, in <span class="Italic">Madrigal v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01941490 (1995), the Commission did provide some additional insight. In <span class="Italic">Madrigal</span>, the Commission found the supervisor's reason for terminating the complainant was not credible, but also found no discrimination because of the supervisor's treatment of similarly situated employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that appellant has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence of record, that the agency's articulated reasons are unworthy of credence. However, we are not convinced that the RO, in acting as he did, did so based on appellant's national origin. Pursuant to the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Hicks, supra</span>, a fact-finder is not required, as a matter of law, to find discrimination whenever it finds that an employer's explanation for its action(s) is not credible. While discrimination may be found in such a situation, the Court emphasized that the fact finder must be persuaded that it was discrimination that motivated the employer to act as it did. In this case, although appellant was treated differently than the other employees supervised by the RO, the majority of these employees were, like appellant, Hispanic. As we noted earlier, this suggests that national origin was not the basis for the RO's actions. Although appellant asserts that the RO disciplines minorities more readily than he disciplines Caucasians, no concrete example of such disparity in treatment was cited. Conversely, the one example cited where Hispanics and Caucasians were involved in committing the same offense resulted in the two Caucasians receiving harsher discipline than the three Hispanics. For these reasons, we agree with the AJ's conclusion, and find appellant has not met his ultimate burden of showing that he was discriminated against based on his national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hinton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942629 (1995) (finding that the agency's reasons were pretextual, but not discriminatory, because others outside of the complainant's protected group were also given letters of warning).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Clegg v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01954431 (1997), the Commission found pretext where the selecting official stated that he relied on the interview for his selection, but the selectee had only the third highest interview score. However, the Commission did not base its finding of discrimination in <span class="Italic">Clegg</span> solely on its determination that the proffered reason was false. The Commission further concluded that the selection was influenced by a memorandum circulated at that time reminding supervisors of the agency's affirmative action program. Whatever the legal ramifications of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> and the Commission's interpretation of the case, <span class="Italic">Clegg</span> provides a good example of the practical realities of proving a case of intentional discrimination: attacking the credibility of the responsible management official, without providing some explanation of why such official would be untruthful does not make a great deal of sense. The Commission's analysis in <span class="Italic">Clegg</span> demonstrates how a complainant can combine credibility evidence with other evidence that provides a sensible explanation of the agency official's actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the Selecting Official's stated reasons for selecting the Selectee are unworthy of belief and are a pretext for discrimination. The Selecting Official claimed that the interviews were the critical distinguishing factor for the selection decision among the four interviewees and that the ability to accept change, as shown in the interviews, was the critical part of the interview. The Selecting Official has not reconciled his statement in his affidavit that the Selectee was the candidate who was most capable of accommodating change, with his selection recommendation of Male Applicant 1 for the position. In the Referral and Selection Register dated August 9, 1993, the Selecting Official recommended Male Applicant 1 for selection in part because of "the ability conveyed to visualize future changes as they occur into the accomplishment of the mission." Furthermore, the Selecting Official ranked the Selectee as having only the third highest interview score. The second highest interview score was held by Male Applicant 2. If the Selecting Official really believed that the interview was the critical factor, then he would have not recommended the Selectee. The Selecting Official has not reconciled his reliance on the interview for selecting the Selectee with his scoring of the interviews wherein the Selectee had the third highest score.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Selecting Official likely changed his recommended selection from Male Applicant 1 (who had the highest interview score) to the Selectee because of the September 14, 1993 memorandum from the Colonel, GS, Deputy Commander requesting the Selecting Official to reconsider the tentative selection in "view" of the KSA scores and the "affirmative action" considerations. On September 20, 1993, six days after the September 14, 1993 memorandum, the Selecting Official changed his selection decision and recommended the Selectee <span id="Page_730"></span>for the position. There is no indication in the record that any additional factors or documentation or interviews were considered between the initial decision to recommend Male Applicant 1 for the position and the subsequent decision to recommend the Selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Selecting Official does not claim that he reconsidered the KSAs and found that the Selectee had the highest scores. If the Selecting Official solely relied on his understanding of the Panel's scores, then he would have selected appellant who he believed had the highest scores. Nor does the Selecting Official, or the agency, claim that the selection decision was made based on an affirmative action plan. When asked by the EEO Investigator in a written interrogatory as to whether the September 14, 1993 memorandum essentially directed the Selecting Official to select the female candidate, the Selecting Official stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I never received a memorandum nor suggestion from my headquarters to hire a female. [The September 14, 1993] memorandum was a reflection of our mutual agreement to start the process over because it was flawed at that point--based on my seeking guidance from [the Commander, INSCOM].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Colonel, GS, Deputy Commander (author of the September 14, 1993 memorandum) stated in an affidavit that he asked the Selecting Official to reconsider the tentative selection because: "The Command Group received a Staff recommendation of non-concurrence by the HQ EEO and Career 132 Program Manager." When asked by the EEO Investigator why he believed no one discriminated against appellant, the Colonel, GS, Deputy Commander responded: "Staff objections to this case were based upon the Command's Affirmative Action program." The Commission reiterates that neither the Selecting Official nor the agency in the FAD or on appeal, argues in any fashion that affirmative action concerns influenced the instant selection in any manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Selecting Official did not restart the selection process after the issuance of the September 14, 1993 memorandum. After the issuance of the September 14, 1993 memorandum the Selecting Official did not: (1) subtract or add any KSA's; (2) perform any interviews; (3) claim to add any other particular factors; or (4) reconvene the Selection Panel. The only action that the record shows that the Selecting Official took after the issuance of the September 14, 1993 memorandum was that the Selecting Official changed his recommended selection from Male Applicant 1 to the Selectee. Thus, the Commission finds that the Selecting Official has either mistakenly confused the timing of the September 14, 1993 memorandum or has mischaracterized its effect on the selection process. The Commission concludes that the Selecting Official's claim that the Selectee was chosen because of her interview is not credible because her interview score, as given by the Selecting Official prior to the September 14, 1993 memorandum, was only the third highest score. What the Commission finds did matter, however, was that the Selectee's sex was female. The Commission concludes that because the Selectee had the highest interview score by a female (she was the only female interviewee and the only female applicant of the eight applicants scored by the Panel), she was selected by the Selecting Official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Selectee's "strong customer oriented management," the Commission finds that this factor has not been further explained by the Selecting Official. The Commission finds it likely that the Selecting official has probably not elaborated on this factor of "customer oriented management" because of his stated reliance in the affidavit on the interview. The Selecting Official has not compared the Selectee's "customer oriented management" skills with any of the other applicants' skills. The Commission finds that reliance on the Selectee's "strong customer oriented management" is reliance on a subjective criteria. The criteria has not been defined by the agency and there is no comparison among the candidates on this subjective criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes that the use of subjective criteria, while not impermissible, may offer a convenient pretext for unlawful discrimination<span class="Italic">. Jenkins</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940284. "This particularly is true where an appellant is found to be objectively better qualified than the selectee."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> (citations omitted). Because no comparison of the applicants was provided regarding this selection criteria and because no explanation of the phrase "customer oriented management" was provided, we find, in the particular circumstances of this case, that this criteria can not serve as a legitimate reason for the selection decision<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940517 (Oct. 13, 1995) ("appellant is entitled to some rationale that provides him with an opportunity to attempt to satisfy his ultimate burden of proving that the proffered explanation was a pretext for discrimination.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Selecting Official's claim in the September 20, 1993 Referral and Selection Register that the Selectee "knows CSFs internal workings better than any candidate," the Commission finds this reason for the Selectee's selection to be unworthy of belief. The Selecting Official has not indicated how he reached the conclusion that the Selectee knew CSF's internal workings better than any candidate. In a written interrogatory the EEO investigator asked the Selecting Official the following question:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Appellant] contends your stated reason on the referral list, for selecting [the Selectee], is based on the false premise that [the Selectee] "knows the CSF's internal workings better than any candidate." [Appellant] states [the Selectee] supervised only one of the three operational elements and, compared to [appellant], had little knowledge of the other functional areas, the organization staff and personnel. Please respond.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Selecting Official provided the following response:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In my opinion, [the Selectee] understands CSF and how it needs to change, in this budget-austere environment, better than [appellant]. I have not seen anything from [appellant] to change my opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Selecting Official's response to the EEO investigator's specific question simply restates that the Selectee knew CSF better than appellant. The Selecting Official has not explained in any manner how he reached that conclusion. Although the Selectee had a much longer tenure in CSF than appellant, appellant's prior employment in the military version of the position at issue might have made appellant as familiar (or more familiar) as the Selectee with the internal workings of CSF. While the Commission recognizes that such speculation regarding the knowledge gained in appellant's prior position might not be correct, the Selecting Official has presented no evidence, except his bare conclusion, that the Selectee knew the CSF internal workings better than any other candidate. Furthermore, Panel Member A stated that appellant was the best qualified based on various factors including "working knowledge of CSF." Thus, to some extent, Panel Member A apparently reached a different conclusion than the Selecting Official regarding which applicant best knew the CSF's internal workings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Selecting Official's statement in the September 20, 1993 Referral and Selection Register that he selected the Selectee in part because she "knows CSFs internal workings better than any candidate," is unworthy of belief because the Selecting Official has not even attempted to justify this assertion when given such an opportunity by the EEO investigator. To the extent that the Selecting Official has attempted to justify this assertion he has linked it to his claim that the Selectee understands the need to change better than appellant. The Commission has already found, for reasons stated <span class="Italic">supra</span>, that the Selecting Official's purported reliance on the Selectee's ability to change is unworthy of belief and is a pretext for discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission reiterates that even if the Selectee was the best applicant in the three factors listed in the September 20, 1993 Referral and Selection Register, we still find that these reasons for selecting the Selectee are not the reasons claimed to be relied upon by the Selecting Official for selecting the Selectee. The reasons upon which the Selecting Official claimed to rely upon stem from the interview, i.e., the Selectee's ability to recognize and accept change. The Commission, as discussed <span class="Italic">supra</span>, has found that reason (interview-change) to be pretextual. The Commission finds that the Selecting Official's purported reliance on the interview was not a pretext for hiring the Selectee for the reasons stated in the September 20, 1993 Referral and Selection Register. There is no apparent reason why the Selecting Official would not have set forth in his affidavit, when asked why he selected the Selectee, the reasons presented in the September 20, 1993 Referral and Selection Register if he indeed relied upon such reasons. The Commission finds that the Selecting Official's reliance on the interview is not pretextual for any other reason other than sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Simply put, the Selectee was chosen because her sex was female. The Commission finds that appellant has met his burden of persuasion and has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's selection decision was motivated in whole by sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to applying <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> in Title VII cases, the Commission has also applied <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> to cases involving disparate treatment under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Attorney General</span>, 01933184 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Ross v. Attorney General</span>, 01941139 (1994) (applying <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> to disability discrimination case). The Commission has also applied <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> to cases of reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01940889 (1994); <span class="Italic">Long v. NASA</span>, 01941237 (1994). Furthermore, the Commission has applied <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> to cases under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Melendez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01940888 (1994); <span class="Italic">Suffern v. Attorney General</span>, 01940577 (1994). In each instance, the Commission cited <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> for the proposition that the burden of persuasion ultimately rests with the complainant.</p>
