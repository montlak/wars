<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-90"><span class="space">P.</span> LEAVE USAGE</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's treatment of leave use as an accommodation suggests that there is a balancing test involved. On the one hand, it is reasonable to expect that an employee with a disabling condition would require some accommodation in sick leave requests. On the other hand, the agency has a legitimate interest in having its employees on the job on a regular basis. The reader is referred to Chapter 14 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-23-055.html#sec14-54">Job Attendance</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002) (Enforcement Guidance), discusses that rule and more as it relates to leave as a form of reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Permitting the use of accrued paid leave, or unpaid leave, is a form of reasonable accommodation when necessitated by an employee's disability. An employer does not have to provide paid leave beyond that which is provided to similarly-situated employees. Employers should allow an employee with a disability to exhaust accrued paid leave first and then provide unpaid leave. For example, if employees get 10 days of paid leave, and an employee with a disability needs 15 days of leave, the employer should allow the individual to use 10 days of paid leave and 5 days of unpaid leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee with a disability may need leave for a number of reasons related to the disability, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> obtaining medical treatment (e.g., surgery, psychotherapy, substance abuse treatment, or dialysis); rehabilitation services; or physical or occupational therapy;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> recuperating from an illness or an episodic manifestation of the disability;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> obtaining repairs on a wheelchair, accessible van, or prosthetic device;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> avoiding temporary adverse conditions in the work environment (for example, an air-conditioning breakdown causing unusually warm temperatures that could seriously harm an employee with multiple sclerosis);</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> training a service animal (e.g., a guide dog); or</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> receiving training in the use of braille or to learn sign language.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Granting an employee time off from work or an adjusted work schedule as a reasonable accommodation may involve modifying leave or attendance procedures or policies. For example, it would be a reasonable accommodation to modify a policy requiring employees to schedule vacation time in advance if an otherwise qualified individual with a disability needed to use accrued vacation time on an unscheduled basis because of disability-related medical problems, barring undue hardship. Furthermore, an employer may be required to provide additional leave to an employee with a disability as a reasonable accommodation in spite of a "no-fault" leave policy, unless the provision of such leave would impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In some instances, an employer's refusal to modify a workplace policy, such as a leave or attendance policy, could constitute disparate treatment as well as a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. For example, an employer may have a policy requiring employees to notify supervisors before 9:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. if they are unable to report to work. If an employer would excuse an employee from complying with this policy because of emergency hospitalization due to a car accident, then the employer must do the same thing when the emergency hospitalization is due to a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Requests for reasonable accommodation are prospective in nature. An agency need not grant sick leave as an accommodation where the request for accommodation does not come until after the sick leave is taken. <span class="Italic">Growitz v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 01A15047 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is required to provide reasonable accommodation and not the employee's accommodation of choice. As noted above, paid leave should first be exhausted before using unpaid leave. <span class="Italic">Lynette B. v. Attorney General</span>, 0720140010 (2015) (the agency does not deny an employee reasonable accommodation where it requires that the employee first use accrued leave prior to granting leave without pay as an accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent">Further, providing unpaid leave instead of advanced sick leave does not amount to a failure to reasonably accommodate. Agencies are not obligated to provide a complainant with paid leave beyond that which is provided to similarly situated employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bettyann B. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019002998 (2020); <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120060710 (2007), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation</span>, No. 915.002 (2002). Of course, whatever the type of leave, it must be an effective accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shae M. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 2020000951 (2020) (finding no liability where the agency denied the complainant's requests for sick leave and instead provided unpaid sick leave; "While Complainant preferred advanced sick leave as an accommodation, we note that she did not argue that LWOP was an ineffective accommodation.").</p>
<p class="noindent">While the agency has a legitimate interest in having its employees in regular attendance, an employee is not removed from the ambit of the Rehabilitation Act by virtue of his or her absences. An agency may be able to demonstrate that accommodating the absences would be an undue hardship, but it cannot use the absences to determine that the employee is not a qualified individual with a disability. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Omar v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912905 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A prior Commission decision, <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880859 (May 21, 1990), provides guidance on the respective burdens of a handicapped employee and an agency in such a situation. In order to prove that he or she is entitled to the protection of the Rehabilitation Act, an employee must first establish that his or her absences stem from a handicapping condition. An employee may do so by submitting medical documentation that proves that the absences were medically necessary, that is, due to the handicapping condition, and not subject to control by medication or other means.[3] The agency then has a duty to show, before taking any disciplinary action, that it would impose an undue hardship to tolerate the absences stemming from complainant's handicap.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;If the employee fails to document his or her absences or if an employee's medical documentation is not sufficient, an agency may require the employee to submit to a medical examination at the agency's expense to verify the employee's condition and need for accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Ruiz</span>, the Commission specifically rejected the agency's argument that the appellant was not a qualified handicapped person because of his absences. The Commission found the agency's contention to be circular. The Commission concluded that an agency cannot avoid its duty of reasonable accommodation by contending that an employee is not a qualified handicapped person prior to showing that the handicap cannot be reasonably accommodated.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kathleen P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720150036 (2016), the Commission affirmed the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency could have reasonably accommodated the complainant by placing her on leave without pay for six months to a year while she recovered from two seizures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the Agency was correct and Complainant was medically unable to perform her duties as a TSO [Transportation Security Officer], the AJ went on to conclude that the Agency failed to consider providing her with a reasonable accommodation. While determining that the evidence did not establish that there was an available position into which Complainant could be reassigned, substantial evidence supports the AJ's conclusion that she could have been effectively accommodated by being placed on leave without pay (LWOP), which would have given her adequate time to be seizure free and medically re-qualify for her TSO position. The AJ further determined that the Agency failed to establish that holding Complainant's position opened for a six-month period or even a year would have constituted an undue hardship. We agree that the record supports the AJ in this regard. While the Agency argues it was unreasonable to expect it to hold the position opened indefinitely, the AJ placed a specific time frame on the proposed accommodation and the medical evidence from Complainant's own physician seems to support the conclusion that it was likely that she would be seizure-free if given this period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission is not entirely consistent in its approach on extended leave cases. For example, in <span class="Italic">Vinson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120121656 (2012), the complainant had been granted 1,000 hours of leave without pay as an accommodation. The Commission found that the agency did not fail to accommodate the complainant in extending her leave noting in <span class="Italic">Vinson</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant requested reasonable accommodation by submitting multiple notes from her physician indicating that she was unable to come to work due to pneumonia, a "severe medical condition," and then due to her disability. The Agency engaged in the interactive process when Agency officials requested that Complainant provide further details regarding her disability; and based on the cumulative information received, the Agency approved over 1,000 hours of LWOP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record shows that Complainant cannot demonstrate she is a "qualified" individual with a disability. We note that "if an employee with a disability, with or without reasonable accommodation, cannot perform <span id="Page_1356"></span>the essential functions of the position...s/he is unqualified." <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation</span>, at Question 38. In this case, the record supports a finding that Complainant is totally incapacitated with no prospects of returning to work. In every note submitted by her physician, Complainant was identified as totally incapacitated. In the questionnaire dated March 29, 2010, Complainant's physician said that her prognosis was guarded and he was unable to provide an estimate as to when she would return to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency granted Complainant many hours of LWOP in order to permit her to recover from her condition. However, it ultimately became apparent that Complainant's condition completely prevented her from working or returning to work. The Agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act when it refused to approve additional LWOP, charged Complainant's absence as AWOL, and terminated Complainant's employment for failure to report to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not clear why the Commission in <span class="Italic">Vinson</span> did not approach the case from the perspective of whether granting additional leave would have been an undue hardship, though it is unlikely that such an approach would have altered the outcome of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Leave as a reasonable accommodation must be allowed when there are no other effective accommodations and the leave will not impose an undue hardship. When the complainant's medical condition is such that there is uncertainty about when, if ever, he will be able to return to work the complainant is not a qualified individual with a disability and granting leave would be an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Price v. Secretary of Army</span>, 03A10002 (2002). To some degree, it seems that <span class="Italic">Price</span> is overkill because if the complainant is not a qualified individual with a disability, he is not entitled to reasonable accommodation and, therefore, the agency is not required to demonstrate undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">Denying an employee leave for treatment and charging her with absence without leave when she does seek treatment can constitute a failure to make reasonable accommodation. Even a threat to place the employee on AWOL if she leaves for treatment can constitute a failure to accommodate. In <span class="Italic">Doak v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 01992531 (1999), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency also erred when it dismissed allegation D. Allegation D alleges that the appellant's supervisor attempted to prevent the appellant from seeing her psychiatrist by threatening to record her as absent without approved leave (AWOL) on February 4, 1994. On February 1, 1994, the same supervisor had issued the letter of warning regarding the appellant's leave usage; the supervisor also had charged the appellant as being AWOL for 4 hours on February 2, 1994, and as being AWOL for 5 hours on February 3, 1994. If allegation D were to be proven true, then the supervisor had placed the appellant in the dilemma of either forgoing treatment for her alleged disability or, in all probability, to incur another charge of AWOL. Therefore, the Commission finds that allegation D states a claim of a denial of a requested accommodation, even though it appears that the supervisor later chose not to charge the appellant with AWOL for seeing the psychiatrist. A remedy for a proven denial of a reasonable accommodation would be, among other things, to require the granting of the accommodation in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Purvis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921624 (1992), the Commission held that attendance cannot be considered an essential element of the employee's position because of the large number of employees with disabilities who would be eliminated from the coverage of the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[H]ere, the agency does not dispute that appellant has a history of asthma. Appellant's physician stated that her acute bronchial asthma prevented her from performing her job on a number of occasions. Therefore, appellant is a "handicapped person" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act and 29 CFR 1613.702(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold question in this case, however, is whether appellant is a "qualified" handicapped person entitled to reasonable accommodation. A qualified handicapped person is one who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others. 29 CFR 1613.702(f). The AJ found, and the agency maintains, that appellant is not a qualified handicapped person because she is unable to meet an essential function of her position, that is regular attendance. However, the Commission has found that if attendance is considered an essential job function, any frequently absent handicapped employee would be considered unqualified, and the agency would consistently be able to avoid the issue of reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. EEOC</span> Request No. 05880859 (May 21, 1990). Thus, where a complainant is able to perform the essential functions in her position description, a more appropriate question is whether the agency has a duty to accommodate the handicap by tolerating appellant's absences;<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> temporarily relocating appellant, or taking other measures designed to minimize the effects of the cause of the absences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that, prior to the renovations being conducted at her facility in 1988 and 1989, she was able to perform her job in a satisfactory manner, without excessive absences. It is noted that, while the notice of removal refers to two past suspensions due to attendance problems, there were no disciplinary actions taken or attendance problems cited which occurred prior to 1988. Appellant stated that the chemicals associated with the renovations aggravated her asthma and resulted in the absences in question. Appellant did state that she works overtime when it is available, and there is no evidence of any performance-related disciplinary actions being taken against appellant. The agency argues that appellant has not demonstrated any correlation between the absences which led to the notice of removal and her handicapping condition. However, appellant's physician specifically found that 14 of the 20 days cited in the notice of removal on which appellant was absent were due to her bronchial asthma. Therefore, we find that appellant was a qualified handicapped employee whose attendance deficiencies were directly attributable to her handicap, such that she is entitled to reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has stated that, when a complainant's illness precludes her from meeting the attendance requirement without a reasonable accommodation, the question becomes what accommodation would be reasonable. <span class="Italic">Walders v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03900042 (May 8, 1990). EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.704 provides that reasonable accommodation may include, but shall not be limited to, job restructuring, and part-time or modified work schedules. In addition, agencies are required to consider reassignment as a possible accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kenney v. EEOC</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03880089 (February 23, 1989). The AJ found that since the agency employed less than 20 Distribution Clerks, it would be an undue hardship for the agency to accommodate appellant's leave. However, a closer examination of the record reveals that there is no evidence that accommodation of appellant, in the form of leave, job restructuring, or reassignment, would cause the agency undue hardship; and, in fact, the agency did not make such an argument. In addition, the agency failed to offer any evidence that it suffered the loss of an essential function as a result of appellant's absences.</p>
<p class="noindent">For a more detailed discussion of attendance as an essential job element, see "<a href="0100-2023-23-055.html#sec14-54">Job Attendance</a>," in Chapter 14.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to receive leave as a reasonable accommodation, the employee must be able to demonstrate that he or she can return to work in the foreseeable future. <span class="Italic">Nieto v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 03A10032 (2002). Although the Commission has not established a bright-line rule as to the period of time within which the employee must be able to return to work because reasonable accommodation must be decided on a case-by-case basis, in <span class="Italic">Nieto</span> the Commission found the complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability where he had already missed two years of work and there was no prognosis that he could return to work in the foreseeable future. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120130663 (2015) (complainant not qualified where she had been on leave for 16 consecutive months and latest physician statement said she needed another nine months of leave).</p>
<p class="noindent">Erratic attendance may impose an undue hardship on the agency. In <span class="Italic">Bryan R. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130020 (2015), the Commission determined it would be an undue hardship for the agency to continue to accommodate he complainant's unscheduled absences, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that the AJ erred in finding that even if the Agency had engaged in the interactive process, there was no accommodation available to Complainant. We disagree and find that even if we were to assume that Complainant was entitled to an accommodation, we find he failed to identify one which would not cause an undue hardship on the Agency. During the hearing, Complainant testified that he required four to six unscheduled absences per month. The record reveals the Agency had previously provided Complainant with over 400 hours of leave pursuant to his rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Furthermore, the Agency was having financial problems and its busiest season was quickly approaching, so Complainant's unpredictable leave required the Agency to use overtime. (HT 149-151). Furthermore, it could not replace Complainant until the position was vacant. (HT at p. 129). Although Complainant asserts he could have been accommodated had the Agency engaged in the interactive process, we find he failed to request or identify any other accommodation which could have enabled him to perform the essential functions of the job.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, the employee must demonstrate there is a nexus between the disability and the need for leave usage. An employee is not entitled to leave usage as an accommodation simply because he or she has a disability. There must be a causal connection between the disability and the leave usage. In <span class="Italic">Blakey v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A35048.txt">01A35048</a> (2004), the Commission found the employee failed to establish such a nexus:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Herein, assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that complainant is an individual with a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act, we nonetheless find that, as to the basis of disability, complainant failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that discrimination occurred, in order to trigger the accommodation requirement, a nexus between <span id="Page_1357"></span>complainant's asserted disability and the agency's action must be shown. Here, complainant failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that the complained of action was based on disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record evidence revealed that complainant voluntarily entered into a last chance agreement on October 4, 2001, in which she was required to maintain satisfactory attendance as defined as no more than three unscheduled absences per quarter and no absences without leave, for a period of eighteen months. Notwithstanding this agreement, complainant did not maintain satisfactory attendance and on April 19, 2002, the agency issued a notice of removal for violating the terms of the last chance agreement, hi the notice, the agency cited 22 unscheduled absences including unscheduled sick leave, unscheduled leave without pay, and absent without leave, for the period January 1, 2002 to April 12, 2002. While complainant contends that her unscheduled absences were the result of the agency's failure to accommodate her disability, complainant failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this assertion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record evidence established that as an accommodation for her foot condition, complainant requested a temporary light duty assignment for the period January 28, 2002 to February 28, 2002. In support of this request, complainant provided medical documentation which showed that she could work an 8-hour day, but could not walk or stand for more than 4 hours in an 8-hour day. The agency approved complainant's request for a temporary light duty assignment for the period requested with walking and standing restrictions as noted in the medical documentation. Notwithstanding the accommodation provided, complainant did not maintain satisfactory attendance during this period. Complainant's unscheduled absences during this period, belies complainant's claim that her unscheduled absences were the result of the agency's failure to accommodate her purported disability since the unscheduled absences occurred during the period the accommodation requested was provided.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Senatore v. Attorney General</span>, 0120123554 (2013), the Commission found that the complainant's request for an additional 90 days of leave was not reasonable where the complainant had worked for the agency for only a short time. The agency had granted the complainant 30 days of leave and the complainant requested the additional leave to receive treatment in Tennessee where she could be near her family. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Senatore</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Complainant's request for extended leave, an employer's failure to accommodate reasonable requests for medical leave can violate the Rehabilitation Act. In this case, management did accommodate Complainant's initial request for 30 days of leave. However, her request for an additional 90-day extension of leave was denied. Complainant did not provide adequate justification for this request. The record does not seems to support a finding that Complainant was unable to work during this period, only that she wanted to remain in Tennessee because she felt more comfortable with the medical treatment there and the support of her family. However, there is no evidence that the sophisticated medical capacities of the Washington, D.C. area would not have provided her with similar treatment options. In light of these factors, as well as the very brief period of her employment, we cannot find Complainant's request for a lengthy extension of her leave to be reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to advance sick leave to a qualified employee with a disability as a reasonable accommodation where it has otherwise placed the employee in a light duty status as an accommodation and allowed him excessive sick leave. The agency acts within its authority when it considers the sick leave taken by an employee with a disability since it must determine whether the employee would be able to earn and replace the leave time being sought in advance. <span class="Italic">See Dreher v. USPS</span>, 01821655 (1983). But an employee who alleges the agency denied her advance sick leave as an accommodation has stated a claim within EEO purview and is entitled to investigation of that complaint. <span class="Italic">See Montoya v. Army &#x0026; Air Force Exchange Service</span>, 01830300 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bracey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992547 (2002), the Commission explained an agency's reasonable accommodation responsibilities, as they relate to paid and unpaid leave:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as to complainant's claim that on July 15, 1995, she was denied 240 hours (30 days) of advanced sick leave, we find that assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case on all the alleged bases, the agency articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its action which complainant failed to show were mere pretext. Commission regulations establish that an employer does not have to provide paid leave beyond that which is provided to similarly-situated employees<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship</span> (March 1, 1999). The record shows that agency regulations state that advanced sick leave, not to exceed 240 hours, may only be granted when there is reason to believe the employee will return to duty. (ELM 513.511) The agency states that the medical documentation submitted by complainant in support of her request for advance sick leave did not provide any prognosis, and that there was, therefore, no reason to believe that complainant would be able to return to work at the end of the 30 days in order to pay back the advanced leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, complainant is a an individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act, Commission regulations establish that an employer does not have to provide paid leave beyond that which is provided to similarly situated employees<span class="Italic">. See</span> A Technical Assistance Manual on the Employment Provisions (Title I) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, at 3.10(4), 8 FEP Manual (BNA) 405:6981, 7011 (1992). The record contains no evidence that any similarly situated individuals, outside complainant's protected classes, were granted advanced leave under similar circumstances. While we find that employers should allow an employee with a disability to exhaust accrued paid leave first and then provide unpaid leave, the record reflects that complainant was able to take the requested 240 hours in a combination of paid and unpaid leave. We, therefore, find no discrimination as to this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mapes v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120090678 (2010) ("An employer does not have to provide paid leave beyond that which is provided to similarly-situated employees,...").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the general rule is that an agency does not have grant an employee paid leave as accommodation unless the employee had accrued paid leave to use, there is an exception where the agency's failure to accommodate results in the employee not being able to come to work. For example, in <span class="Italic">Pitts v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130039 (2013), the Commission found that the complainant was entitled to three days of administrative leave as an accommodation where the facility did not have running water and, as a result, the bathrooms were inoperable and the complainant had a medical condition that resulted in frequent urination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that Complainant did in fact make the Agency aware that she required use of a restroom due to her medical condition. Because the Agency did not have functioning restrooms, Complainant requested administrative leave. The record included Complainant's request for administrative leave for October 26 and 27, 2011, stating that the "remarks" section that the reason for the leave was a "medical condition." Complainant's request for administrative leave on October 28, 2011, stated "safety hazard." Furthermore, on October 27, 2011, Complainant submitted a Report of Hazard which clearly stated that she was unable to use the restroom due to the lack of running water and that this constituted a hazardous condition for her due to her medical condition. She noted that there was no restroom as of 4:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. on October 27, 2011. Complainant also averred that when she informed management about the lack of working restrooms, she made it know that she had a medical condition which had been documented in her Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requests in the past.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that S1, S2 and the Manager all averred that they were not aware of Complainant's medical condition. At the same token, S2 noted that he was aware that Complainant had an FMLA claim. We find the statements by S2 to be inconsistent. In addition, the documents provided by Complainant clearly state that the reason for her requests for administrative leave was her medical condition. As such, we find that Complainant's request for administrative leave for October 26, 27 &#x0026; 28, 2011, constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation. We determine that it was the Agency that failed to recognize Complainant's request for administrative leave as a request for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Due to this failure, none of the management officials engaged in the interactive process. However, the Commission has recognized that an agency's failure to engage in the interactive process does not, in itself, constitute a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Social Security Admin</span>., Appeal No. 01A14791 (February 21, 2003). Liability depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the fact that the Agency failed to properly engage in the interactive process, does not, by itself, demand a finding that Complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation. Rather, to establish a denial of a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must establish that the failure to engage <span id="Page_1358"></span>in the interactive process resulted in the Agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserted that it provide Complainant with an accommodation, however, not the accommodation she requested. Management noted that Complainant could have used a restroom at a gas station one mile away or at a grocery store three miles away. Complainant noted that her medical condition required her to urinate frequently and that she may not have been able to wait to leave the facility and travel to a location one to three miles away in order to use a restroom. It is the Commission's position that if more than one accommodation is effective, "the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration; however, the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9; <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002, Question 9 (revised October 17, 2002); <span class="Italic">Polen v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970984 (January 16, 2001). Here, we cannot find that the Agency's suggestion of allowing Complainant to <span id="Page_1359"></span>travel to another location to use a restroom constituted an effective accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we turn to Complainant's requested accommodation, namely the use of administrative leave for October 26, 27, &#x0026; 28, 2011, when there was no restroom available at the facility. We note that the Agency asserted that there was a portable restroom at the facility during these dates. However., Complainant noted that there was no portable restroom at the workplace at her designated start time of 4:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. on October 26 and 27, 2011. Further, she noted that she could not wait at the facility without a restroom until one was delivered. No Management Official could provide the exact date or time when a portable restroom was delivered or if Complainant was informed of when it was installed. As such, we find that Complainant showed that she should have been provided with administrative leave for October 26, 27 &#x0026; 28, 2011. The Agency failed to argue or present any evidence that providing Complainant with administrative leave would have constituted a reasonable accommodation. Therefore, we conclude that Complainant established that had the Agency properly engaged in the interactive process, she should have been provided with a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation in the form of administrative leave for October 26, 27 &#x0026; 28, 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent">The amount of leave the agency may be required to grant as an accommodation is dependent upon the condition involved, the needs of the agency and "other relevant factors." <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 01841241 (1986). Prior to imposing any discipline for excessive leave, the agency must put the employee on notice that the amount of leave being requested is "unacceptable given the needs of the agency or is otherwise causing an undue hardship on the operation of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 01910116 (1991), the Commission found that an agency may have to grant sick leave as an accommodation where it cannot grant the employee's initial reasonable accommodation request for a shift change. See section on "<a href="0100-2023-24-167.html#sec15-142">Shift Changes</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">That an agency has accommodated an employee at one facility by permitting extensive leave does not mean it must do so at all facilities. <span class="Italic">Shipp v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902000 (1990). Denial of a transfer is not discriminatory where the agency can demonstrate that it would place an undue hardship on the new facility to grant extensive sick leave. But, where the absences are disability-related, the agency's consideration of a low sick leave balance in denying a transfer is discriminatory unless the agency shows that excusing the absences would pose an undue hardship on its operations. <span class="Italic">Rajterowski v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956733 (1998). In the alternative, the agency must show that it would have denied the transfer without relying on the disability-related absences. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who is granted leave as an accommodation is entitled to return to his or her position unless the agency can demonstrate that holding the position open during the employee's absence would constitute an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA</span>, "Types of Reasonable Accommodation Related to Job Performance, Leave." Moreover:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employer cannot hold a position open during the entire leave period without incurring undue hardship, the employer must consider whether it has a vacant, equivalent position for which the employee is qualified and to which the employee can be reassigned to continue his/her leave for a specific period of time and then, at the conclusion of the leave, can be returned to this new position.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an equivalent position is not vacant, the agency must consider a vacant position at a lower level. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, it should be noted that nonprobationary, competitive service employees cannot be involuntarily demoted without invoking the substantive and procedural protections of 5 USC chapter 75.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many agencies use sick leave balance as a criterion in promotion selections, giving preference to employees who use sick leave only infrequently. Although the use of such a criterion generally is acceptable, it is an apparently neutral policy which can serve to impede the progress of an employee with a disability. When the agency fails to demonstrate that accommodation of the employee, through the use of accumulated sick leave, is unduly burdensome, the policy is discriminatory. <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 01820059 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency satisfies its burden of production where it demonstrates that the appellant was a chronic abuser of sick leave and that twice during his absence he had been instructed to report to duty and, upon returning, failed to provide the agency with a medical certificate. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 01821579 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency grants an employee leave as an accommodation, it may not penalize the employee for using that leave. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720090055 (2010), the complainant suffered a heart attack and was granted three months of leave for recovery. When he returned to work, he was under an indefinite restriction on lifting more than 20 pounds, which the agency also accommodated. Approximately six months after his return, he experienced chest pan and was examined for a possible pulmonary embolism. Complainant was out of work for two weeks during which time he exhausted his annual and sick leave. He then requested three weeks of FMLA leave to cover the remainder of his absence.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency denied his request and terminated his temporary appointment contending that he was unable to perform his duties due to extended absence. The agency characterized its action as nondisciplinary.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the agency had denied the complainant reasonable accommodation. It rejected an argument that the pulmonary condition for which the complainant sought leave should have been evaluated as to whether it, standing alone, constituted a disability and, because it did not, the complainant was not entitled to accommodation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Ramos</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the agency contends that although the AJ determined that complainant was substantially limited in lifting as a result of his heart attack, there was no showing that the absence for which he was terminated was related to his cardiac condition, rather than an unrelated pulmonary event. Therefore, the agency asserted that the AJ should have conducted a separate analysis to determine if the pulmonary condition rendered complainant an individual with a disability. The agency further argues that the pulmonary condition did not substantially limit a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, however, that the evidence supports the finding that it is more likely than not that complainant would not have been terminated if the few weeks of requested medical leave for the pulmonary condition had been the sole consideration. Rather, the weight of the evidence indicates that complainant's prior extended absence for his cardiac condition also factored heavily into the decision to terminate. Complainant's supervisor testified that when he proposed complainant's removal for requesting more medical leave, he was aware of his prior heart attack and absence for three months. The agency concedes that the decision to terminate was solely based upon complainant's unavailability for work due to his medical conditions. During the hearing, the supervisor acknowledged that the only previous absences that he was aware of were those stemming from complainant's heart attack. Regardless of whether complainant was substantially limited in a major life activity by the pulmonary condition, complainant had a record of a disability (heart condition with subsequent 20 lb. lifting restriction) that had previously been accommodated with an extended medical leave. Therefore, the Commission finds that the decision to terminate complainant was, in large part, due to his history of disability-related absences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has expressly determined that an employer may not penalize an employee for work missed during leave taken as a reasonable accommodation. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (revised October 17, 2002), Question 19. The Guidance explains that to do so would be retaliation for the employee's use of a reasonable accommodation for which he is entitled under law. Moreover, such punishment would make the leave an ineffective accommodation, thus making an employer liable for failing to provide a reasonable accommodation. We find that the record supports a finding that the agency improperly penalized complainant for his prior accommodation of leave related to his heart condition when it terminated him six months later when he made an additional request for medical leave. As such, the agency violated its duties under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that it would have been subjected to an undue burden if it had accommodated complainant's request for the additional weeks off on FMLA leave. However, the agency has failed to meet its burden of proof in this regard. The agency asserted that complainant's supervisor was new, and that he experienced stress due to complainant's absence in one of the busiest departments in the Commissary. The evidence of record supports the AJ's conclusion that the new manager's situation constituted insufficient evidence of undue hardship. Two other managers testified that complainant's department, and the Commissary in general, had a large staff. Complainant's job entailed manual labor which could be covered by other employees, and indeed was after complainant was terminated. Based on this evidence, the agency simply did not establish that it would not have been able to provide complainant with an additional three weeks off work as an accommodation without experiencing an undue burden on its operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether granting the amount of leave requested by the employee is an undue hardship is determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the amount of leave involved, the work requirements of the agency, the impact and cost of otherwise getting the work done, and the prospect that the employee has a foreseeable return to work. In <span class="Italic">Estate of Williams-Hays v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120102949 (2012), the Commission demonstrated how it balances those factors in a most unfortunate case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record before us, the Commission finds that Complainant has not established that the Agency failed to provide a required reasonable accommodation. Complainant held the only Orthotist-Prosthetist position at her facility, which had a large client demand. Her position required a specialized skill set. She had been in her position <span id="Page_1360"></span>about five months when she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2008. Complainant began chemotherapy in May 2008 and had to use leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To provide coverage for Complainant's position, the Agency had colleagues who held the same position at two other facilities drive 95 or more miles or it used external services for six times the cost of in-house services. Further, the record shows that Complainant exhausted her sick and annual leave, and as of July 2008, was granted three months of discretionary leave without pay by the Agency. Complainant stated that she had difficulty walking, seeing, performing manual tasks, writing, lifting or carrying objects, speaking, remembering, learning, and caring for herself. She acknowledged that, as of January 2009, she remained unable to return to work. Although we note that Complainant thought there were a few months she could have returned to work, but was uncertain of specific dates. The Agency terminated Complainant's employment in December 2008 and hired to her position in June 2009. By 2010, Complainant stated that she was in the final stages of her lymphoma. She passed away June 26, 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering the above, we find that the Agency established that it would have posed an undue hardship for it to allow Complainant's position to remain open indefinitely and not hire to it. The record suggests Complainant was unable to return to her position.</p>
