<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-4"><span class="space">B.</span> BURDEN SHIFTING ANALYSIS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once the complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, the agency bears the burden of showing that the criteria used for disqualification are job-related and that there is no reasonable accommodation that would enable the employee to perform the essential functions of the position adequately and safely. <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 01821171 (1983). In this regard, the testimony of a lay supervisor with no medical training does not constitute a showing that the criteria are job-related. In the <span class="Italic">Jones</span> case, the employee's supervisor revoked his government driving license and reassigned him to a nondriving position after the employee lost vision in one eye.</p>
<p class="noindent">Cases involving reasonable accommodation often are referred to as "surmountable barrier" cases. In <span class="Italic">French v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01850839 (1987), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "surmountable barrier" theory of handicap employment discrimination is based on the affirmative duty of federal employers to provide reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of handicapped employees.... To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under this theory, the following elements must be shown by appellant: (1) except for his handicap, he is qualified to perform the duties of his position; (2) he has a handicap which prevents him from meeting all of the criteria for the position; and, (3) there are plausible reasons to believe that the handicap can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden rests on the employee to demonstrate that his disability is the reason for his failure to perform the functions of his job. An appellant does not meet this burden when the evidence shows that it is his own conduct in failing to get along with fellow employees that causes "job-related stress." Conversely, the agency does not meet its undue burden requirement by presenting a statement of pure medical conclusion by its medical officer that the employee is medically unfit and cannot be accommodated. <span class="Italic">Aaron v. USPS</span>, 01832149 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a reasonable accommodation case, there is no requirement that the complainant demonstrate an intent to discriminate. All that is required is that the complainant demonstrate a failure to accommodate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span> <span class="Italic">Guzman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51266 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant establishes that his disability substantially limits a major life activity and there is a <span class="Italic">plausible</span> accommodation, then the burden of proof shifts to the agency to show either that there is no reasonable accommodation or that any accommodation would impose an undue burden on the agency. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Meyer v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01944240 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, it is undisputed that appellant has a disability which substantially limits a major life activity. Specifically, as stated by the AJ, appellant's diabetes limits his ability to stand, walk, climb, bend, perform manual tasks, and work. Thus, appellant is considered to be disabled for purposes of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Commission finds that appellant was a qualified disabled individual. There was a plausible accommodation for appellant in his job as an Exhibits Maker, for example, rest periods, more frequent breaks for meals, and the elimination of prolonged standing and climbing. However, while appellant was performing his duties in the position, the medical evidence provided to the agency showed that appellant could not perform the essential functions of the position without risk of substantial harm to himself. Upon receiving that evidence, the agency should have attempted to restructure his position, or reassign him to a position in which he could perform the essential functions. The Commission has previously stated that the burden is on the agency to show that the harm to appellant could not be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). Instead, the agency took no action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203 requires Federal agencies to make reasonable accommodations for the known limitations of a qualified person with a disability, unless the agency can demonstrate that accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. Reasonable accommodation on the part of the agency includes, but is not limited to, making work facilities accessible, job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, the provision of readers and interpreters, and other similar actions. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c)(2); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g, Edward v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932014 (April 7, 1994). Further, reasonable accommodation must be ascertained on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the burden rests with the agency to show either that no reasonable accommodation of appellant's disability is possible, or that such an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, the Commission finds that the agency failed to meet its burden of providing reasonable accommodation. Specifically, the agency retained appellant in the Exhibits Maker position, a job for which appellant's physician and the agency's Medical Officer found him to be unsuited. The Personnel Staffing Specialist acknowledged receiving specific documentation to that effect on October 5, 1992; however, the Personnel Staffing Specialist failed to disseminate the information to appellant's Supervisors, or otherwise make them aware of appellant's restrictions. As stated, the Commission deems appellant's submission of the statement from his physician to be tantamount to a request for reassignment to a position within his restrictions. Nevertheless, the agency failed to examine whether it could in fact restructure appellant's position, or reassign him. While the Personnel Staffing Specialist stated, generally, that the only positions available at the time involved typing or computer skills which appellant did not possess, the record contains no evidence in that regard, or other information showing that the agency specifically considered appellant for any available assignments after receiving the applicable medical documentation in October 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission, like the AJ, is concerned that the agency's procedures for identifying and accommodating disabled individuals were inadequate. Specifically, as stated, while the Recruitment and Placement Office and the agency's Medical Officer received information from appellant's physician outlining certain limitations in October 1992, no effort was made to determine whether appellant's condition could in fact be accommodated. In addition, the various offices within the agency who ultimately considered the matter failed to communicate with each other, or with appellant's Supervisors. Accordingly, based upon a review of the record herein, the Commission finds that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate appellant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Barney G. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120120400 (2015) ("While this is not a high burden for the complainant, it is an initial plausibility threshold that the complainant must meet. Once the complainant shows that the requested accommodation is plausible, the burden then shifts to the agency to show whether the accommodation, even if plausible, would nonetheless impose an undue hardship (i.e., a significant difficulty or expense) on the operations of the agency.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a complainant must demonstrate that he or she is substantially limited in a major life activity in order to qualify for reasonable accommodation, an agency is required to accommodate limitations that are not substantially limiting if the complainant makes such a showing. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Iftikar-Khan v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a40137.txt">07A40137</a> (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the agency is obligated to provide reasonable accommodation for any limitations resulting from a disability. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act</span> (Enforcement Guidance), EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at Question 39 (October 17, 2002). The limitation which is the basis for the accommodation request need not itself be substantially limiting. As long as the limitation is a consequence of a disability covered under the Rehabilitation Act, the request must be granted absent undue hardship.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to "make work" in order to provide reasonable <span id="Page_1263"></span>accommodation to an employee. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span> <span class="Italic">Annice F. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132234 (2015); <span class="Italic">Houston v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01A51502 (2006) (agency was not required to create work at one facility as an accommodation to avoid complainant's transfer to another facility with work the complainant could perform). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Medlock-Price v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54134 (2006). However, the converse also is true. If an employee is entitled to reasonable accommodation, it must provide an opportunity for meaningful work. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Fenus v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120100616 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the AJ should also take into consideration that the accommodations that the Agency did provide Complainant were not meaningful accommodations (i.e.: making Complainant sit on the floor in front of her supervisor without work; ordering Complainant to read Postal manuals as busy work; ordering Complainant sit on the floor silently and not talk while other Carriers were permitted to talk; and assigning Complainant an official duty of sitting in a chair with no work). These accommodations may not be in conformance with the purpose of the Rehabilitation Act to ensure equal employment opportunities for persons with disabilities including full participation in the workplace. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(7) ("Congress finds that...the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals."); H.R. Rep. 101-485(M), at 16 (1990) (An accommodation must provide "meaningful equal employment opportunity for the applicant or employee"). Instead, the Agency should have kept Complainant in the modified duty position while it engaged in the interactive process to determine whether there was another vacant funded position for which Complainant could perform the essential functions with or without a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a reasonable accommodation case, whether the complainant is a qualified individual with a disability is determined by his or her condition at the time of the accommodation request. <span class="Italic">Franklin v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A00025 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Franklin</span>, the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complainant was not disabled based on improvements in his condition after it denied his request for accommodation. That the condition may later have improved to the point where the accommodation was no longer needed, or degenerated to the point where no accommodation was effective is irrelevant to the determination of whether there was a failure to accommodate. The agency's period of liability may be shortened, however, to the extent that an accommodation only could have been made for a limited time. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The agency must present specific evidence showing how an accommodation would constitute an undue hardship. It is not sufficient for the agency to merely assert that providing an accommodation would be "economically unfeasible." In <span class="Italic">Spaulding v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932868 (1994), the agency provided accommodation to the employee by providing someone to lift and move equipment during normal work hours. However, the agency refused to provide the accommodation for overtime hours. The Commission rejected the agency's position in <span class="Italic">Spaulding,</span> that to provide accommodation during overtime hours would constitute an undue hardship:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find in the present case, the agency has not shown that providing appellant with someone to lift and move equipment would impose an undue hardship on the agency. The only evidence submitted by the agency in support of its conclusion that accommodating appellant, while working overtime, would constitute an undue hardship was the supervisor's conclusory affidavit that accommodation was "economically unfeasible." No evidence distinguishing between the accommodation offered during regular work hours and overtime was submitted. EEOC's regulations regarding undue hardship anticipate a greater evidentiary showing than that offered in this matter....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Everett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954260 (1997) (a supervisor's assertion that accommodation was not "practical" is insufficient to meet the agency's burden without supporting evidence as to why accommodation is not "practical").</p>
<p class="noindent">The accommodation offered by the agency must be one that allows the employee to perform his or her duties with a reasonable expectation of success. <span class="Italic">Sabella v. USPS</span>, 01840090 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not limited to considering only those accommodations specifically requested by the employee. <span class="Italic">Walsh v. USPS</span>, 01853056 (1987). "While...the Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to exhaust limitless possibilities for reasonable accommodation, the burden for accommodation nevertheless remains with the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The benchmark of whether an accommodation is reasonable is whether it is effective. As the <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA</span>, "Requesting Reasonable Accommodation," at Question 9, explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective. Thus, as part of the interactive process, the employer may offer alternative suggestions for reasonable accommodations and discuss their effectiveness in removing the workplace barrier that is impeding the individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If there are two possible reasonable accommodations, and one costs more or is more burdensome than the other, the employer may choose the less expensive or burdensome accommodation as long as it is effective (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it would remove a workplace barrier, thereby providing the individual with an equal opportunity to apply for a position, to perform the essential functions of a position, or to gain equal access to a benefit or privilege of employment). Similarly, when there are two or more effective accommodations, the employer may choose the one that is easier to provide. In either situation, the employer does not have to show that it is an undue hardship to provide the more expensive or more difficult accommodation. If more than one accommodation is effective, "the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration. However, the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Atkins v. Social Security Administration</span>, 02970004 (2000) (a complainant is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but is entitled to an effective accommodation); <span class="Italic">Irvin v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01990867 (2000) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is required to respond "expeditiously" to a request for accommodation. Undue delay in responding can result in a violation of the agency's reasonable accommodation obligation. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA, "Requesting Reasonable Accommodation</span>," at Question 10.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not withdraw an accommodation as discipline for misconduct. The agency is required to provide reasonable accommodation to an individual with a disability unless it would impose an undue hardship on the agency. If the agency believes the employee has engaged in misconduct, the appropriate response is discipline for that conduct and not withdrawal of accommodation. <span class="Italic">Neal v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924024 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">A request for reasonable accommodation is always prospective. An agency is not required to excuse past misconduct as an accommodation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Flint v. National Security Administration</span>, 01A02308 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a complainant's symptoms can be controlled through measures such as medication and diet do not negate the agency's obligation to provide accommodations that also can assist in controlling symptoms. Nor does the fact that the symptoms of a disease do not openly manifest themselves on the job mean the individual does not suffer from a disabling condition. In <span class="Italic">Dimick v. Postmaster General</span>, 01941259 (1995), the Commission rejected both arguments in a case involving an epileptic employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the findings of the AJ and reject the conclusions of the final agency decision. Courts and the Commission have recognized that epilepsy constitutes a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Mantolete v. Bolger</span>, 767 F.2d 1416, 1421-23 (9th Cir. 1985). Record evidence firmly establishes that appellant has epilepsy. Agency assertions to the contrary are unpersuasive. Appellant informed the agency on numerous occasions that he was epileptic and that he experienced seizures. Appellant's physician, a specialist in the field, wrote several letters to the agency identifying appellant's epilepsy and explaining the relationship of seizure activity and sleep patterns. Finally, the General Manager unequivocally acknowledged his awareness of appellant's condition in a memorandum written at the time of the subject actions, in his investigative affidavit and again during hearing testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final agency decision ignores the representations of appellant, his physician and the General Manager and suggests, after the fact, that appellant's epilepsy is a fabrication designed to ensure a convenient work schedule. The weight of evidence belies this argument. Appellant is not required to outwardly manifest his disability and his right to an accommodation is not prejudiced by the fact that he has, in the past, functioned without the requested accommodation. Similarly, appellant may not be penalized for taking medication and following his doctor's advice to seek other ameliorative measures, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a regular daytime work schedule, to limit the chances of seizures. Appellant is not required to exacerbate his condition in order to substantiate the existence of his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has provided no persuasive medical data to counter the diagnosis and/or recommendations of appellant's physician. The report cited in the final agency decision pertains to a routine medical examination that did not specifically address appellant's epilepsy and, by every indication, focused on his recovery from surgery to remove a pituitary cyst. The agency's emphasis on appellant's documented fitness to perform mailhandler duties is similarly unavailing. Though evidence that appellant could not perform these functions would be probative of whether he met the definition of a person with a disability, evidence that he can do the job does not disprove that he is disabled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we agree with the AJ. Appellant satisfied the definition of a person with a disability. Since it is undisputed that appellant competently performed the functions of his position throughout his tenure with the agency, we find that appellant is a qualified person with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we conclude that the agency failed to show that providing <span id="Page_1264"></span>the requested accommodation would result in an undue hardship to the operation of the agency's program. It is quite clear that persons performing appellant's job were relatively fungible and that the General Manager decided to stop accommodating appellant simply because he feared a flood of like requests. As noted by the AJ, the agency may not decline an accommodation based upon its aversion to setting a bad precedent. Accommodation requests must be handled on a case-by-case basis. The agency accommodated appellant for 14 months. There is no evidence of a significant change in circumstances. Hence, there is no reason to believe that the agency could not have continued to provide appellant with a daytime schedule. A blanket, unsupported statement that appellant was needed on his regular tour does not satisfy the agency's burden of proving undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly unpersuasive is the agency's claim that appellant used his condition as a guise to secure a more favorable work schedule. Appellant's physician explained that a regular daytime work schedule permitted normal sleeping patterns critical to reducing the frequency of appellant's seizures. That a regular daytime work schedule also allows appellant to more easily fulfill certain family obligations does not prove that his accommodation request was a ploy nor undermine his medical need for the requested accommodation of his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like Title VII and the ADEA, the Rehabilitation Act applies to the benefits and privileges of employment, as well as to specific personnel actions. An agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation likewise extends to the benefits and privileges of employment. As the Commission explains in its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA</span>, "Reasonable Accommodation Related to the Benefits and Privileges of Employment":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations so that employees with disabilities can enjoy the "benefits and privileges of employment" equal to those enjoyed by similarly-situated employees without disabilities. Benefits and privileges of employment include, but are not limited to, employer-sponsored: (1) training, (2) services (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, employee assistance programs (EAP's), credit unions, cafeterias, lounges, gymnasiums, auditoriums, transportation), and (3) parties or other social functions (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, parties to celebrate retirements and birthdays, and company outings). If an employee with a disability needs a reasonable accommodation in order to gain access to, and have an equal opportunity to participate in, these benefits and privileges, then the employer must provide the accommodation unless it can show undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no undue hardship where an alcoholic employee is about to end her probationary period and providing her accommodation by granting leave for treatment would allow her probationary period to expire and, thus, make it harder for the agency to terminate her. <span class="Italic">Beck v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01924140 (1994).</p>
