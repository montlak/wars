<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-70a"><span class="space">b.</span> Applicants Through Staffing Agencies</h5>
<p class="noindent">An applicant for hire, through a staffing firm, had standing to bring a discrimination complaint in <span class="Italic">Detra W. v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 2020003147 (2021). In that case, the applicant had "final approval for onboarding" by the agency, but the offer was rescinded because the agency could not honor her reasonable accommodation request to telework. Noting that the agency had "significant input into the denial of Complainant's reasonable accommodation request" and "because this is a hiring case, control over hiring is an especially significant factor in making a determination on joint employment," the Commission found joint control in <span class="Italic">Detra W</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In January 2018, the Agency contracted with a staffing firm to assist it in establishing and operating a new division to provide advice and develop a program to ensure the Agency complied with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requiring federal agencies make all electronic information and technology accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Around mid-2018, the staffing firm's Recruiting Director identified Complainant as a strong candidate for Section 508 work and passed her resume along to the staffing firm's Director, who interviewed her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is uncontested that the Agency's Chief of the Section 508 Program Office reviewed Complainant's resume prior to the staffing firm's decision to bring her onboard. The Recruiting Director, staffing firm Director and Complainant all stated that the Agency Chief also interviewed her in person. The Agency Chief countered that his only role was to review and give feedback on resumes presented by the staffing firm. He stated he met Complainant for a meet-and-greet on November 14, 2018, for five to ten minutes after the staffing firm decided to select her for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the record shows that just prior to May 15, 2018, the staffing firm Recruiting Director emailed Complainant with logistical information for her "Interview with Census Customer [Agency]" and advising her the staffing firm Director would introduce her to "our Census Customer." We find by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency Chief or an Agency official in his place interviewed Complainant for the job in May 2018 before the staffing firm, by email on November 15, 2018, advised her it intended to select her to serve the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence also indicates the Agency Chief had final approval on all candidates the staffing firm presented to the Agency and the Recruiting Director stated that the staffing firm sent resumes to the Agency Chief for "his approval." The staffing firm Director stated that "agreement was reached by Census Bureau...that they would be moving forward with...[Complainant]," and the Agency had final approval for onboarding. Despite the Agency Chief's assertions to the contrary, we find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his approval was required before Complainant assume the 508 position. A spreadsheet the Recruiting Director emailed internally on the status of staffing firm Section 508 candidates contained comments on individual candidates that included, "No-go by client," and "client liked but perhaps as future offer." Also, the Agency Chief stated he approved Complainant to be cleared by the Agency clearance process for onboarding. Complainant passed the background check by the Agency's Census Investigative Services around March 2019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Throughout this process, Complainant was on dialysis due to renal failure. According to Complainant, in January 2018, she had advised the staffing firm Director that because she required dialysis several times a week, with each session being 6-8 hours at home during the day, she needed to telework four days a week but she could work at her desk while receiving treatment. This was later adjusted in a doctor's note from November 2018, recommending Complainant be allowed to telework from home three days a week.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency Chief stated that he was informed for the first time by the staffing firm Director in early May 2019, that Complainant had a disability which required her to telework from home three or four days a week. The Agency Chief responded that contractors were allowed a standard two days a week to telework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 9, 2019, the Agency Chief emailed his supervisor and the Agency's contract officer representative (COR) with a copy to the staffing firm Director:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...please do not [bold in oriGINAl] move forward with [Complainant] for now; let me talk to [my supervisor]...first. Please see the following concerns:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">--I am not sure how she will be able to contribute effectively and meet our deliverable deadline when she will [be] working 3 days from home doing her dialysis. She needs to understand our process and procedures, needs exposure to applications to which she will be working on, conduct customer engagement, etc[.] while going through her dialysis. That makes me nervous. [Bold in oriGINAl].</p>
<p class="noindent-3">--Decennial product owners...are very demanding on...dates/timelines for Decennial applications that we cannot negotiate or change. If I assign a Decennial task and she is not able to deliver [this] will be a huge risk for the program office because [the] application will not able to move to the next level due to Section 508 noncompliance. [The] Section 508 Program Office is not in a position to take that kind of risk at this point because 2020 Decennial is right around the corner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 17, 2019, the Agency Chief's supervisor sent his own questions to the COR on reasonable accommodation, who forwarded them to the Agency's Contractor Representative for response. The Contractor Representative promptly replied that it was up to the COR to work out with the staffing firm whether Complainant would be approved to telework more than the two standard days, and the COR should coordinate closely with the government team receiving the support to determine if the contract requirements could be satisfied if additional remote work is granted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 22, 2019, the staffing firm Director emailed the Recruiting Director that she had been advised by the Agency that for any telework beyond two days the staffing firm would be responsible to financially cover it unless the Agency's Program Area could work within Complainant's constraints. She added that since Program Area did not believe Complainant could ramp up effectively unless she teleworked less, the COR was indicating this was a nonstarter. The next day, the staffing firm Director emailed the COR confirming her understanding that it was already decided by the Agency that Complainant could not participate effectively if she needed to telework three days a week. She added that the staffing firm could not afford the third day without billing the Agency. Given all this, she indicated she was submitting another candidate for the slot. The COR in her EEO investigatory statement cited to the second email and echoed its content.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The staffing firm then informed Complainant of the Agency's unwillingness to allow her to telework more than two days per week and the resulting necessity to rescind the job offer. The instant EEO complaint followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue to be decided in this appeal is whether the Agency had sufficient control over the position in question to be considered a joint employer of the position's incumbent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency found that because work hours were determined by the staffing firm in consultation with the COR and the duration of the job was jointly agreed to in advance by the staffing firm and Agency, this weighed against joint employment. We disagree. Even if we accept these Agency factual findings, they would weigh in favor of both the staffing firm and the Agency controlling the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency found that it did not control when, where, and how work was performed. It referred to contract language that all work was to be done under the supervision of the contractor or contract employees, and any communications with Census Bureau personnel must be done in the presence of a staffing firm representative regarding management issues, specific tasking, and performance. It also found that Agency management deferred to the staffing firm's decision not to offer Complainant a third telework day a week as a reasonable accommodation. However, we disagree with how the Agency weighed the facts on these control factors. We give more weight to the COR and Recruiting Director statements that the Agency controlled the above factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that, at a minimum, the Agency had significant input into the denial of Complainant's reasonable accommodation request--the Agency Contractor Representative wrote that it was up to the COR to work out with the staffing firm whether Complainant would be approved to telework more than the two standard days and the COR should coordinate closely with the government team receiving the support to determine if the requirements can be satisfied if additional remote work is granted. The evidence shows that the Agency's operations area and COR, not the staffing firm, decided that Complainant could not satisfy the requirements of the position in question if she teleworked more than two days a week. The staffing firm's refusal to accept the Agency's demand that it was not responsible to pay for telework labor beyond two days a week, but the staffing firm could, does not undermine this.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because this is a hiring case, control over hiring is an especially significant factor in making a determination on joint employment. We find that control over hiring was shared by the staffing firm and the Agency. The Agency set the detailed qualifications for the position. While the staffing firm recruited Complainant and decided to present her as a candidate to the Agency, prior to Complainant being offered the position, Agency <span id="Page_185"></span>personnel reviewed her resume, interviewed her in May 2018, approved her coming on board, and required her to pass a background check conducted by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth in our previous decisions and guidance, we find that Complainant was a common law applicant for employment and the Agency possessed sufficient control over the position in question to be a common law joint employer for the purpose of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency did not investigate Complainant's merits claim (that she was discriminated against by the Agency regarding the withdrawal of the offer for her to be hired by the staffing firm serving the Agency), we agree with the Agency's argument on appeal that if joint employment was found, Complainant's merit claims should be remanded for investigation in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's dismissal of the complaint is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED to the Agency for compliance with the Order set forth below.</p>
