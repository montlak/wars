<p class="noindent-1">1609.1 Harassment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1609.2 Employer Liability for Harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority: 42 USC 2000e <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span>; 29 USC 621 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span>; 29 USC 12101, <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span>; 29 USC 701, <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x00A7; 1609.1&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Harassment</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national <span id="Page_921"></span>origin, age, or disability constitutes discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment and, as such, violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC 2000e <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span> (Title VII); the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, 29 USC 621 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span> (ADEA); the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 USC 12101 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span> (ADA); or the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 USC 701 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span>, as applicable. (Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)(1)&#x2003;Harassment is verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability, or that of his/her relatives, friends, or associates, and that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;Has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;Otherwise adversely affects an individual's employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)(2)&#x2003;Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;Epithets, slurs, negative stereotyping, or threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts, that relate to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability (footnote omitted); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group because of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability and that is placed on walls, bulletin boards, or elsewhere on the employer's premises, or circulated in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;The standard for determining whether verbal or physical conduct, relating to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability is sufficiently severe (footnote omitted) or pervasive to create a hostile or abusive work environment is whether a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would find the conduct intimidating, hostile, or abusive. The "reasonable person" standard includes consideration of the perspective of persons of the alleged victim's race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability. It is not necessary to make an additional showing of psychological harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;An employer, employment agency, joint apprenticeship committee, or labor organization (hereinafter collectively referred to as "employer") has an affirmative duty to maintain a working environment free of harassment on any of these bases (footnote omitted). Harassing conduct may be challenged even if the complaining employee(s) are not specifically intended targets of the conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;In determining whether the alleged conduct constitutes harassment, the Commission will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the conduct and the context in which it occurred. The determination of the legality of a particular action will be made from the facts, on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;An employer is liable for its conduct and that of its agents and supervisory employees with respect to workplace harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Where the employer knew or should have known of the conduct and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Regardless of whether the employer knew or should have known of the conduct, where the harassing supervisory employee is acting in an "agency capacity." To determine whether the harassing individual is acting in an "agency capacity," the circumstances of the particular employment relationship and the job functions performed by the harassing individual shall be examined.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Apparent authority" to act on the employer's behalf shall be established where the employer fails to institute an explicit policy against harassment that is clearly and regularly communicated to employees, or fails to establish a reasonably accessible procedure by which victims of harassment can make their complaints known to appropriate officials who are in a position to act on complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;With respect to conduct between co-workers, an employer is responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace that relate to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability where the employer or its agents or supervisory employees knew or should have known of the conduct, and the employer failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;An employer may also be responsible for the acts of nonemployees with respect to harassment of employees in the workplace related to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability where the employer or its agents or supervisory employees knew or should have known of the conduct and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action, as feasible. In reviewing these cases, the Commission will consider the extent of the employer's control over non-employees and any other legal responsibility that the employer may have had with respect to the conduct of such non-employees on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;Prevention is the best tool for the elimination of harassment. An employer should take all steps necessary to prevent harassment from occurring, including having an explicit policy against harassment that is clearly and regularly communicated to employees, explaining sanctions for harassment, developing methods to sensitize all supervisory employees on issues of harassment, and informing employees of their right to raise, and the procedures for raising, the issue of harassment under Title VII, the ADEA, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act. An employer should provide an effective complaint procedure by which employees can make their complaints known to appropriate officials who are in a position to act on them.</p>
<p class="noindent">These regulations set forth the specific criteria for evaluating hostile environment harassment cases. As the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposed &#x00A7; 1609.1(c) sets forth the standard of determining whether the alleged harassing conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an intimidating, hostile, or abusive work environment. The standard is whether a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would find the challenged conduct intimidating, hostile, or abusive. In determining whether that standard has been met, consideration is to be given to the perspective of individuals of the claimant's race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability (footnote omitted). Recent case law on this issue emphasizes the importance of considering the perspective of the victim of the harassment rather than adopting notions of acceptable behavior that may prevail in a particular workplace. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872, 878-79, 55 EPD &#x00B6; 40, 520 (9th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards</span>, 760 F. Supp. 1486, 55 EPD &#x00B6; 40,535 (M.D. Fla. 1991). As the <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> court observed, applying existing standards of acceptable behavior runs the risk of reinforcing the prevailing level of discrimination. "Harassers could continue to harass merely because a particular discriminatory practice was common * * *." 924 F.2d at 878.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission explicitly rejects the notion that in order to prove a violation, the plaintiff must prove not only that a reasonable person would find the conduct sufficiently offensive to create a hostile environment, but also that his/her psychological well-being was affected. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems</span>, ___ F. Supp. ___, 60 EPD &#x00B6; 42,070 (M.D. Tenn. 1990) (plaintiff must prove psychological injury), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">curiam</span>, ___ F.2d ___, 60 EPD &#x00B6; 42,071 (6th Cir. 1992), with <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872, 878 n.1 (9th Cir. 1991) (plaintiff need not demonstrate psychological effects). The Supreme Court has granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, ___ U.S. ___, 60 EPD &#x00B6; 42, 072 (1993), and the Commission has joined the Department of Justice in an <span class="Italic">amicus</span> <span class="Italic">curiae</span> brief opposing the Sixth Circuit rule. Brief for the United States and the EEOC (April 1993) (No. 92-1168).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the determination of whether the complained of conduct violates antidiscrimination laws turns on its severity and pervasiveness. Those factors interact. Courts do not typically find violations based on isolated or sporadic use of verbal slurs or epithets; nevertheless, they recognize that an isolated instance of such conduct-particularly when perpetuated by a supervisor-can corrode the entire employment relationship and create a hostile environment. For example, a supervisor's isolated use of inflammatory and patently offensive racial epithets and slurs such as "nigger" and "spic" may be enough to establish a violation. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co.</span>, 792 F. Supp. 628 (E.D. Wis. 1992) (supervisor's infrequent use of racial comments such as "nigger" and "you Black guys are too F***ing dumb to be insurance agents" created a hostile work environment). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Daniels v. Essex Group, Inc.</span>, 937 F.2d 1264, 1274 &#x0026; n.4 (7th Cir. 1991) (court noted that even where harasser was a co-worker, one egregious incident, such as performing KKK ritual in workplace, would create hostile environment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Title VII, the ADEA, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act, all employees should be afforded a working environment free from discriminatory intimidation. Thus, proposed &#x00A7; 1609.1(d) provides that employees have standing to challenge a hostile or abusive work environment even if the harassment is not targeted specifically at them. <span class="Italic">See. e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, 454 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1971) (discriminatory work environment was created for Spanish-surnamed employee by segregation of employer's patients on the basis of national origin), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 406 U.S. 957 (1972); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyard</span>, 760 F. Supp. 1486 (M.D. Ala. 1991) ("behavior that is not directed at a particular individual or group of individuals, but is disproportionately more offensive or demeaning to one sex [can be challenged]").</p>
<p class="noindent">The comment period for the proposed regulations closed on November 30, 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent">In October 1994, the Commission withdrew its notice of proposed rulemaking on Guidelines on Harassment Based on Race, Color, Religion, Gender, National Origin, Age or Disability. However, on a case-by-case basis, the general guidance set forth in the proposed regulations still is followed by the Commission. In <span class="Italic">Olson v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 05930413 (1994), the <span id="Page_922"></span>Commission applied the following guidance to a case alleging both sex-based harassment and harassment based on disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sex-based harassment, that is, conduct directed at an employee because of gender, yet not of a sexual or prurient nature, may give rise to liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The harassing conduct--aggression, intimidation, or hostility of a physical or verbal nature--violates Title VII where it is sufficiently severe or pervasive and is gender-based, occurring merely because of an employee's gender. <span class="Italic">See Andrews v. City of Philadelphia</span>, 895 F.2d 1469 (3d Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Levendos v. Stern Entertainment</span>, 909 F.2d 747 (3d Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Gus Construction Co.</span>, 842 F.2d 1010 (8th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co.</span>, 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129 (D.C. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902888 (November 28, 1990), <span class="Italic">RTR denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910252 (July 5, 1991); EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment N-915-050, No. 137, at 107 (March 19, 1990) (discussing sex-based harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive when it unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The same is true for harassing conduct that is based on disability; that is, acts of harassment directed at an employee because of a physical or mental disability, if sufficiently severe or pervasive, violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, a complainant must show membership in a protected group, such as gender or disability, and severe or pervasive harassing conduct that would not have occurred except for membership in the protected class. <span class="Italic">See Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1482-83; <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, 842 F.2d at 1013-15; <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 833 F.2d at 1482-83; <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d at 1138-40; <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 780 F. Supp. at 761-62; <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902888 at 10-11; EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, N-915-050, No. 137, at 90-107. The severity of the alleged harassment must be determined from a totality of the evidence. One of the critical components in this type of claim, then, is the environment. Evidence of general work atmosphere, as well as incidents of specific hostility directed toward a complainant, is an important factor in analyzing such a claim<span class="Italic">. Hall</span>, 842 F.2d at 1013-15; <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 842 F.2d at 1415; <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902888, at 11. As the Third Circuit noted, pervasive use of derogatory and insulting terms aimed at a protected group may serve as evidence of a hostile environment<span class="Italic">. Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1485.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer is liable for such harassment in a case such as this one when it knew or should have known about the harassing conduct, but failed to take the appropriate preventative or corrective action<span class="Italic">. Hall</span>, 842 F.2d at 1013; <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194, at 6-7. In order to avoid liability, the remedial action taken by the agency must be prompt and reasonably calculated to end the harassment<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> And, as we have previously observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">What is appropriate remedial conduct will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case--the severity and persistence of the harassment, and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194, at 6-7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the totality of the evidence, then, we conclude that appellant has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was subject to sex and disability-based harassment, as a result of the conduct of Supervisor I, and that Supervisor II knew of the harassment and clearly failed to take the appropriate remedial steps. Appellant has shown each of the requisite elements of her claim of harassment here. On the initial element, there is no perceptible dispute that appellant is a member of two protected groups, by virtue of her female gender and her visual disability. Next, the conduct exhibited by Supervisor I was first, severe, and second, pervasive in the following ways.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin with, on the issue of severity, the harassment in this case involved physical, as well as verbal, conduct. The abuse that Supervisor I directed at appellant included the violent, hostile touching on March 23, 1989 during which Supervisor I yelled negative remarks at her in an open work area. The Commission finds this harassing conduct to be severe, based on standards of reasonable conduct in the workplace and on appellant's credible statements that she was hurt both emotionally and physically by this assault. There were other acts of physical aggression as well. Appellant stated under oath that on numerous occasions, Supervisor I caused her body to be unexpectedly jerked back and forth when he surreptitiously approached her from the rear, and violently shook her chair. Moreover, we conclude that the physical assaults in this case were more severe by virtue of the fact that appellant's vision diminished her ability to use self-protective measures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There were additional incidents which increase the pervasiveness of the harassment in this case. We find that Supervisor I made rude, demeaning, profane, and threatening comments to appellant with regularity during the time in question, including, for example, "You're bullshitting me," "You're blowing smoke up my butt," "I'm going to write you up" and "So you're telling me that you can't do it." The preponderance of the evidence also suggests that Supervisor I did give appellant an unreasonable deadline on the special project she performed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also concludes that Supervisor I's conduct was clearly unwelcome and that Supervisor I acted as he did because appellant was a disabled female. It is here especially that we deviate from the previous decision and its suggestion that "[t]he record contains a total of seventeen statements by present and former employees of the agency" and that "[t]hese individuals reported uniformly that [Supervisor I] exhibited a pattern of intimidating and abusive behavior toward his employees, both male and female, both disabled and nondisabled." <span class="Italic">See Pamela Olson v. Jack Kemp, Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922417 at 4 (December 9, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statements by witnesses do not reveal uniformly that Supervisor I's abuse toward his employees was accomplished without regard to gender and disability. In fact, several witnesses provided sworn statements by affidavit supporting appellant's contention that Supervisor I treated females employees worse than he did male employees. Employee C stated that Supervisor I was generally intimidating at work, but that his intimidation tactics were "more focused at women than at men." Employee D suggested that Supervisor I created an "oppressive" work environment, particularly for women. Employee H declared that Supervisor I tended to abuse employees he, Supervisor I, perceived to be weak, more often women than men.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employee G furthermore averred in her affidavit that based on her observations, Supervisor I "push[ed] [appellant] harder because of her handicap," and "treat[ed] [appellant] differently" because of it. And, although the previous decision suggests that witnesses uniformly reported that Supervisor I treated nondisabled and disabled employees equally badly, there is in actuality very little comparative testimony on how Supervisor I treated disabled versus nondisabled employees at work. In addition to Employee G's statements, appellant testified that Supervisor I treated herself and another disabled employee badly. There is other significant evidence, however, that will be discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, going to the issue of harassment based on disability, including, stereotypical slurs and disparaging comments made by Supervisor I about disabled employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the aforementioned evidence, then, at least four witnesses, Employees A, B, E, and F, stated, without qualification, that Supervisor I abused male and female employees alike. Thus, reviewed as a whole, the record demonstrates mixed testimony about how Supervisor I treated employees with regard to gender. There is furthermore some evidence that Supervisor I treated disabled employees less well than employees who had no disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are sworn statements by numerous witnesses, however, which show that Supervisor I made brazen, disparaging comments and open stereotypical slurs about women and individuals with a disability in the workplace. As to women, Employee D averred in his affidavit that he has personally heard Supervisor I "make derogatory remarks about women as a group." Employee G reported hearing Supervisor I favorably compare men as a group to women as a group. As one example, Employee G stated that Supervisor I often criticized the speed of female employees, as opposed to male employees. Employee M declared that Supervisor I made improper remarks about women, often referring to them as "babes." Employee N, who described herself as strong and honest, reported that Supervisor I told her that she "did not fit in the mold of other submissive women."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to persons with a disability, Employee M averred in his affidavit that he had personally heard Supervisor I make unfavorable remarks about disabled employees on several occasions. In fact, when Employee M himself considered applying for a supervisory position in 1989, Supervisor I stopped him in the hall and stated that Employee M's "device" might cause problems for him as a supervisor. In addition, Employee P reported that Supervisor I said at one point that "he does not think that handicapped people should be taking jobs from able-bodied people."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is additional evidence as well on the issue of whether Supervisor I treated appellant as he did because appellant was a disabled female. The record reveals other instances of Supervisor I inappropriately touching individuals, as he indisputably did to appellant, in the workplace. Almost exclusively, those who were inappropriately touched--either violently or sexually--were female. Employee M stated under oath that Supervisor I had "improperly touched" Employee M's own wife when she worked for the agency. Employee P, a female, averred in her affidavit that Supervisor I attempted to have sex with her against her will by inappropriately touching her breasts and lips. [Exhibit] 25. Moreover, there was testimony from a disabled female, Employee G, that Supervisor I had on one occasion poked her in the chest, as he did with appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, on the issue of whether appellant was exposed to unwelcome, severe or pervasive harassment due to her sex and disability, we observe that the weight of the evidence on this issue--direct, circumstantial, and in large part, first-hand evidence--indicates that <span id="Page_923"></span>appellant was harassed by Supervisor I, due to her sex and disability, as she alleged in her complaint. We should also point out that where appellant's and Supervisor I's accounts of certain events differ dramatically or are in total opposition, we find that appellant is the more credible witness. Appellant raised this point as grounds for her request to reconsider, and it is an important one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude after carefully viewing the entire record, that Supervisor I made misrepresentations or lied about a number of important factual issues. On these issues, appellant's testimony is consistently corroborated by numerous witnesses, and Supervisor I's version of the facts stands alone. We find this to be the case on, for example, the issue of the context in which the poking incident took place. Supervisor I suggests that the incident was "light and joking" in contrast to appellant's sworn statements and the statement of Employee H who witnessed the incident and heard appellant cry out in pain. Also, on the issue of whether he violently shook appellant's chair on a number of occasions, Supervisor I denied that he grabbed and shook the chairs of individuals at work. Multiple witnesses with personal knowledge, however, reported that Supervisor I had in fact committed this very act, either to them directly or to another employee in their presence. The Commission concludes, therefore, that a preponderance of the evidence in the record demonstrates that appellant was subject to sex and disability-based harassment, as a result of the conduct of Supervisor I.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the last element of appellant's claim of discrimination, we conclude that Supervisor II had direct knowledge of the harassment imposed by Supervisor I and clearly failed to take immediate, appropriate remedial action. Virtually all the evidence supports this conclusion. Appellant told Supervisor II about the March 23, 1989 physical assault the day after it happened, however, appellant got the impression that Supervisor II minimized the incident, suggesting that appellant was "hypersensitive" to Supervisor I's conduct. Supervisor I's sworn statements show that Supervisor II did not properly communicate to him the severity of the March 23, 1989 poking incident. The following day, according to Supervisor I, Supervisor II mentioned to him that a "touching" might be "construed" as harassment, and intimated that appellant might be overly sensitive to such conduct because of an abusive parent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also described a meeting several months after this incident in which appellant, Supervisor I, Supervisor II, and another employee discussed appellant's shaky relationship with Supervisor I. The meeting was hostile, according to appellant, and Supervisor II dismissed appellant's concerns about Supervisor I as "a difference in communication styles."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 8. Supervisor II also, for example, refused to concede that Supervisor I's statement "I'll write you up" could reasonably be understood as a threat or that a pattern of such threats were occurring. The record indicates instead that Supervisor II may have had a tendency to otherwise put the blame on appellant because Supervisor II also averred in her affidavit that, at this meeting, it was her impression that appellant "was using her handicap as an excuse" for not being able to complete a certain part of a task Supervisor I wanted her to do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Numerous employees in addition observed that Supervisor II was known to "look the other way" when confronted with evidence of Supervisor I's inappropriate or unlawful conduct openly exhibited with appellant, and similarly, with other female or disabled employees. As one example, Employee L averred that, in her own situation, she had reported Supervisor I's offensive conduct to Supervisor II, as well as her own efforts to try and stop him. Supervisor II, according to Employee L, took the matter as a joke, saying, "The man's from New York, that's the personality of people from New York, and you just have to accept it." Thus, to the limited extent that Supervisor II did not have direct knowledge of Supervisor I's harassing conduct with appellant, we will impute knowledge, because Supervisor I's conduct was pervasive and openly practiced, was well-known, and occurred with more than one employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, then, the Commission concludes that appellant has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was subjected to a pattern and practice of sex and disability-based harassment....</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has continued to use the formulation expressed in its proposed regulations on harassment in individual cases. For example, in <span class="Italic">Behrens v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01945787 (1995), the Commission gave the following general definition of harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The harassment of an employee that would not occur, but for the employee's race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability or religion is unlawful, if it is sufficiently patterned or pervasive<span class="Italic">. McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138-1139 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The Commission has adopted the position that sex-based harassment, conduct not involving sexual activity or language, may give rise to Title VII liability if it is sufficiently patterned or pervasive, and directed at employees because of their sex. Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, N-915-050, March 19, 1990. To prove sex-based harassment, appellant must establish that: (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she was subject to harassment that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive work environment; and (3) the harassment was based on her sex<span class="Italic">. Levendos v. Stern Entertainment</span>, 909 F.2d 747 (3rd Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">The key in these cases remains, just as in sexual harassment cases, that the complainant must prove the harassment is based on a status protected under Title VII, the ADEA or the Rehabilitation Act. Proving harassment in general simply does not suffice. As the complainant discovered in <span class="Italic">Behrens</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that appellant has met the first element of proving a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex-based harassment, inasmuch as she is a member of a protected group. As part of the second element, however, appellant must show that she was subjected to harassment and that it was sufficiently pervasive or severe to create a hostile work environment. In determining that a working environment is hostile, factors to consider are the frequency of the alleged discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, and if it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance<span class="Italic">. Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, ___ U.S. ___; 114 S. Ct. 367 (1993). The preponderance of the evidence in the record, including the testimony of appellant and other workers, reflects that the Warehouse Foreman and appellant had an acrimonious work relationship. The Commission notes that there was no hearing held in this case; however, the Commission determines that appellant provided credible, detailed testimony of the incidents which she claimed were tantamount to harassment. In addition, the documents submitted by appellant's supervisor to her supervisor, the second level supervisor, reveal that there was a tension between the warehouse and the warehouse office which stemmed in part from the functions of each office. It is clear from the record that this tension was most clearly reflected in the relationship between appellant and the Warehouse Foreman.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, with regard to the E-mail policy, it is clear that the policy applied to all employees; however, appellant established that the policy most greatly impacted her because in her position, she was required to have the most contact with warehouse personnel. The agency provided no evidence to contradict this assertion. Moreover, the Warehouse Foreman admitted to making the "rude" notation, and he acknowledged that he instructed appellant to do more research as alleged in allegation (B), yet there was no evidence in the record that he treated other employees in the same manner. It is also clear that the second level supervisor attempted to reconcile the problems of the two offices on numerous occasions. When this evidence is coupled with appellant's credible testimony, the Commission finds that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that appellant was harassed, and given that it occurred over a period of months on a consistent basis, we find that it was pervasive in nature. Moreover, there is ample evidence in the record that the work environment became hostile as a result of the deteriorating relationship between appellant and the Warehouse Foreman. Although the agency claims that no effect from the Warehouse Foreman's actions was evident on appellant's work performance, appellant claimed that it became more and more difficult to perform her job, and her claims were well documented with her supervisor. What is unclear, however, is whether or not the actions of the Warehouse Foreman were directed at appellant because of her sex, the third element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex-based harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the record does not support appellant's claim that the Warehouse Foreman harassed her on the basis of her sex. We make this finding because there is virtually no comparative evidence in the record. Specifically, there is no evidence that the Warehouse Foreman treated other male employees differently. Although reference is made to one male who testified that the E-mail policy also applied to him, there is evidence in the record establishing that this comparative was not similarly situated to appellant, given that he had little need to communicate with the warehouse personnel. It is clear from the record that, by virtue of her position, appellant had the most contact with the warehouse. Indeed, we note that her main assignment was to monitor the inventory in the warehouse. By its nature, it appears that this position created a tension between appellant and the Warehouse Foreman. It is appellant's burden to establish all the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Due to the lack of evidence establishing that the harassment was directed at appellant because of her sex, and not because of the position she held, the Commission finds that appellant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex-based harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the analysis of hostile environment harassment on other bases is not significantly different from the analysis of sexual harassment hostile environment cases.</p>
