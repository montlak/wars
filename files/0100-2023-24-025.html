<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-24b"><span id="Page_1289"></span><span class="space">3.</span> Epileptic Seizures; Diabetics</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Knight v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976645 (2000), the Commission found the agency's "send home" policy that required an epileptic complainant to be evaluated by a physician after every seizure before returning to work was discriminatory. The Commission found the agency's policy was based on an "unsubstantiated perception" instead of an individualized evaluation of the risk. Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kathleen P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720150036 (2016), found that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it fired the complainant, a Transportation Security Officer, after she suffered two seizures. The agency's physician concluded that the first seizure was an isolated incident, but noted that if she suffered another seizure, she would no longer be fit for the position. After her second seizure, the agency removed the complainant from her position citing to the agency's medical guidelines. The Commission reversed the removal, in <span class="Italic">Kathleen P</span>., finding that the agency could not rely solely on agency guidelines without also conducting an individualized assessment of the complainant's medical condition and noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that Complainant was removed from her TSO position based upon medical guidelines, which provides that an individual is disqualified from the position "with complex partial seizures within the past year, with or without treatment or with side effects from the treatment; or with severe seizures that interfere with activities of daily living." When the Agency learned of Complainant's first seizure, resulting from a reduction in Complainant's medication levels due to influenza, the Agency's physician concluded the seizure was an isolated incident and did not recommend termination. Complainant was cautioned that if another seizure occurred, he would suggest that she not return to TSO duty. Therefore, in this case, the AJ found that the guidelines were interpreted to mean that two epileptic seizures, of any nature, within one year was disqualifying.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the AJ, the Agency's physician failed to explain why the two seizures experienced by Complainant, that last several minutes and requires her to sleep for approximately twelve hours to fully recover, were deemed either "complex" or "severe." He also failed to describe how the seizures interfered with daily living. In contrast, Complainant's physician deemed the events as "breakthrough" seizures that were not debilitating. Further, direct management did not observe any impact on Complainant's ability to perform her job duties, other than needing a day off occasionally. Therefore, we find that the AJ's determination that Complainant was "qualified" for the position is supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that Complainant's condition might result in injury to herself or the traveling public, the AJ found that the Agency failed to perform an individualized assessment. A person is a "direct threat" if he or she poses a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of him or herself or others which cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The "direct threat" evaluation must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to perform the essential functions of the job. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); 29 C.F.R. 1630 App. 1630.15(b) and (c); <span class="Italic">Nathan v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070014 (July 19, 2013). <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here the Agency contends that Complainant cannot safely perform the TSO duties because she has had two epileptic seizures in a year. In order to exclude an individual on the basis of future possible injury, the Agency must show there is a significant risk by establishing a high probability of substantial harm. A speculative or remote risk is insufficient. The Agency must show more than that an individual with a disability stands some slightly increased risk of harm. The burden of showing a significant risk is on the Agency. <span class="Italic">Selix v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (Mar. 16, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, such a finding must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and 4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. v. Echazabal</span>, 536 U.S. 73 (2002); <span class="Italic">Cook v. State of Rhode Is., Dep't of Mental Health Retardation and Hospitals</span>, 10 F.3d 17 (1st Cir. 1993). A determination of significant risk cannot be based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation, or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. Rather, the agency must gather information and base its decision on substantial information regarding the individual's work and medical history. <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. v. Echazabal, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency, its physician only reviewed the emergency room paperwork regarding the second seizure provided by Complainant, and consulted the Agency's medical guidelines. Even on appeal, the Agency fails to address the factors comprising an individualized assessment.</p>
<p class="noindent">While it may be difficult to quantify how much medical evidence constitutes enough to establish a direct threat, what the Commission's ultimate inquiry will be is whether the agency conducted an individualized assessment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the failure to conduct an individualized inquiry in the case of a complainant suffering from diabetes was discrimination where the agency denied the complainant a TDY assignment based on speculation of injury. In <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Secretary of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01A24984.txt">01A24984</a> (2004), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency considered complainant a direct threat to himself by assuming that severe harm could result from complainant's allegedly "uncontrolled" diabetes. The concerns of the agency pertained to future harm. If complainant were on the two shots a day regimen and were to receive the TDY in Germany, the agency physician feared that complainant would risk increased stress, a factor which may affect and aggravate diabetes and insulin dosage, and a disruption to his normal routine and normal dietary regimen, factors which could lead to a "potential risk of serious medical problem such as insulin shock and hyperglycemia...[, and] require immediate emergency treatment not necessarily available to the [complainant] at the TDY site." He also expressed concern that "these conditions c[ould] result in convulsion, coma, or even death." Conjecturing that an aggravation to complainant's condition could require medical treatment, frequent trips to the Heidelberg Army Medical Center, and a possible need to return complainant to CONUS, the agency physician asserted that "all of these potential problems could affect and compromise the agency's mission." Despite all of this speculation, the agency did not present any evidence that would show why complainant is prevented from taking two shots of insulin per day while he is traveling to Germany or working in his new position. We further note that the agency has failed to present evidence that complainant has missed any work due to his diabetes. In contrast to the agency physician's findings, complainant's physician stated in his June 4, 2002 letter that complainant's blood sugar was under control. The record reflects that complainant's physician had been monitoring complainant's condition for several months and was best-suited to opine about the level of control complainant had over his diabetes. <span class="Italic">See Shobert v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01991157 (August 29, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although there was a speculative risk involved, complainant's medical and work histories further rebut the assumption that a significant risk of harm to complainant existed if he were to travel abroad. Complainant averred and the record reflects that he has performed his duties in a fully successful manner and has no physical restrictions, with the exception that he is required to eat small meals throughout the day. In this respect, the agency physician based his decision to deny complainant's TDY on complainant's morning blood sugar self-monitoring of 244 mg/dl; the June 4, 2002 letter from complainant's physician, which stated that complainant's diabetes was under good control; and one blood sugar test ordered by the agency physician, which resulted in a blood sugar reading of 180 mg/dl. The agency physician, however, never contacted complainant's physician, and did not obtain a complete set of complainant's medical records, but instead based his decision on a one-time reading by complainant and one blood sugar test ordered by the agency. <span class="Italic">See EEOC v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</span> 246 F. Supp.2d 916, 925 (W.D. Term. 2002) (Employer did not articulate a legitimate reason for its decision to withdraw offer of employment to insulin-dependent applicant where employer's physician did not personally examine applicant, contact his treating physician, or obtain complete set of his medical records.). In addition, the agency physician made much of the fact that complainant's "HbAlc level of 9.7 remained high," where "HbAlc of less than 6 is considered to be within normal limits." He also noted that the one blood sugar test to which he sent complainant resulted in a 180 mg/dl, while a normal range is 70-110 mg/dl."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency's use of a generalized statistic is not necessarily true for complainant, and the agency's conjecture regarding the possibility that complainant may become ill is too remote a future circumstance to be considered a direct threat, one factor of which is the imminence of the potential harm. Although many of the statements the agency made about people with diabetes are true for many individuals who have the disease, the agency failed to take into account complainant's medical history and work history and to look past the generalizations about what it means to have diabetes when it made the decision not to recommend him for a TDY. <span class="Italic">See Harrison, supra; Selix, supra.</span> By engaging in assumptions about complainant's experience with his health condition, the agency officials did not conduct an individualized assessment of his condition. Although the agency physician used some objective measurements and made an effort to weigh the potential harm of complainant being sent to Germany, the agency used generalizations to arrive at the conclusion that complainant presented a direct threat.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's successful work history and his physician's finding that his diabetes is "under control" shows that complainant is capable of performing the essential functions of the TDY assignment. Complainant is a person who is currently able to control his diabetes. He has the qualifications necessary to perform a TDY assignment. Accordingly, we find that complainant is a qualified individual with a disability, and that the agency has not shown that his diabetes constitutes a direct threat, either to himself, or others. Complainant has met his burden of <span id="Page_1290"></span>establishing that he was subjected to disability discrimination when the agency improperly denied complainant the TDY to Germany in violation of the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar case, <span class="Italic">Boots v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/03A40060.txt">03A40060</a> (2004), the Commission found that the agency failed to properly invoke the direct threat defense where it relied solely upon a Department of Transportation regulation that was not binding on the agency. In <span class="Italic">Boots</span>, the complainant had a seizure disorder that required he take medication. The agency removed the complainant from his position as a tractor-trailer operator based on a recently implemented DOT regulation disqualifying individuals taking anti-seizure medication from operating commercial vehicles despite the complainant's 15-year record of driving tractor-trailers without an accident. Because the regulation was not binding on the Postal Service and because it did not conduct an individualized inquiry into the threat posed by the complainant's medication, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Boots</span> found the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner began his employment with the agency in 1998. At the time he was hired, petitioner disclosed that he had been diagnosed with seizure disorder for which he took anti-seizure medication. To occupy the position of Tractor-Trailer Operator, petitioner was required to hold a valid CDL. When he was hired by the agency, petitioner was in possession of a valid CDL issued by the State of Florida, and had worked as a Tractor-Trailer Operator for ten years without any difficulties. Petitioner's CDL was renewed on February 6, 2001 with an expiration date of April 5, 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner underwent a periodic medical evaluation conducted by the agency's contract physician, who on July 8, 2002 advised the agency that petitioner was not qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle under the DOT regulations because of his use of anti-seizure medication. The agency's medical officer concurred in this assessment. However, the medical officer expressed reservations as to whether, in view of petitioner's problem-free history, it was actually necessary to remove him from his Tractor-Trailer Operator position. On July 9,2002, petitioner's personal physician found that petitioner was qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle, and signed the necessary medical certificate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 23, 2002, the agency proposed to reassign petitioner to the Mailhandler craft, but did not offer him a specific position. Rather, petitioner was advised to apply for a Mailhandler position "while the vacancies still exist." It appears that petitioner was subsequently offered a Mailhandler position, but declined the offer. However, the record contains no copy of an actual job offer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 15, 2002, the agency proposed petitioner's removal on the ground that he was unable to perform the duties of his Tractor-Trailer Operator position. On December 20, 2002, the agency issued petitioner a Notice of Removal, effective December 21, 2002. The agency noted that DOT had revised its regulations in 2000 to disqualify individuals who take anti-seizure medication from holding CDLs. The agency stated that petitioner had been offered, and declined, a Mailhandler position, and that no other positions were available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his April 29, 2003 decision, the MSPB AJ upheld petitioner's removal. The AJ assumed that petitioner's medical condition constituted an actual or perceived disability. The AJ then found that petitioner was not a "qualified individual with a disability" because he could not meet the qualification standard for the Tractor-Trailer Operator position, and therefore could not perform the essential functions of his position with or without reasonable accommodation. The AJ noted that the agency had offered petitioner reassignment as a Mailhandler, which offer petitioner had rejected. The Board denied petitioner's petition for review of the AJ's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC regulations provide that the Commission has jurisdiction over mixed case appeals on which the MSPB has issued a decision that makes determinations on allegations of discrimination. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.303 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. The Commission must determine whether the decision of the MSPB with respect to the allegation of discrimination constitutes a correct interpretation of any applicable law, rule, regulation or policy directive, and is supported by the evidence in the record as a whole. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.305(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the decision of the MSPB does not constitute a correct interpretation of applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policy directives, and is not supported by the evidence of record as a whole. The Commission therefore DIFFERS with the decision of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to establish a disability discrimination claim under the Rehabilitation Act, an individual must demonstrate that he or she: (1) is an "individual with a disability"; (2) is "qualified" for the position held or desired, i.e., can perform the essential functions of the position with or without accommodation; and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability. <span class="Italic">See Swanks v. WMATA,</span> 179 F.3d 929, 934 (D.C. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Heyman v. Queens Village Committee for Mental Health for Jamaica Community Adolescent Program,</span> 198 F. 3d 68 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner has a diagnosis of seizure disorder, for which he takes anti-seizure medication. The agency, being aware of these facts, would not permit petitioner to operate a commercial motor vehicle, i.e., to work in a class of jobs. By virtue of the foregoing, the evidence of record demonstrates that petitioner is an "individual with a disability" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(g), 1630.2(m). Petitioner, however, must also establish that he is a "qualified individual with a disability." It is undisputed that petitioner had safely operated tractor-trailers for at least 15 years at the time of his removal. It is further undisputed that the agency relied solely upon the DOT regulation in removing petitioner from his position as a Tractor-Trailer Operator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may require, as a qualification standard, that an individual not pose a direct threat. A "direct threat" is defined as a "significant risk of substantial harm" that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The agency has the burden of proof regarding whether there is a significant risk of substantial harm. <span class="Italic">See Massengill v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01964890 (July 14, 2000). A determination as to whether an individual poses such a risk cannot be based on an employer's subjective evaluation or, except in cases of the most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. <span class="Italic">See Selix v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000). Rather, after identifying the risk, the employer must conduct an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). This assessment must be based on objective evidence, not subjective perceptions, irrational fears, patronizing attitudes, or stereotypes about the nature or effects of a particular disability or of disability generally. Relevant evidence may include input from the individual with a disability, his work history or experiences in previous positions, and opinions of medical doctors who have expertise in the particular disability or direct knowledge of the individual with a disability. If it is determined that an individual does pose a direct threat because of his or her disability, the employer must determine whether a reasonable accommodation would eliminate the risk of harm or reduce it to an acceptable level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency failed to conduct an individualized assessment of petitioner. Rather, the agency, solely in reliance on a DOT regulation which it is not required to observe, deemed petitioner disqualified from holding a CDL and removed him from his position as a Tractor-Trailer Operator without regard to the fact that petitioner had been seizure-free and operating a tractor-trailer successfully and safely for at least 15 years. It is noted that the Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="Italic">Albertsons, Inc. v. Kirkingburg,</span> 527 U.S. 555 (1999), is inapposite to the case at bar. The employer in that case was required to abide by the DOT regulations regarding operation of commercial vehicles. By contrast, the agency is specifically exempt from the DOT regulations, and observes the regulations on a strictly voluntary basis. In this regard, the MSPB AJ erred in finding that the regulations were mandatory upon the agency. The agency therefore should have conducted an individualized assessment of petitioner rather than relying on the mere existence of the DOT regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision was affirmed by the Special Panel in <span class="Italic">Boots v. Postmaster General</span>, 100 MSPR 513 (Spec. Pan. 2005).</p>
