</header>
<p class="noindent">In addition to processing a complaint of discrimination through the employing agency, there are two other methods of administratively pursuing a complaint of discrimination. In some instances, employees within a collective bargaining unit may pursue a complaint of discrimination through a negotiated grievance procedure. In other cases, it is possible to pursue a complaint of discrimination before the Merit Systems Protection Board. A detailed discussion of both options follows.</p>
<p class="noindent">Executive agency employees who are covered by a negotiated grievance procedure that provides for the processing of allegations of discrimination have the option of pursuing discrimination complaints either through the grievance or EEO process, but not both. 5 USC 7121(d). Agencies, such as the U.S. Postal Service, which derive their collective bargaining authority from the National Labor Relations Act instead of the Civil Service Reform Act, are not subject to the prohibition against dual processing of grievances and EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency takes an action against an employee that is within the Jurisdiction of The MSPB, the employee has the option of pursuing his or her complaint through the agency EEO process or before the Board, which can take jurisdiction over the allegations of discrimination. However, it is possible that such an action also could come within the province of the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent">The law and regulations concerning the processing of cases in other forums that raise issues of discrimination are difficult to understand and confusing, at best. Over the years, the overlap of jurisdiction between the negotiated grievance procedure, the MSPB, and the EEOC has led to protracted and duplicative litigation--the very thing that the applicable provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act were designed to prevent. Although both the Board and the Commission have, in the past, issued conflicting and confusing decisions regarding their overlapping jurisdiction, it is worth noting that neither is responsible for creating the jurisdictional overlap. That was the idea of Congress. Happily, there are indications that both the Commission and the Board are trying to clarify the law and regulations in this area. The Commission, through Part 1614 and MD-110, has substantially clarified the processing requirements of these cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonetheless, the discussion of EEO alternatives begins with the caution that there is only so much clarity that can be brought to that which is inherently confusing. Cases that invoke the overlapping Jurisdiction of The MSPB and the EEOC are referred to as "mixed cases." They could just as easily, and probably more accurately, be referred to as "mixed-up cases."</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec20-2"><span class="space">I.</span> NEGOTIATED GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</h2>
<p class="noindent">Allegations of discrimination may be processed through a negotiated grievance procedure under a collective bargaining agreement if allegations of discrimination are not excluded from the grievance procedure. But an employee may not pursue an allegation of discrimination through both the negotiated grievance procedure and the EEO complaint process. The employee must choose one or the other. 5 USC 7121(d). This choice is referred to as an "election of remedies."</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiated grievance procedure should be distinguished from an administrative grievance procedure. Most agencies provide, through regulation, for an administrative grievance procedure that applies to employees not covered by a collective bargaining unit. Section 7121 does not permit the processing of allegations of discrimination under administrative grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01964669 (1997) (there is no provision in 29 CFR Part 1614 that requires an employee to forego the EEO process merely because he has also exercised his rights under an administrative grievance process). It is directed solely to grievance procedures that are subject to collective bargaining by the parties. Employees covered only by an administrative grievance procedure are required to pursue allegations of discrimination via the agency EEO process. An agency may only dismiss an EEO complaint when a grievance on the same matter previously has been filed under a negotiated grievance procedure. It may not dismiss a complaint on the basis that the employee has filed a grievance under an administrative grievance procedure<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Walton v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01955186 (1996); <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05910929 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">To determine whether a member of a particular collective bargaining unit has a right to pursue allegations of discrimination and the procedures for doing so, the contract between the bargaining unit and the agency should be consulted. If the agreement does not specifically exclude processing allegations of discrimination via the grievance procedure, the employee may elect to pursue a complaint of discrimination through the negotiated grievance procedure or the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(a)(2) (parties may exclude any matter from the negotiated grievance procedure).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations, at 29 CFR 1614.301(a), provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a person is employed by an agency subject to 5 USC 7121(d) and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that permits allegations of discrimination to be raised in a negotiated grievance procedure, a person wishing to file a complaint or a grievance on a matter of alleged employment discrimination must elect to raise the matter under either part 1614 or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. An election to proceed under this part is indicated only by the filing of a written complaint; use of the pre-complaint process as described in &#x00A7; 1614.105 does not constitute an election for purposes of this section. An aggrieved employee who files a complaint under this part may not thereafter file a grievance on the same matter. An election to proceed under a negotiated grievance procedure is indicated by the filing of a timely written grievance. An aggrieved employee who files a grievance with an agency whose negotiated agreement permits the acceptance of grievances which allege discrimination may not thereafter file a complaint on the same matter under this part 1614 irrespective of whether the agency has informed the individual of the need to elect or of whether the grievance has raised an issue of discrimination. Any such complaint filed after a grievance has been filed on the same matter shall be dismissed without prejudice to the complainant's right to proceed through the negotiated grievance procedure including the right to appeal to the Commission from a final decision as provided in subpart D of this part. The dismissal of such a complaint shall advise the complainant of the obligation to raise discrimination in the grievance process and of the right to appeal the final grievance decision to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">The regulation may seem simple enough on its face, but it has caused considerable confusion, in part because of a difference in the law with respect to discrimination in the private sector, and in part because of changes brought in by the Civil Service Reform Act. In the private sector, the Supreme Court ruled that the existence of alternative remedies, such as a negotiated grievance procedure, do not preclude an employee from seeking relief under all available avenues simultaneously. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.</span>, 415 U.S. 36, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L. Ed.2d 147 (1974). However, in passing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Congress foreclosed that opportunity for most employees in the federal sector. Pursuant to 5 USC 7121, an employee may raise allegations of discrimination in the EEO process or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. 5 USC 7121(d) specifically provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in its 1992 version of MD-110 at 3-8, provided the following explanation of the relationship between the negotiated grievance procedure and the EEO process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The election to proceed under the negotiated grievance procedure or under part 1614 is set out in this Management Directive in Chapter 2 (EEO Counseling). The underlying principle is that an aggrieved employee who has a choice of forums in which to proceed cannot go forward in more than one forum (unless the employing agency is exempt from coverage of 5 USC 7121(d)). This is true "irrespective of whether the agency has informed the individual of the need to elect or of whether the grievance has raised an issue of discrimination." 1614.301(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the explanation was deleted from the 1999 version of MD-110, it is still valid and an informed election of forum is not required.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 2015 version of MD-110 at 4-5 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employee first files a grievance and thereafter files a complaint of discrimination on the same matter, the complaint must be dismissed without prejudice to the complainant's right to proceed through the negotiated grievance procedure, including the right to appeal to the Commission from a final decision as provided in subpart D of part 1614 (Appeals and Civil Actions). The dismissal of the complaint must advise the complainant of the obligation to raise discrimination allegations in the grievance process and of the right to appeal the final grievance decision to the Commission. 1614.301(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant is employed by an agency that is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement that permits the processing of allegations of discrimination, such allegations must be processed as an EEO complaint under Part 1614. 29 CFR 1614.301(b). Such a complaint is subject to the normal processing requirements discussed in Chapters 2 through 8, above. The exception to this rule is when both the personnel action at issue in the complaint and the employee are subject to the Jurisdiction of The MSPB. In those instances, the employee has a third option which is discussed in the section on Mixed Cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1664"></span>Not all agencies are subject to the provisions of 5 USC 7121(d). For example, see the discussion related to grievance procedures in the U.S. Postal Service, below. 29 CFR 1614.301(c) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a person is employed by an agency not subject to 5 USC 7121(d) and is covered by a negotiated grievance procedure, allegations of discrimination shall be processed as complaints under this part, except that the time limits for processing the complaint contained in &#x00A7; 1614.106 and for appeal to the Commission contained in &#x00A7; 1614.402 may be held in abeyance during processing of a grievance covering the same matter as the complaint if the agency notifies the complainant in writing that the complaint will be held in abeyance pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> MD-110 at 4-5, which explains that "[t]he underlying principle is that an aggrieved employee who has a choice of forums in which to proceed cannot go forward in more than one forum (unless the employing agency is exempt from coverage of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d))."</p>
<p class="noindent">For the procedural and substantive requirements of a particular grievance process, as well as time limits for initiating and completing various stages of the process, the specific applicable collective bargaining agreement should be consulted. Generally, grievance procedures involve a number of steps or stages in which the matter is brought to the attention of progressively higher-level agency officials. Often, the first step of a grievance is to raise the matter orally with the employee's immediate supervisor. In the next stages, grievances are submitted in writing.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a negotiated grievance procedure, the employee has the right to be represented by the union and the union has an obligation to represent the employee. If the matter is not resolved at any of the grievance stages, arbitration may be sought. It is significant to note that only the union can invoke arbitration and not the individual employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">A discussion of arbitration is well beyond the confines of this book. In its simplest form arbitration is a hearing before an impartial arbitrator where both the union and the agency can present evidence, in the form of testimony and documents, and also legal argument on the issue or issues subject to arbitration. The arbitrator issues a decision, called an "award," which is binding on the parties. The arbitrator's award is subject to an appellate process before the Federal Labor Relations Authority. When a party appeals an arbitrator's award to the FLRA, it is known as filing "exceptions" to the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with final agency decisions in the EEO process, the Commission has review authority over decisions on issues of discrimination in the negotiated grievance procedure. Specifically, 29 CFR 1614.401(d) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A grievant may appeal the final decision of the agency, the arbitrator or the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) on the grievance when an issue of employment discrimination was raised in a negotiated grievance procedure that permits such issues to be raised. A grievant may not appeal under this part, however, when the matter initially raised in the negotiated grievance procedure is still ongoing in that process, is in arbitration, is before the FLRA, is appealable to the MSPB or if 5 USC 7121(d) is inapplicable to the involved agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the collective bargaining agreement provides that the union has 20 days to invoke arbitration after receipt of a final agency decision on a grievance, the time period for the complainant to file an appeal with the Commission does not begin to run until the expiration of time period for invoking arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05900781, (1990) (complainant had 20 days from the expiration of time to invoke arbitration to file an appeal with EEOC). <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> was decided under the Commission's former regulations at Part 1613. Under the current regulations, the appeals period has been extended to 30 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.402(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission does not have general jurisdiction to review grievance decisions, arbitration awards, or FLRA decisions. Its jurisdiction is limited only to those awards and decisions involving issues of discrimination. When an allegation of discrimination is raised in the negotiated grievance process, it is error for the arbitrator to fail to consider the issue of discrimination independent of whether the collective bargaining agreement has been violated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gamble v. General Services Administration</span>, 02880007, (1988). Relying on <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1985), the Commission in <span class="Italic">Gamble</span> held that an arbitrator reviewing allegations of discrimination must apply the substantive law of Title VII in the same fashion as would the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency dismisses a complaint on the basis that the allegations of discrimination could have been raised under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, it must do more than merely assert such coverage. In order for the Commission to properly review the dismissal, the agency must provide a copy of the collective bargaining agreement provision which purportedly allows allegations of discrimination to be raised in the negotiated grievance procedure, and a copy of the grievance. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01982721 (1999); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Secretary of Defense, Office of Dependents Education</span>, 01953214 (1996); s<span class="Italic">ee also</span> <span class="Italic">Swain v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01984465 (1999) (evidence that the complainant was at a union meeting where disparate treatment was discussed was not evidence that she had filed a grievance).</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to dismiss an EEO complaint because of a prior election of the negotiated grievance procedure, the agency must establish that both the EEO complaint and the grievance raise the same claim. For example, it was error for the agency to dismiss an EEO complaint over the failure of the agency to promote the complainant to the GS-9 level where her previous grievance sought back pay for work allegedly performed at the GS-9 level. <span class="Italic">Yost v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A11084 (2002).</p>
