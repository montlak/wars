<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-27"><span class="space">3.</span> Commission Review of Agency Programs and Policies</h4>
<p class="noindent">It's not enough that agencies have anti-discrimination programs and policies. They must follow the dictates of MD-715 and would also do well to audit those programs and policies from time to time to ensure compliance. For example, the Commission reviewed the sufficiency of the agency's anti-harassment policy in <span class="Italic">Rosamaria F. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120181068 (2020), when the complainant alleged that her supervisor disclosed her EEO activity, the counselor only interviewed the supervisor during the informal counseling process and "management did not respond to her cries for help and that the Agency's harassment policies only address sexual harassment and never nonsexual harassment." Applying MD-715 requirements, the Commission found the agency's program and policies lacking because it did not inform employees of who they may approach to raise claims, where they must go to file a complaint, who will conduct the investigation, and who will decide whether corrective action is appropriate. The policy further failed to assure the confidentiality of individuals bringing harassment complaints. Ordering the agency to seek technical assistance from the Office of Federal Operations and to correct the policy and program deficiencies, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Rosamaria F.</span> wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have serious concerns regarding the Agency's handling of harassment claims, particularly with regard to the Agency's legal obligation to ensure the confidentiality of such claims, we take this opportunity to review the Agency's anti-harassment policy in its entirety. <span class="Italic">See</span> Executive Order 11478, Sec. 3 ("The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall be responsible for directing and furthering the implementation of the policy of the Government of the United States to provide equal opportunity in Federal employment for all employees or applicants for employment."). After careful consideration of the record, we find that the Agency's anti-harassment policy does not adequately address the Agency's legal obligation to prevent harassment in the workplace. We conclude that the Agency's anti-harassment policy is not in accord with the Commission's Management Directive 715 (MD-715) because the Agency's policy statement does not effectively communicate EEO policies and procedures regarding harassment. Because the preponderant evidence suggests this failure may have contributed to the unlawful disclosure of Complainant's protected EEO activity, as discussed above, we remind the Agency of its legal obligations as set forth below and direct the Agency to comply with the remedial actions listed in the Order herein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's MD-715 is the policy guidance which the Commission provides to federal agencies for their use in establishing and maintaining effective programs of equal employment opportunity under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. MD-715 provides a roadmap for ensuring that all employees and applicants for employment enjoy equality of opportunity in the federal workplace regardless of race, sex, national origin, color, religion, disability, or reprisal for engaging in prior protected EEO activity. Compliance with MD-715 is mandatory for all Executive agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> MD-715 ("Responsibilities") ("Agency Heads are responsible for the following: 1. Ensuring compliance with this Directive and those implementing instructions issued by EEOC in accordance with existing law and authority."). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.103(b)(2) ("This part applies to[.] Executive agencies as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105[.]"); and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102(e) ("Agency [EEO] programs shall comply with this part and the Management Directives and Bulletins that the Commission issues.") (emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is critical to understand the legal requirements with which agencies must comply in order to avoid liability for harassment. Following the United States Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775 (1998) and <span class="Italic">Burlington Indus. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742 (1998), the Commission issued <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> in 1999, advising employers (both public and private sector) to establish anti-harassment policies that contain, at a minimum, the following elements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-A clear explanation of prohibited conduct, including a reference to all of the protected bases;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-Assurance that employees who make claims of harassment or provide information related to such claims will be protected against retaliation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-A clearly described complaint process that provides accessible avenues for complainants;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-Assurance that to the extent possible, the employer will protect the confidentiality of the individuals bringing harassment claims;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-A complaint process that provides a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-Assurance that the employer will take immediate and appropriate corrective action when it determines that harassment has occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission subsequently issued MD-715 on October 1, 2003, which applied the minimum standards and guidelines set forth in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> and <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> to the federal sector (i.e., federal agencies). <span class="Italic">See</span> Model EEO Programs Must Have An Effective Anti-Harassment Program, n.8.5 Sections II (A) and (C) of MD-715 expressly require federal agencies to establish and maintain effective affirmative programs of equal employment opportunity, which show demonstrated commitment from agency leadership and ensure management and program accountability. To this end, agencies must issue a written policy statement signed by the <span id="Page_18"></span>agency head that expresses commitment to EEO and a workplace free of discriminatory harassment, and the development of a comprehensive anti-harassment policy to prevent harassment on all protected bases, including race, color, religion, sex (sexual or nonsexual), national origin, age, disability, and reprisal. In this regard, a comprehensive anti-harassment policy that complies with MD-715 should: establish a separate procedure outside of the EEO complaint process; require a prompt inquiry of all harassment allegations to prevent or eliminate conduct before it rises to the level of unlawful harassment; establish a firewall between the EEO Director and the Anti-Harassment Coordinator to avoid a conflict of interest; and ensure that the EEO Office informs the anti-harassment program of all EEO counseling activity alleging harassment. See Instructions to Federal Agencies for MD-715 Section I The Model EEO Program, Part III. Element C (B); <span class="Italic">see also Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, Part V(C)(1)("Policy and Complaint Procedure").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is simply not enough to create an anti-harassment policy. MD-715 expressly requires agencies to effectively communicate EEO policies and procedures to all employees. Specifically, agencies must inform their employees of their rights and responsibilities pursuant to the EEO process, anti-harassment program, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process, reasonable accommodation program, and behaviors that could result in discipline. Methods of dissemination include training, webinars, brochures, emails, or other types of written communication. Instructions to Federal Agencies for MD-715 Section I The Model EEO Program, Part I. Element A (B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We remind agencies that failure to effectively communicate anti-harassment policies not only violates MD-715 but may also expose them to liability. In this regard, we note that the first prong of the affirmative defense for harassment liability under <span class="Italic">Faragher, supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, requires a showing by the employer that it undertook reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such reasonable care generally requires an employer to establish, disseminate, and enforce an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure and to take other reasonable steps to prevent and correct harassment. We emphasize that a federal agency's formal, internal EEO complaint process does not, by itself, fulfill its obligation to exercise reasonable care. That process only addresses complaints of violations of the federal EEO laws, while the Court, in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, made clear that an employer should encourage employees "to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive." <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 2270. Furthermore, the EEO process is designed to assess whether the agency is liable for unlawful discrimination and does not necessarily fulfill the agency's obligation to undertake immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> at n.57.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, while we acknowledge that the Agency issued a Workplace Anti-Harassment Policy Statement on May 1, 2018, outlining its obligation to prevent harassment, we conclude that this policy fails to effectively communicate EEO policies and procedures in accordance with MD-715 because it does not: 1) clearly establish the complaint procedure, including the appropriate channels for filing a complaint, that is separate from the EEO process; and 2) ensure confidentiality to the extent possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the first deficiency, we note that the Agency's Workplace Anti-Harassment Policy Statement states that "any Sailor, Marine, or civilian employee who encounters workplace harassment should report the incident through appropriate channels." As noted above, however, MD-715 requires agencies to clearly inform their employees of their rights and responsibilities pursuant to their anti-harassment programs. While we acknowledge that the Agency's policy statement informs employees of their right to "report the incident through appropriate channels," we find this rather vague statement to be inconsistent with MD-715 because it does not notify employees of who they may approach to raise claims. As explained in our report, Model EEO Programs Must Have An Effective Anti-Harassment Program, a model EEO program must clearly describe the complaint process, particularly the agency officials who can receive harassment claims. We further explained in our report that agencies, in establishing model EEO programs, should consider designating at least one official outside an employee's chain of command to accept claims of harassment. Indeed, agencies should ideally provide multiple points of contact for the employee, such that all claims need not go through the chain of command. In this case, it is clear that the Agency did not designate anyone to be the "go to" person for reporting harassment, much less multiple points of contact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize the importance of clearly delineating channels of communication for reporting harassment, particularly in light of cases such as this where a complainant does not feel comfortable approaching the very people who are responsible for the conduct they are reporting or have reported in the past.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that agencies, as part of their legal obligation to establish procedures to prevent all forms of discrimination, including harassment, must identify the investigation process, including where to file the complaint, who will conduct the investigation, and who will make the decision for corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Model EEO Programs Must Have An Effective Anti-Harassment Program, Part I (C). Here, our review of the Agency's Workplace Anti-Harassment Policy Statement, shows that the Agency simply noted that its anti-harassment policy is "separate and apart from any administrative, negotiated grievance, or statutory complaint process that covers allegations of harassment, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity complaint process." There is no mention of where an employee must go to file a complaint, who will conduct the investigation, and who will make the decision for corrective action. To fulfill its legal obligations under MD-715, the Agency should develop complaint procedures that are separate from the EEO process and clearly establish the complaint procedure in accordance with our guidelines. <span class="Italic">See</span> Model EEO Programs Must Have An Effective Anti-Harassment Program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a clearly-described complaint process, the policy must contain the time frames and responsible officials for the intake, investigation, and decision-making stages of the process. Two EEOC appellate decisions provide guidelines for time frames involving prompt investigations and immediate corrective actions. For the investigation to be prompt, an EEOC decision found the agency should have started the investigation within 10 days of receiving notice of a harassment allegation. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120123232 (May 21, 2015); <span class="Italic">see also</span> MD-715, Part G, Question C.2.a.5. As to immediate corrective actions, another EEOC decision found the agency should have reached a decision and taken corrective action within 60 calendar days of receiving notice of the allegation. <span class="Italic">See Tammy S. v. Dep't of Defense (Defense Intelligence Agency)</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120084008 (June 6, 2014). As such, the Agency's policy must include time frames for the intake, investigation, and decision-making stages of the anti-harassment complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with regard to the second deficiency, we again remind the Agency that complainants are generally entitled to confidentiality with regard to not only their EEO complaints, but their claims of harassment as well. Indeed, the right to confidentiality is an important hallmark of a model EEO program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained in our <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, an employer should clearly inform its employees that it will protect the confidentiality of harassment allegations to the extent possible. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, Part V(C)(1)(c)("Confidentiality"). While we recognize that an employer cannot guarantee complete confidentiality, since it cannot conduct an effective investigation without revealing certain information to the alleged harasser and potential witnesses, information about the allegation of harassment should be shared only with those who need to know about it. Records relating to harassment complaints should be kept confidential on the same basis. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Federal agencies, as part of their legal obligation to establish and maintain model EEO programs under MD-715, must ensure the confidentiality of all harassment allegations, to the extent possible, and effectively communicate to employees that their EEO activity will not be disclosed without their authorization, except in limited circumstances as provided by law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the Agency's Workplace Anti-Harassment Policy Statement reveals serious shortcomings with regard to this obligation. In this regard, we note that the Agency's policy statement makes no assurances that the Agency will protect the confidentiality of individuals bringing harassment complaints to the fullest extent possible. In fact, the Agency's policy statement contains no mention of any right to confidentiality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is a clear failure to communicate, which undermines the effectiveness of the Agency's anti-harassment program, as managers may unknowingly violate the law and employees may be discouraged from reporting harassment without assurances of confidentiality. MD-715 expressly requires management and program accountability, which involves putting employees and management officials on notice of their rights and responsibilities. As was demonstrated in this case where a Complainant's supervisor disclosed her EEO activity to someone without a need to know, it is critically important that an agency's anti-harassment policy inform its employees of the legal obligation to ensure the confidentiality of Complainant's protected EEO activity, including harassment allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Agency's Workplace Anti-Harassment Policy Statement does not meet the standards as required by MD 715, our <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> and our Model EEO Programs Must Have An Effective Anti-Harassment Program guidance. In particular, the Agency's <span id="Page_19"></span>policy does not set out with specificity the complaint procedures by which an employee may raise a claim of harassment, including time frames for the processing of the harassment allegations as well as naming officials who can receive such claims. Second, the Agency's policy does not provide notice of the requisite confidentiality accorded to the filing of claims of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(a)(2), to remedy a finding of discrimination, the Commission may order an agency to provide corrective, curative or preventive actions to ensure that violations of the law similar to those found will not recur. Here, as discussed above, the Agency's anti-harassment policy does not comply with the Commission's MD-715 policy guidance because it does not clearly establish the complaint procedure, including the appropriate channels for filing a complaint, and ensure confidentiality to the extent possible. We would be remiss to take no action to correct the Agency's clear violations of MD-715. As the Agency is not in compliance with MD-715 regarding its anti-harassment policy, under circumstances that are capable of being repeated, we order the Agency to seek technical assistance from the Commission's Office of Federal Operations, Federal Sector Programs, and to correct the deficiencies in the policy identified above. This will ensure that the agency is taking the necessary preventive steps to avoid liability for harassment in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent">After finding that the agency's anti-harassment policy was not in compliance with MD-715, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Foster B. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2019005682 (2021), ordered the agency to "seek technical assistance from the Commission's Office of Federal Operations, Federal Sector Programs, and to correct the deficiencies in the policy identified."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Darius C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020000613 (2021), the Commission found that a last-minute need for an accommodation did not rise to the level of undue burden, especially where the disability is known and accommodated in the past. In that case, the agency's failure to provide interpretive services to a hearing-impaired employee led the Commission to audit the agency's reasonable accommodation manual. Finding it lacking, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Darius C</span>., the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's MD-715 is the policy guidance which the Commission provides to federal agencies for their use in establishing and maintaining effective programs of equal employment opportunity under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. MD-715 provides a roadmap for ensuring that all employees and applicants for employment enjoy equality of opportunity in the federal workplace regardless of race, sex, national origin, color, religion, disability, or reprisal for engaging in prior protected EEO activity. Compliance with MD-715 is mandatory for all Executive agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Management Directive 715 (MD-715) ("Responsibilities") ("Agency Heads are responsible for the following: 1. Ensuring compliance with this Directive and those implementing instructions issued by EEOC in accordance with existing law and authority."). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.103(b)(2) ("This part applies to...Executive agencies as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105..."); and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102(e) ("Agency [EEO] programs shall comply with this part and the Management Directives and Bulletins that the Commission issues").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we acknowledge that the Agency provided a copy of its April 2017 Reasonable Accommodation, An Interactive Process Handbook EL-307 (Handbook) regarding reasonable accommodation. The Handbook generally outlines the Agency's policy and obligations on procedures, guidance, and instructions on reasonable accommodation matters. While the Handbook does not cover details regarding accommodations for hearing-impaired or deaf employees, it does refer individuals to a separate Management Instruction (MI) guideline titled, MI Providing Communication Accommodations for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, EL-670-2013-6, and last updated September 9, 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While this MI covers a variety of matters related to accommodations for the deaf and hard of hearing, we conclude that the MI fails to effectively communicate the EEO policies and procedures in accordance with MD-715 because it does not clearly establish that written, exchanged notes do not qualify as an effective, reasonable accommodation. In the instant complaint, the Agency argued that the May 13, 2020 emergency meeting qualified as an exigent circumstance under the MI. The Agency argued that as such, management did not violate Complainant's rights when they only provided passed notes regarding the COVID-19 emergency meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, providing written materials does not excuse an agency from its obligation to provide a deaf employee with an interpreter simply because the employee can otherwise understand written material. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05880750 (Apr. 18, 1989). The MI's guidelines fail to make this abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the MI provides that management is not in violation of the MI if there is a cancellation or failure of an in-person interpreter to appear as scheduled. The MI deems a cancellation or no-show as an exigent circumstance which releases the Agency of its obligation to provide interpretation services at an event. The MI further only requires the Agency to provide an accommodation as soon as "reasonably" as possible. This policy fails to consider that should there be a cancellation or a no-show, the Agency still has effective alternative methods, such as Video Remote Interpreting (VRI), or Video Relay Service (VRS), and should make every reasonable effort to provide such alternative resources to the employee(s) on the same day as the oriGINAlly scheduled in-person interpretation. The current MI indicates that should an in-person interpreter cancel or fail to show, then an Agency is free of its obligations until it can "reasonably" reschedule. What the MI guidelines fail to make clear is that should in-person interpretation cancel or is a no-show, then the Agency is still obligated to attempt scheduling of VRI or VRS services. <span class="Italic">See Coralee H. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172277 (Feb. 15, 2019). To this end, we find that the Agency shall work with the Commission's Federal Sector Programs to update and issue its reasonable accommodation procedures as ordered below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Repeated failures to comply with Commission orders or to timely submit reports or evidence of compliance may result in an audit of the agency's program. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Henry L. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 2020002246 (2020), where the Commission found that the agency was 13 months late filing its ordered report of compliance. The Commission noted 20 other pending cases in which the agency failed to submit requested reports and/or evidence and ordered the agency to submit a written report detailing its compliance efforts, identifying problem areas in its program and an action plan to cure those deficiencies in <span class="Italic">Henry L</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulations 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.502(a) and &#x00A7; 1614.503 provide that relief ordered in a final EEOC decision is "mandatory and binding" on the agency. The regulations also provide that, on behalf of the Commission, its Office of Federal Operations (OFO) "shall take all necessary action to ascertain whether the agency is implementing the decision of the Commission." Finally, the regulations provide that failure to implement EEOC orders will subject the agency to a variety of enforcement actions, including the issuance of a notice to show cause to the head of the agency, a referral to the Office of Special Counsel, and/or judicial enforcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, on February 24, 2020, the Agency submitted a brief titled, "Agency Response to Petitioner's Request for Compensatory Damages," which addresses Petitioner's request for compensatory damages and leave restoration. The Agency also submitted a document indicating that the Agency requested restoration of Petitioner's leave. We find, however, that these remedial actions do not comply with the Commission's order in EEOC Appeal No. 0120172820. Regarding compensatory damages, the order expressly requires the Agency to issue a "final decision on the compensatory damages issue with appeal rights to this Commission." As for the order pertaining to leave restoration, the Agency provided no information how it calculated the amount of leave to restore nor any evidence that the leave was in fact restored. Furthermore, we find no evidence that the Agency complied any other orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, for approximately 13 months, the Agency has failed to report on its completion of any of the Commission's orders in EEOC Appeal No. 0120172820. Moreover, the Agency has not submitted any statement of its position or explanation in response to notification of the docketing of the instant petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even more concerning, the Agency's refusal to report on its compliance with the Commission's order in this case appears to be part of a larger, ongoing pattern of similar failures. EEOC's OFO is currently faced with multiple cases involving the Agency where it is unable to effectively fulfill its regulatory responsibility to monitor compliance with its orders because the Agency has failed to provide the required reports and/or evidence of its compliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Petition Nos. 2019001866, 2019004318, 2019004319, 2019004320, 2019004321, 2019004322, 2019004323, 2019004324, 2019004325, 2019004327, 2019004328, 2019004329, 2019004330, 2019004334, 2019004335, 2019004336, 2019004337, 2019004338, 2019004339, 2019005948, 2020002241, 2020002242, and 2020002245.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Agency's failure to provide evidence of its compliance with EEOC's order in EEOC Appeal No. 0120172820, we cannot conclude that it is in compliance. The Commission directs the Agency to immediately take action consistent with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7)&#x2003;Within sixty (60) calendar days of the date this decision is issued, the Agency shall issue a written report to Director, Federal Sector Programs (FSP), Office of Federal Operations (OFO) that includes:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;An analysis of its Fiscal Year 2018-2019 Agency-wide EEO reporting on compliance with EEOC orders to identify problem areas in meeting regulatory reporting requirements, including timely reporting and providing adequate evidence of compliance with EEOC orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;A detailed action plan setting forth how the problems identified in its analysis will be corrected, delays ended, and compliance reporting brought in accordance with EEOC regulations. Such <span id="Page_20"></span>plan will include specific and reasonable timeframes within which to meet such goals. The Agency shall provide quarterly progress reports to FSP on the achievements of its action plan throughout the remainder of FY 2020 and shall include a report of its progress in its next MD-715 report.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">8)&#x2003;The Agency is further directed to submit its report of compliance in digital format as provided in the statement entitled "Implementation of the Commission's Decision." The report shall be submitted via the Federal Sector EEO Portal (FedSEP). <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.403(g).</p>
