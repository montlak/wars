<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-14"><span class="space">E.</span> COMPLAINTS BY OTHERS--ASSOCIATION COMPLAINTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">As with other bases of discrimination, the Commission has long held that a complainant alleging reprisal can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by alleging that an association with someone who has engaged in protected activity triggered reprisal. <span class="Italic">See Sellard v. USPS</span>, 01862682 (1988) (son alleged a reprisal over a complaint filed by mother); <span class="Italic">Schenarts v. Department of Treasury</span>, 03860064 (1987) (husband alleged that an EEO complaint by his spouse resulted in reprisal against him); <span class="Italic">see also</span>, EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 at II.B.4. (2016). Where there is actionable association complaint, both the employee who engaged in the protected activity and the third party who is subjected to the materially adverse action can state a claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Colby S. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020002713 (2020).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP</span>, 562 U.S. 170, 131 S. Ct. 863 (2011), the Supreme Court adopted the Commission's position in a case involving the termination of a fianc&#x00E9; of an employee who had filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC. In that case, Miriam Regalado filed a sex discrimination complaint with the EEOC. Three weeks later, her fianc&#x00E9;, Eric Thompson, was <span id="Page_1475"></span>fired by the same employer. His civil action was later dismissed by the U.S. district court finding that Title VII did not permit "third party" claims. A panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, but the Court, <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, then affirmed the district court decision by a 10-6 vote and the Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an opinion written by Justice Scalia, the Court, relying its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern and Sante Fe Railway Co. v. White</span>, 126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006), had little difficulty that, if the facts were as alleged by the plaintiff, there was a violation of Title VII. "We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her finance would be fired." <span class="Italic">Thompson, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The more difficult question, according to the Court, was whether Thompson had standing to sue under Title VII. Focusing on Title VII's use of the term "aggrieved," the Court rejected the rationale of the Sixth Court panel that merely satisfying the Article III constitutional requirement for standing was sufficient for Title VII purposes, but also rejected an argument by the employer that in order to be aggrieved, the employee bringing the suit had to have engaged in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Scalia, writing in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The more difficult question in this case is whether Thompson may sue NAS for its alleged violation of Title VII. The statute provides that "a civil action may be brought...by the person claiming to be aggrieved." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(1). The Sixth Circuit concluded that this provision was merely a reiteration of the requirement that the plaintiff have Article III standing. 567 F. 3d, at 808, n.1. We do not understand how that can be. The provision unquestionably permits a person "claiming to be aggrieved" to bring "a civil action." It is arguable that the aggrievement referred to is nothing more than the minimal Article III standing, which consists of injury in fact caused by the defendant and remediable by the court. <span class="Italic">See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife</span>, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992). But Thompson's claim undoubtedly meets those requirements, so if that is indeed all that aggrievement consists of, he may sue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have suggested in <span class="Italic">dictum</span> that the Title VII aggrievement requirement conferred a right to sue on all who satisfied Article III standing. <span class="Italic">Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</span>, 409 U.S. 205 (1972), involved the "person aggrieved" provision of Title VIII (the Fair Housing Act) rather than Title VII. In deciding the case, however, we relied upon, and cited with approval, a Third Circuit opinion involving Title VII, which, we said, "concluded that the words used showed 'a congressional intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 209 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc.,</span> 445 F.2d 442, 446 (1971)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We think that <span class="Italic">dictum</span> regarding Title VII was too expansive. Indeed, the <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span> opinion did not adhere to it in expressing its Title VIII holding that residents of an apartment complex could sue the owner for his racial discrimination against prospective tenants. The opinion said that the "person aggrieved" of Title VIII was coextensive with Article III "<span class="Italic">insofar as tenants of the same housing unit that is charged with discrimination are concerned</span>." 409 U.S., at 209 (emphasis added). Later opinions, we must acknowledge, reiterate that the term "aggrieved" in Title VIII reaches as far as Article III permits, <span class="Italic">see Bennett v. Spear</span>, 520 U.S. 154, 165-166 (1997); <span class="Italic">Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood</span>, 441 U.S. 91, 109 (1979), though the holdings of those cases are compatible with the "zone of interests" limitation that we discuss below. In any event, it is Title VII rather than Title VIII that is before us here, and as to that we are surely not bound by the <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span> <span class="Italic">dictum</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now find that this <span class="Italic">dictum</span> was ill-considered, and we decline to follow it. If any person injured in the Article III sense by a Title VII violation could sue, absurd consequences would follow. For example, a shareholder would be able to sue a company for firing a valuable employee for racially discriminatory reasons, so long as he could show that the value of his stock decreased as a consequence. At oral argument Thompson acknowledged that such a suit would not lie, We agree, and therefore conclude that the term "aggrieved" must be construed more narrowly than the outer boundaries of Article III.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the other extreme from the position that "person aggrieved" means anyone with Article III standing, NAS argues that it is a term of art that refers only to the employee who engaged in the protected activity. We know of no other context in which the words carry this artificially narrow meaning, and if that is what Congress intended it would more naturally have said "person claiming to have been discriminated against" rather than "person claiming to be aggrieved." We see no basis in text or prior practice for limiting the latter phrase to the person who was the subject of unlawful retaliation. Moreover, such a reading contradicts the very holding of <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span>, which was that residents of an apartment complex were "person[s] aggrieved" by discrimination against prospective tenants. We see no reason why the same phrase in Title VII should be given a narrower meaning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view there is a common usage of the term "person aggrieved" that avoids the extremity of equating it with Article III and yet is fully consistent with our application of the term in <span class="Italic">Trafficante</span>. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, authorizes suit to challenge a federal agency by any "person...adversely affected or aggrieved...within the meaning of a relevant statute." &#x00A7; 702. We have held that this language establishes a regime under which a plaintiff may not sue unless he "falls within the 'zone of interests' sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint." <span class="Italic">Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation</span>, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990). We have described the "zone of interests" test as denying a right of review "if the plaintiff's interests are so marGINAlly related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit." <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn</span>., 479 U.S. 388, 399-400 (1987). We hold that the term "aggrieved" in Title VII incorporates this test, enabling suit by any plaintiff with an interest "arguably [sought] to be protected by the statutes," <span class="Italic">National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat. Bank &#x0026; Trust Co</span>., 522 U.S. 479, 495 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), while excluding plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III sense but whose interests are unrelated to the statutory prohibitions in Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that test here, we conclude that Thompson falls within the zone of interests protected by Title VII. Thompson was an employee of NAS, and the purpose of Title VII is to protect employees from their employers' unlawful actions. Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged, Thompson is not an accidental victim of the retaliation--collateral damage, so to speak, of the employer's unlawful act. To the contrary, injuring him was the employer's intended means of harming Regalado. Hurting him was the unlawful act by which the employer punished her. In those circumstances, we think Thompson well within the zone of interests sought to be protected by Title VII. He is a person aggrieved with standing to sue.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120110535 (2011), the Commission, citing to <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, found that a husband, who was an area office director, who alleged retaliation in the form of a relocation of his area office because of his wife's EEO activity had stated a claim for relief. However, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120110364 (2011), the Commission found that a specialist who worked under that director was not within the "zone of interests" protected by the Statute. In upholding the agency's finding of no discrimination in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination with respect to the move of the Howell Area Office. While we found in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dep't of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120110535 (April 25, 2011) that the AD would have a cause of action for a claim of reprisal discrimination based on his wife's EEO activity, we cannot find that Complainant has a cause of action as well. Utilizing the guidance on reprisal claims articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> we found that the AD was able to bring a third-party claim of retaliation against the Agency over the SD's actions, allegedly done in retaliation for the AD's wife's EEO complaint against the SD. However, having met the threshold to bring a retaliation claim, we concluded that the AD had not proven that the SD's actions were retaliatory. In this instance, we find that Complainant is not within the "zone of interests" contemplated by the decision in <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> and that as the SD was not allegedly retaliating against the Area Office staff, any adverse action taken for retaliatory motives against the AD would render the staff the mere "accidental victim[s] of the retaliation--collateral damage, so to speak, of the employer's unlawful act." <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> 131 S. Ct. at 870.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 at B.4. (2016), is instructive regarding third-party retaliation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third Party Retaliation--Person Claiming Retaliation Need Not Be the Person Who Engaged in Opposition</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Materially Adverse Action Against Employee</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sometimes an employer takes a materially adverse action against an employee who engaged in protected activity by harming a third party who is closely related to or associated with the complaining employee. For example, the Supreme Court explained that it is "obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fianc&#x00E9; would be fired." Similarly, if an employer punishes an employee for engaging in protected activity by cancelling a vendor contract with the employee's husband (even though he was employed by a contractor, not the employer), it would dissuade a reasonable worker from engaging in protected activity. Although there is no "fixed class of relationships for which third-party reprisals are unlawful[,]...firing a close family member will almost always meet the Burlington standard, and inflicting a milder reprisal on a mere acquaintance will almost never do so."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b. Standing to Challenge: "Zone of Interests"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where there is actionable third party retaliation, both the employee who engaged in the protected activity and the third party who is subjected to the materially adverse action may state a claim. The third party may bring a claim even if he did not engage in the protected activity, and even if he has never been employed by the defendant employer. "Regardless of <span id="Page_1476"></span>whether the plaintiffs are employed by the defendant,...the harm they suffered is no less a product of the defendant's purposeful violation of the anti-retaliation provision." As the Supreme Court stated, the third party was not an "accidental victim"; "[t]o the contrary, injuring him was the employer's intended means of harming the [employee who engaged in protected activity]." Thus, the third party "falls within the 'zone of interests' sought to be protected by [the retaliation provision]" and has standing to seek recovery from the employer for his harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Colby S. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020002713 (2020), the complainant alleged that agency officials refused to investigate his spouse's harassment claims and made the spouse the subject of a fact-finding investigation in retaliation for his EEO activity. The agency dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, concluding that "to allow the processing of a complaint about another person's EEO complaint would have a chilling effect on the processing of EEO complaints." Finding an actionable claim of third-party retaliation, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Colby S</span>. remanded the compliant to the agency for further processing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter, Complainant is alleging that Agency officials refused to investigate his spouse's claims of harassment and subjected his spouse to a fact-finding investigation due to his protected activity. Specifically, in an attachment to Complainant's formal complaint, Complainant states "immediately after I won a summary judgment against the Agency in my EEO case, the Agency conducted a disparately run investigation into my wife...[and] [t]he action was taken within weeks of her scheduled testimony in my EEO case in federal court." Complainant asserts that these actions against his wife resulted in him being subjected to a hostile work environment. We find that given these specific circumstances, Complainant has set forth an action reasonably likely to deter him or others from engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Kristie L. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020001506 (2020), the Commission remanded complainant's reprisal complainant for processing where she alleged "third party" retaliation. The substance of the complaint read:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the period at issue, Complainant worked as a Sales and Service Distribution Associate, PS-6, at the Agency's Post Office in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York. Complainant's husband is also employed at the same facility under the same Postmaster.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 12, 2019, Complainant filed a formal complaint alleging that the Agency subjected her and/or her spouse to discrimination based on national origin (Indian-American), race (Asian), sex (female), religion (Hindi), color (brown), age (over 60, otherwise unspecified), and in reprisal for prior protected EEO activities 2 when:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">1.</span> On June 3, 2019 the Postmaster slammed a door on Complainant's husband's hand;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">2.</span> On June 7, 2019 Complainant's husband was given instructions to clean and he was not dressed for cleaning; and</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">3.</span> On June 10, 2019 Complainant's husband was not paid for 32 hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 29, 2019, the Agency issued the instant final decision dismissing the formal complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1), for failure to state a claim. Specifically, the Agency's stated Complainant's discrimination allegations were vague in failing to identify specific employment harm against her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant appeal followed. On appeal, Complainant contends that the Postmaster had retaliated against her husband because of Complainant's prior protected EEO activities. Specifically, Complainant alleged that the Postmaster became overtly hostile to her husband in retaliation for Complainant's EEO activity, which had been resolved through a settlement agreement executed on between Complainant and the Agency on June 3, 2019.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding that the complainant alleged a viable "third party" retaliation complaint, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kristie L</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In part, the Agency's dismissal of Complainant's complaint is correct as to her race, color, national origin, sex, religion and age claims as Complainant has not alleged facts that, if proven true, would show she personally suffered a harm or loss with respect to a term, condition or privilege of employment. All the alleged actions were taken against Complainant's husband and he is the proper party to claim they occurred because of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the anti-retaliation provisions of the employment discrimination statutes seek to prevent an employer from interfering with an employee's efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the statutes' basic guarantees and are not limited to actions affecting employment terms and conditions. <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern &#x0026; Santa Fe Railroad. Co. v. White</span>, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006). To state a viable claim of retaliation, Complainant must allege that: 1) she was subjected to an action which a reasonable employee would have found materially adverse, and 2) the action could dissuade a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 (August 25, 2016) (hereinafter referred to as "Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation"); <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970939 (April 4, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon a comprehensive reading of the appeal and all prior submissions, we have determined that Complainant stated a viable claim of "third party retaliation." Complainant asserted that immediately after she reached an EEO settlement agreement with her local Postmaster, this Postmaster engaged in a pattern of retaliatory harassment against Complainant's husband that had a chilling effect on Complainant's own pursuit of her EEO rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation, Chap. II, Sect. B(4), explains that sometimes an employer may take action against an employee who engaged in protected activity by harming a third party who is closely related to or associated with the complainant employee. As an example of such a close relationship, the Guidance references the complaining employee's spouse. The Guidance goes on to state the under such circumstances, both the employee who engaged in the protected activity and the third party who is subjected to the materially adverse action may state a claim. <span class="Italic">See also, Carry R. v. Dep't of State</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120133366 (Apr. 22, 2016), <span class="Italic">citing Thompson v. N. American Stainless, LP</span>, 562 U.S. 170 (2011). Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency improperly dismissed Complainant's claim of retaliatory harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hill v. Attorney General</span>, 0120121735 (2012), the Commission used the <span class="Italic">Ma</span> test, see Chapter 3, section on "<a href="0100-2023-12-069.html#sec3-69">Independent Contractors and Consultants</a>," to determine that an contractor who alleged retaliation for his wife's EEO activity had stated a claim for relief. The complainant's wife, who was an agency employee had filed a complaint alleging gender discrimination. After finding under <span class="Italic">Ma</span> that the agency asserted sufficient control to consider the complainant an employee under Title VII, the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal and remanded the complaint for processing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Earlier, in one case, the Commission determined that an employee who alleged that his performance rating was lowered because of his supervisor's previous EEO activity stated a case within the EEO purview. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mack v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01892878 (1989). The complainant maintained that members of the performance review board knew his supervisor had gained his position through an EEO settlement and lowered performance ratings issued by the supervisor in retaliation. The Commission noted the ensuing investigation should not center on comparing the performance ratings of complainant with others issued by the same supervisor. Rather, it should focus on the empaneling of the review board, the relationship of board members to the EEO complaints filed by the supervisor and their actions and statements at the review board hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a complaint alleging reprisal because the employee's parents contacted the agency about ongoing harassment does not fall within the scope of Title VII. The Commission found the complaint failed to allege any prior EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bafus v. Postmaster General</span>, 01911492 (1991). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11699 (2001), the Commission found there was no protected activity where the complainant alleged that he was not given a step increase because of the settlement of an EEO case involving another employee. The complainant did not allege that he in any way participated in the other employee's case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a perplexing decision, the Commission held that mere membership in an organization promoting the rights of disabled people does not constitute protected activity covered by EEO statutes. <span class="Italic">DeMeo v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01951047 (1996). The complainant in that case based his reprisal allegation on his membership in an organization representing disabled persons that was seeking formal recognition by the facility in order to avail itself of the facility's "public information system." The Commission held the complainant's mere membership in a group representing disabled persons that was seeking formal recognition by the facility, did not constitute "protected activity." Although it certainly is true that membership does not constitute protected activity under the participation clause, it is not clear why the Commission did not analyze the case under the opposition clause.</p>
<p class="noindent">Encouraging others to "avail themselves of their EEO rights" and to assist others in filing EEO complaints is protected activity. <span class="Italic">Cornell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966639 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to revising its <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span> in May 1998, and the 2016 EEOC Enforcement Guidance replacing the <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span> Section 8, the Commission had held that an allegation that a relative was being punished for the complainant's EEO activity failed to state a claim of reprisal. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01975380 (1998), distinguished this scenario from cases in which a complainant alleged that she was being discriminated against for a relative's EEO activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An examination of the record makes it clear that appellant suffered no harm with respect to the terms, conditions or privileges of her employment as a result of her husband's receipt of an LOC. It is well settled that third party reprisals are cognizable under EEO law<span class="Italic">. See Bates v. U.S. Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01963655 (June 10, 1997) <span class="Italic">citing De Medina v. Reinhardt</span>, 444 F. Supp. 573 (D.C. 1978). However, such cases stand for the proposition that third parties may bring claims of reprisal for the EEO activity of their relatives. They do not permit, as appellant would argue, <span id="Page_1477"></span>a claimant to bring claims on behalf of an aggrieved relative for actions done in reprisal for the claimant's EEO activity. Consequently, appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and the agency's decision to dismiss allegation (4) was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Melton v. Postmaster General,</span> 01972363 (1998), the Commission found that the loss of a husband's income as the result of discrimination, requiring the complainant to work more, was not a proper basis for a complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant, an agency employee, alleges that the agency terminated her husband's employment in retaliation for her prior EEO activities. The agency dismissed her complaint for failure to state a claim on grounds that the appellant had not alleged that her husband's termination had affected a term, condition, or privilege of her employment, and the agency had not taken any action against her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the appellant contends that, due to the loss of her husband's income, she has to work overtime and holidays. She also describes in detail other adverse consequences to herself and her children which allegedly flowed from the alleged retaliation against her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the entire record, the Commission finds that the appellant's complaint fails to state a claim under 29 CFR Part 1614 because it does not allege that the agency adversely affected a term, condition, or privilege of the appellant's employment. The agency has adversely affected the appellant's husband's employment, not the appellant's employment, allegedly due to the appellant's prior EEO activity. Thus, the appellant's husband, not the appellant, has a claim of alleged retaliation under 29 CFR Part 1614. The fact that the appellant worked extra hours to supplement the family income does not convert the agency's action against the appellant's husband to an agency action against the appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Tinsley-Meyers v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01983304 (1999), the Commission came to the opposite conclusion, based on its 1998 revision of the <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span> section on Reprisal. In <span class="Italic">Tinsley-Meyers</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, EEOC Directives Transmittal 915.003 8-II(3) (c) (May 20, 1998) provides that retaliation against a close relative of an individual who opposed discrimination can be challenged by both the individual who engaged in protected activity and the relative, where both are employees. In this case, although the record discloses that appellant was no longer an employee of the agency at the time of the alleged discrimination, the cornerstone of her complaint, i.e., her allegations of retaliation, arose as a result of her past employment with the agency. As the remaining portion of allegation concerns acts of retaliation taken against appellant's husband due to appellant's prior EEO activity, we find that it states a claim....</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Young v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01072 (2000), the Commission found that the complainant stated a claim of retaliation when her husband, who also worked for the agency, received a transfer after the settlement of the complainant's prior EEO complaint. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A46150 (2006), the Commission found that its administrative judge erred in dismissing a complaint of reprisal because the complainant had not engaged in EEO activity where the complainant's spouse had engaged in such activity. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Falvo v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720080009 (2010) (retaliation against wife for husband's EEO activity).</p>
