<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-59"><span class="space">L.</span> CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is not unusual for an agency to insist on a "confidentiality" clause as part of a settlement agreement. Essentially, the clause states that neither the complainant nor his representative will disclose the terms of the agreement to any third parties. Often, the clause goes further and states that violation of the provision will void the remainder of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is nothing wrong, <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span>, with such a clause. However, the Department of Justice has adopted a policy that prohibits confidentiality clauses in its own settlement agreements. Some agencies have followed suit, while others have not. The Commission continues to treat confidentiality clauses as valid in its decisions on breach allegations determining whether the specific clauses involved have been violated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Schnelle v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01996091 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Dunning v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52506 (2006) (agency breached confidentiality clause by disclosing that favorable recommendation for reassignment was the result of an agreement). The problem, discussed in more detail below, is how to remedy the breach of a confidentiality clause.</p>
<p class="noindent">From the agency's perspective, confidentiality clauses give some assurance that settlements in one case will not affect possible settlements in other cases. Although there is no empirical evidence to support such a notion, agencies also fear that knowledge of settlements will "open the floodgates of litigation" and encourage others to file complaints in the hope of obtaining a settlement. From the employee's perspective, it is a concession that costs nothing, except perhaps "bragging rights." However, agencies and complainants should guard against confidentiality clauses that are overly broad and permit no exceptions. As a general rule, the agency will want to seek specific permission to disclose the terms of the agreement to those agency officials who have a need to know in order to execute the terms of the agreement. Also, complainants generally will want permission to disclose the terms of the agreement to immediate family members, lawyers, and other tax or financial consultants.</p>
<p class="noindent">The importance of a well-drafted confidentiality clause is demonstrated by <span class="Italic">Cosner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120110073 (2012). In that case, the parties entered a settlement agreement that provided for confidentiality and also provided that the terms could be disclosed to those with a need to know to execute the terms of the agreement or enforce the agreement. Thereafter, the complainant wrote to a congressman complaining the agency was in breach. In response, the agency disclosed the terms of the agreement. The Commission found that the agency was not in breach and that the complainant was disingenuous in so claiming because he had written to the congressman seeking help in enforcing the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Confidentiality clauses can be overly broad. For example, in <span class="Italic">In re Slay</span>, 05870221 (1987), the agency included in a proposed settlement a confidentiality clause that imposed $1,000 in liquidated damages for every breach of confidentiality. The complainant rejected the agreement and the agency dismissed the complaint on the basis that full relief had been offered in the other provisions of the agreement. The Commission rejected the argument that the complainant was required to expose himself to unlimited liability in exchange for otherwise full relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hairgrove v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01913532 (1992), the Commission issued a perplexing decision in which it held that an agency could actually restrain a complainant from discussing the substance of her allegations with others outside the EEO process. In <span class="Italic">Hairgrove</span>, the complainant received a five-day suspension for discussing a previous EEO complaint involving allegations of sexual harassment with coworkers and agency employees outside of her direct chain-of-command. The previous complaint was settled and the complainant instructed to maintain the confidentiality of the EEO process by not discussing the allegations with persons outside of her direct chain of command.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency defended its actions by indicating that it had a need for confidentiality on EEO matters and that appellant was advised of this need. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Hairgrove</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]nitially, the Commission notes that appellant's discussion with co-workers and the individual outside the chain-of-command about the allegations of sexual harassment are an expression of opposition to an alleged unlawful agency practice and thus protected by Title VII. The agency indicated that it ordered appellant upon her initial employment with the office to refrain from discussing its business. Also, the record indicates that appellant was ordered to refrain from discussing her EEO complaint. The record does not establish at the time that it ordered appellant not to discuss her sexual harassment allegations that her discussion of such matters would disrupt the office. However, the agency reasonably concluded that appellant's action compromised the mission <span id="Page_384"></span>of the office, particularly since her discussions violated the confidentiality rule. Thus, it does not appear that the agency unnecessarily interfered with appellant's protected activity. Therefore, the Commission finds that the evidence does not establish that there is a nexus between the order to refrain from discussion sexual harassment allegations that are prior EEO activities. According to the agency, the confidentiality policy was established before the occurrence of appellant's allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission finds that the agency properly balanced the enforcement of its confidentiality requirements against the protection of appellant's EEO-related activity. The Commission makes this finding because the order was based on an established, necessary office policy and appellant was provided with accessible EEO channels by which to discuss her complaints....</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not clear that <span class="Italic">Hairgrove</span> should be interpreted to mean that an agency can restrict a complainant from discussing the underlying allegations of discrimination through a confidentiality clause. Most confidentiality clauses relate only to disclosure of the terms and conditions of settlement. It seems unlikely the Commission would uphold a similar restriction on a complainant who was not employed in the agency's EEO office.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">St. Cyr v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21630 (2002), the Commission rejected an argument by the complainant that a nondisclosure clause was overly broad and had a chilling effect on EEO activity. The Commission specifically noted that the disputed provision contained exceptions for enforcement and compliance purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Jungbauer v. Secretary of Transportation, FAA,</span> 01962272 (1997), the Commission found that the agency did not breach the nondisclosure terms of a settlement agreement where it disclosed the terms of the settlement and provided a copy of the EEO file to an attorney who was representing the agency in another case. Finding that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Jungbauer</span> may have been called to testify regarding her prior EEO complaint in another case, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the plain language of the Agreement states that the Agreement's terms can be disclosed only to those employees of the agency and representatives of appellant with a "need to know" the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Agency employees who would be deemed as having a need to know are not specified in the Agreement nor does the Agreement identify specific situations in which a release of information is precluded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on these considerations and our review of the record, the Commission is satisfied that the agency's decision to disclose appellant's settlement agreement and EEO file to its own attorney was appropriate in this case. Specifically, we find that A-1's request for appellant's EEO file was justified by the fact that A-1 was the attorney charged with representing the agency in a case in which appellant might have had to provide testimony concerning her prior EEO complaint and possibly the agency's conduct with regard to appellant's prior EEO activity. We note that, as attorney for the agency, A-1 was required to prepare for the case and to decide whether to release appellant's EEO files to E-1's attorney pursuant to the deposition and interrogatories discussed above.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Alfonso T. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120172044 (2018), the confidentiality clause agreed to by the parties provided that the settlement was confidential and nonprecedential and that it would "not be cited for any reason, including comparison, in any other administrative and/or judicial proceedings in any forum." The complainant alleged breach when a supervisor referred to the agreement in two separate EEO complaints brought by coworkers and included a copy of the agreement in a case file. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Alfonso T.</span> agreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agreement specifically stated that the settlement agreement would be kept confidential and included language that "it will not be cited for any reason, including comparison, in any other administrative and/or judicial proceedings in any forum." Although the Agency asserted that the existence of the settlement agreement is not confidential, such a statement is inconsistent with the confidentiality clause found within the settlement agreement signed by both the parties. Moreover, we note that not only did the Agency reference the existence of the settlement, a copy of the actual agreement was placed in the investigative record of another employee in at least one instance. As such, we find that the Agency breached the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As Complainant elected specific performance, the Agency shall notify Complainant that the terms of the settlement agreement shall stand and the Agency will abide by all of the terms of the agreement, including the non-disclosure provision. Among other things, this means the Agency shall not reference Complainant's settlement agreement, regardless of its relevance, during the processing of EEO complaints and/or grievances filed by other employees. Further, the Agency shall remove all existing references to the settlement agreement and copies of the settlement agreement from all reports of investigation in EEO complaints filed by other employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is further directed to submit a report of compliance, as provided in the statement entitled "Implementation of the Commission's Decision." The report shall include supporting documentation verifying that the corrective action has been implemented.</p>
<p class="noindent">Often a settlement agreement calls for the agency to perform some personnel action. When the agreement also contains a confidentiality clause, it does not necessarily preclude the agency from disclosing the existence of the personnel action as long as it does not disclose that the action is the result of settlement. In <span class="Italic">South v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01966897 (1997), the agency and the complainant entered into a settlement agreement that provided for a desk audit of the complainant's position and also included the following confidentiality provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;The Complainant and Management agree that the fact of this Mediation Agreement and all the terms contained here, will be kept CONFIDENTIAL, and they agree not to disclose or discuss the fact of the agreement with other employees of the Naval Hospital, Pensacola (except to authorized EEO and Activity officials responsible for implementing this agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant alleged that the agency breached this provision when the department head informed another employee that the complainant's position was scheduled for a desk audit. That employee then informed two other employees of the pending audit. As a defense to the breach allegation, the agency maintained that the department head had not disclosed that the audit was the result of a settlement agreement. The Commission in <span class="Italic">South</span> found that there was no breach because the agency agreed not to disclose the fact that the agreement existed, but the confidentiality provision did not prevent the agency from disclosing the substance of the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission disagrees with appellant's interpretation of provision 4 of the agreement. The Commission finds that a reading of provision 4 in its entirety shows that the agency agreed not to disclose the fact of the agreement with other employees. In the instant matter the Commission finds that the Department Head did disclose the existence of the audit to Person A, but that there is no evidence that the Department Head discussed, with Person A, the existence of the settlement agreement or in any way indicated to Person A that the desk audit was due to the settlement agreement. Furthermore, in an affidavit, the Department Head denied informing Person A of the existence of the settlement agreement or informing Person A that the desk audit was being conducted because of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department Head stated that he telephoned appellant's supervisor to inform him that appellant's audit was being rescheduled, but that he was informed that the supervisor was on leave and that Person A was acting for the supervisor. Appellant claims that Person A was not acting for the supervisor. The Commission finds that even if Person A was not acting for appellant's supervisor the confidentiality provision was not breached because there is no indication that the agency acted in bad faith and because there is no evidence showing that the existence of the agreement was communicated to Person A (or persons B or C). Furthermore, appellant has not shown that knowledge of the existence of the audit led to some unauthorized person concluding that the audit was being conducted because of a settlement agreement. Therefore, we find that appellant has failed to show that the agency breached provision 4 of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01985079 (1999), the Commission found a confidentiality clause did not prohibit the agency from discussing the personnel matters that were the subject of the settled complaint. In <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> the complainant alleged that</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the agency breached the confidentiality provision at a meeting with appellant and her union representative by discussing appellant's alleged past and present disciplinary and performance matters.</p>
<p class="noindent">Upon examination of the language of the settlement agreement, the Commission found that the agency in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> had not breached the privacy provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unambiguous language of the confidentiality provision provides that it only applies to the terms of settlement. Thus, even accepting as true all of appellant's allegations with respect to what transpired at the February 29, 1998 meeting, there is nothing in the settlement agreement which precludes such discussion, regardless of who is present. The agreement does not bar the agency from discussing or acting on any alleged disciplinary or performance problems, even if they were the subject of dispute in the underlying formal complaints which the agreement settled....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that appellant interpreted the settlement agreement as mandating that the agency not discuss certain disciplinary or performance matters, or as mandating her promotion, such interpretations cannot be enforced where they were not reduced to writing as part of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See Jenkins-Nye v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 019851903 (March 4, 1987). We have previously held that if a settlement agreement is made in good faith <span id="Page_385"></span>and is otherwise valid, it will not be set aside simply because it appears that one of the parties made a poor bargain<span class="Italic">. See Ingram v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880565 (June 14, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Patel v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01971929 (1998), the Commission determined that reference to a settlement agreement on a Standard Form 50 did not breach the confidentiality clause of the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the reference to the settlement agreement on Form SF 50, appellant argues that the agency's actions were a breach of the confidentiality provision (provision 8) of the settlement agreement. We disagree. We find that the record supports a determination that the agency was required to include explanatory statements in personnel records, such as Form SF 50, to explain why an irregular personnel action was occurring. We are persuaded by the agency's assertion that where, as here, appellant's record did not warrant any step increase, it was reasonable for the agency to explain that the action was required pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was obtained in <span class="Italic">Schnelle v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01996091 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that complainant has not shown that the agency has breached the settlement agreement. First, the settlement agreement states that the "terms of the agreement were to remain confidential." The agreement, however, makes no reference to complainant's SF-50 or the alleged comments on it. Therefore, disclosure of that document cannot be construed as revealing the terms of the settlement. Moreover, complainant has not shown that the terms of the agreement were revealed to any agency official without a need to know the information to perform their official duties. Although complainant points to the Arapaho/Roosevelt Forest Supervisor's statement that he knew complainant had been hired as part of an EEO settlement, he has not shown that the actual terms of the agreement were revealed to the Forest Supervisor, or that if they were, that the Supervisor did not need to know that information to carry out his responsibilities as the chief management authority of the Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest. Complainant has thus failed to show that terms of the settlement agreement were revealed contrary to the confidentiality provision of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no breach of a confidentiality clause where a newspaper report on the complainant's alleged misconduct that resulted in indictment by a grand jury was based on court documents and information provided by the prosecuting attorney. In <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120063099 (2007), the Commission noted the complainant's allegation that the agency provided the prosecuting attorney with the information, but credited the agency's argument that it had a legal obligation to provide that information.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the absence of a confidentiality clause, the agency is not required to keep secret the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Woodlief v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01972937 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">One problem with confidentiality clauses is that supervisors and coworkers can observe changes in the workplace and in an employee's work status. Such observations are not an indication that the confidentiality clause of an agreement has been breached. In order to demonstrate breach, the complainant must show that the supervisor's or coworkers' knowledge came from the agreement itself and not from elsewhere. For example, in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01996175 (2001), the complainant alleged breach of a confidentiality provision when his supervisor announced his retirement, which was a term of an EEO settlement agreement, at a staff meeting. The Commission found there was no breach because the supervisor's knowledge did not come from the agreement, but from statements the complainant made.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that there is a confidentiality clause that precludes a complainant from discussing the terms and conditions of the settlement does not mean that she cannot say anything about the settlement. It means precisely what such clauses say: she is not permitted to disclose the terms and conditions of the settlement, except to those who have a need to know. General comments to those not having a need to know that do not disclose the terms and conditions of the agreement do not violate the clause. Both points were illustrated in <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01986019 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency found that in discussing the settlement with the Acting EEO Manager appellant stated that she "won" her case. The agency argued that the Acting EEO Manager had no need to know about the terms of the settlement agreement and that appellant was only permitted to say the agreement was "resolved." In an affidavit the Acting EEO Manager stated that appellant told the Acting EEO Manager: "I am sure you know about the case I won, and my attorney would kill me if he knew...I was saying that, but if the Agency would work with me, I would say forget the leave request and let me spend time helping people like this." The Commission finds that appellant did not reveal the terms of the agreement to the Acting EEO Manager and that appellant's statement that she "won" her case to the Acting EEO Manager (a person one could reasonably assume was aware, could be aware, or would be aware of the terms of the agreement) did not constitute a breach of the confidentiality provision of the agreement...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency found that appellant told the Payroll Supervisor appellant that appellant was given a "gift" of 10 hours of sick leave and that such a statement constituted a breach of the confidentiality provision of the agreement. In an affidavit the Payroll Supervisor stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I called [appellant] to ask her some details regarding the Settlement Agreement. The Agreement stated that I was to restore 10 hours of sick leave.... She said she did not remember the exact dates, but she only used 3.5 hours of sick leave, and the rest was a 'gift from [the agency attorney who signed the agreement].'</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant's statements to the Payroll Supervisor did not breach the confidentiality provision of the agreement. Because the Payroll Supervisor had a need to know details of the agreement, appellant's discussion of the terms of the agreement with the Payroll Supervisor was not a breach. Appellant's use of the word "gift" was not forbidden by provision 6 of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may use a confidentiality clause as a condition precedent to a settlement agreement, such that the complainant is not entitled to the benefits of the agreement if he breaches the confidentiality clause. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cottos v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01971741 (1998), the agency promised the complainant a promotion. However, the agency made the promotion contingent upon the fulfillment of several conditions over a 90-day period. One provision of the agreement called for the complainant to keep the terms and conditions of the settlement confidential. The Commission found the complainant breached the confidentiality provision in the 90-day period. As a result, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Cottos</span> found the complainant was not entitled to the promotion and dismissed the complainant's claim of breach.</p>
<p class="noindent">One of the problems with confidentiality clauses is that, in many cases, their breach does not evoke any particular remedy. For example, in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A00935 (2001), the complainant, who had since been removed from the agency for reasons unrelated to the issues underlying the settlement agreement, alleged that the agency breached the confidentiality clause of the agreement. The Commission noted that given the fact that the complainant no longer worked for the agency, it could not specifically enforce the agreement by putting the complainant in a position from which he had been removed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> further noted that "equity would not favor complainant if we allowed him to reinstate his complaint, for he would be required to repay any monies issued pursuant to the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission dealt with a similar problem in <span class="Italic">Meress v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120091936 (2009). In that case, the complainant and agency entered into a settlement agreement with the following confidentiality clause:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All promises, conduct and statements made in the course of reaching this agreement including the fact of settlement, are confidential, and will not be disclosed voluntarily to the extent allowed by law. The complainant agrees to keep the facts and terms of this agreement private and she will not disclose or discuss this settlement with other current or former agency employees except for responsible management personnel in order to facilitate the execution of this agreement. The agency agrees it will not disclose or discuss this settlement except as necessary for implementation in accordance with the Privacy Act, 5 USC 552a. Any disclosure of the fact or terms of the agreement by the employee shall be considered a material breach and will constitute a waiver of the employee's protection under the Privacy Act and will be an authorization to release the facts and terms of the agreement as the Agency deems necessary.... Management officials are authorized to disclose the details of this agreement for the employee's case to those officers and employees who have a need for such information in the performance of their duties, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant subsequently alleged breach of the agreement when a supervisor discussed the settlement with two other agency employees at a social event, and also when an agency official sent an email to several other agency employees about implementing the agreement. The Commission found that the latter claim was not a breach of the agreement because those involved in the email chain had a need to know. The agency also argued that it should be excused from breach because it had taken actions to prevent a future recurrence of breach by disciplining the offending supervisor who discussed the agreement at the social event and had issued an apology to the complainant. The complainant argued that those actions did not cure the breach. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Meress</span>, agreed with the complainant, but explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unfortunately, there is no practical way to undo the harm caused by the supervisor discussing the terms of complainant's settlement agreement with other employees. We note that the agency has taken steps to ensure that a similar breach will not occur in the future and has disciplined the supervisor at issue, as well as issuing complainant an apology. However, complainant is correct that these steps cannot cure the breach. Where, as here, a breach is found and an order of specific performance is not possible, the only remedial relief available is reinstatement of the two complaints settled by the agreement for further processing. However, if the complaints are reinstated for further processing, then the parties <span id="Page_386"></span>must be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> at the time that the parties entered into the settlement agreement, which would require that the complainant return any benefits received pursuant to the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Amour v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01965593 (June 24, 1997); <span class="Italic">Komiskev v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0119955696 (September 5, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Isidro A. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120160486 (2016) (finding breach where complainant's supervisors discussed among each other the amount of compensatory damages awarded to complainant; "we are not convinced that every supervisor in Complainant's chain of command had to know all of the terms of the agreement. Of particular relevance, the Agency has not established why the supervisors needed to know the amount of money Complainant received under the terms of the settlement.").</p>
