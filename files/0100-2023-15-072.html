<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-73"><span class="space">1.</span> Amendments</h4>
<p class="noindent">Unlike amendments at the formal complaint stage, which must be accepted by the agency, an administrative judge has the discretion to grant or deny a motion to amend a complaint. The most likely bases for denial of a motion to amend a complaint are that the new claims are not like or related to the existing claim or that there is insufficient time before the hearing to develop the record on the amended complaints. The former situation is discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">With respect to the latter situation, the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 1-5 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(d) authorizes Administrative Judges to rule on motions to amend complaints. In considering a motion to amend a complaint, the Administrative Judge should consider its impact on the existing claim, including when the amendment was brought to his/her attention and whether there will be any potential harm to the agency resulting from surprise. An Administrative Judge should issue a written ruling on a motion to amend a complaint within a reasonable period of time. The ruling should also be referenced in the Administrative Judge's decision on the merits of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The substantive standard for granting a motion to amend a complaint is that it is like or related to the oriGINAl claim. "In deciding if a new claim is 'like or related' to the oriGINAl claim, a determination must be made as to whether the new claim adds to or clarifies the oriGINAl claim, and/or could have reasonably been expected to grow out of the investigation of the oriGINAl claim." <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 1-5, citing MD-11-0 at 5-10.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the administrative judge grants a motion to amend a complaint, the scope of the hearing is expanded to accommodate the additional claim or claims. The administrative judge has the discretion to determine the best way to develop the record on the new claim or claims. As provided in the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 1-5:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Administrative Judge grants a motion to amend a complaint, <span id="Page_467"></span>the scope of the adjudication enlarges to encompass additional events or legal claims. In these situations, the Administrative Judge must decide the appropriate method for filling evidentiary voids. The Administrative Judge may order the agency to expedite an investigation within a particular time period, allow the parties to develop the record themselves through discovery, or issue orders for the production of documents and witnesses. In determining the appropriate method, the Administrative Judge may consider the size and nature of the evidentiary gap and the parties' abilities to conduct discovery to develop the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the formal complaint stage, as discussed fully in <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec3-1">Chapter 3</a>, the complainant has an absolute right to amend a complaint. When the complainant seeks to amend a complaint, he or she is not required to undergo precomplaint counseling on the amended complaint. The claims are simply added on and, if necessary, the time for conducting the investigation can be extended. At the hearing stage, the right to amend is not absolute. If the administrative judge denies the motion to amend because the new claims are not like or related to the existing claims, the agency must use the date of the motion to amend to determine if initial counselor contact is timely. <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 1-5. If so, the agency must refer the complaint to counseling. If not, the agency must issue a final agency decision dismissing the complaint as untimely and give the complaint appeal rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> fails to clarify what the agency is required to do in a situation where the administrative judge determines the new claims are like or related to the existing claims, but denies the motion to amend because inclusion of the new claims would prejudice the agency at the hearing. Presumably, the new claims would be referred to precomplaint counseling with the date of the motion to amend being used as the date to determine timely counselor contact. However, the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> does not specifically address the situation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission's case law is less than clear, it appears that a complainant must do more than simply raise factual allegations that would support an amended claim at the hearing stage. Recent case law suggests that the complainant must take some action that indicates an intent to amend the complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21949 (2003), the Commission found that factual allegations indicative of sex-based harassment did not serve as a request to amend her complaint, but her allegations of reprisal, accompanied with a request to include them in the scope of the hearing, was a request to amend her complaint. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Jimenez</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree, however, with the AJ's treatment of complainant's supposed "harassment" allegations. Commission regulations permit a complainant to amend a complaint, at any time prior to the conclusion of the investigation, to include issues or claims like or related to those raised in the complaint. 29 C.F.R. 1614.106(d). After requesting a hearing, a complainant may file a motion with the AJ to amend his or her complaint to include issues or claims like or related to those raised in the complaint<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In the instant matter, complainant made reference in her EEO affidavit to a number of prior workplace disputes which she alleged gave rise to her stress reaction medical condition, and that during her twenty-one years of agency employment, she has experienced sexism and harassment "from fellow employees, supervisors, vehicle trainers, and postal police." For example, she stated that in July, 1998, one supervisor allegedly told her that he "can get [her] anytime for anything," that her driving privileges had been withdrawn in February, 2000, and that in September, 2000, she was told to get her time card from another supervisor's desk. She also stated, however, in apparent reference to the allegation stated in her formal complaint, that "this is the first time the discrimination...has been so overt and intentional." Complainant also presented similar information, in a similar context, to the AJ in her response to the AJ's notice of her intent to consider issuing a decision without a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our examination of these documentary statements reveals that there is no indication that complainant attempted to amend her complaint to include a harassment claim, either prior or subsequent to the completion of the agency's investigation into her formal complaint. Furthermore, we cannot conclude that the aforementioned documents indicate with any certainty that complainant ever intended to raise such a harassment claim, as opposed to merely intending to provide background information on her medical condition and the issue accepted in her formal complaint. Accordingly, we find that there was no harassment claim presented by complainant as described above, and that such a claim was not before the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do find, however, that the AJ erred in failing to address complainant's attempt to amend her complaint to include an allegation of retaliation. In her September 4, 2001 response to the AJ's notice of intent to consider issuing a decision without a hearing, complainant identified a number of incidents of alleged retaliation, and stated "I would like to include this retaliation in this EEO complaint or make a new EEO complaint." The AJ's decision ignored complainant's request, and there is no indication in the record that complainant presented her retaliation allegations to an agency EEO Counselor. Complainant renewed her retaliation allegations on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mattox-Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A60053 (2006), the Commission found that the administrative judge did not err in allowing the complainant to amend a complaint over the suspension of her license to operate a powered industrial truck to include a claim that the agency also delayed her license recertification. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Mattox--Davis</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ properly permitted complainant to expand the accepted claim of her complaint to include a claim regarding the delay in retraining and re-certification of her license and restoration of her driving privileges, over the agency's objections. We observe that complainant alleged this discriminatory delay in her initial complaint and again referenced it in answers to discovery submitted to the agency well ahead of the hearing date. Moreover, the key witnesses and evidence regarding this claim were available at the hearing for either party to question or cross examine. Additionally, we find this claim could have been easily expected to grow out of the accepted issue as framed by the agency and therefore the AJ properly permitted complainant to expand her complaint to include it.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in granting a motion to amend a complaint to include a claim of retaliation just four days before the hearing. In <span class="Italic">Mannon v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070074 (2012), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that on April 12, 2007, the AJ granted Complainant's Second Motion to Amend and permitted Complainant to amend her complaint to include a claim of retaliation. The Commission notes that an AJ has broad discretion in the conduct of a hearing under EEOC regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109; <span class="Italic">see also</span> MD-110, Chap. 7, III, D. We find that the AJ did not abuse her discretion when she granted Complainant's motion to amend her complaint to include a claim of reprisal. Although the Agency contends that it only had one day notice, we note that the hearing was held on April 16, 2007. Therefore, we find that the Agency had sufficient time to prepare.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After requesting a hearing, a Complainant may file a motion with the AJ to amend a complaint to include issues or claims like or related to those raised in the complaint. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(d). In deciding if a subsequent claim is "like or related" to the oriGINAl claim, a determination must be made as to whether the later incident adds to or clarifies the oriGINAl claim, and/or could have reasonably been expected to grow out of the investigation of the oriGINAl claim. MD-110 at Chap. 5, III, B, 2, <span class="Italic">citing Scher v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940702 (May 30, 1995); <span class="Italic">Calhoun v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05891068 (March 8, 1990); <span class="Italic">Webber v. Dept. of Health and Human Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01900902 (February 28, 1990). We find that the claim of reprisal based on the same incidents that were raised initially is sufficiently like or related to the oriGINAl claims because it could have reasonably been expected to grow out of the investigation of the oriGINAl claim. We note that the facts include that SM terminated Complainant immediately after she notified SM that she was going to be reassigned by HRO to a position that accommodated her physical impairment. Accordingly, we find that the AJ did not err in amending the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120120140 (2014), the Commission upheld the amendment of a complaint at the hearing stage to include a claim of violation of the medical exam and inquiry provisions of the ADA that was not like or related to the pending claims finding the factual record was fully developed and that the agency was not prejudiced by the amendment. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, among other things, the agency noted that the complainant had never raised a claim of disability discrimination. The Commission, however, upheld the AJ's finding of discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act because (1) whether an employee is an individual with a disability is irrelevant to the issue of whether the agency properly required him to undergo a medical examination because the Rehabilitation Act's limitations regarding disability-related inquiries and medical examinations apply to all employees; and (2) the complainant's claim did not change and all the facts were sufficiently developed by both parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to our precedent, we find that it is appropriate in this case to also determine whether the Agency's actions violated the Rehabilitation Act even though Complainant did not allege such a violation. The Agency is not prejudiced by our decision because the facts in this matter are not in dispute and have been sufficiently developed. Furthermore, we note that the Agency's justification for ordering the examination was that Complainant's behavior with management during the course of the investigation into her sexual harassment claims, along with her use of sick leave, led management to believe that she should receive further psychological evaluation in order to determine whether she could work safely....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is simply not persuaded by the Agency that its medical inquiries were in fact job-related and consistent with business <span id="Page_468"></span>necessity. The Agency's sole reason for sending Complainant for a FFD evaluation and placing her on administrative leave was the allegedly "extreme behavior" that she exhibited during the investigation of her complaints about the notes and the November 3rd interview with the OIG investigator. The Commission notes, however, that prior to her interview with the OIG investigator there is no evidence of any concerns about her job performance nor was there any indication that she posed a direct threat to herself or others. Although we certainly do not condone Complainant's alleged behavior both before and during the meeting, we do not find that the behavior justified the Agency's medical inquiry almost two weeks later.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the Agency was justified in its belief that Complainant acted inappropriately in expressing her displeasure with the manner in which the Agency conducted the investigation into her complaints of harassment, the Agency has presented no persuasive evidence that Complainant engaged in any action that would have led the Agency to form a reasonable belief that she posed a direct threat to herself or others or could not perform the essential functions of her position. In this regard, we note the amount of time that expired between the incidents that caused the Agency's concern and the order to undergo the examination process. Complainant was on leave until November 14, 2010. Thus, eleven (11) days after the interview, Complainant was escorted from the plant by Agency police and a nurse and asked to submit to A&#x0026;D testing, which was the first step in a process that continued three (3) days later when she took a psychological evaluation on November 17, 2010, and which concluded on November 29, 2010, twenty-six (26) days after the interview with the OIG investigator.</p>
