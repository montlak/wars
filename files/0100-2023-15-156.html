<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-154"><span class="space">10.</span> Telephonic Hearings and Testimony</h4>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, taking the testimony of certain witnesses telephonically is a routine procedure in EEO hearings. Videotaped testimony is also admissible, though its use is not as frequent due to the expense. Often, the testimony of physicians and other expert witnesses, whose presence can be both difficult and expensive to secure, is taken by telephone. For the most part, credibility determinations involving these witnesses do not hinge upon demeanor evidence but on whether there is a valid foundation for the opinions they render. Thus, not having an opportunity to observe the witness is not an obstacle to determining the probative value to give to their testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, for several years the Commission's San Antonio District Office had a practice conducting nearly all of its hearings telephonically. This led some in the federal sector EEO community to question whether administrative judges can adequately assess the credibility of witnesses without being able to see their demeanor, particularly in cases where pretext is the main issue.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_526"></span>In 2006, the Commission struck down the practice of holding hearings telephonically, leaving only a narrow exception. In <span class="Italic">Louthen v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a44521.txt">01A44521</a> (2006), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05a60806.txt">05A60806 (2006)</a>, the administrative judge took the testimony of all 12 witnesses by telephone, even though the complainant objected and the administrative judge was in the same city as the parties. The Commission reversed the findings of no discrimination and remanded the case for an in--person hearing. The Commission denied reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Louthen v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05a60806.txt">05A60806 (2006)</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Madaris v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0120131585.txt">0120131585</a> (2013), the Commission explained the procedures for approving telephonic testimony:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Louthen v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A44521 (May 17, 2006), the Commission addressed the issue of telephonic hearings and testimony. The Commission concluded that AJs should not conduct telephonic hearings or take testimony by telephone, except where there are exigent circumstances or a joint and voluntary request by the parties. Where exigent circumstances exist, the AJ must find and document that the situation requires a hearing or testimony by telephone. If exigent circumstances are not present, to hold a telephonic hearing or take testimony by telephone requires that the parties submit a joint request to the AJ, and, prior to the hearing, the AJ must obtain a statement of consent reflecting that they have been informed of the limitations of taking testimony telephonically. Further, the AJ must be satisfied that it is unlikely that the credibility of any witness testifying telephonically will be at issue. The parties' joint request as well as the AJ's ruling on it must be documented in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">A foreshadowing of the <span class="Italic">Louthen</span> decision came in 2005 when the Office of Federal Operations had <span class="Italic">Louthen</span> and a companion case still under consideration. The opinion in the companion was mistakenly put on the Commission's website before it was finalized. In <span class="Italic">Berry v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A35079 (2005), the Commission has written a draft opinion finding that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in taking some testimony telephonically where she had already held two days of in-person hearings, had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of key witnesses, and the complainant raised no objection to completing the hearing telephonically. In <span class="Italic">Berry</span>, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission first addresses complainant's arguments regarding the AJ's decision to conclude the hearing telephonically. This record reveals the following in that regard: This case was scheduled to be heard in North Charleston, South Carolina on January 15 and 16, 2003 by an AJ from the Commission's Charlotte, North Carolina District Office. A total of 10 witnesses, including complainant, were approved to testify. However, at the end of the second day, complainant's representative had begun but not yet concluded his cross-examination of agency witness LCM, a member of the selection panel involved in the third non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, by letter dated January 28, 2003, the AJ offered the parties a choice of dates for continuing the hearing, specifying on which dates she would be available in person or by telephone. Through the agency's representative, the AJ learned that complainant's representative was not available on the dates she specified for in-person appearance. The AJ therefore scheduled the hearing for one of the telephone appearance dates, February 13, 2003. Complainant, however, declined that date, citing "negotiations at work." Complainant also charged the AJ with "impropriety and impartiality [sic]" and requested that the case be assigned to a different AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By letter dated February 11, 2003, the AJ offered the parties alternate hearing dates. Nothing further was head from the parties until the agency's representative contacted the AJ on March 26, 2003, noting that complainant had been present at work and presumably was available to continue the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ thereafter rescheduled the hearing to continue telephonically on April 10, 2003. On April 7, 2003, complainant's representative cited a schedule conflict and proffered several alternate dates, specifically requesting that the hearing continue in person.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By order dated April 9, 2003, the AJ set the continuation of the hearing for April 29, 2003, one of the complainant's proffered dates. The AJ noted that this date was the only date proposed by complainant on which she was available, and that because of the schedule conflicts the day before and the day after, she would be unable to travel in order to continue the hearing in person; the matter therefore would proceed telephonically. The AJ noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I do not believe this telephonic testimony will prejudice either party, however, because I have already had the opportunity to observe the key witnesses in this matter. The remaining portion consists of the completion of [LCM's] testimony, the possible recall of the Complainant, and two additional panel members, whose testimony is quite possibly repetitious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a companion case decided today, the Commission has held that, with limited exceptions, hearings should be held in person, and not telephonically. In <span class="Italic">Louthen v. Department of the Army</span>, the Commission noted that the post-hearing factual findings of an AJ are afforded review under the "substantial evidence" standard rather than being subjected to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review. The Commission further noted that the basis for this deference is the AJ's opportunity to observe the witnesses during a hearing, an opportunity which the Commission, as appellate arbiter, does not have. The Commission concluded that "[c]onsidering the special weight given to an AJ's demeanor-based credibility determinations...the AJ should be afforded maximum opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness." <span class="Italic">Louthen v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A44521.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes in the case at bar, the AJ scheduled two full days to conduct a hearing into three relatively straight-forward non-selections. All of the key witnesses were observed by the AJ during in-person testimony. When the hearing could not be concluded within the time set, the AJ attempted to reschedule the hearing in accordance with complainant's request for an in-person continuation. It is noted that complainant's cooperation was not entirely forthcoming in this regard. When the AJ scheduled the hearing for telephonic continuation on a date proffered by complainant, she addressed the matter of possible prejudice to the parties, noting that she had already had the opportunity to observe the key witnesses and indicated that she expected the remaining testimony to provide cumulative information. Finally, it is noted that the AJ issued specific credibility determinations with regard to only two witnesses--complainant and agency witness NS--and only with regard to matters on which she observed them to testify during the in-person portion of the hearing. The Commission finds that the case at bar presents a set of circumstances under which the AJ's determination to conclude the hearing by telephone was not inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See Louthen</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A44521.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Berry</span> case was pulled from the Commission's website a few days after it first appeared.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although it took more than a year and the unusual step of the direct deliberations of the Commissioners prior to reconsideration, the Commission ultimately reissued <span class="Italic">Louthen and struck down telephonic hearings, except in limited circumstances.</span> Noting that the case was one of first impression, the EEOC reviewed the history of hearings in federal sector EEO cases. First, the Commission observed that the federal government had been exempt for the 1964 Civil Rights Act. However, discrimination in the federal sector was prohibited by executive order which gave the former Civil Service Commission the authority to issue regulations for the processing EEO claims. "From the first, the regulations included a provision for an individual raising a claim of discrimination to obtain a hearing before a disinterested arbiter," the Commission noted.</p>
<p class="noindent">Continuing to trace the history of federal sector EEO hearings, the Commission noted that it had carried over the CSC regulations, including the right to a hearing, when the EEOC became responsible for enforcing Title VII in the federal sector. The only exception to the complainant's right to a hearing in the federal sector has been the authority of an administrative judge to issue a summary judgment decision after notice to the parties and an opportunity to argue why a hearing should be held. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Louthen</span> went on to explain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1992, 29 C.F.R. Part 1613 was superseded by 29 C.F.R. Part 1614. The new hearing regulation, found at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109, clarified the circumstances under which an AJ could issue findings and conclusions without a hearing. In addition to a <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> determination by the AJ, the regulations for the first time specified that either party could move for a recommended decision without a hearing, subject to notice and opportunity for the non-moving party to respond to the motion. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e) (1992). The regulation stipulated, however, that a motion for a decision without a hearing is appropriate only where "some or all material facts are not in genuine dispute <span class="Italic">and there is no genuine issue as to credibility...</span>." (emphasis supplied) <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614,109(e)(l), 1614.109(e)(3);<span class="Italic"> see, e.g., Williams v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05931149 (May 26, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is noted here that the Commission has long granted a measure of deference to the factual findings of an AJ, in particular according greater deference to credibility determinations based on testimonial inferences. In <span class="Italic">Embree v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, the Commission noted, "[O]nly the AJ, as the fact finder, has the opportunity to personally observe the demeanor and reactions of the witnesses.... Consequently, we accord more weight to credibility determinations based on testimonial inferences...." (citations omitted)<span class="Italic"> Embree v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05901054 (November 15, 1990); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Hanratty v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01922312 (May 6, 1993), n.9 (testimonial inferences drawn from demeanor, expressions, tone, pace, or physical appearance of witnesses are lost in transcription of hearing or trial onto paper)<span class="Italic">; Johnson v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No, 05910359 (June 21, 1991) (considerable weight given to AJ's credibility determinations based on direct observation of witness demeanor because this perspective not available to Commission reviewing record from written transcript).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_527"></span>The weight given to AJ testimonial-based credibility determinations, expressed in <span class="Italic">Embree, et al</span>, took on new import with the 1999 revision of 29 C.F.R. Part 1614. Under the revised regulations, the decision of the AJ, previously "recommended," is binding on both parties, subject to the right of appeal to the Commission by either party or the filing of a civil action by the complainant. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.110. Further, and significantly, the revised regulations provide for a dual standard of appellate review. From 1979 until the 1999 amendments, the Commission had exercised <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review over all cases brought before it on appeal. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1613.234 (1979), 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405 (1992). As of the 1999 revision, however, "[t]he decision on appeal from an agency's final action shall be based on a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, except that the review of the factual findings in a decision by an administrative judge issued pursuant to &#x00A7; 1614.109(i) shall be based on a substantial evidence standard of review." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking explained this change as follows: "[T]he substantial evidence standard does not preclude meaningful review of factual findings. However, applying the <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard of review to the factual findings of the administrative judges' final decisions after hearings would be an inefficient use of EEOC's limited [appellate] resources. In addition, since EEOC's Office of Federal Operations did not see and hear the witnesses, it would not be in a position to second-guess the administrative judge during the appellate process, especially with respect to credibility determinations based on a witness' [sic] demeanor...." 63 Fed. Reg. 8601 (1998). Plainly, such deference to the factual findings of the AJ was premised on the expectation that the AJ would have the opportunity to personally observe the witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission concluded that "[c]onsidering the special weight given to an AJ's demeanor-based credibility determinations...the AJ should be afforded maximum opportunity to observe the demeanor of a witness." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Louthen</span> pulled up just short of saying that telephonic testimony or a telephonic hearing is never permissible, instead opting for an "exigent circumstances" test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes that in exigent circumstances it may be necessary to take the testimony of a witness, or to conduct an entire hearing, telephonically. For instance, the parties or witnesses to an action may be at far-flung locations and travel is impractical for reasons other than mere inconvenience or expense to the parties, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a civilian witness has been deployed on military reserve duty. Witnesses who are not Federal employees or who have left Federal service and cannot be compelled to appear in person may nonetheless be willing to testify telephonically. Taking testimony by telephone may be an appropriate reasonable accommodation where a witness or party has a disability that prevents him or her from participating in a hearing in person. This is not an exhaustive list of the limited circumstances in which a telephonic hearing or telephonic testimony may be warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A telephonic hearing or testimony is permissible when the AJ determines that such exigent circumstances require it and the AJ documents these circumstances in the record. If exigent circumstances are not present, a telephonic hearing (or telephonic testimony) may be conducted only if the parties submit a joint request to the AJ. In such a case, prior to the date of the hearing, the AJ must obtain a statement of consent from both parties to the telephonic hearing or testimony, reflecting that the parties have been informed of the limitations of taking testimony telephonically. Further, the AJ must be satisfied that it is unlikely that the credibility of any witness testifying telephonically will be at issue. The parties' joint request as well as the AJ's ruling on them must be documented in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Louthen</span>, the Commission remanded the case to the district office for an in-person hearing before a new administrative judge, noting that "not all such cases may require so extensive a remedy."</p>
<p class="noindent">In a companion case, <span class="Italic">Rand v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a52116.txt">01A52116</a> (2006), the Commission remanded the case for an in-person hearing but did not require the assignment of another administrative judge. The Commission did not specifically explain the variation in remedy between <span class="Italic">Louthen</span> and <span class="Italic">Rand</span>, though it was likely due to the fact that the <span class="Italic">Rand</span> case originated in the Washington Field Office and was transferred to San Antonio, so that the administrative judge was not in the same city as the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission determined that a remand for a new hearing was required in <span class="Italic">McCandless v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A43377.txt">01A43377</a> (2006), where the complainant had repeatedly voiced her objections to a telephonic hearing and the administrative judge's finding of no discrimination was based largely on credibility determinations that involved the demeanor of the witnesses. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Moreno v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120073140 (2010) (no finding of exigent circumstances and lack of written consent by parties); <span class="Italic">Conley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A40787 (2006) (new hearing required where there were no exigent circumstances, all parties and witnesses were in San Antonio, complainant continually objected, there were communication problems during hearing, and judge's findings were based, in part, on credibility determinations); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52071 (2006) (no exigent circumstances where all witnesses were in same city, administrative judge could have traveled, and decision rested largely on credibility determinations); <span class="Italic">Medina v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A44278 (2006) (no exigent circumstances indicating judge could not personally preside, communications problems during hearing, and findings resting on credibility determinations); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. National Credit Union Administration</span>, 01A60380 (2006) (same); <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A50017 (2006) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">While many of the cases remanded for a new hearing have involved appeals by complainants from findings of no discrimination, remands have not been limited to complainants' appeal. For example, in <span class="Italic">Baptiste v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a40038f.txt">07A40038</a> (2006), the Commission remanded a case with findings of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, in <span class="Italic">Neil M. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0720140005 (2016), the Commission upheld a telephonic hearing and found that the administrative judge's scheduling error amounted to exigent circumstances. Noting further that the parties failed to object to the administrative judge's proposal to hold a telephonic hearing, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the AJ did not abuse his discretion in conducting a telephonic hearing. Here, the record reflects that the parties convened in Des Moines on February 8, 2012 for an in-person hearing, but the AJ was unexpectedly absent (and in Milwaukee) because of a scheduling error. In addition, the record reflects that the AJ proposed to conduct a telephonic hearing in order to accommodate his unexpected absence. Moreover, the record reflects that the AJ, before he proceeded with the telephonic hearing, specifically asked the parties if they had any objections and neither party did. Based on the above, we find that exigent circumstances existed such that the AJ was warranted in conducting a telephonic hearing. Although the Agency argues that the AJ did not inquire about specific alternatives to a telephonic hearing, we emphasize that the AJ gave the parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed telephonic hearing and the Agency's only concern was that the record reflect Complainant's consent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Neil M.</span> involved a nonselection, and as to the agency's belated objection regarding credibility determinations, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency argues that the AJ based his finding of discrimination in large part on credibility determinations, we emphasize that the AJ's credibility determinations were not facially of a nature that suggests they could only be reliable if' the AJ had been in the same room with S3. We note that the AJ's credibility determinations were not based on S3's demeanor or tone of voice, but on comparing the substance of S3's hearing testimony to the application package documents, the selection process, and S3's affidavit testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sotomayor v. Secretary of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a43440.txt">01A43440</a> (2006), the Commission found the decision of the administrative judge to hold a telephonic hearing was harmless error:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission notes that the hearing in this case was held by telephone at the AJ's behest, without the objection of the parties. The Commission has held today that testimony may not be taken by telephone in the absence of exigent circumstances, unless at the joint request of the parties and provided specified conditions have been met. <span class="Italic">Louthen v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A44521. However, since the facts of this case pre-date <span class="Italic">Louthen</span> we will assess the propriety of conducting the hearing telephonically by considering the totality of the circumstances. Here, it is unclear whether exigent circumstances existed. On the other hand, it is clear that there were no issues of witness credibility that might have been impacted by the taking of testimony telephonically. Under these circumstances, even if it is assumed that the AJ abused his discretion in this case by taking testimony telephonically, the Commission finds that his action constituted harmless error.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Britany N. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120141929 (2016) (there were no issues of witness credibility that might have been impacted by the taking of testimony by telephone, and neither party objected to the manner in which those witnesses testified); <span class="Italic">Bostick v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720120021 (2013) (agency manager had retired prior to hearing and agency did not object to telephonic testimony); <span class="Italic">Mannon v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070074 (2012) (physician could have appeared in person but finding of no disability discrimination rendered judge's error harmless); <span class="Italic">Creasey v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01A53345 (2006). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Kidd v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A41617 (2006), the Commission found no need for remand where exigent circumstances may have existed because a key witness was in a remote location and, although the judge's decision did make credibility findings, it did not rest solely on credibility findings. In <span class="Italic">DiGiangi v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120053932 (2006), the Commission found exigent circumstances where some of the witnesses were in the Mariana Islands and another witness was in Saipan. Witnesses who could attend the hearing did and, ultimately, the decision of the administrative judge did not rest entirely on credibility findings. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A40871 (2006), the Commission found no need for remand even though there was no indication in the record that exigent circumstances existed where only one witness had testified by telephone, credibility was not an issue with respect to that witness, and neither <span id="Page_528"></span>party had objected to taking the testimony by telephone. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Clements v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50052.txt">07A50052</a> (2006), the Commission found no reason for remand where neither party objected to taking the testimony of two witnesses telephone, credibility played a factor in evaluating the testimony of only one of those witnesses, and the credibility determination was not based on demeanor, but on the detail of the testimony of that witness. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A45519 (2006) (testimony of doctor determined to be credible based on detail not demeanor); <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A34968.txt">01A34968</a> (2006) (findings based on medical evidence and not witness credibility).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Avila v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A60023 (2006), the Commission found harmless error on the part of the administrative judge in holding the hearing by telephone. Although it did not appear from the record that any exigent circumstances existed, neither party objected to the telephonic hearing. Moreover, although the judge's finding of discrimination was based on credibility findings, the Commission determined those findings were not based on demeanor. Two of the witnesses did not testify at the hearing and the judge determined their affidavits were not credible. With respect to the agency official who did testify by telephone, the Commission determined the witness was found not credible based on internal inconsistencies in the testimony of that witness, as well as the fact that the official's testimony was inconsistent with that of other witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lurensky v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 012006104 (2008), the Commission found there was no error in a telephonic hearing even where both parties had objected both prior to the hearing and during the hearing. In doing so, the Commission also muddled the circumstances as to when taking the testimony of a particular witness by telephone is permissible. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lurensky</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the hearing in this case was held by telephone, with the AJ participating by telephone, while the parties and witnesses met at a single location in Washington D.C. Both parties objected to telephone hearing format both at the outset of the hearing and at various points during the taking of witness testimony. On appeal, complainant argues that the AJ should not have conducted the hearing by telephone. The Commission has held that testimony may not be taken by telephone in the absence of exigent circumstances, unless at the joint request of the parties and provided specified conditions have been met. <span class="Italic">See Louthen v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A44521 (May 17, 2006). However, since the facts of this case pre-date <span class="Italic">Louthen,</span> we will assess the propriety of conducting the hearing telephonically by considering the totality of the circumstances. Here, no exigent circumstances existed. We note, however, that the AJ's decision does not rely on conclusions regarding witness credibility that have been impacted by the taking of testimony telephonically. The AJ made no credibility determinations based upon any witness's general demeanor, manner of testifying, or tone of voice. Under these circumstances, even if it is assumed that the AJ abused her discretion in this case by taking testimony telephonically, the Commission finds that her action constituted harmless error<span class="Italic">. See Garcia v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A45437 (July 19, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120090096 (2010), the Commission found that there were exigent circumstances for taking the testimony of two witnesses by telephone. The witnesses had been listed on the agency witness list, but the agency decided not to call them as both witnesses were from out of town. At the hearing, the complainant objected stating he had planned on cross-examining the witnessed and did not realize that he also needed to place them on his witness list. The Commission found that the administrative judge properly determined there were exigent circumstances and that the testimony of the witnesses was properly taken by telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120120882 (2014), the Commission found that exigent circumstances existed in taking the telephonic testimony of a witness in Germany where technical difficulties with the video equipment could not be resolved:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we note that the VLTP Specialist no longer worked with the Agency when she testified telephonically. Moreover, at the time of the hearing, this witness was in Germany working for another agency. Further, the record reveals that the witness was scheduled to testify via video conference but, during the hearing, the Agency discovered that its video-conferencing technology was incompatible with the technology of the witness' current agency. Additionally, attempts to rectify the matter by consulting with the other agency's technology personnel were stymied by the unavailability of personnel in Germany because of the significant time zone difference, and the AJ's insistence that the hearing not be prolonged for additional days because of the technical difficulties. Finally, we note that the witness who testified in Germany did not provide testimony that is pivotal or central to the outcome of this case. As such, we find that exigent circumstances existed in this case that justified allowing the witness to testify telephonically. Therefore, we do not find that the AJ abused her discretion with regard to this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission does not consider social engagements to present exigent circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120123547 (2014), the Commission found that denial to take the telephonic testimony of a witness who was at a wedding did not constitute exigent circumstances, but the failure of video equipment did:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a preliminary matter, we find the AJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Complainant's request to permit her witness to testify by telephone. We consider Complainant's explanation that her witness, Wi, was unable to appear at the hearing because she was attending the wedding of her sister. We consider Complainant's description of the circumstances under which the Agency, at the time scheduled for the hearing, requested that one of its witnesses be permitted to testify by telephone because video conferencing equipment had failed on that day. We find the AJ granted the Agency's request upon a showing of exigent circumstances, while the social event cited by Complainant for her witness's absence from the hearing presented no comparable occasion. Furthermore, we find an affidavit is in the record from W1.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Erickson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0120080008 (2010), the Commission found that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in disallowing the testimony of the complainant's physician in a reasonable accommodation case. The Commission noted that the physician was local, there was no evidence of exigent circumstances under <span class="Italic">Louthen</span>, and that the physician's credibility was critical to a determination of whether the complainant was a qualified individual with a disability. The Commission did note that it would be more expensive for the complainant to have had the physician testify in person that did not constitute exigent circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Huddleson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090005 (2011), the Commission found that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in allowing the complainant's physician by telephone, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a threshold matter, we note that one witness in this case, Complainant's physician (p1), testified via telephone. The Commission has held that testimony may not be taken over the telephone in the absence of exigent circumstances, unless at the joint request of the parties and provided that specified conditions have been met. <span class="Italic">See Louthen v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A44521 (May 17, 2006). The witness in question was not a federal employee. In <span class="Italic">Louthen,</span> an example of an exigent circumstance is a witness who is not a federal employee or who left federal service that cannot be compelled to appear in person and may nonetheless be willing to testify telephonically. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Such is the case here. Therefore, we find that the AJ properly exercised discretion in allowing P1 to testify by telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge did not abuse her discretion by conducting a telephonic "preliminary hearing" between the parties to clarify the issues presented in the case. <span class="Italic">Christeen H. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142242 (2016). Though the Commission framed the telephonic discussion as a "preliminary hearing," it was more likely a prehearing conference where the judge entertained oral arguments on a summary judgment motion. The most important distinction between <span class="Italic">Christeen H.</span> and the <span class="Italic">Louthen</span> case, and one that the Commission was careful to note, is that the judge did not entertain witness testimony during the preliminary hearing.</p>
