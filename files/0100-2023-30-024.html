<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-25"><span class="space">A.</span> BACK PAY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Awards of back pay apply to a wide range of personnel actions, such as removals, suspensions, demotions, denial of within-grade increases, failure to promote, and failure to hire. Awards of back pay in discrimination cases are governed by 5 CFR 550.805. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(b)-(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">Pursuant to 5 CFR 550.804(a):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an appropriate authority has determined that an employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, the employee shall be entitled to back pay under section 5596 of title 5, United States Code, and this subpart only if the appropriate authority finds that the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action resulted in the withdrawal, reduction, or denial of all of part of the pay, allowances, and differentials otherwise due the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC is an appropriate authority under the Back Pay Act, as is an agency head or his designee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 550.803. Actual computations for back pay awards are performed in accordance with 5 CFR 550.805:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;When an appropriate authority corrects or directs the correction <span id="Page_1712"></span>of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal, reduction, or denial of all or part of the pay, allowances, and differentials otherwise due an employee--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The employee shall be deemed to have performed service for the agency during the period covered by the corrective action; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The agency shall compute for the period covered by the corrective action the pay, allowances, and differentials the employee would have received if the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action had not occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;No employee shall be granted more pay, allowances, and differentials under section 5596 of title 5, United States Code, and this subpart than he or she would have been entitled to receive if the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action had not occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent">In calculating a back pay award as the result of a finding of discrimination, the Commission must assume that the complainant has performed satisfactory work, or at least at the fully successful level. <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Postmaster General</span>, 04A10049 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">A succinct statement of the general rules governing back pay awards was set forth in <span class="Italic">Carmon-Coleman v. Secretary of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/04a30030.txt">04A30030</a> (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of a back pay award is to restore to petitioner the income she would have otherwise earned, but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody,</span> 442 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975); <span class="Italic">Davis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (November 29, 1990). The agency is required to make certain deductions from back pay awards to ensure that the employee does not receive more in total benefits than she would have received in the absence of the personnel action. The person who has been discriminated against must receive a sum of money equal to what would have been earned by that person in the employment lost through discrimination (gross back pay) less what was actually earned from other employment during the period, after normal expenses incurred in seeking and holding the interim employment have been deducted (net interim earnings). The difference between gross back pay and net interim earnings is net back pay due. Net back pay accrues from the date of discrimination, except where the statute limits recovery, until the discrimination against the individual has been remedied. Gross back pay should include all forms of compensation and must reflect fluctuations in working time, overtime rates, penalty overtime, Sunday premium and night work, changing rates of pay, transfers, promotions, and privileges of employment to which the petitioner would have been entitled but for the discrimination.<span class="Italic"> See Allen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04940006 (May 31, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission construes "benefits" broadly to include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, annual leave, sick leave, health insurance, overtime and premium pay, night differentials and retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">See Verb v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04980008 (February 29, 1999). A back pay claimant under Title VII generally has a duty to mitigate damages. The burden is on the agency, however, to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner has failed to mitigate her damages.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(d); <span class="Italic">McNeil v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960436 (December 9,1999). The Commission recognizes that precise measurement cannot always be used to reduce the wrong inflicted; nonetheless, the Commission believes that the burden of limiting the remedy rests with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Davis, supra.</span> It is the agency's obligation to ensure that its back pay calculations are clear, supported in the record and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has acknowledged that calculation of back pay awards with the goal of placing the employee where he or she would have been but for the discrimination often involves a degree of speculation. Uncertainties in the method of calculation are resolved in favor of the complainant. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Postmaster General</span>, 04990018 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes that precise measurement cannot always be used to remedy the wrong inflicted, and therefore, the computation of back pay awards inherently involves some speculation<span class="Italic">. Hanns v. United States Postal Services,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04960030 (September 18, 1997). The Commission has held that uncertainties involved in a back pay determination should be resolved against the agency which has already been found to have committed acts of discrimination<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (November 29, 1990); <span class="Italic">Besemer v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04890005 (December 14, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Daniel v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420070004 (2006), the Commission described the agency's obligations to provide back pay relief and calculations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provided relief is designed to make a person who has been subjected to discrimination "whole" by placing him "as near as may be, in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed." <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-419 (1975). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501, an aggrieved shall be deemed to have performed service for the agency from the date the individual would have entered on duty until the date the individual actually enters on duty for all purposes except for meeting service requirements for completion of a required probationary or trial period. The Commission recognizes that precise measurement cannot always be used to reduce the wrong inflicted; nonetheless, the Commission believes that the burden of limiting the remedy rests with the defendant agency. <span class="Italic">Smallwood v. United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 728 F.2d 614, 616 n.5 (4th Cir.), cert, denied, 469 U.S. 832 (1984). It is the agency's obligation to ensure that its back pay calculations are clear, supported in the record and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501,....</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee is entitled to any incremental increase she would have received if not for the prohibited discrimination, and to any overtime she can demonstrate would have been worked had the discriminatory action not been taken. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01832701 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">As with any final order of the agency, the complainant can appeal a back pay award. An agency may not withhold the payment of any undisputed amount of a back pay award contingent upon the complainant waiving his or her right to appeal. <span class="Italic">See Hart v. Postmaster General</span>, 04990023 (2000). "Such an action is tantamount to interference with the EEO process." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When the amount of back pay is in dispute, the burden is on the agency to produce documentary evidence of the hours the complainant would have worked and the rate of pay he would have received but for the prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Moreno v. USPS</span>, 01880274 (1988). If the agency fails to produce evidence to support its back pay calculations, the Commission will give it another chance to submit such evidence--a courtesy not ordinarily extended to complainants who fail to meet their evidentiary burden the first time. However, if the agency continually fails to provide such evidence in response to Commission orders, then the full amount of potential back pay will be awarded. For example, because the agency failed to follow the Commission's order to conduct an investigation into the number of hours complainant would have worked absent discrimination, the Commission ordered the agency to award the complainant full pay for the period in question in <span class="Italic">Adesanya v. Postmaster General</span>, 04980016 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Adesanya II</span>, the Commission ordered the agency to conduct another supplemental investigation, specifying in great detail what information the agency was to gather in order to answer petitioner's theretofore undisputed allegations that she could have performed 90 percent of her regular duties during the period she was denied work; that other employees worked overtime performing tasks she could have performed on a straight-time basis; and that the agency accommodated weight-lifting restrictions of other non-pregnant employees during that time period. The agency inexplicably failed to comply with the Commission's Order in <span class="Italic">Adesanya II</span>, and instead merely resubmitted the previous, inadequate investigation. The Commission therefore will direct the agency to pay petitioner the back pay and benefits, including overtime, she would have earned had she been permitted to work her regular full-time schedule during the period in question.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant has a duty to cooperate with the agency to assist with back pay calculations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Perez v. Postmaster General</span>, 04A40041 (2005) (no failure of agency to comply with EEOC relief order where delay was due to failure of complainant to cooperate with agency on calculations).</p>
<p class="noindent">Back pay calculations are the nightmare of every representative, whether he or she represents complainants or agencies. Whether the back pay calculation results from a finding of discrimination or a settlement agreement, the agency's interest is in getting out of the case as inexpensively as possible and the complainant's interest is in getting as much money as possible. In settlement agreements, these competing interests can be addressed by specifying the actual dollar amount of back pay. Indeed, it is hard to imagine why, in settlement of a case, the parties would risk endless litigation over the amount of back pay. Nonetheless, such cases are not infrequent. Nor is it entirely clear why agencies risk paying large attorney fee awards over disputes involving small amounts of back pay where findings of discrimination have issued. Yet, again, it repeatedly happens.</p>
<p class="noindent">Lest anyone doubt the validity of the above, consider the following case. In April 1999, the Commission faced for a fifth time an appeal in the case of <span class="Italic">Randolph v. Postmaster General</span>, 01970008 (1999). The complainant alleged the agency breached a settlement agreement by its back pay computations. The Commission began its present <span class="Italic">Randolph</span> decision by incorporating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Background portion of <span class="Italic">Randolph [v. Postmaster General</span>], EEOC Appeal No. 01941542 [(May 1995)] fully sets forth the procedural history of the settlement breach allegation and the Commission's attempts to have the agency recalculate the amount to be paid to appellant pursuant to the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In the 1999 appeal of <span class="Italic">Randolph</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency found that appellant was paid for 1,408.9 hours of straight (non-overtime; i.e., regular) hours as compared to the average hours of 1,361 paid to the other PTFs during the same time period. The agency found that appellant was paid 47 more hours than the average employee. The Commission finds that the agency has compared the average work hours by the employees other than appellant to the actual hours paid to appellant. This was improper. The evidence supplied by the agency <span id="Page_1713"></span>indicates pay hours and work hours for each employee (apart from overtime hours) The Commission previously found:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he number of hours appellant may have actually worked is not relevant to the matters at issue in the instant case; rather, we find that since the essence of the settlement agreement is compensation, the relevant matter is the difference between the hours for which appellant was paid and the hours paid to the other part-time flexible employees at her pay location.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Randolph</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941542.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After examining the records supplied by the agency the Commission finds that the difference in pay hours and work hours is apparently (in most if not all instances) the leave taken by the employees; thus, it appears that the regular pay hours are the amount of regular hours for which the employees were actually paid and the work hours are the amount of regular hours actually worked by appellant (which does not include hours taken for leave). The issue in the settlement agreement is compensation<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Therefore, appellant should be compensated for the difference between the average regular pay hours of the other employees (not including appellant) and the regular pay hours of appellant for the relevant time period. Because we are remanding the matter for other calculations as discussed herein, we shall remand the matter of the recalculation of the regular pay hours to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Having examined the agency's failure to document its calculations of other pay owed to the complainant, including a computation that the complainant agreed was an overpayment, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Randolph</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes the long history of the instant settlement breach allegation which spans, at present, over seven years, and, including the instant decision, five separate appeals to the Commission. The agency has repeatedly failed to make the proper calculations. Although appellant may have been paid all (or more than) she is due under the settlement agreement the Commission must be able to independently determine that such calculations were properly made. In light of the repeated unsuccessful attempts by the Commission to have the agency make the correct calculations, the Commission shall order the parties to meet in an attempt to resolve the differences in their calculations. If no agreement can be reached after such a meeting, then the agency shall reissue a decision with its new calculations and providing appeal rights to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its orders for <span class="Italic">Randolph</span>, the Commission enumerated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7.&#x2003;Within 30 days of the date this decision becomes final the agency shall contact appellant so that a meeting may be held to discuss the agency's recalculations pursuant to this Order. Such a meeting shall occur no later than 60 days after the date this decision becomes final unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">8.&#x2003;If no resolution of the matter can be achieved after the meeting between the parties, then, no later than 90 days after the date this decision becomes final, the agency shall:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Issue a new decision on the breach of settlement allegation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Pay appellant any additional monies due under the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A copy of the agency's new decision must be sent to the Compliance Officer referenced herein.</p>
<p class="noindent">Bear in mind that the dispute in <span class="Italic">Randolph</span> encompassed only about 50 hours of back pay and there was even the possibility the complainant had been overpaid. Surely, the agency expended far more than the value of the disputed compensation in defense of its actions. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 04990022 (1999) (the Commission could not decipher the agency's back pay and interest calculations).</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in a series of attempts by the Postal Service to avoid the issuance of back pay in discrimination cases, the Commission held that the agency may not use its own regulations to shield it from liability under Title VII. For example, in <span class="Italic">Fiene v. Postmaster General</span>, 04920009 (1992), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In EEOC Appeal No. 01900911, the Commission ordered the agency to issue a check to petitioner for the appropriate amount of backpay, interest on backpay, and other benefits under pertinent OPM regulations. In many previous cases, the agency has argued that backpay awards under Title VII are controlled by Postal Service regulations. In previous decisions, the Commission has explained that Title VII provides for make-whole remedies and has noted numerous courts have awarded backpay against the Postal Service under Title VII. Under the statutes administered by this Commission, we are empowered to issue orders, instructions and regulations as we deem necessary to effectuate the remedial purposes of the statutes. Regarding backpay awards, the Commission has, pursuant to Title VII and 29 CFR 1613.271, chosen to follow OPM Regulation 5 CFR 550.805, which sets forth a method of backpay computation under the Back Pay Act. The agency may not erect a set of regulations that acts as a shield or limitation on the extent of its liability under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ann C. Ferguson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880848 (May 8, 1990). The Commission has repeatedly reaffirmed this principle. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bobby D. Jefcoat v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900261 (August 27, 1990) and <span class="Italic">Joseph I. Sellman v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04910001 (November 16, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's back pay liability is not infinite. An employee may recover back pay only up to two years prior to the filing of the complaint. <span class="Italic">Wewers v. General Services Administration</span>, 01880297 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">For many positions in the federal government, computation of back pay is relatively easy. Many of the positions are full-time, salaried jobs and therefore, calculation of the back pay is simply a matter of prorating the salary over the appropriate period of time while accounting for any incremental increases that would have occurred. However, the federal government also employs many people on an hourly basis in both full-time and part-time positions with variable hours. Computing back pay in such cases is far more complex. In such cases, the Commission will look at the totality of circumstances in calculating the amount of back pay. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cotton v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01932096 (1994), the Commission rejected both the agency's and the complainant's method of back pay and implemented its own formula:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where discrimination is found, the injured party is to be placed, as near as may be, in the situation she would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed<span class="Italic">. Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has recognized that the computation of a back pay award is inherently speculative. Consequently, unrealistic exactitude is not required. Further, the law is well settled that once an employer is found to have discriminated, uncertainties in determining what an employee would have earned should be resolved against the discriminating employer<span class="Italic">. McIssac v. Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920136 (March 30, 1992); <span class="Italic">Salinas v. Roadway Express, Inc.</span>, 735 F.2d 1574, 1578 (5th Cir. 1984). The agency found that appellant was entitled to back pay from October 27, 1991, the date she was reassigned from the Rod and Gun Club to September 8, 1992, the date she resigned from the Arts and Crafts Center. We agree. A back pay claimant under Title VII generally has a duty to mitigate damages. Specifically, &#x00A7; 706(g) of Title VII, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g) provides that "interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the backpay otherwise allowable." Here, appellant left her job at the Arts and Craft Center without securing another job, and hence, ceased mitigating her damages. Accordingly, the agency properly found that its back pay liability ceased after September 8, 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the number of hours appellant would have worked had she stayed in her variable hour position at the Rod and Gun Club during the back pay period should be based on the average number of hours worked there by other employees, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, approximately 23 hours a week. Appellant argues that this figure should be based on her work history at the Rod and Gun Club, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, approximately 39.4 hours a week.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's method of calculation is too imprecise. First, because appellant was a sales clerk at the Rod and Gun Club, a calculation of the number of hours she would have worked had she stayed there should start from the hours appellant as a sales clerk would have worked. It appears the agency averaged the hours of employees in all positions worked at the Rod and Gun club. Further, just taking an average is too imprecise because appellant had a practice of working overtime when the opportunity was provided. There may have been sales clerks, who, unlike appellant, only wished to work a very limited number of hours. The hours worked by such clerks should not be considered in calculating the number of hours appellant would have worked had she stayed at the Rod and Gun Club.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the same time, appellant's method of calculation is too imprecise. The record suggests that during the relatively short period appellant worked at the Rod and Gun Club, the Club was short staffed with regard to sales clerks. Further, the record suggests that funding and/or business significantly dropped off for the Rod and Gun Club at some point after appellant stopped working there. Accordingly, the hours appellant worked at the Rod and Gun Club during her stint there may well not provide an appropriate basis of calculation. Below, we will explain the proper method of calculation, given the specific circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the agency should assume, since appellant worked many hours as a variable hour employee and accepted overtime opportunities, that she would have worked the maximum number of hours she would have had an opportunity to work. Next, with a sanitization of identities, the agency should list the number of hours worked by each sales clerk at the Rod and Gun Club during the back pay period (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, October 27, 1991 to September 8, 1992, the date appellant resigned from the Arts and Crafts Center). Finally, the agency should then assume, on a pay period to pay period basis during the back pay period, that appellant would have worked the same number of hours as the sales clerk who worked the most hours during each pay period.</p>
<p class="noindent">In such cases, factual development of the record is extremely important. <span id="Page_1714"></span>Doubts will be resolved in the complainant's favor unless the agency can come forward with evidence to support its back pay calculations.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant's work history is too short to accurately project lost earnings for back pay purposes, it is appropriate to look at the earnings history of a similarly situated employee. For example, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933156 (1994), the Commission found that the complainant, who was terminated some 10 weeks after her oriGINAl hiring date, had too short of a tenure to use as an adequate guide in determining the appropriate amount of back pay. However, the Commission found that it was appropriate to use the earnings history of a similarly situated white male to determine the number of hours the complainant would have worked.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not enough that the agency correctly compute any amounts of back pay, interest, and other benefits due. The agency must provide the complainant with sufficient information to determine whether or not the agency's calculations are correct. In <span class="Italic">Morra-Morrison v. Postmaster General</span>, 04980023 (1999), the Commission, frustrated by the number of times the complainant had to approach it with compliance questions, ultimately ordered the agency to provide the complainant with one person who could serve as a "point of contact" for compliance questions. For anyone interested in how much work and money is wasted by an agency obstinately trying to nickel and dime a successful complainant, <span class="Italic">Morra-Morrison</span> is required reading.</p>
