<h4 class="h4" id="sec19-28"><span class="space">2.</span> Commonality and Typicality</h4>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge must ensure that the claims of class members share common questions of fact and raise claims that are typical of those raised by the class agent. Typicality is often confused with commonality, but the concepts involve two different interests. Commonality explores whether the putative class members share enough common or similar interests so that one decision, binding on all, is in the interest of justice and fair to the members. Typicality, on the other hand, concerns whether the interests of the class agent are similar enough to all in the putative class that a decision on the agent's claims can be applied on a broad scale to other class members. The analysis for each criterion is different. For example, <span class="Italic">Tessa L. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0720170021 (2017), involved an allegation that the agency's decision to decentralize the sign language interpreting services and funding resulted in delayed and denied reasonable accommodations for its deaf and hearing-impaired employees. As to the commonality question, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of the commonality and typicality requirements is to ensure that a class agent possesses the same interests and has experienced the same injury as the members of the proposed class. <span class="Italic">See Gen. Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. 147 (1982). Both commonality and typicality serve as guideposts for determining whether, under the circumstances, maintenance of a class action is economical and whether a proposed class agent and the remaining potential class members' claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While these two criteria tend to merge and are often indistinguishable, they are separate requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Commonality requires that there be questions of fact common to the class; that is, that the same agency action or policy affected all members of the class. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10107 (May 8, 2003). Typicality, on the other hand, requires that the claims or discriminatory bases of the class agent be typical of the claimed bases of <span id="Page_1625"></span>the class. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A class agent must be part of the class he seeks to represent, and must "possess the same interest and suffer the same injuries" as class members. <span class="Italic">Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. at 160. Moreover, claims must be sufficiently typical to encompass the general claims of the class members so that it will be fair to bind the class members by what happens with the class agent's claims. <span class="Italic">Conanan v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01952486 (Jan 13, 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. at 156). The underlying rationale of the typicality and commonality requirement is that the interests of the class members be fairly encompassed within the class agent's claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ concluded that the requisite nexus exists to establish common questions of fact and law between Class Agent and the putative class members. The AJ noted that the class complaint challenges the effect of the Agency's decision to decentralize the system for administering and funding requests from deaf and hard of hearing employees for qualified sign language interpreter services. The AJ further noted that the specific accommodation denied in these instances (the lack of consistent, reliable, or any sign language interpreter services at all) is typical of Class Agent's claims as well as those of the putative class members. Accordingly, the AJ concluded that Class Agent and the putative class members consist of a uniform group of individuals, in that they are all deaf or hard of hearing employees employed by the Agency in the NCR. The AJ further noted that the record contains affidavit testimony demonstrating that the putative class members have suffered or will suffer similar, or in some cases, the same injury. Specifically, the AJ noted that Class Agent avers that deaf or hard of hearing employees have failed to receive (or have received inconsistent and/or unreliable) qualified sign language interpreting services for Department services (including the Health Unit, Gym facilities, postal services, security office, parking office) and Department-wide events (such as specific-themed fairs). Accordingly, the AJ concluded that the class complaint satisfies the commonality and typicality prerequisites.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues on appeal that since decentralization, the sub-agency policies and practices regarding interpreter administration do not have a common administrator, a common standard, a common process, a common policy, or a common outcome. Accordingly, the Agency argues that there is no "glue" holding together the reasons for all of the sub-agencies' responses to requests for interpreters and, thus, no commonality among the putative class members' claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Agency's argument. We agree with the AJ that the Departmental Management decision to dismantle the centralized interpreting fund is the "glue" that holds the reasons for the alleged discrimination experienced by each class member together. The class complaint asserts that if it were not for this policy change, Class Agent and the members of the class would not be experiencing a lack of consistent, qualified interpreting services both within their respective sub-agencies and at Department-wide functions. The degree of centralized administration involvement in the present matter is high, given that the decision was made by DM and allegedly has an adverse impact on all U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) sub-agencies in the NCR. DM provides "overall direction and coordination for the administrative programs and services of USDA...[and] direct[s] customer service to Washington, D.C. employees." According to the class complaint, the decision by a high-level centralized administration to dismantle the centralized interpreting fund has been applied to the class as a whole, which caused a systematic failure to provide consistent and qualified interpreting services for deaf and hard of hearing employees to perform essential functions and to access the benefits and privileges of employment both at the sub-agency level and at Department-wide events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with Class Agent that the cases cited by the Agency are distinguishable from the facts herein. Contrary to the cited case law, this class action argues that the Department's discriminatory policy (the decentralization of interpreting services) has the effect of discriminating against the proposed class of deaf and hard of hearing USDA NCR employees as a whole. This single policy has caused a common discriminatory act (i.e., failure to provide, across the entire Department, the reasonable accommodation of consistent qualified interpreting services). This case is about the discriminatory conduct of DM, which oversees accommodations for all deaf and hard of hearing employees. This class complaint is not about the sub-agencies' violation of the law, but rather the DM's refusal to retain effective means of providing consistent, qualified interpreting services, and deciding to dismantle the centralized system without regard for the needs and rights of deaf and hard of hearing employees. The sub-agencies allegedly had no opportunity to allocate costs for interpreting services in their budgets or to train their staff to ensure that consistent qualified interpreting services would be provided in an uninterrupted manner. The Class Agent claimed that DM's action allegedly left the sub-agencies in a state of total disorder.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the question of typicality, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Tessa L</span>. explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with the AJ that the typicality requirement is met. While typicality is met when there is some nexus between the class agent's claims and the class members' claims, this prerequisite does not mandate that the class agent's circumstances be identical to those of the class members.' <span class="Italic">See Meyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assoc., LLC</span>, 707 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp</span>., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998). Factual differences in the claims of the class members should not result in a denial of class certification where common questions of law exist. <span class="Italic">See Milonas v. Williams</span>, 691 F.2d 931, 938 (10th Cir. 1982). Class Agent and the putative class members claim that the DM discriminated against them through the dismantling of the centralized interpreting fund which resulted in lack of reasonable accommodations. The Class Agent's claims do not need to be identical in every respect to the claims of the class members. The basic premise underlying Class Agent's claim and the class members' claim is the same--the very same act of dismantling the centralized fund caused everyone to suffer lack of reasonable accommodations in the form of consistent, qualified interpreting services for essential functions of their respective employment and Department-wide functions. Complainant's specific job responsibility of handling her agency's interpreting requests does not distinguish her from the other class members. She, as a deaf USDA employee, has allegedly suffered a lack of consistent, qualified interpreting services as a result of the decentralization of interpreting services.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Aurore C. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp</span>., 0120150342 (2018), is another good case example of commonality and typicality. In that case, the Commission affirmed the administrative judge's refusal to certify the class because not all of the class members shared the same discriminatory bases as the class agent (typicality) and not all class members had the same interests or suffered the same harm as the class agent (commonality):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Class Agent did not establish typicality since she did not establish that all of the class members have the same discriminatory bases as she does. Class Agent stated that the discrimination suffered by the class is on the bases of race (African American), color (Black), sex (female), age (over 40), and reprisal for prior protected activity. However, a review of the record reveals that not all of the class members are alleging the same bases of discrimination. For example, Class Agent contends that there are "151 employees affected by the reorganization in a discriminatory and disparate manner." Class Agent's Response to Judge's Inquiry at 6. Class Agent then states that, of those 151 individuals, approximately 78 are African American and black, approximately 84 are female, approximately 57 participated in protected EEO activity, and many are over the age of 40. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As a result, Class Agent did not establish typicality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that Class Agent did not establish commonality. There is no evidence in the record to support the finding that all of the class members possess the same interests and suffered the same harm as Class Agent. For example, there are no affidavits from other class members containing anecdotal evidence describing harm that they suffered similar to Class Agent. Instead, Class Agent provided broad conclusory allegations of class-wide harm. Mere conclusory allegations of discrimination, standing alone, do not establish commonality. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A30562 (Sept. 23, 2004). Additionally, the proposed class consists of employees at various grade levels, various positions, and under various supervisors in various divisions, and Complainant did not make it clear in the record that these differences had no impact on the harm each class member allegedly suffered. Further, Complainant has very fact specific allegations of harm, such as she applied for a GS-14 Auditor position in the AED, and the Agency asked OPM to "pass over" her because they deemed her to be not qualified. There is no evidence in the record that any other proposed class member also applied for a GS-14 Auditor position and the Agency deemed him or her not qualified. As a result, we find that Complainant did not establish commonality.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although commonality and typicality are two separate requirements for class certification, they are closely related and often analyzed together in certification decisions. Their treatment by the EEOC is based on the courts' interpretations of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). "As a <span class="Italic">general</span> rule, the commonality issue focuses upon the claims and injuries of the plaintiff and class whereas the typicality issue focuses upon the claims and defenses of the defendant. While the individual may raise the same issues, such as promotion, as is raised for the class, the typicality requirement is not satisfied if the <span class="Italic">individual's</span> claim is not susceptible to class-wide proof." <span class="Italic">In re Department of Treasury</span>, 01811826 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">The class agent must "be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members." <span class="Italic">Norris v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01841957 (1985). Commonality does not imply absolute identity and "it is sufficient to satisfy this prerequisite that questions of law or fact common to members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individuals." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">"These requirements (commonality and typicality) effectively 'limit the class claims to those <span class="Italic">fairly</span> <span class="Italic">encompassed</span> by the named plaintiff's claims.'" <span class="Italic">Zamora v. Department of Air Force</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, (quoting <span class="Italic">Telephone Company of the Southwest v. Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. 147, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed.2d 740 (1982) <span id="Page_1626"></span>(emphasis supplied by EEOC)). In <span class="Italic">Zamora</span>, the Commission found a class was properly defined as: GS-9s and above, covered by a merit promotion plan, and allegedly discriminated against through the competitive selection process on the basis of sex and national origin. A class is not established on the basis of commonality where all class members are present employees and the class includes applicants who were denied employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mara v. USPS</span>, 01851589 (1987). The named class members failed to allege any injury in common with applicants for employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not sufficient that each subclass of the entire class satisfy the elements of commonality and typicality. <span class="Italic">Antoine v. Postmaster General</span>, 01982065 (1999). In that case, the Commission agreed that the subclass of custodians raised issues that satisfied the commonality and typicality requirements. However, the custodians' issues did not share commonality and typicality with the class of maintenance mechanics who brought the complaint. The Commission, therefore, found that the class should be limited to the mechanics.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brockman v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01842660 (1986), the Commission held that the class agent must do more than merely make general allegations of pervasive discrimination to meet the requirements of commonality and typicality:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[An] appellant may maintain an "across the board" class complaint (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, one in which the appellant complains of one employment practice while other class members complain of other practices, but all of them allegedly suffer from essentially the same injury) only if she demonstrates a sufficient nexus to the class so as to represent them even though they suffer different injuries stemming from the same practices. <span class="Italic">General Telephone Company of the Southwest v. Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. 147 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To demonstrate such nexus under Title VII the appellant must meet the Rule 23(a) prerequisites which include commonality and typicality. According to the teachings of <span class="Italic">Falcon</span>, a careful evaluation of these prerequisites are necessary to determine whether the class claims are "fairly encompassed" within appellant's claim. Thus, the validity of the class claim hinges upon whether the claim itself reflects the genuine existence of questions of law or fact which are common to and typical of a real class of complaints. The mere allegation that class discrimination has occurred, however, is insufficient to establish the existence of or define the composition of the class.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Falcon</span>, the Supreme Court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an individual's claim that he has been denied a promotion on discriminatory grounds, and his other unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual, such that the individual's claim and the class claim will share common questions of law or fact and that the individual's claim will be typical of the class claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. 457 U.S. at 157.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> teaches that the mere presentation of facts sufficient to support the individual claim of the class would not necessarily justify an inference that the discriminatory treatment suffered by the appellant is typical of the employer's discriminatory practices, or that the practices are pervasive and cut across departmental and/or policy issues. Consequently, it is necessary to probe behind any generalized allegations of class discrimination to see if there are real issues of fact or law that touch on real class members. In other words, the burden is on the class agent to establish with a reasonable amount of specificity that she is a member of an identifiable class and that she possess the same interest and suffered the same injuries as the class members. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">East Texas Motor Freight v. Rodriquez</span>, 431 U.S. 345 (1977)...(footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brockman</span>, the Commission determined that appellant's injury of a 10-day suspension did not meet the <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> prerequisites when the employee alleged a department-wide conspiracy that resulted in more discipline for blacks than whites. The complainant was unable to cite further examples of discipline applied to the class, and the agency submitted statistics that tended to show that blacks within the unit received disciplinary actions in almost the same proportion as they did agency-wide. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mathews-Frazier v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A44789 (2006) (generalized allegation of discrimination by itself does not establish commonality).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Department of Navy</span>, 01852943 (1987), the Commission upheld the dismissal of a class complaint where the representative sought to challenge hiring and other employment practices with respect to all past, present, and future black employees and applicants:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In focusing on the typicality requirement, the courts have found that "there must be a showing that the representative plaintiff has a claim which affects the members of the class to an extent that the interests of the representative party...[are] coextensive with the interests of the entire class...." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Pan American World Airways</span> 74 F.R.D. 24, 15 FEP Cases 1640, 1649 (N.D. Cal. 1977) [quoting <span class="Italic">Eisen v. Carlisle Jacquelin</span>, 391 F.2d 555, 562-563 (2nd Cir. 1968)].</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also noted that courts have consistently held that employees challenging promotional practices lack the required "nexus" with persons pursuing allegations of discriminatory hiring practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a class agent can allege "across-the-board" discrimination against a certain protected group, demonstrating the requisite commonality of the claims is not easy. The complainant must make some demonstration that a common procedure or policy of the agency acts to discriminate against the group. General allegations that such a policy exists will not be sufficient, even if supported by some anecdotal evidence. In <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 07A10107 (2003), the Commission rejected the findings of an administrative judge that the proposed class demonstrated commonality on an "across-the-board" claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has determined that the AJ erred in finding that complainant established commonality. Commonality requires that there be questions of fact common to the class. The putative class agent must establish an evidentiary basis from which one could reasonably infer the operation of an overriding policy or practice of discrimination. Generally, this can be accomplished through allegations of specific incidents of discrimination, supporting affidavits containing anecdotal testimony from other employees who were allegedly discriminated against in the same manner as the class agent, and evidence of specific adverse actions taken<span class="Italic">. Belser v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A05565 (December 7, 2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Mastren v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930253 (October 27, 1993)). "Across the board" actions which involve allegations of discrimination in different practices such as hiring, promotion, termination, training, and awards, will not be certified merely because the class members share the same race, national origin, or sex<span class="Italic">. Mastren v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930253 (October 27, 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">General Tel. Co. of the SW v. Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. 147, 150-52 n.4, 159 n.15 (1982)). When raising a claim of "across the board" discrimination, allegations of specific discriminatory treatment, absent evidence of some common policy or practice, such as proof of an entirely subjective decision-making procedure, do not support class certification<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01994220 (March 15, 2002) (citation omitted). Conclusory allegations, standing alone, do not show commonality<span class="Italic">. Mastren v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930253 (October 27, 1993). Factors to consider in determining commonality include whether the practice at issue affects the whole class or only a few employees, the degree of centralized administration involved, and the uniformity of the membership of the class, in terms of the likelihood that the members' treatment will involve common questions of fact<span class="Italic">. Mastren v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930253 (October 27, 1993) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the class agent's request for class certification fails because the class agent did not show that common questions exist among the purported class members; therefore, the class complaint did not satisfy the requirement of commonality. The class complaint is merely an "across the board" claim of discrimination that fails to identify any discriminatory policy or practice which has the effect of discriminating against the class as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a letter to the parties, dated December 14, 1999, the AJ requested that the class agent provide the AJ with additional information to enable him to determine whether the class should be certified. Regarding the commonality requirement, the AJ asked the class agent to describe how the alleged discriminatory actions occurring at the class agent's facility relate to the alleged discriminatory actions at other facilities, or, whether the class claims concern only actions at the class agent's facility. The AJ also asked the class agent to describe what information the class agent had to support his belief that there are discriminatory policies or practices common to his facility and other facilities. In his July 30, 2001 decision certifying the class, the AJ cites the class agent's January 14, 2000 response, which referenced the "nationwide near-absence of Hispanic Managers at USGS," and "identified eleven Hispanic employees from five different locales who have filed formal complaints of discrimination regarding promotions, work environment and assignments." The AJ also relies on testimony from the class agent's deposition in which the class agent claims, "[I]f you look at the 1997 statistics on Hispanic managers, there are three GS-13's in the whole country outside of Puerto Rico and there-is one SES. Most of the managers that are Hispanic are under the GS-13 level."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the AJ's rationale for finding commonality is flawed. To support a finding of commonality the AJ relies, in part, on a list of eleven complainants provided in the documentation provided by complainant. The Commission finds, however, that the information regarding the eleven complainants from five different locales who filed formal complaints is merely a list of names without further elaboration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his decision certifying the class, the AJ also relies on the fact that complainant provided a copy of a report entitled "Views on Minority Problems" that "discusses in general terms undocumented, alleged 'abuses' to minority (including Hispanic) employees in the western region." This report is an unsworn, unsigned document that does not <span id="Page_1627"></span>speak directly to the issues affecting Hispanic employees. The report only describes personnel actions as they pertain to "minorities" and "non-minorities." Significantly, the report fails to define what groups these terms encompass. Although the cover letter to the report states that most of the information contained in it can be verified, the Commission notes that in fact, the information has not been verified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has not identified any agency policy that has the effect of discriminating against the class as a whole. In his brief in support of his petition for class certification, complainant claims, "[T]he USGS utilizes facially neutral employment policies and procedures in a subjective decision-making fashion that results in an adverse impact on Hispanic employees." Complainant claims that while the policies of the agency may be non-discriminatory, he believes that there is an unwritten policy not to discipline or hold accountable managers who discriminate against Hispanic employees, and that this unwritten policy "emanates from the very top." Complainant identifies two USGS Central Region managers, who were allegedly responsible for permitting practices that discriminate against Hispanic employees, one of whom had "a great deal of authority" in selecting managers and over reorganizations in the district that negatively impacted Hispanics. Complainant also identified the USGS Central Region Chief of the Personnel Office and Personnel Specialist as the officials involved in his downgrade, which complainant claims resulted when the Regional Office denied complainant's position description upgrade to a GS-12 position from a GS-11 position, despite the fact that complainant had been performing GS-12 level duties. Complainant contends that the agency's EEO department is responsible for the agency-wide discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although complainant lists management officials at the national and regional level who are allegedly responsible for discrimination against Hispanic employees, he fails to describe any specific actions taken by these officials which had any discriminating effect on the class, and complainant fails to provide, and the AJ does not cite, examples of discriminatory use of facially neutral employment policies that affected the class. The simple naming of management officials is insufficient to constitute a common theme or practice. Declarations of the identified EEO officials indicate that they were not responsible for developing and implementing discriminatory employment and/or personnel policies and practices at the agency. Their responsibilities are to implement the agency's EEO programs. Moreover, the AJ concluded in his Interim Ruling and Order that the claims regarding the ineffectiveness of the agency's EEO process and affirmative action policies would not be considered in connection with the certification of the class complaint. Complainant's generalized allegations about management's actions and unwritten rules, without more, is insufficient to establish commonality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the AJ's decision, the AJ concludes that complainant demonstrated statistically the under-representation of Hispanic employees nationwide at higher grades and regarding awards. These statistics, even if accurate, fail to address any common scheme or practice resulting in the alleged discriminatory promotions, selections, training assignments, duty assignments, awards, evaluations, selections to managerial positions, or creation of a hostile and offensive work environment<span class="Italic">. See Yarborough v. Federal Maritime Commission,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01893535 (Dec. 14, 1989), req. to reopen denied, EEOC Request No. 05900323 (July 20, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As advanced by the agency in its October 31, 2000 brief in opposition to class certification, complainant has not provided specific, detailed, and reliable information, such as that contained in affidavits or declarations from putative class members, showing that they were personally affected by the agency's alleged discriminatory practices and policies. In finding that complainant established commonality among the purported class members, the AJ relies in part on a survey of USGS Hispanic employees that was conducted by complainant. Thirty-seven purported class members responded to the survey. There is no survey included in the record for the purported class agent. Twenty-nine out of the 37 current or former employees indicated that they wanted to be included as members of the class complaint, three indicated that they did not want to be members, and 5 indicated either that they were unsure, did not know, or left the response area blank. The survey is not probative of discrimination based on race (Hispanic) or national origin (Hispanic). Significantly, the survey does not ask the respondents to indicate the basis/bases for the alleged discrimination. Question 20 asks, "Have you ever been a victim of discrimination?" Although 32 individuals responded "yes" to Question 20, indicating that they had been victims of discrimination, even examining the entire survey, and not strictly the responses to Question 20, only eight respondents indicated that they experienced discrimination because they were Hispanic. The survey, like the "Views on Minority Problems" report, only asks the putative class members to <span class="Italic">compare</span> themselves to "non-minority employees," and, similarly, it too does not define what groups are encompassed by the terms "minority" and "non-minority." Ultimately, the "survey" fails to show any purported agency policy which has the effect of discriminating against the class as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ erred in granting the class agent's request for class certification because complainant failed to identify a question of fact common to all members of the class. Since we find that the class agent's request for class certification fails because it did not meet the requirement of commonality, it is not necessary to make determinations regarding typicality, numerosity, or adequacy of representation.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Fogg v. Attorney General</span>, 0120073003 (2012), the Commission found its administrative judge erred in finding there was no commonality and typicality where a black criminal investigator for the U.S. Marshall's Service alleged that the agency discriminated against black employees in work assignments, giving preferential treatment to white employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that AJ-1 improperly determined that the legal requirements of commonality and typicality were not met. In his October 17, 2004 declaration, which Complainant included in his "Comments and Statements in Response to Commission's Request for Reconsideration," Complainant alleges that during the course of his 17 year employment with the USMS, he was subjected to discrimination based on race and reprisal. Specifically, Complainant alleges that the Agency had a practice of giving "non-Black employees [...] preferential treatment with respect to the assignment of law enforcement positions." Complainant alleges that this practice had the affect of subjecting him to disparate terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to less preferable work assignments and opportunities to advance within the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this same pleading and attached as Exhibits 2 and 3 to his appeal, Complainant includes declarations from 22 Black USMS employees, alleging that they experienced similar incidences of discrimination over the course of their employment with the USMS. <span class="Italic">See</span> August 20, 2007 Appeal, Exhibits 2 and 3; <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090003 (Mar. 26, 2010) (The Commission certified a class where complainant alleged a lack of promotional opportunity due to: the agency's performance review process, the ability to fill a position without posting the vacancy, the ranking done by the central rating board, and Commander approval, and supported the allegation with affidavits and statistical evidence showing that other African-American employees, also subject to the same agency promotional process, had not risen to the aspired Pay Band).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CM-1 stated that he worked for the USMS for a total of 12 years, and worked at the GS-12 level as a Deputy Marshall for approximately nine years in Alabama. CM-1 states that he was subjected to discrimination based on his race over the course of his employment by being denied promotions in favor of less senior less qualified White employees, and by being assigned less preferable work than similarly situated white employees. CM-1 states that he was discriminated against because of his race upon being hired by the USMS. CM-1 states that although he had a law enforcement background, he was only permitted to enter the USMS at the GS-5 level while White candidates with no law enforcement background were hired at the GS-7 level. In 1998 CM-1 states that he applied for a merit promotion to an instructor position at the Law Enforcement Academy, and that his application tied with a White Deputy's for fifth place on the "Top Five" list. CM-1 states that only the applications of the White applicants were considered for the position. CM-1 states that he inquired about his application being disregarded, and was informed that a mistake had been made; however, nothing was ever done to rectify the mistake.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CM-2 stated that he has worked for the USMS for over 18 years. At the time he made his declaration, CM-2 indicated that he was a GS-13 Supervisory Deputy. CM-2 stated that despite being eligible to bid on GS-13 positions in 1990, it took him three years after becoming eligible to be promoted to the GS-13 level. CM-2 stated that, in 1991, he applied for a vacant supervisory position in the Fugitive Division. CM-2 states that he had a background in the Division and was the most senior employee in the division. CM-2 says that despite his qualifications his application was denied and a White male who had never worked in the Division was selected. Throughout the 1990s, CM-2 says that he applied for and made the "Top Five" eligibles list for approximately fifty GS-14 positions. Each time, CM-2 states he was denied the promotion and a less or equally qualified White male was selected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CM-3 stated that he has been employed by the USMS for approximately 25 years. At the time he made the declaration he was employed as a GS-12 Deputy U.S. Marshall for nearly 11 years. CM-3 alleges that he has only been afforded the opportunity to serve in two temporary promotions at the GS-13 level for a total of five months during his tenure with the USMS, while White employees have been granted more extensive and more regular details. CM-3 states that while he has been repeatedly denied promotions throughout his career despite his qualifications, White Deputy Marshalls that started working with USMS at the same time have been promoted to the GS-13 level and beyond.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CM-4 stated that she had been employed by the USMS for 13 years at the time she made her declaration. In 2004 she had been working for 11 years as a Program Analyst at the GS-9 level. In or around 1993, CM-4 states that she began submitting applications for various GS-12 positions but <span id="Page_1628"></span>was not selected for any of them. CM-4 states that she was well qualified for the positions and more senior than most of the White employees selected for the positions, as well as, those hired in the recent years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains evidence of other examples similar to those summarized above. We find that this evidence is sufficient to meet the commonality requirement. Additionally, we find that this evidence is sufficient to establish that the practices at issue affect the whole class and not only a few employees, and sufficiently alleges a claim of "across the board" discrimination. The declarations Complainant provided from 22 Black USMS employees offer preliminary proof of what appears to be a common Agency practice, and an entirely subjective decision-making procedure affecting Black USMS employees. <span class="Italic">See Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. at 159 n.15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant established typicality for many of the same reasons he met the commonality requirement. The Commission notes that it is necessary for Complainant to make some affirmative showing, beyond individual claims and general class allegations, that discrimination has been suffered by the proposed class. <span class="Italic">See Roliz v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01891595 (January 22, 1990). As discussed and presented previously above, Complainant has provided evidence to support his contention that common claims exist among the purported class members. The declarations from 22 Black USMS employees Complainant produced supports Complainant's assertion that a class of employees within the Agency has been discriminated against due to their race.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the class agent in <span class="Italic">Candice B. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120160714 (2016), was able to establish commonality and typicality in a disparate impact case where she was terminated as a Customs Border and Protection Officer for failing to pass the push-up requirement of a fitness test. In order to obtain a permanent officer position, candidates had to successfully complete three separate fitness tests each with its own push-up requirement. With the successful completion of each fitness test, the candidate would advance to the next level of his or her candidacy. After successfully completing the first two fitness tests, the class agent was assigned to a field office subject to a probationary period and successful completion of the final fitness test, but she failed the push-up portion of the third test and was terminated. The administrative judge originally denied certification, finding that her case was not common or typical of the women who failed the first two tests. The Commission disagreed, and also granted a request to add two more class agents, one that failed the first fitness test and one that failed the second fitness test. Noting that the class agents all shared a common injury, disqualification from obtaining permanent employment, and that they all were challenging a multistage push-up test requirement as a whole, the Commission reversed the AJ's decision in <span class="Italic">Candice B.,</span> reasoning:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, contrary to the AJ and the Agency's contentions, that the commonality and typicality requirements have been established. Here, Complainant challenges an agency policy, which contains qualification standards, as disparately impacting women. She identified the Agency's policy of administering a set of tests that requires that a fixed number of push-ups be performed in a certain amount of time at three points in the process. The tests include detailed written instructions and procedures for conducting the push-up tests. Push-up requirements are uniform, standardized, and documented in the Agency's policies. Failure to perform the number of push-ups in the required amount of time at any stage in the process results in removal from consideration for employment as a CBPO.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That a woman could fail the push-up tests at any one of the steps does not deprive the class of commonality because the push-up requirement is the qualification standard at the center of the complaint that a policy disparately impacts women. We also note that Complainant was able to advance to the third step, having not failed the first two steps that led to her complaint, and she was given a conditional offer of employment, unlike those women who did not reach the third step. We find, however, that the existence of these facts as it pertains to Complainant does not make Complainant's claim uncommon to the class. The common injury is that in failing to pass the push-up tests, the class members were ultimately barred from permanent employment as a CBPO.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The class agents have also established that their individual claims are typical of the class as a whole. Each class agent was required to perform the very same push-up tests as every other woman seeking permanent employment as a CBPO. Each class agent failed. When they failed, their failure ended their progression towards becoming employed as a CBPO. The Commission therefore concludes that the criteria of commonality and typicality have been satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent">Commonality is not established where the only central policy is one of giving local managers discretion in employment decisions and the only evidence of commonality was an expert's opinion that the corporate culture was vulnerable to gender discrimination. <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes,</span> 131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011). In the <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> case, the putative class consisted of some 1.5 million female employees who claimed they were subjected to sex discrimination by local managers with regard to compensation and promotions. Overturning a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals certifying the class, the Supreme Court found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The crux of this case is commonality--the rule requiring a plaintiff to show that "there are questions of law or fact common to the class." Rule 23(a)(2). That language is easy to misread, since "[a]ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common 'questions.'" Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 97, 131-132 (2009). For example: Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart? Do our managers have discretion over pay? Is that an unlawful employment practice? What remedies should we get? Reciting these questions is not sufficient to obtain class certification. Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members "have suffered the same injury," <span class="Italic">Falcon, supra,</span> at 157. This does not mean merely that they have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law. Title VII, for example, can be violated in many ways--by intentional discrimination, or by hiring and promotion criteria that result in disparate impact, and by the use of these practices on the part of many different superiors in a single company. Quite obviously, the mere claim by employees of the same company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate-impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once. Their claims must depend upon a common contention--for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor. That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution--which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"What matters to class certification...is not the raising of common 'questions'--even in droves--but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common answers." Nagareda,<span class="Italic"> supra,</span> at 132.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard. A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule--that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc. We recognized in <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> that "sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question," 457 U.S., at 160, and that certification is proper only if "the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied,"<span class="Italic"> id.,</span> at 161; <span class="Italic">see id.,</span> at 160 ("[A]ctual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a) remains...indispensable"). Frequently that "rigorous analysis" will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim. That cannot be helped. "'[T]he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action.'"<span class="Italic"> Falcon, supra,</span> at 160 <span class="Italic">(quoting Coopers &#x0026; Lybrand v. Livesay,</span> 437 U.S. 463, 469 (1978); some internal quotation marks omitted). Nor is there anything unusual about that consequence: The necessity of touching aspects of the merits in order to resolve preliminary matters, e.g., jurisdiction and venue, is a familiar feature of litigation. <span class="Italic">See Szabo v. Bridgeport Machines, Inc.,</span> 249 F.3d 672, 676-677 (CA7 2001) (Easterbrook, J.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents' merits contention that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination. That is so because, in resolving an individual's Title VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is "the reason for a particular employment decision," <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,</span> 467 U.S. 867, 876 (1984). Here respondents wish to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once. Without some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members' claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial question why was I disfavored.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> describes how the commonality issue must be approached. There an employee who claimed that he was deliberately denied a promotion on account of race obtained certification of a class comprising all employees wrongfully denied promotions and all applicants wrongfully denied jobs. 457 U.S., at 152. We rejected that composite class for lack of commonality and typicality, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an individual's claim that he has been denied a promotion [or higher pay] on discriminatory grounds, and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual, such that the individual's claim and the class claim will share common questions of law or fact and that the individual's claim will be typical of the class claims."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 157-158.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Falcon</span> suggested two ways in which that conceptual gap might be bridged. First, if the employer "used a biased testing procedure to evaluate both applicants for employment and incumbent employees, a class action on behalf of every applicant or employee who might <span id="Page_1629"></span>have been prejudiced by the test clearly would satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 159, n.15. Second, "[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of both applicants and employees if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices in the same general fashion, such as through entirely subjective decisionmaking processes." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> We think that statement precisely describes respondents' burden in this case. The first manner of bridging the gap obviously has no application here; Wal-Mart has no testing procedure or other companywide evaluation method that can be charged with bias. The whole point of permitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evaluating employees under a common standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second manner of bridging the gap requires "significant proof" that Wal-Mart "operated under a general policy of discrimination." That is entirely absent here. Wal-Mart's announced policy forbids sex discrimination, <span class="Italic">see</span> App. 1567a-1596a, and as the District Court recognized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal employment opportunity, 222 F. R. D., at 154. The only evidence of a "general policy of discrimination" respondents produced was the testimony of Dr. William Bielby, their sociological expert. Relying on "social framework" analysis, Bielby testified that Wal-Mart has a "strong corporate culture," that makes it "'vulnerable'" to "gender bias."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 152. He could not, however, "determine with any specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaningful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart. At his deposition...Dr. Bielby conceded that he could not calculate whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking." 222 F. R. D. 189, 192 (ND Cal. 2004). The parties dispute whether Bielby's testimony even met the standards for the admission of expert testimony under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 702 and our <span class="Italic">Daubert</span> case, <span class="Italic">see Daubert v. Merrell Dow</span> <span class="Italic">Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</span> 509 U.S. 579 (1993). The District Court concluded that <span class="Italic">Daubert</span> did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage of class-action proceedings. 222 F. R. D., at 191. We doubt that is so, but even if properly considered, Bielby's testimony does nothing to advance respondents' case. "[W]hether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking' is the essential question on which respondents' theory of commonality depends. If Bielby admittedly has no answer to that question, we can safely disregard what he has to say. It is worlds away from "significant proof" that Wal-Mart "operated under a general policy of discrimination."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs' evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-Mart's "policy" of allowing discretion by local supervisors over employment matters. On its face, of course, that is just the opposite of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action; it is a policy against having uniform employment practices. It is also a very common and presumptively reasonable way of doing business--one that we have said "should itself raise no inference of discriminatory conduct," <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust,</span> 487 U.S. 977, 990 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, we have recognized that, "in appropriate cases," giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact theory--since "an employer's undisciplined system of subjective decisionmaking [can have] precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 990-991. But the recognition that this type of Title VII claim "can" exist does not lead to the conclusion that every employee in a company using a system of discretion has such a claim in common. To the contrary, left to their own devices most managers in any corporation--and surely most managers in a corporation that forbids sex discrimination--would select sex-neutral, performance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no actionable disparity at all. Others may choose to reward various attributes that produce disparate impact--such as scores on general aptitude tests or educational achievements, <span class="Italic">see Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,</span> 401 U.S. 424, 431-432 (1971). And still other managers may be guilty of intentional discrimination that produces a sex-based disparity. In such a company, demonstrating the invalidity of one manager's use of discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another's. A party seeking to certify a nationwide class will be unable to show that all the employees' Title VII claims will in fact depend on the answers to common questions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondents have not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company--aside from their reliance on Dr. Bielby's social frameworks analysis that we have rejected. In a company of Wal-Mart's size and geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction. Respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence, but their evidence falls well short.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statistical evidence consists primarily of regression analyses performed by Dr. Richard Drogin, a statistician, and Dr. Marc Bendick, a labor economist. Drogin conducted his analysis region-by-region, comparing the number of women promoted into management positions with the percentage of women in the available pool of hourly workers. After considering regional and national data, Drogin concluded that "there are statistically significant disparities between men and women at Wal-Mart...[and] these disparities...can be explained only by gender discrimination." 603 F.3d, at 604 (internal quotation marks omitted). Bendick compared work-force data from Wal-Mart and competitive retailers and concluded that Wal-Mart "promotes a lower percentage of women than its competitors." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if they are taken at face value, these studies are insufficient to establish that respondents' theory can be proved on a classwide basis. In <span class="Italic">Falcon,</span> we held that one named plaintiff's experience of discrimination was insufficient to infer that "discriminatory treatment is typical of [the employer's employment] practices." 457 U.S., at 158. A similar failure of inference arises here. As Judge Ikuta observed in her dissent, "[i]nformation about disparities at the regional and national level does not establish the existence of disparities at individual stores, let alone raise the inference that a company-wide policy of discrimination is implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and district level." 603 F.3d, at 637. A regional pay disparity, for example, may be attributable to only a small set of Wal-Mart stores, and cannot by itself establish the uniform, store-by-store disparity upon which the plaintiffs' theory of commonality depends.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is another, more fundamental, respect in which respondents' statistical proof fails. Even if it established (as it does not) a pay or promotion pattern that differs from the nationwide figures or the regional figures in all of Wal-Mart's 3,400 stores, that would still not demonstrate that commonality of issue exists. Some managers will claim that the availability of women, or qualified women, or interested women, in their stores' area does not mirror the national or regional statistics. And almost all of them will claim to have been applying some sex-neutral, performance-based criteria--whose nature and effects will differ from store to store. In the landmark case of ours which held that giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact theory, the plurality opinion conditioned that holding on the corollary that merely proving that the discretionary system has produced a racial or sexual disparity is not enough. "[T]he plaintiff must begin by identifying the specific employment practice that is challenged." <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 487 U.S., at 994; <span class="Italic">accord, Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</span> 490 U.S. 642, 656 (1989) (approving that statement), superseded by statute on other grounds, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(k). That is all the more necessary when a class of plaintiffs is sought to be certified. Other than the bare existence of delegated discretion, respondents have identified no "specific employment practice"--much less one that ties all their 1.5 million claims together. Merely showing that Wal-Mart's policy of discretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity does not suffice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondents' anecdotal evidence suffers from the same defects, and in addition is too weak to raise any inference that all the individual, discretionary personnel decisions are discriminatory. In <span class="Italic">Teamsters v. United States,</span> 431 U.S. 324 (1977), in addition to substantial statistical evidence of company-wide discrimination, the Government (as plaintiff) produced about 40 specific accounts of racial discrimination from particular individuals. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> at 338. That number was significant because the company involved had only 6,472 employees, of whom 571 were minorities, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 337, and the class itself consisted of around 334 persons, <span class="Italic">United States v. T.I.M.E.-D.C., Inc.,</span> 517 F.2d 299, 308 (CA5 1975), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds, Teamsters, supra.</span> The 40 anecdotes thus represented roughly one account for every eight members of the class. Moreover, the Court of Appeals noted that the anecdotes came from individuals "spread throughout" the company who "for the most part" worked at the company's operational centers that employed the largest numbers of the class members. 517 F.2d, at 315, and n.30. Here, by contrast, respondents filed some 120 affidavits reporting experiences of discrimination--about 1 for every 12,500 class members--relating to only some 235 out of Wal-Mart's 3,400 stores. 603 F.3d, at 634 (Ikuta, J., dissenting). More than half of these reports are concentrated in only six States (Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri, Texas, and Wisconsin); half of all States have only one or two anecdotes; and 14 States have no anecdotes about Wal-Mart's operations at all. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 634-635, and n.10. Even if every single one of these accounts is true, that would not demonstrate that the entire company "operate[s] under a general policy of discrimination," <span class="Italic">Falcon, supra,</span> at 159, n.15, which is what respondents must show to certify a companywide class.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent misunderstands the nature of the foregoing analysis. It criticizes our focus on the dissimilarities between the putative class members on the ground that we have "blend[ed]" Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement with Rule 23(b)(3)'s inquiry into whether common questions "predominate" over individual ones. <span class="Italic">See post</span>, at 8-10 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That is not so. We quite agree that for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) "'[e]ven a single [common] <span id="Page_1630"></span>question'" will do, post, at 10, n.9 (quoting Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the Structure of the Class Action, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 149, 176, n.110 (2003)). We consider dissimilarities not in order to determine (as Rule 23(b)(3) requires) whether common questions predominate, but in order to determine (as Rule 23(a)(2) requires) whether there is "[e]ven a single [common] question." And there is not here. Because respondents provide no convincing proof of a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion policy, we have concluded that they have not established the existence of any common question.</p>
<p class="noindent">The effects of the <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> decision in the federal sector are not clear. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0520130561 (2014), the Commission held that it would not apply <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> to cases where class certification was issued prior to the Supreme Court's decision. The Commission went on to explain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span>, which pertains to the requirements of class certification, was issued after the AJ's April 27, 2011 decision on the merits of the class complaint, we find that <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> is not applicable here. Similarly, we find that the appellate decision was not required to revisit the issue of class certification because the AJ had already issued a decision on the merits of the class complaint. Like in <span class="Italic">Hyman</span>, the question of class certification is not properly before us because the merits of the class complaint have already been decided. We find that the instant matter is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, EEOC Request No. 05830298 because a decision on the merits had not been reached in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> when the Commission revisited the issue of class certification in light of the subsequent ruling in <span class="Italic">Falcon</span>. As to the Agency's argument concerning Rule 23(c)(1)(C), we note that the Commission looks to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance, but is not strictly bound by them. <span class="Italic">See Matheny v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30373 (Apr. 21, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that the Agency failed to demonstrate that the appellate decision's failure to apply <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> will have a substantial impact on the policies, practices, or operations of the Agency. The Commission realizes that <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> may have implications for the certification of class complaints in the federal government. However, the Commission deems it prudent to address <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> when the issues raised by <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> are squarely presented, i.e. when the class certification hinges upon an analysis of <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span>. As discussed in detail above, <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> and its impact on class certification was not at issue here because the AJ had already reached a decision on the merits of the class complaint. <span class="Italic">See Hyman</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01840707.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0720110008 (2015), the Commission rejected that agencies argument that <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> precluded certification of a class comprised on Bureau of Federal Prison employees, who from 1999 to 2008 were allegedly denied promotion opportunities in reprisal for EEO activity, holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency, <span class="Italic">citing Walmart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes</span>, 131 S. Ct, 2541, 180 L. Ed.2d. 374 (2011), argues Complainant has failed to demonstrate that the claims of the class members "depend upon a common contention" and that there is "some glue holding the alleged reasons" for the decisions together.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Walmart</span> involved a proposed class consisting of more than a million potential members involving many thousands of management decision-makers and the grant of unfettered discretion to those managers to bind the purported class together. By contrast, in the instant case, Complainant has identified a far smaller purported class of about 3,000. More importantly, the AJ determined that there were common questions of fact and law between Complainant and the proposed class members--that Complainant's claims and those of the proposed class members were linked by a common thread. Specifically, the AJ pointed to evidence that established that all GS-14 promotions and "leadership" positions at any grade were decided by a common group--the "Executive Committee," a relatively small group that exercised considerable subjectivity in their decision-making process. In addition, the next level of promotions was controlled by the regional directors, who were also part of the Executive Committee. The AJ found evidence which showed the individuals who comprised the Executive Committee had knowledge of the prior EEO activity of candidates for promotion. Furthermore, the AJ found that the class complaint alleged that the retaliatory failure to promote was enforced by the Agency's "vouchering" practice, where selecting officials engaged in informal discussions about applicants, and allegedly, prior EEO activity was discussed. The AJ also described an alleged culture of retaliation which existed based on anecdotal comments contained in the class members' affidavits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ further noted that Complainant's expert's testimony provided support for class certification. The expert concluded that individuals who filed EEO complaints were promoted at a significantly lower rate than those who did not. The AJ further noted that even when the promotion rate for all employees was at its lowest at 12%, the promotion for individuals who filed EEO complaints lagged significantly behind at 3%.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ concluded that this combination of factors supported a finding of commonality and typicality. Essentially, the AJ found that there was a pattern or practice alleged of negatively considering prior EEO activity when making promotional decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the Agency's final order and brief on appeal, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the AJ's findings on commonality and typicality are erroneous. Complainant has alleged a sufficiently tailored class comprised of current and former Agency employees who were denied promotions because of prior protected EEO activity. Based on our independent review, we find no reversible error in the AJ's conclusion that the putative class meets these two prerequisites.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Aurore C. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp</span>., 0120150342 (2018), noted the <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart</span> decision, but quickly dismissed its application by distinguishing the facts of the case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes</span>, 564 U.S. 338 (2011), the Supreme Court clarified the standard for "commonality" under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 23(a)(2). The Supreme Court found that plaintiffs can establish commonality by providing "significant proof" than an employer operated under a general policy or a uniform employment practice of discrimination at a high level within a company, as opposed to leaving all employment decisions to the discretion of low-level supervisors spread throughout many different locations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 355-57. Federal courts have interpreted this to mean that, when determining whether a class should be certified, commonality is established when there is a company-wide policy or practice that is applied uniformly throughout the company or throughout one specific location. <span class="Italic">See McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#x0026; Smith, Inc</span>., 672 F.3d 482 (7th Cir. 2012) (the court allowed certification in a Title VII class claim and distinguished the case from <span class="Italic">Dukes</span> where plaintiffs pointed to a uniform company policy that based account distributions on employees' past success with no discretion from management); <span class="Italic">Bolden v. Walsh Construction Co</span>., 688 F.3d 893, 896, (7th Cir. 2012) (the court held that workers failed to satisfy commonality requirement for certification of class of African American workers at all construction sites, and relying on <span class="Italic">Dukes</span> found that commonality does not exist when multiple managers exercise independent discretion at different work sites); <span class="Italic">Youngblood v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc</span>., No. 09 Civ. 3176, 2011 WL 4597555 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2011) (not reported) (the court granted a class certification and distinguished the case from <span class="Italic">Dukes</span> by determining that "the crux of this case is whether the company-wide policies, as implemented, violated Plaintiffs' statutory rights"). While we note this Supreme Court decision and how federal courts have applied it, we also must point out that <span class="Italic">Dukes</span> specifically addressed an interpretation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the Commission is not strictly bound by but does look to for guidance. <span class="Italic">Matheny v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05A30373 (Apr. 21, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Class Agent contends that the alleged discrimination against the class arose from employment decisions of the Agency Director and the BAPD Director. Additionally, all of the proposed class members are located in the same location in Washington, D.C. As a result, assuming without finding that <span class="Italic">Dukes</span> applies to the federal sector, we find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Dukes</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">A class does not have present evidence of identicality to establish commonality and typicality. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cooper, et al. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090043 (2012), the Commission upheld the decision of an administrative judge granting certification to class of employee with disabilities who were on light or limited duty and sent home because the agency alleged it had no work within their restrictions even though the class members were in different crafts. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ determined that the requirements of commonality and typicality were met because the class agents alleged that the Agency engaged in a District-wide practice of refusing work to disabled employees and sending them home. As already noted in this decision, both class agents worked within the Los Angeles District, both have provided evidence that they had medical restrictions due to a disabling condition and had previously been provided light or limited duty assignments because of their medical restrictions, and both were sent home by management during the relevant time period based on the assertion that there was no work available within those medical restrictions. The class agents also identified over 100 individuals within the Los Angeles District that they allege were similarly impacted by the practice of refusing to give work to disabled employees and sending them home. Like the AJ, we find that this evidence is sufficient to support an inference that there exists a class of individuals who were harmed by this identified agency policy/practice and that the class shares common questions of fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that because the two class agents are in different crafts, and because Complainant Cooper has a non-work-related medical condition while Complainant West's injury was accepted by OWCP, their claims are not typical of employees outside their respective crafts and workers' compensation status. The Agency argues, for instance, that certain reasonable accommodations are available to clerks that are not available for letter carriers because there are many more clerk positions <span id="Page_1631"></span>on multiple tours of duty. The Agency also argues that combining light employees and limited duty employees together under the definition of "injured worker" over-simplifies the issues involved in each particular employee's situation. The Agency states that Complainant West, with an on-the-job injury and OWCP payments and coverage, is differently situated from Complainant Cooper, an employee "whose illness or injury arose outside of work and whose medical concerns and benefits are not covered by OWCP."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ, however, rejected the Agency's arguments about the differences in craft and OWCP status and indicated that the "evidence was particularly strong in this case," that an alleged policy of sending employees with impairments home from work, without pay and without reasonable accommodation operated throughout the Los Angeles District without distinction as to location of work, craft or supervisory chain of command. We find that the record supports the AJ's determination in this regard. Moreover, we note that the Commission has previously approved certification of a national class in <span class="Italic">Walker v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060005 (March 18, 2008), regardless of what craft a particular employee occupies. Similarly, we reject that Agency's arguments that the difference in OWCP status (light duty vs. limited duty) makes a difference here. The class complaint is not designed to adjudicate the workers' compensation rights of employees, but their rights under the Rehabilitation Act. The Commission has ruled that "the question of whether an agency has satisfied its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act concerning reasonably accommodating a particular employee is a separate inquiry from any determinations that OWCP might make about that employee." <span class="Italic">Clearly v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120050911 (December 21, 2006), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520070265 (March 2, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">A class can properly consist of persons denied both competitive and noncompetitive promotions. <span class="Italic">See In re Department of Navy</span>, 05850114 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Hadnot v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01932318 (1993), the Commission found that a complainant, who was a supervisor alleging the agency failed to promote him to a higher-level position, had fulfilled the typicality requirement of a class complaint alleging a failure to promote to supervisor positions generally. Because the complainant was alleging a pattern and practice of failing to promote black employees to supervisory positions, his own supervisory status was not fatal to the proposed class certification. <span class="Italic">See Hadnot v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 05940202 (1994) (reaffirming <span class="Italic">Hadnot v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01932318 (1993)). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Woods v. Secretary of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 01961033 (1998) (class representative's claim of a denial of career ladder promotion was not common with claims of failure to promote competitively to management positions).</p>
<p class="noindent">Conclusory allegations that the class has suffered similar injuries are insufficient to maintain a class action. The class agent must make at least some preliminary factual showing to support an inference that there is a common pattern or practice of discrimination that similarly affects all proposed class members. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01922968 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commonality requires that there be questions of fact common to the class members. 29 CFR 1613.601(b)(2). "Across-the-board" actions which involve allegations of discrimination in different practices such as hiring, promotion, termination, compensation, and the like, will not be certified merely because the class members share the same race and sex. <span class="Italic">Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. at 150-152, n.4. In <span class="Italic">Falcon</span>, the court noted that a class representative must specifically identify facts common to the class. Factors to be considered in determining commonality are whether the practice at issue affects the whole class or only a few employees, the degree of local autonomy or centralized administration involved, and the uniformity of the membership of the class, in terms of the likelihood that the members' treatment would involve common questions of fact. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 74 F.R.D. at 41.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since <span class="Italic">Falcon</span>, while courts have not required complainants to prove the merits of their claims at the class certification stage, complainants have been required to prove more than bare allegations that they satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a). Appellant must show some nexus with the alleged class members. <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Booth</span>, 763 F.2d 1366, 1371 (11th Cir. 1985). What is necessary is a specific showing of underlying facts which might raise an inference of a common question of pattern and practice through allegations of specific incidents of discrimination, supporting affidavits containing anecdotal testimony by other employees that there is a class of individuals who were discriminated against in the same manner as the class agent, evidence of a biased testing procedures, or evidence of entirely subjective decision-making and evaluation processes. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Dugger</span>, 823 F.2d 1476, 1487 (11th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that the commonality requirement was satisfied because the class members share common factual questions, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, all Black male Revenue Agents employed by the agency at the GS-11 grade level or above were issued unfavorable performance evaluation ratings, denied an opportunity to enter the Regional Management Career Program, and denied promotions, awards, recognition, and other opportunities for career advancement within the agency. However, with respect to the promotion/career advancement allegation, we find that the class complaint fails to identify a specific policy or personnel practice which allegedly resulted in the non-promotion or denial of career opportunities relating to the identified class members. Nor does the complaint identify specific agency officials allegedly responsible for the class-wide non-promotion or the denial of career advancement opportunities in their capabilities as panel members, selecting officials, or concurring officials. In the absence of substantive evidence demonstrating that the same officials were responsible for the non-promotions or that the disputed non-promotions could be directly attributable to a particular policy or personnel practice, we find that the class members' claims regarding their failure to be afforded promotions or their claims regarding the denial of career advancement opportunities involve different factual questions.</p>
<p class="noindent">What the Commission emphasizes in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> is that, when proceeding under a disparate impact theory, the class must point to a common policy or practice. In cases involving intentional discrimination, the class must show that the same agency officials were responsible for the personnel action at issue, or that the decisionmaking authority was centralized. Both theories of discrimination are discussed in this chapter under the subheadings "<a href="0100-2023-28-060.html#sec19-60">Adverse Impact</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-22-146.html#sec13-145">Intentional Discrimination</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Turner, et al. v. Attorney General</span>, 0720060041 (2007), the Commission refused to certify a class based on an alleged pattern and practice of retaliation against employees who filed EEO complaints, holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In fact, the Commission has arrived at this conclusion before in deciding certification questions similar to this one. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Neufeld v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A32782 (Apr. 1, 2004), we denied certification of an across the board retaliation claim, noting that there was no commonality where different types of conduct are alleged and the proposed class members occupy different jobs series, grades, work under different supervisors, and where the conduct occurred at different facilities and in different levels of management. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A30562 (Sept. 23, 2004), we again encountered similar facts and held that the class agent "does not identify a particular racially discriminatory or retaliatory policy or practice which has the effect of discriminating against the class as a whole. Rather the class complaint includes a wide range of allegedly discriminatory practices, apparently committed by a multitude of different agency officials. As a result, the Commission...finds that...the class agent failed to identify any facts common to the class as whole." <span class="Italic">See also Matthews-Frazier v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No 01A44789 (Apr. 20, 2006) (denying certification of an across the board race and reprisal claim on behalf of African-American employees at two postal facilities where there was "no single theme, policy, common element or decision-maker unit[ing] the claims of the class agent and [the] proposed class members"). As the class complaint fails to meet the certification criterion of commonality, we decline to address the remaining requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant challenges agencywide policies or practices in a class action complaint, the complainant must establish that implementation of those policies or practices is sufficiently centralized so that the proposed class meets the commonality and typicality requirements for certification. In <span class="Italic">Charles v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05880256 (1988), the Commission found that a proposed class of black promotion candidates did not possess a commonality of interest, even though they were challenging the same employment practice, where the proposed class spanned 12 departments of the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The essence of appellants' claim is that the NSCO Merit Promotion System allows excessive subjectivity in decision making and therefore results in race discrimination. Appellants characterize this claim principally as one of disparate impact, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that a facially neutral employment practice has a disproportionate adverse effect on a protected group. (footnote omitted). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424 (1971). The U.S. Supreme Court has recently held that disparate impact analysis may be applied to subjective as well as to objective employment practices. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust</span>, 56 U.S.L.W. 4922 (U.S. June 29, 1988), <span class="Italic">vacating</span> 798 F.2d 791 (5th Cir. 1987). Since the Merit Promotion System challenged herein governs all NSCO departments, appellants argue, the appropriate class is one composed of all black NSCO employees. This argument, however, fails because it ignores the fact that the MPS does not mandate any uniform employment practice (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, any promotion action or criterion for action) within NSCO. The Merit Promotion System is merely a set of procedures or steps through which selection criteria are developed and applicants are evaluated. Selection criteria (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, crediting plans) are developed in conjunction with the department where the vacancy exists, applicants are judged against those criteria by a panel of experts from the relevant department, and the final selection is made by an official of that department. Accordingly, the disparate impact, if any, of the Merit Promotion System would arise on a department-by-department basis. The Commission is therefore persuaded that appellant's interest and injury, if any, are the same as others who sought and were denied positions within the Data Processing Department only and that the <span id="Page_1632"></span>commonality and typicality requirements...restrict the class which appellants may represent to unsuccessful black applicants for positions within that department. (footnote omitted). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sperling v. Donovan</span>, 35 F.E.P. Cases 983 (D.D.C. 1984); <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 30 F.E.P. Cases 11287. (footnote omitted). In so holding, the Commission notes that classes crossing occupations have been certified in disparate impact cases challenging subjective selection mechanisms. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc.</span>, 708 F.2d 475 (9th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Lewis</span>, 559 F. Supp. 943 (D.D.C. 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 731 F.2d 995 (D.C. Cir. 1984)....</p>
<p class="noindent">The key consideration in <span class="Italic">Charles</span> was that there was no evidence of uniform application of the criteria among departments, and because promotion criteria could vary dramatically among the departments, there was no showing of commonality of policy or practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Moten v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 05960233 (1997), the Commission had an opportunity to expand upon its holding in <span class="Italic">Charles</span>. The evidence developed at the time of appeal showed that the agency had a centralized plan for promotion that established various procedures, but the plan was substantively administered in the individual offices where the promotions took place. In remanding the case for further development of the record, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Moten</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next must determine whether appellant meets the commonality and typicality class action prerequisites. The agency forcefully argues here, as it has throughout these proceedings, that it does not employ a unitary and centralized promotion system, and that, for this reason, appellant cannot establish commonality and typicality with employees located in offices other than OPPR. The agency argues that substantive criteria regarding promotions, assignments, training, and performance appraisals are developed in each individual office and are not done on an agency-wide basis. In this regard, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Moten III</span> noted that the agency issued two Merit Promotion Plans (MPPs) covering the applicable period at issue herein, that the MPPs set forth only the procedural framework for selections and promotions, and that the MPPs do not discuss or set forth any substantive factors regarding promotions within specific offices. <span class="Italic">Moten III</span> also noted that agency Administrative Directives (ADs) regarding training, performance appraisals, and assignments, similarly provide only general procedural guidelines and do not set forth any substantive considerations. Finally, the agency contended that the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Charles</span> is directly on point and requires a finding that appellant cannot satisfy the commonality prerequisite given the agency's use of a decentralized promotion process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, appellant contends that the existence of a centralized promotion system, evidenced here by the agency's issuance of MPPs and ADs, permits appellant to represent a class not limited to OPPR. She further contends that in <span class="Italic">Hartman v. Duffey</span>, 19 F.3d 1459, 1472 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the court ruled that even where an employer makes subjective employment decisions, an individual seeking one position may represent individuals seeking other positions as long as the putative class representative makes a sufficient showing that "a common policy of discrimination pervaded all of the employer's challenged employment decisions."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hartman</span>, the court examined whether a class conditionally certified in 1978 and modified in 1984 met the prerequisites for commonality and typicality following decisions on the merits of the class claims. The class agent sought to represent women seeking both foreign and civil service positions with the U.S. Information Agency. The court declined to establish a firm rule "that a named plaintiff who unsuccessfully applied for one job can never represent an employee who unsuccessfully applied for another job simply because the application process for the second job included a separate and different element." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Citing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">General Tel. Co. v. Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. 147 (1980), the court stated that "given sufficient proof, an unsuccessful applicant for one particular job can presumably challenge discriminatory hiring for different job categories where the primary practices used to discriminate in the different categories are themselves similar." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1471.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court further noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[W]here a plaintiff charges that subjective employment decisions have allowed the employer systematically to discriminate on the basis of gender in choosing among the minimally qualified applicants, the potential for common issues of law and fact among applicants for different positions clearly exists regardless of individual differences in job descriptions or minimal qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1472. The court remanded <span class="Italic">Hartman</span> to the District Court for further examination of the class issue. On remand, the District Court, citing to anecdotal and other evidence developed over the years, held that its certification decision was proper and that "the primary practices allegedly used to discriminate against women applicants cut across all job categories...." <span class="Italic">Hartman v. Duffey</span>, 158 F.R.D. 525, 542 (D.D.C. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">Hartman</span> suggests that a class agent may represent a broad range of persons outside of her specific job group, the agency argues, again citing <span class="Italic">Charles</span>, that the Commission has ruled that where an agency-wide merit promotion system provides only a "set of procedures or steps through which selection criteria are developed and applicants are evaluated" and where selection decisions are made on a department-by-department basis, a procedural centralized personnel policy would not establish commonality and typicality among employees located in different offices. For this reason, the agency continues, the Commission held that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Charles</span> could represent as a class agent only those employees who worked in the same department as she.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, as did appellant, that the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Charles</span> was based on a record developed after thirty-eight days of hearing testimony. Similarly, the courts in <span class="Italic">Hartman</span> had the benefit of a well-developed record. The record in this case, though much more developed than the record presented for review in <span class="Italic">Moten II</span>, is by contrast substantially less extensive. What we do have are documents presently indicating that an overarching agency merit promotion policy emanates from a central office, but that specific decisions on promotions may be made department-by-department. Commission precedent--most notably <span class="Italic">Charles</span>--would suggest that the apparent decentralization of decision-making would preclude a finding of commonality beyond the specific department or job held by the putative class agent. As a general proposition, we believe <span class="Italic">Charles</span> retains its validity. In this case, however, we find that the record remain insufficient for the purpose of determining with finality whether appellant may be able to establish commonality and typicality with a class beyond OPPR. Nonetheless, we further find that she has presented sufficient evidence to support a provisional determination of commonality and typicality for the limited purpose of moving forward with this matter. But as <span class="Italic">Charles, Hartman</span>, and Commission regulations make clear, whether an action retains class status or whether a definition of an appropriate class retains validity may be reviewed where facts developed over time raise legitimate questions.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission's decisions in <span class="Italic">Charles</span> and <span class="Italic">Moten</span> indicated that a decentralized selection process would bar complainants from demonstrating the required commonality for a class complaint, in <span class="Italic">Flourney v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 01966586 (1998), the Commission retreated somewhat from that position. In <span class="Italic">Flourney</span>, the Commission found that putative class members may have met the commonality requirement, even though the decisionmaking was decentralized, because the selections still retained a common element of top-level approval. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Flourney</span> noted that there was enough decisionmaking from the "top down" for provisional certification as a class complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At issue in this case is whether the Commission should certify a class of black employees who allege that the Center discriminated against them when it failed to evaluate them for promotion the GS-14 or GS-15 level through the MURC. In his brief, appellant argues that he and members of the class are all subject to the same, secret promotion process, wherein none of the employees is aware as to whether they have been, are, or will be considered for promotion through the MURC. Appellant argues that the agency has implemented a centralized promotion process that employs subjective criteria, resulting in a marked underrepresentation of black employees in higher graded positions. Appellant notes that under the MURC process, employees become eligible for promotion when they have been working in-grade for at least one year; work at the full performance level of their job; have been given additional duties, which has resulted in an accretion of duties; and either have had sufficient interaction among other agency employees who work in different departments or have achieved national or international renown in their fields. Appellant argues that the agency applies these requirements across all its directorates at the Center, exercising a degree of centralized control on the process sufficient to present common questions of law and fact to the matter. He further contends that the agency's failure to consider him for promotion through the MURC process makes his claim typical of the claims of other class members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that whether an employee becomes eligible for consideration for promotion through the MURC process depends in large measure on an accretion of duties; that is, on unanticipated growth beyond the originally established position. The agency further contends that whether this growth has occurred depends on individual supervisory discretion: it occurs where a supervisor assigns work of greater importance or difficulty (or both) to an employee who the supervisor believes can do the work. The agency argues that the MURC process is highly decentralized, using many different supervisors in many different agency directorates. The agency notes that the sixty-eight black GS-13 and GS-14 Center employees who would make up the class work in eight different directorates, on nine different projects, in eleven different branches, and in forty different sections; that no more than three employees work under the same first-level supervisor (and there are only two groups of three and one group of two employees who share supervisors); and only two groups of two employees share job descriptions. The agency also notes that the MURC process begins with an employee's first-line supervisor, who must convince his/her <span id="Page_1633"></span>supervisor that the employee merits nomination to the MURC; sixty supervisors thus are responsible for initiating the process as to these employees. The agency further argues that the only things typical about appellant's situation are that he, like most of his colleagues, has a unique job within the Center and does not share his supervisor with any other potential class member. For purposes of this matter, the agency argues that appellant's conditions of employment are not like those of any of the other employees he seeks to include in the class. The agency argues, in essence, that decisions as to who to nominate for consideration in the MURC process are made on an individual department basis, constituting a decentralized promotion process that does not establish commonality and typicality among employees located in different sections or directorates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, however, that appellant has presented enough evidence to warrant provisional certification of the class and further development of the record. Based on the record as it presently exists, we find that the agency employs an overarching promotion process that emanates from the Center itself, where specific decisions on nominations to the MURC only begin at the branch or section level. The present record suggests that the framework within which the Center pursues promotions through the MURC operates both from the bottom up--first level supervisors make recommendations to their supervisors, who have to convince a division chief and then the "director of" the employee's directorate--as well as from the top down: the directors of each nine directorates have input into the promotion decision and the Director of the Center has the final vote on whether to accept or reject the recommendations of the directors. Moreover, and of particular significance in this case, there is no evidence concerning the assignment of work and whether it is wholly within the discretion of the first-line supervisor or includes the involvement of second-level supervisors or higher officials. The record indicates that much of the Center's work is project-oriented and that an employee's assignment to a project often is what leads to accretion of duties and visibility beyond his/her specific section or Code. Whether agency officials outside of an employee's individual supervisor are involved in deciding who gets what assignment, and who thus would have input into work assignments that could lead to an accretion of duties and exposure to persons outside of the employee's Code, remains an issue for further exploration. So while it is fair to say that the process generally is decentralized, there are aspects of the process that involve persons other than an employee's immediate supervisor. In this regard, the promotional opportunities of appellant and members of the class are affected not just by their immediate supervisors, but by all persons responsible for making project and work assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that Commission precedent--most notably <span class="Italic">Charles v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880256 (November 29, 1988)--would suggest that the apparent decentralization of decision-making would preclude a finding of commonality beyond the specific department or job held by the putative class agent. In this case, we find that the record remains insufficient for the purpose of determining with finality whether appellant may be able to establish commonality and typicality with a class of black Center employees. Nonetheless, we further find, as noted above, that appellant has presented sufficient evidence to support a provisional determination of commonality and typicality for the limited purpose of moving forward with this matter. But as<span class="Italic"> Charles</span> and Commission regulations make clear, whether an action retains class status or whether a definition of an appropriate class retains validity may be reviewed where facts developed over time raise legitimate questions. <span class="Italic">See also Moten v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> EEOC Review No. 05960233 (April 8, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lee v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01990384 (2000), the Commission certified a class of black employees alleging the agency delayed and limited both wages and career opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agency-wide policy is implicated in a complaint, certification of a class spanning more than one department may be proper. In <span class="Italic">Howard v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01994518 (2000), the complaint alleged discrimination in career advancement for African-American employees in the agency's Headquarters offices in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Howard</span> conditionally certified the class based on evidence of an agency-wide policy, and the failure of the agency to come forward with information regarding how the relevant personnel decisions were made among the agency offices at issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has acknowledged that it has issued a Department Administrative Order (DAO) implementing the federal merit promotion policy agency-wide. The agency admittedly also has promulgated agency-wide principles governing the issuance of performance appraisals. Thus, it appears that common standards govern agency promotion and performance appraisal decisions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. In addition, the Commission takes administrative notice of the information set forth in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Annual Report on the Employment of Minorities, Women and People with Disabilities in the Federal Government for the Fiscal Year [FY] 1998 to find that there exist questions of fact and law in common to the members of the class as to whether the agency has denied African-American employees career advancement opportunities to white-collar positions, GS-9 through GS-15 and equivalent non-GS grades, due to their race.... In finding that the commonality requirement for a class complaint has been satisfied provisionally, the Commission recognizes that the class agent and law firm have not had access to pre-certification discovery<span class="Italic">. Hines, et al. v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 0 5940917 (January 29, 1996). The Commission also recognizes that the cited information involves nation-wide statistics which may or may not precisely reflect the situation in the agency's Headquarters offices. However, the agency has exclusive possession of this information which it has not yet provided to the complainant and the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although it is more difficult to press allegations that the entire class has been discriminated against in nearly all regards, the Commission has held that it is error for an administrative judge to fail to consider an "across-the-board" theory of discrimination when ruling on commonality and typicality. In <span class="Italic">Howard v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01956455 (1997), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the legal standards of <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> to this case, the AJ found that common questions did not exist among the purported class members. The AJ's determination was based on the fact that the class agents occupied different job series, salary grades, and worked in different locations under different supervisors. Furthermore, the class agents, according to the AJ, failed to identify some agency policy or practice that discriminated against the class because of race, color, or reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review of the recommended decision, the Commission finds that the AJ overlooked the fact that <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> does not wholly foreclose the possibility that an "across-the-board" class action might be properly certified in appropriate circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Jordan v. County of Los Angeles</span>, 713 F.2d 503, 504, <span class="Italic">modified</span>, 726 F.2d 1366 (9th Cir. 1984) ("<span class="Italic">Falcon</span> does not prohibit 'across-the-board' class formation in every instance.") In fact, <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> noted that the commonality and typicality requirements might be satisfied if there was "[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination," and "the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion in the same general fashion, such as through entirely subjective decision making processes." 457 U.S. at 159 n.15. Typically, cases in which courts have certified "across-the-board class" actions involve allegations that all of the challenged decisions (only some of which affected the named plaintiff(s)) are made through a subjective process, in which a group of white and/or male supervisors exercise total or near total discretion in a discriminatory fashion. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. Byrd</span>, 709 F.2d 1016, 1020 (5th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 464 U.S. 1009 (1983) (although plaintiff had only a transfer claim, she could represent sex discrimination claims of both employees and applicants because decisions of defendant's mostly male supervisors were entirely subjective). Accordingly, the Commission finds that, in the present case, the class complaint must be remanded to an AJ for a determination as to whether it meets the standards for commonality and typicality under the "across-the-board" theory.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the question of whether a complainant is a qualified individual with a disability requires an individualized assessment, a putative class of such individuals does not lack commonality and typicality. In <span class="Italic">Glover v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04428 (2001), the Commission rejected an argument by the agency that the proposed class could not meet the commonality and typicality requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also argues that the putative class does not represent employees with similar interests and, therefore, the putative class lacks commonality and typicality. According to the agency, each individual class member would require separate evaluation from the standpoint of whether, despite compensable injury, s/he was a qualified individual with a disability who could perform the essential functions of the sought-after position and who had the qualifications to be selected. Commonality and typicality require that the class agent possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the members of the proposed class. General Telephone Company of the <span class="Italic">Southwest v. Falcon,</span> 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982); <span class="Italic">East Texas Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodgriguez,</span> 431 U.S. 395, 403 (1979). In application, the commonality and typicality prerequisites tend to merge, and are often indistinguishable<span class="Italic">. Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. at 157, n.13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as the agency appears to argue that it is impractical to determine whether putative class members sought promotions and were not selected despite possessing the relevant qualifications, the Commission has permitted certification of class complaints challenging promotional policies notwithstanding the argument that commonality and typicality are lacking because the selection criteria is not uniform and the positions involve varying skills and duties<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span> <span class="Italic">Moten v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960233 (April 8, 1997); <span class="Italic">Board v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00021 (October 31, 2000). In this case, it is clear that the class agent, as a permanent rehabilitation employee with a disability, and the putative class, other <span id="Page_1634"></span>permanent rehabilitation employees with disabilities, have the same interest and would suffer the same injury under complainant's theory. We conclude that the AJ correctly found that the purported class meets the prerequisites of commonality and typicality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the agency suggests that the putative class is impermissibly impractical because such a class would require a review of each potential class member to determine whether or not s/he is an individual with a disability who sought a promotion for which s/he was qualified, but was not selected for that promotion. The agency presents no law or regulation in support of its contention that we may deny class certification on this ground. Moreover, we note that there is no evidence in the record that the putative class is impractical. The record reveals that the agency failed to comply with the AJ's order to produce evidence as to the total number of employees holding permanent rehabilitation duty positions. Because the agency failed to respond to his order, the AJ inferred that, had the agency produced the evidence, it would have identified sufficient positions to satisfy the numerosity requirement. Since the agency had the opportunity to produce the total number of positions potentially affected by the class action, we are not persuaded by the agency's mere assertion, on appeal, that the putative class is impractically large.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We take this opportunity to point out that even after a class is certified, the Administrative Judge remains free to modify the certification order or dismiss the class complaint in light of subsequent developments<span class="Italic">. See General Telephone Co. v. Falcon,</span> 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982). The AJ has the authority, in response to a party's motion or on his/her own motion, to redefine a class, subdivide it, or dismiss it if the AJ determines that there is no longer a basis for the complaint to proceed as a class complaint<span class="Italic">. Hines v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940917 (January 29, 1996). On remand, the AJ must adequately define the class to enable the agency to comply with 29 CFR 1614.204(e). The Commission finds that the agency improperly rejected the AJ's decision recommending certification of the class and improperly dismissed the complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">The requirements of commonality and typicality are also intertwined with the requirement of adequacy of representation, discussed separately below. A potential class agent who does not share common interests with the proposed class cannot demonstrate that he or she will adequately represent the interests of the proposed class. In <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01920303 (1992), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Typicality requires that the class agent has suffered substantially the same injury as other class members and possesses substantially the same interest as other class members. <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> at 156, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">East Texas Motor Freight Systems v. Rodriguez</span>, 431 U.S. 395, 403 (1977). Some overlap does exist between the commonality and typicality requirements. <span class="Italic">Harriss v. Pan American World Airways</span>, Inc., 74 F.R.D. 24 (N.D. Cal. 1977). Appellant must show some nexus with the alleged class. <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Booth</span>, 763 F.2d 1366, 1371 (11th Cir. 1985). Typicality exists where the class agent demonstrates some nexus with the claims of other class members, which can be shown by demonstrating the similarity between the (agent's) conditions of employment and those of the other class members, and the similarity between the alleged discrimination affecting the agent and that affecting the class. <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Simon</span>, 29 F.E.P. Cases 1541, 1546 (E.D. Penn. 1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reveals that appellant is the only named class agent representing the purported class of Caucasian males and minority males and females. There is no named minority class agent. Thus, we find that appellant's claim, as the only named class agent, to have been the victim of race (Caucasian) and sex (male) discrimination cannot be termed typical of claims of discrimination on account of race (non-Caucasian) or sex (female) that would be raised by minority class members. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bartelson v. Dean Witter &#x0026; Co</span>. 24 F.E.P. 367 (E.D. Penn. 1980). Appellant's claims are, however, typical of claims of discrimination that would be raised by male minority class members that are gender based.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, because of our finding that the class agent did not meet the typicality requirement, we also find that the class agent failed to meet the adequacy of representation requirement, as he has not shown that his interests are coextensive with the interests of the class as identified. <span class="Italic">Falcon</span> at 157 n.13 (the requirements of commonality and typicality tend to merge with the adequacy of representation requirement). Clearly, there are potential conflicts of interest between appellant as a Caucasian, and the minorities he seeks to represent. Accordingly, we find that appellant and his chosen representative would not adequately represent the interests of the purported class.</p>
<p class="noindent">The retirement of a named complainant does not disqualify him as a class representative where a favorable decision on the complaint still would entitle him to remedial relief. <span class="Italic">See In re Department of Navy</span>, 05850114 (1987). The employee's retirement does not mean that he did not suffer an injury that was typical of the class. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Moten v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 05960233 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the class alleges more than one basis of discrimination, it is not necessary that each class member fall into all protected categories. For example, in <span class="Italic">Johnson-Feldman v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01953168 (1997), the class alleged discrimination on the basis sex (female) and age; the class was deemed to include males over the age of 40.</p>
<p class="noindent">There must be sufficient factual development of the record for the Commission to determine the issues of commonality and typicality. In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920003 (1991), also discussed above, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the prerequisite of commonality, the focus is whether there are questions of fact, common to the class. Factors to consider in determining commonality are whether the issue effects the whole class or only a few employees, the degree of local autonomy or centralized administration involved, and the uniformity of the membership of the class, in terms of the likelihood that the members' treatment will involve common questions of fact<span class="Italic">. Harriss v. Pan American World Airways</span>, 15 FEP Cases 1640, 1648-1649 (N.D. Cal. 1977). In the present case, appellant identified a specific agency policy: namely, the policy of requiring all long-term limited duty employees to accept a job offer, which requires them to leave their regular work locations and to change their duty hours, or to go on LWOP. The policy affected all handicapped employees on long-term limited duty as evidenced by the numerous job offers contained in the record. The Commission finds that appellant's complaint met the commonality prerequisite. All the class members were affected by the same policy in a similar manner and, therefore, there are indeed questions of fact common to the class.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, typicality requires that the class agent must be part of the class, has suffered substantially the same injury as other class members and possesses substantially the same interest as other class members<span class="Italic">. General Telephone Company of the Southwest v. Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982). While it is undisputed that appellant suffered substantially the same injury as the other identified class members since when she was on long-term limited duty she was given a choice of a job offer or LWOP, pursuant to the disputed policy, it is unclear from the present record whether she possesses substantially the same interest as other class members due to the question of whether she is a member of the protected group. The identified class is handicapped employees on long-term limited duty. It is undisputed that appellant was on long-term limited duty; however, the record contains no evidence that appellant is a handicapped person as defined in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a) states that a "handicapped person" is one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. Therefore, the Commission finds that a determination as to whether appellant's complaint meets the typicality prerequisite cannot be made based upon the present record....</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result, the Commission remanded the case to the agency to provide appellant with an opportunity to present evidence to demonstrate that she was a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency instituted a National Reassessment Program (NRP) to evaluate all limited duty and rehabilitation employees who had been injured on the job, the Commission found that the administrative judge properly determined that the prerequisites for a class action were fulfilled. In <span class="Italic">McConnell v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080054 (2010), the complainant alleged that her limited duty assignment was a reasonable accommodation that was taken away as a result of the NRP and that consequently her employment was terminated. She further alleged that the program targeted disabled employees, constituted an improper medical inquiry and created a hostile environment for disabled employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld the certification of the class by the administrative judge finding that although an employer is not required to create a position as a reasonable accommodation, a limited duty position could become an accommodation if the employee was permitted to perform in that position for a significant period of time and could make a showing that the work was necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">McConnell</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the AJ properly determined that the class agent stated a claim for a violation of the Rehabilitation Act because the class agent presented evidence which showed that she was aggrieved, i.e., she lost her position as a result of the NRP process. Further, we also find that the AJ was correct in finding that the class agent was a qualified individual with a disability. The Commission has held that were an employee has performed a modified position for an extended amount of time, it is that position which is considered for the purposes of determining whether the employee is a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">See Jambora v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40128 (May 16, 2006) and <span class="Italic">Pruneda v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720050014 (June 4, 2007). Moreover, we find that the class agent was able to show that the work that she was doing was necessary work and not a make-work assignment, as the agency has alleged is the case for many putative class members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, with respect to the class agent's contention that the NRP created a hostile work environment, the class agent asserted that the NRP created <span id="Page_1635"></span>a hostile work environment for the class as a whole. (CA's Response to Agency's Opposition, 7.) The class agent argued that the NRP:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...is hostile to disabled employees in many ways: it targets a very large category of disabled employees for scrutiny and adverse job actions, reviews their medical records, troops them into pre-scripted 'show trials' with management teams to tell them their jobs have been eliminated, and belittles their efforts to seek a way to remain employed at the agency. Indeed, the evidence shows that the top agency officials broadly generalized about injured-on-duty employees sitting idle, performing only 'make-work,' or that modified positions consisted of 'cobbled together' tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the class agent's allegations are sufficient to state a claim of hostile work environment harassment. We find the issue of whether the NRP meetings actually were severe or pervasive enough to establish a hostile work environment or harassment is a question that is to be determined on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Commission finds that the class agent has met the class-certification requirements for a wrongful medical disclosure theory. We find that the class agent has adequately asserted that all rehabilitation employees and limited-duty employees were subjected to the gathering and review of their medical documentation and were subjected to similar treatment under the nationalized process. The record shows that the requirement of commonality, typicality, and numerosity, have been met because medical documentation was reviewed for the class agent in the same or similar manner that the agency reviewed medical documentation for all other rehabilitation and limited-duty employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected an agency argument that a class action could be maintained on the basis of disability only if the agency policy that discriminated against individuals with disabilities on its face. In <span class="Italic">Jantz v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720090019 (2010), the Commission also held that the focus in determining commonality and typicality is not on which party had the strongest evidence on the ultimate question of discrimination but whether the class had submitted sufficient evidence to raise an inference of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Class Agent has asserted that the discrimination practice at issue is the Agency's centralized policy of affording selecting officials unfettered discretion in making promotion selection decisions. Upon review of the record, we find that the Class Agent has proffered sufficient evidence to support his contention that significant factual and legal questions are common to the members of the class. Specifically, the Class Agent has established commonality by providing: 1) significant evidence of the alleged Agency-wide policy containing allegations of excessive subjectivity in personnel decisions, and the maintenance of a strong Agency culture which included disability stereotyping; 2) statistical evidence of disparities in selection based on disability; and 3) anecdotal evidence of alleged disability-based discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of commonality, the Class Agent provided evidence from a Social Scientist who provided facts to support a claim that the culture at the Agency included disability-based stereotyping. The Social Scientist relied on affidavits, organizational charts, and other documents looking at the history of the Agency. Further, the Class Agent provided expert evidence from a Statistician who concluded that there was "a consistent pattern of statistically significant shortfalls in selection of applicants with [targeted disabilities] over the time period covered." The Agency challenged evidence provided by these experts and provided competing experts of their own. However, the Agency's challenge is misplaced at this stage of processing of the class complaint. At the certification stage, the main issue is for the factfinder to examine the proffered evidence to address whether or not there are common questions of fact or law. At certification, the focus is not on which parties' evidence supports the ultimate findings as to discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 602-3. As such, the Commission is not persuaded by the Agency's challenges to the evidence provided by the Class Agent's experts. Considering the proffered evidence as a whole, we find that the Class Agent has raised an inference that the Agency engaged in discriminatory practices related to promotions that affected the members of the class in a common manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also asserted that class complaints raised pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act should only be certified if the challenged practice is "facially discriminatory" against individuals with a disability. The Commission has previously stated that it has no policy finding the Rehabilitation Act as "ill-suited" for class treatment. <span class="Italic">Travis v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992222 (October 10, 2002). We have held, however, that the putative class agent must establish an evidentiary basis from which one could reasonably infer the operation of an overriding policy or practice of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Cyncar v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720030111 (February 1, 2007); <span class="Italic">see also Garcia v. Dept of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10107 (May 8, 2003). Here, we are satisfied that the class has met the commonality by establishing an inference of the operation of an overriding policy of discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. As found by the AJ and noted above, the Class Agent provided evidence to establish significant evidence of the Agency-wide policy, statistical evidence of disparity, and anecdotal evidence in support of the claim of disability-based discrimination. Accordingly, we conclude that the AJ correctly held that the Class Agent established commonality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the record clearly indicated that the Class Agent's individual claims of discriminatory non-promotion, as well as those of the other proffered alternative class agents, are typical of the class. Therefore, the Commission also agrees with the AJ finding that the Class Agent and proffered alternative Class Agents met the prerequisite of typicality.</p>
