<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-117"><span class="space">11.</span> Job Modification in Lieu of Reassignment</h4>
<p class="noindent">Reassignment is the accommodation of last resort. As a result, an employer may modify the duties of a position as an accommodation prior to considering reassignment, subject to the qualification that an employer is not required to eliminate essential functions from a position as an accommodation. However, if such modifications are not effective as an accommodation, the employer must consider reassignment of the employee. Conversely, an agency violates the Rehabilitation Act by reassigning an employee when the essentials duties of her present job can be modified as an accommodation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A53965 (2006), the Commission found that the agency erred in reassigning the complainant to another position where there was no evidence that it could not have modified the job the complainant held to allow her to alternate between duties requiring repetitive motion and other duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the employee can no longer perform even the modified duties of the position does not remove her from the definition of a qualified individual with a disability without consideration of reassignment. Indeed, if an employee who can no longer perform the essential functions of the position she holds was eliminated from the definition of a qualified individual with a disability, no one would ever qualify for consideration for reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rowelette v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A10816 (2003), the Commission found that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the complainant by considering reassignment even where it modified the duties of her position by reducing the number of face-to-face and telephone interviews she had to do as a claims representative. The administrative judge found those interviews were an essential function of the job and that the complainant was not eligible for consideration for reassignment because she was no longer a qualified individual with a disability since she could not perform the essential functions of a claims representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rowlette</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has worked for the agency since 1991. At all relevant times, she was a GS-11 Social Insurance Specialist Claims Representative at the agency's Baltimore field office in Reisterstown, Maryland (part of "Region III" of the agency). This job required her to interview, both in person and on the phone, members of the public who were claiming eligibility for various Social Security benefits. As a Claims Representative, she also had to adjudicate applicants' ultimate entitlement to these benefits. By all accounts, she was good at this job, was extremely professional and hardworking, and cared greatly about her work and the agency's patrons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in late 1995 and early 1996, complainant became very ill. She was extremely anxious and depressed, could not sleep or eat properly, vomited constantly, and lost 60 pounds in roughly a four month period. She was eventually hospitalized for this condition and missed work for many months as a result. When she returned to her job in May of 1996, she quickly fell ill again. She suffered from painful headaches and acute stress. She had trouble concentrating and remembering. She also felt completely overwhelmed and paranoid.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After running a myriad of tests to rule out physical causes for these symptoms, her doctor ("Doctor") ultimately diagnosed complainant as suffering from a stress-induced eating disorder manifested by periods of extreme nausea and vomiting resulting in extreme weight loss and debilitation. By October of 1996, Doctor (and two other consulting physicians) had determined that the incessant interviewing and public interaction and the extreme workload at complainant's job exacerbated her illness and actually triggered her psychiatric symptoms. Doctor opined that complainant was in a "marginal state," and warned that her condition could worsen if the stress continued. He therefore concluded that it was "unclear whether she will ever have a full recovery, unless her job situation is changed."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, on October 17, 1996, complainant filed an official request with the agency for a "reasonable accommodation" for her condition--specifically, that her job be restructured or that she be reassigned to a different section of the agency so that she would not need to conduct the "stressful" face-to-face or telephone interviews that caused her condition to deteriorate so dangerously. Complainant's supervisor and the District Manager of the Baltimore field office both endorsed complainant's request and forwarded it to appropriate Region III "reasonable accommodation" officials for final review. In the meantime, complainant's supervisors reduced her interviewing workload and made other efforts to ease her integration back into the work place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant nevertheless got severely sick again in or around May of 1997. She was granted advance sick leave (and included in the agency's leave transfer program), was hospitalized again, and was absent from work from May through August of 1997. She returned to work in September of 1997, but submitted letters from her psychologist ("Psychologist"), explaining (again) that forcing complainant to conduct face-to-face or telephone interviews was detrimental to her health, and indicating that complainant needed a new job where such public contact would not be required. Around this same time, complainant applied for workers' compensation benefits, asserting that she could not perform her job as a Claims Representative because of her stress-induced eating disorder. She also applied for a hardship reassignment to a GS-11 position within the agency's headquarters (ostensibly within commuting distance). She apparently never heard back from anyone on either her workers' compensation claim or her hardship reassignment application.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Then on September 22, 1997, almost a year after complainant first asked for reasonable accommodation, the relevant Region III "reasonable accommodation personnel" formally denied complainant's request. These officials reasoned that complainant was unable to perform an essential function of her current Claims Representative position--interviewing the public--and that no accommodation could change this fact. The reasonable accommodation officials also apparently concluded, after consultation with the agency's physician, that under the relevant Rehabilitation Act regulations, they were not required to consider reassigning complainant to another position as a form of reasonable accommodation. Rather, they told complainant, she should apply for an inter-agency reassignment through the agency's "hardship transfer" program (or consider disability retirement) instead.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In October of 1997, Psychologist wrote another letter to the agency, again stating that complainant's job stress had contributed significantly to complainant's psychological condition, and warning that she could no longer handle dealing with the public in a face-to-face situation on a continuous basis. That same month, Doctor also told the agency that complainant was still struggling with work-related stress, which was possibly the "trigger" for her recurring episodic illness. Around January of 1998, though, it appears her condition temporarily improved somewhat. On January 16, 1998, Psychologist informed the agency that complainant now could perform limited scheduled interviews. Roughly a week later, complainant made a second formal request for reasonable accommodation, citing her work-related stress-induced eating disorder, and asking for "restricted limited public face-to-face interviewing." In response (and while Region III reasonable accommodation officials reviewed the second request), her District Manager reduced her interviewing workload. However, complainant never did receive an official response from the agency on her second request for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's ongoing failure to either restructure her position to eliminate the public interaction portion of her duties, or to reassign her, prompted complainant to contact an agency equal employment opportunity ("EEO") counselor, and ultimately, to file a formal EEO complaint against the agency. In this complaint, filed in February of 1998, complainant claimed that the agency had violated the Rehabilitation Act by refusing to grant her request to eliminate the interviewing portion of her position and/or to transfer her to a job that did not require this type of overwhelming public interaction. The agency investigated complainant's complaint, and issued a report of investigation on the matter in September of 1998. After receiving this report, complainant requested a hearing before one of EEOC's administrative judges. The appointed AJ ("the AJ") held a hearing on complainant's claim on December 6 and 7, 1999, at which complainant, complainant's supervisor, the District Manager, Psychologist, the agency's consulting physician, and others testified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Meanwhile, it appears the improvements to complainant's health (improvements which had enabled her to tolerate limited public interviewing at the beginning of 1998) dissipated. Throughout 1998 and 1999, complainant was again absent from work for extended periods of time due to her ongoing struggles with her stress-induced eating disorder. During this period, on or around April of 1999, District Manager placed complainant into a special work unit where she would not have to conduct any face-to-face interviews. Notwithstanding this attempt to temporarily adjust complainant's duties, the agency's consulting physician--the same physician who had concluded in 1997 that complainant should be denied a reasonable accommodation of reassignment--decided in August of 1999 that complainant now should be permanently reassigned to a similar position at the same grade level that would not require her to perform any face-to-face public interviewing. In response, roughly a month later, complainant submitted yet a third official request for a reasonable accommodation of reassignment. Complainant never got any agency response to this third request, either.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 29, 2000, the AJ issued a decision ruling that complainant had not proven her allegations by a preponderance of the evidence, <span id="Page_1382"></span>and that the agency thus could not be held liable for disability-based employment discrimination. The AJ found that complainant was an "individual with a disability" as defined under the Rehabilitation Act (since her stress-induced eating disorder was an "impairment" that "substantially limited" her in the "major life activity" of eating). However, the AJ then found that she was not a "qualified" individual with a disability--and thus not protected by the Rehabilitation Act at all--because she could not perform the essential public interviewing function of her Claims Representative position and no accommodation could enable her to do so. Moreover, the AJ ruled, even during the periods when complainant had recovered sufficiently so that she could perform some interviewing on the job (and thus was arguably "qualified" during such periods and entitled to a reasonable accommodation), her supervisors limited her workload and public interactions in ways that were tantamount to effective accommodations. For these reasons, the AJ determined the agency either was not obligated to, or did when necessary, provide complainant a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a final order ("FAO") issued on October 20, 2000, the agency informed complainant that it intended to fully implement this AJ ruling. Complainant then promptly filed a notice with this Commission challenging this FAO and, by implication, the AJ's decision finding no discrimination. We docketed complainant's notice as this appeal. After a consideration of the complete record before us, including the investigative file, the hearing transcript, the AJ's ruling, and a brief complainant submitted in support of her appeal, we are now issuing a decision on this matter pursuant to the authority granted us by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reassignment admittedly is the "reasonable accommodation of last resort." <span class="Italic">See</span> Reasonable Accommodation Guidance, at 19 (instructing that "before considering reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, employers should first consider those accommodations that would enable an employee to remain in his/her current position. Reassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort and is required only after it has been determined that (1) there are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her current position, or (2) all other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Psychiatric Disabilities Guidance, at 16 (stating that "reassignment must be considered as a reasonable accommodation when accommodation in the present job would cause undue hardship or would not be possible"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> Workers' Compensation and Disabilities Guidance, at 14 (clarifying that an employer may not unilaterally reassign an employee with a disability-related occupational injury to a different position instead of first trying to accommodate the employee in the position s/he held at the time the injury occurred).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We concur that public interviewing was/is an essential function of complainant's Claims Representative position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Hearing Transcript, at 127, 154, 301, 343, 350. Nevertheless, here there was no accommodation that would have enabled the complainant to perform the essential function of public interviewing. By all accounts, she simply could not safely do it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> Hearing Transcript, at 50-52, 86-87, 92, 99-100. Therefore, this was an appropriate situation for invoking the accommodation of last resort, and the agency should have investigated the feasibility of reassigning complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's decision emphasized that no reassignment was required because complainant's supervisors accommodated complainant in other ways. The AJ pointed out that, from the time complainant first requested a reasonable accommodation in October of 1996 up until the present, complainant's supervisor and the District Manager limited her workload generally and restricted the amount of public interviewing she had to do, specifically. The AJ reasoned that these arrangements were "effective in allowing complainant to remain employed by the agency at the GS-11 level." AJ Decision (Sept. 29, 2000), at 13. Thus, the AJ concluded, because the agency never "proposed complainant's removal because of her inability to perform an essential function of her official position," it therefore was "not obligated under law to seek another or more permanent reassignment of complainant at her grade or a lesser grade."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ was mistaken on this point. It is true that complainant's supervisors reduced her workload, eliminated some of her interviewing functions temporarily, and allowed her to take various forms of leave to deal with her illness. It is also true, as the AJ noted, that the agency never terminated complainant. It is not true, however, that these agency's efforts sufficed as reasonable accommodations. EEOC's regulations plainly provide that any "accommodation made to assist an employee with a disability in the performance of his or her job must be adequate to enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the relevant position." Appendix to Part 1630, at Section 1630.9: Not Making Reasonable Accommodation; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> Reasonable Accommodation Guidance, at 8 (explaining that any reasonable accommodation offered must at a minimum be "effective"--that is, must provide the individual in question "with an equal opportunity to apply for a position, to perform the essential functions of a position, or to gain equal access to a benefit or privilege of employment"). Neither the informal, temporary accommodations provided by complainant's supervisors (however well-intentioned), nor any other accommodation, could have enabled complainant to safely perform the public interviewing essential function of her Claims Representative position. Therefore, the agency should not have required complainant to remain in this role, which inevitably required her to do at least some interviewing, triggered her psychiatric symptoms, and thus deprived her of the ability to perform effectively and enjoy all the benefits and privileges of employment. Instead, the agency should have pursued the "accommodation of last resort." To provide an effective reasonable accommodation, that is, the agency should have explored the possibility of transferring her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It obviously did not do so. Instead, the agency told complainant it had no duty to even consider reassigning her in the first place. Notwithstanding this erroneous reading of the Rehabilitation Act, the agency's failure to perform a "reassignment" search (for suitable vacancies) cannot itself subject the agency to automatic liability for violating the Rehabilitation Act<span class="Italic">. See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Barnard v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10002 (Aug. 2, 2002); <span class="Italic">Key v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20001 (Aug. 2, 2002), request to reconsider denied, EEOC Request No. 05A21136 (February 18, 2003); <span class="Italic">Graham v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20078 (Aug. 2, 2002); and <span class="Italic">Valera v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10115 (Aug. 2, 2002). For the agency to be held accountable for failing to provide the reasonable accommodation of reassignment, complainant herself must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that at the time she requested such reasonable accommodation, there was a vacant position for which she was "qualified" and into which she could have been reassigned.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g); 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). Clearly, complainant can establish this by producing evidence of actual vacancies that existed at the time she needed reasonable accommodation. In the alternative, complainant can show that it is more likely than not that (1) she was qualified to perform a type of job or jobs which existed at the agency; and (2) there were trends or patterns of turnover in the relevant type of job or jobs so as to make a vacancy likely during the time period in question<span class="Italic">. See Hampton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (Aug. 1, 2002); <span class="Italic">cf. Barnard v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10002 (Aug. 2, 2002); <span class="Italic">Key v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20001 (Aug. 2, 2002), request to reconsider denied, EEOC Request No. 05A21136 (February 18, 2003); <span class="Italic">Graham v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20078 (Aug. 2, 2002); and <span class="Italic">Valera v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10115 (Aug. 2, 2002) (all providing that the existence of the requisite vacancy may be inferred based on documentary or testimonial evidence regarding, among other things, (1) complainant's qualifications; (2) the size of the agency's work force; and (3) indicia of postings and/or selections during the pertinent time period within classes of jobs for which complainant would have been qualified).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requested reassignment first in October of 1996, again in January of 1998, and again in September of 1999. On all three occasions, the agency either explicitly refused to reassign her or failed to respond to her transfer request at all. Our review of the entire record (and the hearing transcript, in particular) reveals that during the relevant time period, it is more likely than not that there were indeed "funded vacant position[s] located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority" to which complainant could have been reassigned. <span class="Italic">See</span> former 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Hearing Transcript, at 132 (where complainant's former supervisor stated that there may have been some non-interviewing "claims development clerk" positions available since 1996); 174 and 263-264 (where complainant testified that during relevant times numerous individuals were given details to various places within the region); 175 (where complainant testified that during the relevant period she had put in multiple applications for open positions at the agency and always made the best qualified list); and 302 (where an agency staffing and classification specialist testified that there were available jobs in the relevant commuting area that involved little or no public contact). Therefore, we believe the agency was obligated to reassign complainant, beginning on October 17, 1996 (i.e., the date complainant first informed the agency of her need to be reassigned).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120081046 (2011), the Commission found that the agency did not fail to accommodate the complainant where it assigned her temporary duties for over a year while looking for a reassignment position. The complainant, a clinical nurse, who suffered from PTSD could no longer perform her regular nursing duties because of an inability to multitask. The agency provided her with a temporary work assignment that involved answering a "nurse's line," taking messages and distributing the messages to the appropriate doctors or nurses while it evaluated the complainant and looked for reassignment positions. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, rejected the complainant's argument that the agency could have modified her existing position as an accommodation rather than reassigning her:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1383"></span>An employer may choose among reasonable accommodations so long as the chosen accommodation is effective. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (RA Guidance), Notice No. 915.002, Q. 9 (revised Oct. 17, 2002). An employer need not provide an employee's preferred accommodation as long as the employer provides an effective accommodation. <span class="Italic">Lathum v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A53430 (Aug. 22, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the evidentiary record reveals that the AJ's findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. We now determine whether the AJ correctly applied his findings to law. We note that the AJ found that Complainant was not an individual with a disability but that is immaterial to our analysis, as he also determined that Complainant, even if disabled, was not denied an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically and in relevant part, the AJ found that once Complainant requested an accommodation and underwent an FFDE, the Agency relieved Complainant from having to perform the full range of nursing duties and assigned her the task of retrieving and distributing messages to the appropriate physicians and nurses. The AJ found this was not intended to be a permanent position for Complainant but noted that when the Agency mentioned other jobs Complainant found reasons not to accept them. For example, he noted that Complainant turned down a Food Worker Service position at retained pay because she believed the position was demeaning, and did not accept the Agency's offer to be reassigned as a Clinical Nurse in another facility because she did not want to work nights. He also noted the Supervisor's efforts to keep Complainant fully informed and engaged while the Agency sought ways Complainant could be accommodated. The AJ concluded that Complainant was not entitled to the precise accommodation she wanted, and noted that the Agency was free to choose among any number of accommodations so long as they were effective.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is some indication that Complainant was unable to perform the duties of the positions offered by the Agency; however, the Agency was not made aware of this until after the offers were extended. The record shows that the Agency worked with Complainant and her doctors to locate a position within Complainant's restrictions but to no avail. We are not convinced by Complainant's argument that the Agency could have found a suitable position for her by looking at modification rather than reassignment. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's finding that the Agency considered efforts to possibly modify Complainant's position but the nature of her job made that impossible. As noted above, Complainant is not entitled to her accommodation of choice; the accommodation she was given (i.e., having her work at a nurse station and retrieve, record and distribute telephone messages to appropriate medical personnel), which lasted from April 2005 until she retired over one year later, was an effective accommodation as it allowed Complainant to work within her medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the accommodation Complainant was accorded was temporary (as shown by the Agency's continual efforts to find Complainant work or a position within her restrictions), there is no evidence that the Agency could have placed Complainant into a position for which she qualified. In this respect, "position" is not limited to the position held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held as a result of reassignment. Accordingly, the Agency was required, as it did, to consider reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> RA Guidance; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. Part 1630.2(o).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases of reassignment, Complainant has an evidentiary burden in such reassignment cases to establish that it is more likely than not (preponderance of the evidence) that there were vacancies during the relevant time period into which she could have been reassigned. Complainant could have established this by producing evidence of particular vacancies. In the alternative, Complainant could have shown that: (1) she was qualified to perform a job or jobs which existed at the agency, and (2) there were trends or patterns of turnover in the relevant jobs so as to make a vacancy likely during the time period. Complainant failed to produce evidence of either.</p>
