<h5 class="h5" id="sec20-36"><span class="space">b.</span> "Inextricably Intertwined": Current Guidance</h5>
<p class="noindent">As of October 24, 2003, the EEOC issued EEO-Management Bulletin 100-1. This Management Bulletin had the effect of deleting Chapter 4, Section II.B.4.d, from MD-110. In other words, the Commission's guidance is that the EEOC should retain jurisdiction over those matters not within Board jurisdiction even when they are "inextricably intertwined" with actions within Board jurisdiction. This policy has the advantage of simplicity. Neither an agency representative nor an EEOC administrative judge is required to determine if complaints over matters not within MSPB jurisdiction are sufficiently related to a matter within Board jurisdiction such that the Board should take jurisdiction over all matters. Likewise, complaints over matters not within Board jurisdiction do not have to be held in abeyance while an MSPB administrative judge decides whether to take jurisdiction over those claims. Finally, the policy eliminates potential appeals over those jurisdictional decisions. The disadvantage is that both the agency and the complainant may be required to litigate related matters in different forums--an end that would appear contrary to the purpose of the mixed-case provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act. Ultimately, the problem is not one created by the EEOC or the MSPB. The problem is created by the failure of the mixed-case provisions to anticipate these cases and address how they should be handled.</p>
<p class="noindent">A succinct statement of the current law is provided by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Inter-American Foundation</span>, 0120132968 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's decision to dismiss the complaint for raising the same matter in her appeal to the MSPB is reversed. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(4) requires the dismissal of a complaint where the complainant has raised the matter in an appeal to the MSPB and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302 indicates the complainant has elected to pursue the non-EEO process. Because Complainant filed her complaint first, &#x00A7; 1614.302 does not indicate that Complainant elected to pursue the MSPB forum on the matters raised in her EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In EEOC Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, Chap. 4, Sec. II.B.4.d (located at pages 4-5, 4-6) (EEO-MD-110) (Nov. 9, 1999), the Commission advised that where a complainant has pending a non-mixed case complaint or a series of non-mixed complaints and the claims in those complaints are inextricably intertwined with an appeal on a claim that is appealable to the MSPB, the agency should file with the MSPB a motion to consolidate the non-mixed case claim with the mixed case appeal. As an example the Commission wrote that an allegedly discriminatory performance evaluation and subsequent placement on a PIP are non-mixed claims that may culminate in a removal, which is appealable to the MSPB. Chap. Sec. II.B.4.d was deleted by the Commission in EEOC Equal Employment Opportunity Management Bulletin EEO-MB 100-1 (October 24, 2003). The Commission explained that the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations was notified by the MSPB that the deleted language improperly advised parties on MSPB procedures and jurisdiction because it constituted a request for an MSPB Judge to hear matters which may not be within the Jurisdiction of The MSPB. The doctrine of inextricably intertwined was effectively overturned because the MSPB generally does not have jurisdiction over non-appealable matters, even if they are connected with appealable matters. We note, however, that a proposed action merges with the decision on an appealable action, i.e., a proposed removal merges into a decision to remove. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120122103 (Sept. 10, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's finding that the non-appealable matters in Complainant's EEO complaint are inextricably intertwined with the matter she could and did appeal to the MSPB--her removal, is not persuasive. We refer to legal history regarding the doctrine of inextricably intertwined discussed above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding AWOL, we note that if the MSPB reverses the removal, it is very likely it would not remedy the AWOL charge by ordering, for example back pay (Complainant argues she should have been on administrative <span id="Page_1676"></span>leave) because it has not taken jurisdiction over the characterization of Complainant's leave. However, if the MSPB upholds the removal and in doing so finds that Complainant's leave was properly categorized as AWOL, the Agency could argue in the EEO forum that the doctrine of issue preclusion applies to the characterization of Complainant's leave as AWOL.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like many mixed cases before the MSPB, <span class="Italic">Lilian C. v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 0120181917 (2019), involved the complainant's removal. Four days prior to her removal, the complainant filed a formal EEO complaint alleging that the Agency subjected her to discriminatory harassment on the bases of race (African-American), and disability (physical), and in reprisal for prior protected EEO activity. After her removal, she filed a mixed case appeal before the MSPB. The MSPB administrative judge affirmed the removal and found that the complainant was not discriminated against based on her race or in reprisal for protected EEO activity. The administrative judge further found that the agency did not fail to reasonably accommodate the complainant. The complainant then requested a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge, but her claim was dismissed under the doctrine of collateral estoppel as having been fully litigated before the MSPB:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC AJ stated that, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, once an issue is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that decision precludes re-litigation of the issue in a different cause of action. The EEOC AJ noted that the record reflected that Complainant raised the claims in the underlying EEO complaint as an affirmative defense to her removal in her MSPB appeal. The EEOC AJ stated that, when Complainant raised her affirmative defense, she was obligated to raise her remaining inextricably intertwined claims in that forum. The MSPB AJ found that Complainant did not establish that the Agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation and that Complainant did not establish the affirmative defense of race or reprisal discrimination. As such, the EEOC AJ dismissed Complainant's complaint, with prejudice.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission disagreed, in <span class="Italic">Lilian C</span>., noting that the "inextricably intertwined" doctrine was largely abandoned:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that the AJ stated that, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, once an issue is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that decision precludes re-litigation of the issue in a different cause of action. The Commission has previously held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applicable to discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See Fitz-Gerald v. Tenn. Valley Auth</span>., EEOC Request No. 05910573 (Jan. 16, 1992). Also, in <span class="Italic">Magnallanes v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900176 (July 13, 1990), the Commission noted that the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel both fall within the purview of "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>," each concerning the preclusive effect of a prior adjudication. <span class="Italic">Bezelik v. Nat'l Sec. Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A11104 (May 8, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Magnallanes</span>, the first doctrine is <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> itself, or claim preclusion. This approach provides that a final judgment on the merits bars further claims by the same parties based on the same claim or cause of action and issues relevant to that claim, treating the judgment as the full measure of relief to be accorded between the same parties. Under true <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, when the judgment is rendered for the defendant, the plaintiff's claim is extinguished, and the judgment then acts as a bar. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second doctrine under <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is collateral estoppel or issue preclusion. It recognizes that suits addressed to particular claims may present issues relevant to suits on other claims. Thus, issue preclusion bars the re-litigation of issues actually adjudicated and necessary to the judgment in a prior litigation between the parties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the EEOC AJ properly dismissed Complainant's reasonable-accommodation claim but improperly dismissed Complainant's hostile work environment claim on the grounds that her complaint was fully litigated before the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no persuasive evidence here that the MSPB AJ, either expressly or implicitly, assumed jurisdiction of Complainant's harassment claim. The MSPB AJ, in initially describing Complainant's appeal, stated that "[o]June 9, 2016, [Complainant] filed this appeal from the agency's action removing her from the position of AST, Engineer Program Management, GS-0801-11, effective May 10, 2016.... The action was based upon a charge that [Complainant's] performance was unacceptable in one or more critical elements of her position and was taken under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43." This was the claim over which the MSPB found it had jurisdiction, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(e) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, the MSPB AJ's decision addressed the question of whether Complainant's removal was the result of discriminatory animus because she raised this as an affirmative defense. Complainant argued that her removal was the result of discrimination due to a failure to accommodate and disparate treatment. The MSPB AJ found that Complainant was an individual with a disability, and that the Agency accommodated her by providing alternative work space in other buildings. Regarding Complainant's request to telework as a reasonable accommodation, the MSPB AJ found that the Agency did not fail to reasonably accommodate Complainant when it denied her request because she did not explain how telework would improve her performance. The MSPB AJ also determined that Complainant's race, disability, and prior EEO activity, were not factors in her removal from the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argued before the MSPB that her removal resulted from the Agency's failure to accommodate. We find that the failure-to-accommodate claim cannot be sensibly bifurcated from her removal claim, and that the MSPB AJ properly issued a determination on this claim. Complainant's reasonable-accommodation claim was adjudicated in the MSPB proceeding and necessary to the determination on her removal claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, based on the totality of the record, we are not persuaded that Complainant's harassment claim was fully litigated and addressed by the MSPB AJ. We do not find that the MSPB assumed jurisdiction over Complainant's claim of a hostile work environment. We note that harassment is not an agency action over which the MSPB typically has jurisdiction, but that the MSPB may, in its discretion, consider harassment as it pertains to an involuntary (constructive) discharge or retirement. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082616 (Nov. 10, 2008). In this case, Complainant did not allege that her removal was a constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that the Commission has long ago abandoned the doctrine of claims being "inextricably intertwined" because the MSPB generally does not have jurisdiction over non-appealable matters, even if they are related to appealable matters. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120130459 (Aug. 28, 2014); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Inter-American Foundation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132968 (Jan. 8, 2014) (wherein the Commission essentially overturned the doctrine of inextricably intertwined).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the MSPB AJ's decision reveals that there is no mention of Complainant's harassment claim. Because the instant complaint raises a cause of action distinct from the removal, i.e., a hostile work environment claim, we do not find that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> bars Complainant from prosecuting her harassment complaint. Further, because the MSPB AJ did not decide the harassment issues not related to the reasonable-accommodation claim, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar Complainant from pursuing those issues. Accordingly, we will vacate the Agency's final order adopting the EEOC AJ's dismissal of Complainant's harassment claim, and remand this claim, in accordance with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Barnett v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093400 (2010), the Commission appears to be taking a new approach to cases involving cases that invoke matters within MSPB jurisdiction with actions that are not within MSPB jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, the complainant alleged that he was subject to retaliation for prior EEO activity when his supervisor proposed his removal for failure to follow instructions and failure to follow a direct order. The proposed removal was subsequently upheld by another agency official. The complainant appealed his removal to the MSPB. Significantly, the MSPB administrative judge assigned to the case determined that the complainant did not maintain that the deciding official retaliated against him, but instead contended that the proposing official had engaged in retaliation when he ordered the complainant, who was on approved leave but had gone to the worksite to visit the credit union, to leave the facility. The administrative judge determined that the Board had no jurisdiction over such an allegation and ultimately upheld the complainant's removal.</p>
<p class="noindent">On a petition for review of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, the Commission found that the complainant's retaliation allegation did relate to the removal. Because the Board had already determined that the allegation of retaliation was not within its jurisdiction, the Commission remanded the case to the agency for processing. The agency dismissed the complaint on the basis that it had already been litigated before the Board. The Commission reversed the agency's dismissal finding that the allegation had not been litigated before the Board. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is not persuaded by the agency's decision to dismiss the matter pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(4). The regulations at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(4) provides that an agency shall dismiss a complaint where the complainant has raised the matter in an appeal to the MSPB and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302 indicates that the complainant has elected to pursue the non-EEO process. A review of the Commission's decision in 0320090026 clearly found that the MSPB AJ, when determining that complainant conceded that the deciding official was not motivated by retaliation, failed to consider complainant's allegation that the proposing supervisor tainted the removal action with unlawful retaliatory animus through his actions (ordering complainant to leave the building) that formed the sole basis of the discipline, as well as his decision to propose removal as a result of the incident. Instead, the MSPB AJ determined he had no jurisdiction over these actions by the proposing supervisor. However, while the Commission disagreed with this analysis, noting that in its view the actions of the proposing supervisor were inextricably tied to the removal, it found that it could not review the MSPB's determination in this regard. Therefore, the Commission "unmixed" the allegations of <span id="Page_1677"></span>retaliation concerning the actions of the proposing supervisor and sent these allegations back to the agency for further processing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we find it inappropriate to dismiss the claims of unlawful retaliation by the proposing supervisor pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(4). Therefore, we REVERSE the agency's decision to dismiss the complaint on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, the Commission noted that "[i]f it was later determined that the proposing supervisor's actions were, in fact, motivated by unlawful retaliatory animus, there would also have to be an evidentiary determination of how these actions impacted on the final removal decision when awarding appropriate remedies." The <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> case raises the interesting possibility that the MSPB and EEOC could come to contrary results on the removal. If the Commission determines that the order given by the supervisor is retaliatory, then it is difficult to see how the agency could demonstrate that it would have removed the employee even absent retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ike D. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120140592 (2016), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in Equal Employment Opportunity Management Bulletin (EEO-MB) 100-1 (October 24, 2003), the Commission explained that the doctrine of "inextricably intertwined" is no longer applicable in most circumstances because the MSPB generally does not have jurisdiction over non-appealable matters, even if they are related to appealable matters. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520140447 (January 29, 2015); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120130459 (August 28, 2014). Consequently, a complainant's harassment claim is usually properly part of an EEO complaint, even if the harassment claim encompasses incidents that are related to the complainant's ultimate removal from employment which is appealable to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Inter-American Foundation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132968 (January 8, 2014); <span class="Italic">Jones v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110192 (June 10, 2011); <span class="Italic">Hubble v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120092453 (February 18, 2011); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Veteran Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120064012 (December 19, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, both the Commission and the Board exacerbated the problem with inconsistent decisions. Even after issuing EEO-Management Bulletin 100-1, the Commission issued the following decision in <span class="Italic">Lethridge v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05a50398.txt">07A40076</a> (2004)<span class="Italic">:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to issuing a decision on complaints 1 and 2, the AJ acknowledged that the agency terminated complainant's employment, and that he appealed this matter to the MSPB. We find that the record shows that in both complaints 1 and 2, complainant contends that the agency failed to provide him with a suitable position to accommodate his psychiatric disability, and that this resulted in long periods of non-pay status. In fact, in his MSPB appeal, complainant avers that it is the agency's historic failure to provide him with a suitable position as a reasonable accommodation that resulted in his termination. Furthermore, complainant avers that the termination itself constitutes a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, in keeping with this same discriminatory history, as reflected in complaints 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, based on these statements, as well as the record before us, we find that complainant's contentions that the agency's on-going failure to provide him with a suitable position, resulting in long periods of non-pay status, and culminating in his termination, must be construed together as one matter. For this reason, we further determine that complaints 1 and 2 cannot sensibly be disassociated from the termination claim, and that the entire matter must be referred to the MSPB where the termination claim was, and is now, pending. Accordingly, we find that the AJ erred when she denied the agency's motion to dismiss claims 1 and 2 pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making the above determination, the Commission acknowledges the extensive EEO processing that has taken place. We further find, that under certain circumstances, the Commission may properly assume initial jurisdiction of a mixed case matter when it becomes so firmly enmeshed in the EEO process that it would unduly delay justice and create unnecessary procedural complications to remand it to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See Harrell v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940652 (May 24, 1995). However, in this case, it is complainant who chose to pursue his termination claim in the MSPB forum, effectively precluding Commission jurisdiction. Thus, to avoid artificially bifurcating complainant's claims between two forums, risking inconsistent adjudications, we find that the issues raised in complaints 1 and 2 must be referred to the MSPB for consolidation with the termination claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth above, we find that the AJ should have declined jurisdiction over this entire matter in favor of the MSPB, and dismissed complaints 1 and 2, with an order to the agency to advise complainant that he must bring the claims of discrimination contained in complaints 1 and 2 to the attention of the MSPB, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(c)(2)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01200640121 (2006), the complainant alleged a pattern of harassment based on his race that ultimately culminated in his removal. The complainant appealed his removal to the MSPB and the EEOC administrative judge dismissed the hostile environment claim on the basis that it was "inextricably intertwined" with his removal appeal. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> reversed finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter, we find that the EEOC AJ erred when she found that the instant complaint (harassment/hostile work environment) was not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The AJ failed to take note of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Management Bulletin, 100-1 (October 24, 2003), which required the deletion of Section II.B.4.d. of Chapter 4 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110) (1999),4 including footnote 4.5 Management Bulletin 100-1 explains that although this section in MD-110 was designed to reduce the fragmentation of EEO complaints on related matters that were pending before both the EEOC and the MSPB, the section (which recommended dismissing the related matters from the EEO process and sending them to the MSPB to be consolidated with the matter on appeal there) constituted a request for an MSPB Judge to hear matters which may not be within the Jurisdiction of The MSPB. Therefore, the Management Bulletin 100-1 deleted this section of MD-110. Therefore, the AJ erred in proceeding as if this Management Bulletin had not been issued. Thus, we find that the Commission has jurisdiction over complainant's hostile work environment claim, which encompasses incidents that led up to his removal from the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Caveney v. Executive Office of the President</span>, 01913645 (1992), a case involving a reassignment and an alleged involuntary resignation, the Commission endeavored to explain the complexities of such cases and how they should be handled:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The [mixed case] Regulation also imposes notice duties on federal agencies. An agency is required to inform every employee who is the subject of an action appealable to the MSPB, and who has raised an allegation of discrimination concerning the action, of his or her right to file either a mixed case complaint or a mixed case appeal. The employee must be informed that he or she may not initially file both and that whichever is filed first is an election to proceed in that forum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Involuntary retirement has been held by the MSPB to be tantamount to a removal, <span class="Italic">Rysavy v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 28 MSPR 263, 265 (1985), and therefore an appealable action. Appellant's retirement Form 52 on its face shows an explicit claim of forced retirement and an allegation of discrimination. We note that the complaint file submitted by the agency is devoid of any documentation on appellant's retirement. However, the agency has not disputed appellant's assertion that he clearly stated his claim of forced retirement in his retirement paper and indeed, the action of giving appellant information on mixed case processing demonstrates that his claim was viewed as an appealable action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the claim was explicitly raised at the time appellant submitted his retirement papers, the agency's decision to treat the claim under mixed case processing regulations was correct. However, the agency's notice to appellant, while commendably extensive, was incomplete and therefore ultimately misleading. The notice provided in the agency's April 18, 1991 letter to appellant (and repeated in varying language in all subsequent letters) stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">During the course of the investigation, you raised the issue of your being forced to retire because of the discriminatory actions of the agency. You did not file another complaint alleging forced retirement, nor did you request that the agency amend your complaint to include the circumstances surrounding your retirement in June, 1990. However, since the issue did arise during the investigation, the agency will include and adjudicate the issue of forced retirement in your complaint if you desire.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Before making your decision, you should understand that the inclusion of discriminatorily forced retirement would change the nature of your case and, therefore, the way it would be processed. As I explained in our conversation, the inclusion of the forced retirement issue would turn your EEO complaint into a "mixed" case. A mixed case complaint includes an issue that stems from an agency action that is appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) such as forced retirement. Even if only one of several issues in a complaint is appealable to MSPB, the entire complaint is processed as a mixed case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At no time was appellant informed of his right to appeal the forced retirement issue directly to the MSPB. Nor was he informed of his right to file a separate mixed case complaint on the issue. Thus the Commission finds that the agency's notice did not provide all of the information required under the EEOC Regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the information that was provided was misleading. The only avenue appellant was given to pursue his forced retirement claim was the instant complaint. Giving appellant only one option compounded <span id="Page_1678"></span>the error of incomplete notice, because choosing it would have caused appellant's oriGINAl complaint on his reassignment to be converted from an EEO complaint to a mixed case complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its notice to appellant, and in its arguments to the Commission in its opposition to the RTR, the agency gave no explanation or authority for treating the reassignment issue as a mixed case complaint, or for binding the two issues together. By itself, reassignment with no loss of grade or pay is not a matter that is appealable to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. Therefore, processing the reassignment issue as such would have been improper, and the notice to appellant implying the necessity for such processing was incorrect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission can speculate that the agency had deemed the two issues to be inextricably linked, and shaped its notice to appellant accordingly. The affidavit of appellant that was submitted with his attorney's arguments indicate that appellant did claim that his reassignment was designed to drive him to retire, and that he retired as a result of the loss of job responsibilities and the stress induced by the reassignment. Given the fact that reassignment is not by itself an appealable issue, however, a case for linking the two issues is not as clear cut as the agency's notice implied. Generally, non-appealable issues should be severed and processed separately from the issues appealable to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vance E. Caldwell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910649 (September 6, 1991). Furthermore, the Commission notes the attorney's arguments and supporting citations on the proposition that the reassignment issue is not within the MSPB's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing views are given here, not to reach the question of whether linkage was appropriate, but to illustrate the misleading nature of the agency's information to appellant. If the agency had reached a legal conclusion that the issues were linked enough to warrant MSPB jurisdiction over both, the agency should have explained its conclusion to appellant. In his responses to the agency letters of notice, appellant repeatedly stated that he did not want the complaint to proceed as a mixed case; he stated that he wanted "straight" EEO processing. This was sufficient notice to the agency that he was challenging the agency's determination to process the reassignment issue as part of a mixed case complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has considered the agency's arguments that appellant made an informed election. As the agency maintains, appellant did have the pertinent EEOC Regulations in his possession, as evidenced by his January 10, 1990 memorandum providing the regulations to the agency. Therefore, we would agree that he must have understood the process better than his attorney now claims. In addition, appellant did misinform the agency about having the benefit of continuing legal advice, and the agency might have been lulled into a failure to re-evaluate and correct its notice because of his misinformation. Nevertheless, appellant's actions do not alleviate the agency's duty to have given appellant full notice of his rights to elect a forum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant did not make an informed election, pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.403, when he refused to amend his complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barbara A. Lauderdale v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910033 (February 15, 1991). The agency's incomplete and misleading notice flawed the agency's subsequent FAD on the instant complaint, and led to error in our previous decision. Our previous decision upheld the agency's rejection of the complaint. However, that determination rested on a finding that the forced retirement issue was not part of the complaint; the Commission found that appellant had elected not to raise the issue through MSPB proceedings, and that he chose not to amend the complaint to add the issue. For the reasons above, the Commission reverses its previous findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this reversal, and in the interest of fairness, the Commission has decided to vacate the agency's FAD. We note that the agency's cancellation of the entire complaint would mean that appellant's allegation of forced retirement would not be processed in any administrative forum, despite the fact that he raised the allegation with the agency. It is Commission policy to preserve a complainant's EEO rights whenever possible<span class="Italic">. Patricia Erdman v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910729 (October 31, 1991). The instant complaint is remanded so that the agency can give appellant notice, pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.403, of his right to file either a mixed case complaint or a mixed case appeal on the forced retirement issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By this decision, we do not intend to automatically overturn the agency's cancellation of the reassignment issue. However, we cannot rule on whether appellant is no longer aggrieved by the reassignment, until the forced retirement issue is resolved one way or another. That is because the complexities of mixed case processing permit a variety of potential effects on the reassignment issue. It would not be appropriate for the Commission to act before the MSPB has ruled on jurisdiction over either of the two issues, or to anticipate the effect of any MSPB decision. Furthermore, if MSPB were to determine that it lacks jurisdiction over the forced retirement claim, the claim could be pursued in the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Susan B. Schmitt v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902126 (June 29, 1990). Therefore, after the notice required by 29 CFR 1613.403 is provided to appellant, the agency should hold the instant complaint in abeyance pending final action on the forced retirement issue in the MSPB forum.</p>
