<h3 class="h3" id="sec18-13"><span class="space">F.</span> CONSISTENCY OF DISCIPLINE</h3>
<p class="noindent">In terms of disciplinary cases, consistency of discipline is an issue that frequently arises. It presents the classic form of disparate treatment allegations: the complainant alleges that a fellow employee, not of the complainant's protected group, engaged in the same or similar misconduct and received a lesser penalty.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is important to note that the role of the EEOC in reviewing penalty determinations is to determine whether there is an inconsistency in discipline imposed that is motivated by prohibited discrimination. It is not the proper role of the EEOC, or its administrative judges, to substitute its judgment on an appropriate penalty for that of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to impose discipline with exacting uniformity. It is not discriminatory for one supervisor to impose harsher discipline on a male employee than a different supervisor has imposed on female employees for similar offenses. <span class="Italic">Payne v. USPS</span>, 01840240 (1985). Although a great disparity of treatment may be evidence of pretext, there is no indication the supervisor would have treated female employees less harshly had he been in a position to take action.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency as a whole, however, must make some attempt to be consistent in its discipline of employees. The fact that a black employee received a letter of reprimand for being away from his work station and talking to fellow employees was found to be discriminatory where white employees received no discipline for the same conduct. <span class="Italic">See Higley v. Tennessee Valley</span><span class="Italic"> </span> <span class="Italic">Authority</span>, 018311337 (1983). The employee was observed by an area supervisor who ordered the employee's foreman to look into the matter. The Commission noted that the white employees observed by the area supervisor were not supervised by the same foreman, but found it significant that the area supervisor did not order their foremen to conduct a similar investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1562"></span>In cases where more than one employee is involved in misconduct, such as fighting, the agency is not required to discipline each employee in the same manner, but may take into account which employee was the aggressor and past disciplinary records. However, it is strong evidence of pretext where one employee is severely disciplined and the other employee receives no discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cobb v. USPS</span>, 01791773 (1981). Still, the employee must show that the disparity in discipline is the result of discrimination in order for the Commission to take action to remedy it. <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. USPS</span>, 01860385 (1987). Where the conduct is similar in nature but different in degree, an agency can impose different disciplinary sanctions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hunter and Herrera v. Attorney General</span>, 01A51779 (2006), the complainants alleged that they received harsher discipline than coworkers because of their race and sex for inappropriate use of government computers. The complainants received 14-day suspensions, while others were verbally counseled. The Commission found no discrimination based on the fact that the complainants had forwarded several inappropriate emails containing pornographic items. Those counseled had only received the emails. In finding no discrimination, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Hunter</span> and <span class="Italic">Herrera</span> found that "[a]lthough not all employees received the same discipline as complainants, not all employees engaged in violations of the agency's computer use policy as serious as complainants. Clearly, the Warden viewed complainants' action in forwarding the inappropriate emails, rather than just receiving the emails, as meriting a greater degree of disciplinary action."</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether the imposition of discipline was motivated by discrimination, the Commission looks at the totality of circumstances surrounding the alleged misconduct, including the similarity of the offenses involved, the number of offenses, the nature of the offenses, the time period during which they occurred, and the performance of the employee. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01821940 (1983) (no credence given to an agency's argument that a white employee's offense was one of omission, but a black employee's was one of commission where a first charge related to failure to perform assigned duties and the second charge related to an error of judgment in performing additional duties not assigned to him).</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as an agency is given some leeway in the consistency of discipline, so too, are employees in terms of their culpability. In <span class="Italic">In re USPS</span>, 05860428 (1987), the Commission, citing <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Sante Fe Trail Transportation Co.</span>, 427 U.S. 286 (1986), noted that "precise equivalence in culpability" is not required in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment. The agency then may advance a legitimate reason for its difference in treatment and the employee will have the opportunity to demonstrate pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">The touchstone in cases where inconsistent penalties are the issue is factual development. The comparison employee or employees outside of the complainant's protected group must be similarly situated. In situations involving employees with significantly different job duties and responsibilities, there may exist good reason for inconsistent discipline. For example, an employee whose job functions include fiduciary responsibilities may receive much harsher discipline for a minor misreporting of hours worked than a custodian. Regardless of the race, sex, color, national origin, or religion of the employees involved, there is simply more of a rational connection between the offense and the job responsibilities of one employee as opposed to the other. The misconduct itself also must be similar. Continuing the example, an agency is justified in imposing harsher discipline upon an employee who has engaged in several incidents of falsifying time sheets as opposed to an employee who committed only one infraction. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hamane v. USPS</span>, 01841834 (1986) ("The agency has not attempted to explain this disparity [in penalty], as it could have, for example, by showing that it regarded appellant's conduct as more serious than that involved in the other cases."). Likewise, an agency is justified in imposing a more severe penalty for stabbing a coworker than slapping a coworker. <span class="Italic">See Kaiser v. Department of Army</span>, 03860110 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The past disciplinary records of comparison employees are important. The agency properly takes into account whether an employee has no prior history of discipline or has been subject to several forms of discipline in the past. In attempting to show that discipline has been imposed in a discriminatory fashion, the advice of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), <span class="Italic">Furnco</span>, and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> should be particularly heeded. The object is to eliminate all possible reasonable explanations for the disparity in discipline, leaving only impermissible reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, the Postal Service appears to have created a working environment where threats to supervisors occur on a regular basis. These threats have been advertised by well-publicized "shooting sprees" by former Postal Service employees. As a result, the Postal Service takes threats, however mild, extremely seriously. In one case involving a threat, the EEOC also elaborated on its proper role in reviewing penalty determinations, focusing its inquiry on comparative employees rather than the overall reasonableness of the penalty. In <span class="Italic">Myers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01913261 (1991), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor do we find, given the circumstances of appellant's situation, that the agency engaged in discrimination on the basis of race or reprisal against him when it terminated him for creating a hostile working environment. While appellant has shown that agency officials were aware of his prior EEO activity and that the termination occurred sufficiently close in time to the prior activity to permit an inference of causality, appellant has failed to show that the manner in which suspension was imposed justifies an inference of reprisal. <span class="Italic">Heiser v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request 05901184 (March 7, 1991). Specifically, appellant has failed to show that he was meeting the normal requirements of his position when he was suspended or that, if he was not meeting the normal requirements of his position, other employees also were not, but were not similarly suspended. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahal Communications</span>, 738 F.2d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Donahue v. Piedmont Aviation Inc.</span> 723 F.2d 921,922 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Bassett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEO Request Number 05880960 (March 8, 1989). The testimony of one administrative official, one union steward, and two other employees indicates that appellant's threats, coupled with the information that he carried a gun in his car, created a climate of anxiety in the work place. We note that appellant's threatening behavior occurred around the same time that the media gave wide coverage to two postal facility's shooting sprees by disgruntle former employees. Accordingly, we find that the agency's response to terminate appellant was not unreasonable. Nor do we find that appellant has shown that other agency employees who threatened or actually fired shots were similarly situated to appellant. In the case of one black male employee, there was no evidence introduced explaining the extent of his alleged threat in 1985, nor does the record contain any information about whether at that point, news of shooting sprees similar to those occurring in 1989 might have had any effect on the decision made with respect to that comparative's treatment. We note that another comparative, a supervisor, allegedly shot at a car of people, but no further information was provided regarding that supervisor's race, sex, or handicap status, additionally, we note that the supervisor, by virtue of his/her managerial status, was not similarly situated to appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that appellant did establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination with respect to his termination, we find that the agency articulated a non-discriminatory reason for the termination, which reason appellant did not show to be pretextual. The agency introduced testimony from a shop steward and two supervisors that appellant's threats were taken seriously by at least some fellow employees, resulting in verbal and written requests to take actions to safeguard the workroom floor. We again find that specific threats that certain individuals would be killed, or would not live to see paperwork, coupled with the widespread knowledge that the maker of those threats carried a gun with him, could reasonably justify a decision to remove that individual. In reaching this conclusion, we do not substitute our judgment for the agency's; nor do we find that this was the only or the best response to the situation--merely that it was a reasonable one. In contrast, we note that the AJ determined that the agency should not have taken and did not take seriously the appellant's threats, and therefore found the removal was too harsh a sanction. We find that the AJ improperly substituted her own notion of an appropriate penalty for appellant's behavior for that of the agency. While such a judgment substitution might have been appropriate for the arbitrator in a grievance, it is not so for an EEO case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many agencies recommend the use of tables of penalties to guide managers in disciplining employees for various offenses. The tables usually recommend a range of discipline depending upon both the seriousness of the offense and whether it is the employee's first, second, or third offense. "[A] mere showing that an employer meted out a disciplinary action greater than that normally given under a progressive disciplinary scheme does not, in and of itself...establish that the discipline given was based on prohibited discriminatory criteria. An additional showing must be made either that the employee, in receiving a form of discipline beyond the normal progressive discipline, was treated more harshly than similarly situated employees or that the employer has never deviated from its progressive disciplinary scheme." <span class="Italic">Freeman v. USPS</span>, 01853110 (1987).</p>
