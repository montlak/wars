<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-26"><span class="space">1.</span> Ready, Willing, and Able to Work</h4>
<p class="noindent">In general, a complainant must be ready, willing, and able to work during the period of back pay recovery in order to receive back pay. But when a complainant receives workers' compensation due to an agency's failure to make reasonable accommodation, this does not preclude a back pay award for that period of time. In the context of failure to make reasonable accommodation, receipt of workers' compensation benefits does not indicate an inability to work. <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Postmaster General</span>, 03980087 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">An exception to the ready, willing and able to work doctrine is where it is the agency's discrimination that causes the complainant's inability to work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blount v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720070010 (2009), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. denied</span>, 0520100148 (2010). In such cases, the agency is liable for back pay. For example, in <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50003.txt">07A50003</a> (2006), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also found that complainant was entitled to back pay with interest and benefits from October 25, 2001, the date she stopped at the agency, until the date of the agency's final order. The AJ found that back pay was warranted as the evidence demonstrated that the complainant's inability to work was causally connected to the discrimination she encountered. The AJ found that the amount of back pay should be offset by the amount of any wage replacement benefits which complainant received from OWCP. The agency disputes the award of back pay, stating that complainant voluntarily absented herself from the workplace on October 25, 2001 and did not return. The agency also alleged that at the time complainant left the agency, the harassment had ceased and her work situation was improving. However, the AJ found in his decision that complainant's testimony substantiated her claim that she was subjected to a hostile work environment from August 2000 until October 2001, when she left work. The record supports the AJ's finding that complainant's inability to work following her resignation from the agency was causally connected to the harassment she suffered at the agency. As the AJ found that complainant was subjected to a hostile work environment when she left her position at the agency and she could not work upon her resignation, we concur with the AJ's finding that back pay is warranted in the instant case as complainant's inability to work after October of 2001 was causally connected to the discrimination. We concur with the AJ's finding that complainant is not entitled to recover leave taken due to the discrimination, as it was restored under OWCP.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that if the complainant is unable to work as a result of the agency's discrimination, the proper date on which to terminate back pay benefits is the date the decision becomes final. In <span class="Italic">Moore v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720050084 (2007), the complainant, a tractor trailer operator, sustained a shoulder injury when the agency discriminated against him by refusing him assistance in loading and unloading his truck, The Commission found that, as a back pay award, the complainant was entitled to full regular pay with any pay adjustments, overtime, and federal thrift savings contributions. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that as part of complainant's make-whole remedy, the AJ properly determined that complainant should be awarded back pay, including overtime pay, with interest, and lost benefits, including thrift savings account contributions. The Commission finds that substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that complainant was not able to work due to the injury he suffered on February 26, 2003, and that the injury was the result of the agency's race discrimination and retaliation. In addressing the issue of back pay, the AJ ordered that complainant be awarded back pay and overtime in the amount of $5,069.00 per month, with interest, from February 27, 2003 to July 1, 2005, and thrift savings contributions of at least $5,100.00 annually. On appeal, the agency argues that if back pay must be awarded, the award should end on April 26, 2005. The agency argues that the AJ issued her decision on April 26, 2005. The Commission finds that although the AJ's decision finding discrimination is dated April 26, 2005, the decision was not actually issued until June 21, 2005, when the attorney's fees and cost decision could be issued together with the April 26, 2005 decision. The Commission finds that the appropriate end date of the back pay period is August 2, 2005, which is the date of the agency decision. <span class="Italic">See Brinkley v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980429 (Aug. 12, 1999) (awarding back pay, in a similar situation, to end on the date of the agency decision). The agency has not challenged the actual calculations made by the AJ. We find that the amounts awarded by the AJ are appropriate in light of the evidence submitted by complainant as to his base salary and the amount of overtime that he typically worked prior to his injury.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, that did not end the agency's liability to the complainant, who also received an award of $120,000 in compensatory damages. The Commission remanded <span class="Italic">Moore</span> for a determination of a future pecuniary damages award for loss of earning capacity. See discussion of "<a href="0100-2023-30-104.html#sec21-101">Future Pecuniary Damages</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Barnett v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060019 (2008), the Commission found that where the agency's failure to accommodate him by providing a smoke-free truck resulted in his being totally disabled from working, the agency was liable for back pay from the time the complainant became unable to work until the time its decision became final. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency 's remaining arguments surround the remedies awarded by the AJ. Specifically, the agency argues that complainant is not entitled to back pay from April 2001, because he was totally disabled from this point forward, and unable to perform the essential functions of his job. The agency maintains that it is not liable for the period of time that complainant was not qualified. The agency also maintains that complainant should not recover back pay because he was not "ready, willing and able" to work as stated in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(c). The purpose of a back pay award is to restore complainant to the position she would have occupied, but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</span> 442 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975); <span class="Italic">Payne v. Department of Veteran's Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A42405 (August 24, 2005). Here, complainant was essentially forced off the job due to emotional distress and depression he endured directly as a result of the agency's inaction and failure to accommodate. Complainant sought psychological treatment and even became suicidal due to the agency 's failure to assist him. Eventually, in April 2001, complainant went out on total disability. The Commission finds that complainant's emotional and physical condition was directly caused by the agency's failure to accommodate and that his condition worsened to a point that no reasonable person in complainant's position could remain. <span class="Italic">See Payne,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A42405 (back pay ordered for failure to accommodate when agency failed to establish that complainant would have gone out on disability retirement absent the discrimination); <span class="Italic">Morrison v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A50003 (April 18, 2006) (back pay ordered when complainant's decision to leave work causally connected to hostile work environment). Denying complainant back pay for wages lost as a result of an illness which was directly related to the agency's discrimination would not be equitable, or consistent with back pay principles, which seek to place the individual in the same position he would have been in absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Martin v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 184 F.3d 1366 (July 30, 1999). The agency shall calculate back pay with appropriate offsets to account for workers' compensation payments and any interim earnings, in accordance with our order below. Accordingly, we find complainant is entitled to back pay due to the agency 's failure to accommodate from the date of the discrimination up until the date this decision becomes final.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Small v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100031 (2012), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant's back condition resulted in a further deterioration of that condition and applications for workers' compensation and disability retirement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency claims the AJ erred by ordering Complainant reinstated to his former position at the Hope Mills facility although he applied for disability retirement. We disagree. We find that the Agency discriminated when it failed to accommodate Complainant in his position as carrier at Hope Mills and that there is a causal connection between its denial of accommodation and actions Complainant took to sustain his livelihood, e.g., filing for OWCP and disability retirement. Accordingly, we find reinstatement to said position consistent with the make whole relief required by <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. at 418-23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation resulted in Complainant's inability to work, we find back-pay appropriate from July 24, 2006 (date Complainant went out on leave) through July 23, 2007 (date Complainant had gastric bypass surgery). We find further that back-pay calculations should also include from the end date of Complainant's recuperation from gastric bypass surgery the Summer of 2007 through <span id="Page_1715"></span>the date Complainant was reinstated. We note that it is unclear from the record when Complainant recuperated from gastric bypass surgery or if and when the Agency reinstated Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The back-pay calculations should consider offsets and deductions set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805. Further, we find restoration of all sick and annual leave used due to the discriminatory actions here appropriate. According to the record, Complainant may have exhausted annual and sick leave accruals by the date we find a violation began (July 24, 2006); however, if such is not the case, the leave used shall be restored. We add that compensation for leave without pay used in relation to the discriminatory actions here is also proper. The record shows that, between July 25, 2006 and June 19, 2007, Complainant used approximately 400 hours of leave without pay since exhausting his sick and annual leave accruals.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Augustine S. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720110018 (2015) (back pay awarded from date of retirement until "date Complainant accepts or rejects reinstatement back into his position, or once its determined that he cannot be accommodated in the position.").</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant becomes able to work before the decision becomes final, then that is the appropriate time for termination of back pay if the complainant fails to mitigate his damages by seeking other employment. The duty to mitigate is discussed in more detail below. In <span class="Italic">Knott v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100049 (2011), the Commission found the complainant had sufficiently recovered to take a volunteer position, but did not seek alternative work to mitigate his damages. The Commission terminated the agency's back pay obligation as of the date it determined that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Knott</span> had recovered:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding Complainant did not mitigate his damages once he was able to work, the AJ observed that Complainant took a volunteer position in 2008, but did not pursue other paid work until May 2009. While finding that re-employment at the Agency did not present Complainant with a viable mitigation opportunity, the AJ found that once he had recovered sufficiently to work, Complainant failed to use reasonable diligence in seeking a comparable position with another employer. The AJ cited to the fact that Complainant himself testified that he did not want to be employed until the AJ's decision was issued. The decision also noted that during the hearing, Complainant offered few details when asked about how and when he conducted a job search. Therefore, the AJ limited the award of back pay for failure to mitigate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Complainant's contention that the AJ intended to cease back pay in August 2008, instead of 2007, the Commission agrees. The AJ's reasoning seemed to focus on when Complainant was capable of working, noting that by August 2007 he stopped taking medication. However, the Al's own decision on damages also notes that in the summer of 2007, Complainant was "still fixated on the proposed removal and related actions which cause him to have a second panic attack" and he was "frustrated by his inability to overcome pain and depression." The record also reflects that he was still on medication in 2008. Therefore, the Commission finds that the record establishes that Complainant was unable to work, due to the discrimination, until August 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also awarded two years of front pay in the case because the discriminatory harassment was sufficiently pervasive that the complainant could not be returned to the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency does not properly deduct a period of time that the complainant is not able to work from a back pay award where the discrimination is the reason for the complainant's inability. For example, in <span class="Italic">Damon Q. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420130028 (2015), the Commission found that the agency improperly deducted several months from the back pay award, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find no reason to exclude that time period based on Petitioner's inability in work. To the extent that Petitioner was unable to work, the medical documentation in the record for EEOC Appeal No. 0120130887 reflects that it was linked to his discriminatory termination by the Agency. For example, a January 6, 2011 note from Petitioner's VA psychiatrist stated, "It is felt that patient's more severe depression resulting in patient's...inability to work...[was] significantly exacerbated and caused by the situation of unlawful termination at the [Agency]." Similarly, an October 19, 2012 letter from Petitioner's VA psychologist stated, "Although [Petitioner] suffered from Depression prior to his termination from the [Agency], the termination appeared to have aggravated and precipitated a significant worsening in his Depression to the Moderate and Severe Range and resulted in a significant increase in his service connected compensation award. Currently, he is unable to maintain gainful employment." Therefore, because the Agency's discriminatory termination caused Petitioner to be unable to work, we find that providing full relief to the Petitioner requires that we decline to limit the time period for back pay.</p>
