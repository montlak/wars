<p class="noindent">When an employee believes he or she has been discriminated against on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, genetic information, age, or has been subject to retaliation for participating in the EEO process or opposing a discriminatory employment practice, the first step in the complaint process is to initiate EEO counseling. This is referred to as the precomplaint or informal stage of the EEO process. The label "informal" can be misleading as there is nothing informal about this stage. Precomplaint counseling is an absolute prerequisite to filing a formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's former regulations specifically stated the purposes of precomplaint counseling as: (1) giving the agency notice of the employee's claim; (2) assisting the employee in defining the complaint against the agency; and (3) if possible, attempting an informal resolution of the complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.213. (1991). Much of this verbiage has been dropped from Part 1614, but there is still a significant emphasis placed on informal resolution of complaints in the precomplaint stage, including a requirement that agencies establish, or have access to, an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.105; MD-110, Chapter 3. In addition, the Commission continues to place a strong emphasis on the responsibility of EEO counselors to assist potential complainants in defining their complaints, and on giving the agency notice of potential claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">According to the EEOC's Annual Report on the Federal Workforce for fiscal year 2009, the number of requests to initiate precomplaint counseling dropped from 41,070 in fiscal year 2005 to 39,038 in fiscal year 2009. However, the number of requests for counseling was up slightly from fiscal year 2008 figures. Of the more than 39,000 requests for counseling, 16,947 resulted in formal complaints being filed. The latest figures available for fiscal year 2012 show 34,521 requests for counseling resulting in 15,837 complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">One should not assume from those statistics that precomplaint counseling resulted in over 20,000 complaints being resolved by settlement prior to the formal stage. There are many reasons, aside from settlement, that complainants decide not to go forward with their complaints. In some instances, complainants may receive information in the precomplaint process that convinces them there is little chance of prevailing if they go forward. In other instances, complainants may be unwilling to give up the anonymity of the precomplaint process in order to go formal. Still others may opt to pursue their complaints through the negotiated grievance process or the Merit Systems Protection Board, where applicable. Whatever the reasons, the precomplaint counseling requirement does substantially reduce the number of formal complaints filed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even in the absence of resolution, the importance of precomplaint counseling should not be overlooked. Precomplaint counseling may not be waived by either the agency or the complainant. It is an absolute prerequisite to filing a formal complaint. Over the years, precomplaint counseling also has been referred to as "informal" counseling. This is because the Commission's regulations, at 29 CFR 1614.105(a), require counselors to "try to informally resolve the matter." Throughout this book, every attempt has been made to steer clear of the term "informal counseling" because it suggests that counseling may not be a required part of the process. As noted immediately above, this is not the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">During precomplaint counseling, complainants need to make certain that they have fully stated the grounds for their complaint. Otherwise, they may find portions of their complaints dismissed at the formal stage and it may be too late to begin precomplaint counseling on the dismissed claims in a timely fashion. Likewise, agencies need to ensure that subsequent investigations of formal complaints address all claims raised in the counseling stage in order to avoid costly and time-consuming discovery at the hearing stage or surprise at the hearing itself.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1992, Part 1614 extended the time limit for contacting an EEO counselor from 30 days to 45 days from the alleged discriminatory incident. Also, consistent with the theme of Part 1614 of establishing time limits for all agency actions in the EEO administrative process, the regulations provide for concluding precomplaint counseling within 30 days. There are provisions for extending this period by mutual agreement, or extending the time period when the parties elect ADR. Part 1613 merely included a provision that counseling should be completed within 21 days, if practicable. Because the regulation was advisory only, it had little real effect.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations on precomplaint counseling, at 29 CFR 1614.105, provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Aggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or handicap must consult a Counselor prior to filing a complaint in order to try to informally resolve the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;An aggrieved person must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The agency or the Commission shall extend the 45-day time limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, that he or she did not know and reasonably should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred, that despite due diligence he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from contacting the counselor within the time limits, or for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency or the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)(1)&#x2003;At the initial counseling session, Counselors must advise individuals in writing of their rights and responsibilities, including the right to request a hearing or an immediate final decision after an investigation by the agency in accordance with 1614.108(f), election rights pursuant to 1614.301 and 1614.302, the right to file a notice of intent to sue pursuant to 1614.201(a) and a lawsuit under the ADEA instead of an administrative complaint of age discrimination under this part, the duty to mitigate damages, administrative and court timeframes, and that only the claims raised in precomplaint counseling (or issues or claims like or related to issues or claims raised in pre-complaint counseling) may be alleged in a subsequent complaint filed with the agency. Counselors must advise individuals of their duty to keep the agency and Commission informed of their current address and to serve copies of appeal papers on the agency. The notice required by paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section shall include a notice of the right to file a class complaint. If the aggrieved person informs the Counselor that he or she wishes to file a class complaint, the Counselor shall explain the class complaint procedures and the responsibilities of a class agent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Counselors shall advise aggrieved persons that, where the agency agrees to offer ADR in the particular case, they may choose between participation in the alternative dispute resolution program and the counseling activities provided for in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Counselors shall conduct counseling activities in accordance with instructions contained in Commission Management Directives. When advised that a complaint has been filed by an aggrieved person, the Counselor shall submit a written report within 15 days to the agency office that has been designated to accept complaints and the aggrieved person concerning the issues discussed and actions taken during counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;Unless the aggrieved person agrees to a longer counseling period under paragraph (e) of this section, or the aggrieved person chooses an alternative dispute resolution procedure in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Counselor shall conduct the final interview with the aggrieved person within 30 days of the date the aggrieved person contacted the agency's EEO office to request counseling. If the matter has not been resolved, the aggrieved person shall be informed in writing by the Counselor, not later than the thirtieth day after contacting the Counselor, of the right to file a discrimination complaint. The notice shall inform the complainant of the right to file a discrimination complaint within 15 days of receipt of the notice, of the appropriate official with whom to file a complaint and of the complainant's duty to assure that the agency is informed immediately if the complainant retains counsel or a representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;Prior to the end of the 30-day period, the aggrieved person may agree in writing with the agency to postpone the final interview and extend the counseling period for an additional period of no more than 60 days. If the matter has not been resolved before the conclusion of the agreed extension, the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section shall be issued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;Where the aggrieved person chooses to participate in an alternative dispute resolution procedure in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pre-complaint processing period shall be 90 days. If the claim has not been resolved before the 90th day, the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section shall be issued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(g)&#x2003;The Counselor shall not attempt in any way to restrain the aggrieved person from filing a complaint. The Counselor shall not reveal the identity of an aggrieved person who consulted the Counselor, except when authorized to do so by the aggrieved person, or until the agency has received a discrimination complaint under this part from that person involving that same matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Through the initial publication of MD-110 in 1992, its reissuance in November 1999 and its recent revision in 2015, the Commission has issued substantial <span id="Page_36"></span>guidance on the duties of an EEO counselor. The duties of the counselor are covered in depth in Section B, below. Because timeliness of counselor contact is an issue in so many complaints, however, the discussion of EEO counseling begins with a review of the applicable time limits.</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec2-2"><span class="space">I.</span> THE 45-DAY TIME LIMIT</h2>
<p class="noindent">Under 29 CFR 1614.105(a)(1), an aggrieved person must contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of the incident he or she believes is discriminatory. If the discriminatory incident is a personnel action, the 45-day time limit begins running from the effective date of the action. Because precomplaint counseling is an absolute prerequisite to filing a formal complaint, the 45-day sets up what is in effect an extremely short statute of limitation for initiating federal sector discrimination complaints. By comparison, the minimum statute of limitation for filing private sector complaints with EEOC is 180 days and, in most instances, is extended to up to 300 days. The federal sector time limit, like its private sector companion, is subject to waiver, tolling, and estoppel. See "<a href="0100-2023-11-014.html#sec2-15">Extending the Time Period for Initiating Counseling</a>," subheadings "<a href="0100-2023-11-028.html#sec2-29">Waiver of Time Limit</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-11-015.html#sec2-16">Tolling the Period for Counseling</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-11-047.html#sec2-47">Estoppel</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Under Part 1613, a complainant was required to contact an EEO counselor within 30 calendar days of the incident the employee believed to be discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.214(a)(i). Many were highly critical of the short time period for initiating the EEO complaint process, pointing to the private sector where complainants have from 180 to 300 days from the alleged discriminatory incident to initiate the administrative process. The Commission rejected attempts to extend the time limit for initiating precomplaint counseling to 180 days, instead settling on the 45-day limitation. As it explained in the 1992 notice of final rulemaking at 57 Fed. Reg. 12634-35:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As under part 1613, a person who believes he or she has been retaliated against or discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap must first seek counseling under part 1614 from the alleged discriminating agency and file a written complaint with that agency. Proposed part 1614 contained the same 30-day time limit for contacting a counselor as the existing part 1613 but invited comments on whether that time period should be enlarged. Many of the non-agency commenters advocated lengthening the time period to as much as 180 days arguing that 30 days was insufficient to reflect, secure advice or realize the impact of a discriminatory action, that the relatively short period was screening out many meritorious complaints and that there should be a symmetry between the private sector time limit for filing a charge and the federal sector time limit for contacting a counselor. Most, but not all, of the agency commenters suggested retaining the 30-day limit reasoning that the existing liberal extension provision adequately protects the rights of federal employees and applicants and that any lengthening of the time period would introduce further delays, undermine quick resolution and result in faded memories, lost documents and unavailable witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not believe that the analogy between the private sector filing period and the federal sector counseling time limit is apt. Private employees must actually file a complaint within 180 days, not just contact an EEOC office about doing so. Private employees may have to travel many miles or use the mail to file a charge with EEOC while federal employees only have to contact a counselor by telephone or often merely visit a counselor who is located in the same work place in order to comply with the time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, a comparison of private sector charge filings and federal sector complaint filings indicates that federal employees file complaints at a rate three times greater than private sector employees file charges. Further, the earliest possible contact with a counselor aids resolution of disputes because positions on both sides have not yet hardened. Therefore, we believe a significant lengthening of the pre-complaint period is not justified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, some potential complainants may not be able to comply with the 30-day limit for valid reasons. Consequently, EEOC has decided to modify the time limits for seeking counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Part 1614 provides that an employee or applicant must generally contact a counselor within 45 days of the discriminatory event but also requires an agency to extend the time limit for contacting a counselor when warranted by the circumstances. The reasons for extending the 45-day time period are identical to those in current &#x00A7; 1613.214(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, proposed part 1614 limited the time spent in counseling to 30 days with the possibility of an extension for an additional 60 days if agreed to by both parties. Many agency commenters noted that counseling presented a very important opportunity to resolve complaints and that agencies with formal dispute resolution procedures needed more than 30 days to use them. In order to encourage and accommodate such voluntary efforts, part 1614 now provides that the counseling period will be 90 days where an agency has an established dispute resolution procedure available during counseling and the employee or applicant chooses to use it. We believe that the 60-day extension provision applicable in all other situations will accommodate voluntary settlement efforts whenever both parties agree to it without unduly delaying further processing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's October 1987 amendments to Part 1613 codified previous case law by making a greater attempt to define precisely when the 30-day period started. If a personnel action was involved, the period began to run from the effective date of the action, not the date the action was proposed. If an event or incident not constituting a personnel action was involved, the time period began to run from the date of the event or incident. These provisions were retained in Part 1614.</p>
<p class="noindent">The October 1987 amendments also provided that when the employee had no reason to believe at the time of the personnel action or event that it was based on prohibited motives, the time period was tolled and began to run from when the employee knew or reasonably should have known that discrimination was involved. Part 1614 retains the basic idea of the 1987 amendment but, instead of treating the time limit as not beginning to run until the employee does or should become aware of the alleged discrimination, the time limitation is extended beyond the 45-day period. In pertinent part, 29 CFR 1614.105(a)(2) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency or the Commission shall extend the 45-day time limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, that he or she did not know and reasonably should not have been known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred, that despite due diligence he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from contacting the counselor within the time limits, or for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency or the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">The regulation embodies at least three separate legal principles relating to timeliness: (1) tolling; (2) waiver; and (3) estoppel. There is nothing wrong, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, in combining those three principles into one regulation. However, in practice, the Commission has often blurred the distinction between the doctrines and that, in turn, has led to inconsistency in its decisions. Generally, the principle of tolling the time period should be used when the complainant, through no fault of his or her own, was unaware that the agency had taken a personnel action, or did not, and reasonably should not, have been aware that the action may have been discriminatory. Waiver of the time period, as a principle, generally should be used where the complainant is reasonably unaware of the time limits for complaint processing, or for some other good reason was unable to meet a complaint processing time limit. Finally, estoppel should be used where the agency has engaged in some action that indicates an intent to set aside the time period or takes some other action that is likely to dissuade a complainant from timely initiating counseling. The reason for making these distinctions is not to give fancy legal labels to the basic concept that there are circumstances when the time limit for contacting a counselor should be set aside. Rather, the distinctions among tolling, waiver, and estoppel permit a better focus on defining, categorizing, and understanding those circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although 1614.105(a)(2) specifically deals with counseling, the same principles of tolling, waiver, and estoppel are applied to timeliness questions involving other segments of the complaint process, such as the filing of the formal complaint, requests for hearing, appeal of a final agency decision, and requests for reconsideration by the Commission. The reader also is referred to the specific section of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> regarding those segments of the process. The concepts of tolling, waiver, and estoppel are discussed in detail later under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-11-014.html#sec2-15">Extending the Time Period for Initiating Counseling</a>," subheadings "<a href="0100-2023-11-028.html#sec2-29">Waiver of Time Limit</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-11-015.html#sec2-16">Tolling the Period for Counseling</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-11-047.html#sec2-47">Estoppel</a>."</p>
