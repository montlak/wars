<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-197"><span class="space">2.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span></span> and Collateral Estoppel</h4>
<p class="noindent">Issues that are closely related to those involving identical complaints arise when an agency asserts the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or collateral estoppel as justification for dismissal of a complaint. The doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel are themselves aligned closely and confused easily. When the agency asserts that the dismissed complaint is identical to one already litigated in U.S. district court, the Commission follows the judicial doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or "claim preclusion." That doctrine bars not only the relitigation of legal theories already adjudicated, but litigation of legal theories that could have been litigated but were not. <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 01841917 (1986). But the use of background evidence of reprisal in a complaint alleging nonselection on the basis of race and sex is not the same as a complaint of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Means v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01942654 (1995), the Commission explained the difference between the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rules of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> comprise two doctrines concerning the preclusive effect of a prior adjudication. The first doctrine is claim preclusion or true <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. This treats a judgment once rendered as the full measure of relief to be accorded between the same parties on the same claim or cause of action and issues relevant to that claim. When the judgment is rendered for the defendant, the plaintiff's claim is extinguished and the judgment then acts as a bar<span class="Italic">. Paul R. Magnallanes v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900176 (July 13, 1990) <span class="Italic">citing Kasper Wire Works, Inc., v. Leco Engineering</span>, 575 F.2d 530, 535-536 (5th Cir. 1978). The second doctrine under <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is collateral estoppel or issue preclusion. It recognizes that suits addressed to particular claims may present issues relevant to suits on other claims. Thus, issue preclusion bars the re-litigation of issues actually adjudicated and necessary to the judgment in a prior litigation between the parties<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In the instant matter the doctrine of issue preclusion applies.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bezelik v. National Security Administration</span>, 05A11104 (2003) (adopting the same definitions of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel). In <span class="Italic">Means</span>, the Commission applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel in a complaint involving placement of the complainant on administrative leave and barring his access to agency premises. Collateral estoppel, and not <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, applied because the complainant previously litigated his removal for making threatening statements before the Merit Systems Protection Board. The removal, the complainant's placement on administrative leave, and his denial of access to the agency premises were all premised on the threatening statements. In applying collateral estoppel in <span class="Italic">Means</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Issues (2) and (3), appellant alleged reprisal discrimination with respect to the agency's placing him on administrative leave and not allowing him access to the agency building. Both of the agency's actions stemmed from appellant's allegedly threatening and disruptive behavior in the workplace which, according to the agency, was evidenced by various memorandums which appellant wrote and by allegedly threatening statements made by appellant. This same allegedly threatening and disruptive behavior also led to appellant's removal which was sustained by the MSPB and ultimately sustained by the Commission. In its decision, the Commission specifically found that the agency's assessment of appellant's behavior as threatening was justified by the record. As such, we find that the issue of appellant's allegedly threatening and disruptive behavior which led to his being placed on administrative leave and being barred from access to the agency building was previously addressed, and under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, appellant is estopped from asserting that his behavior was neither threatening or disruptive, or that the agency was not justified in taking the action it did based on the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">For the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to apply, three elements must be present: "(1) the entry of a final judgment on the merits by the court of competent jurisdiction; (2) the participation in the subsequent litigation by the same parties, or parties in privy with these present in the former litigation and (3) the subsequent action must involve these same causes of action as the prior suit." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 07A10033 (2001), where the Commission held that collateral estoppel precluded the complainant from showing he was a qualified individual with a disability. In the <span class="Italic">Jones</span> case, the complainant had previously appealed his placement on enforced leave to the Board. As part of the Board's decision upholding the agency's action, the Board concluded that the complainant was not able to perform the essential functions of his position. "The critical issue to be determined--whether complainant was able to perform the essential functions of the Aircraft Sheetmetal Worker position with or without reasonable accommodation--was actually and necessarily determined by the MSPB in upholding the enforced leave action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who appears as a witness at a discrimination trial to testify about an agency's alleged pattern and practice of sex discrimination is not subject to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> because she did not participate in the previous proceeding as a party. <span class="Italic">In re USPS</span>, 05840024 (1987). The court's ruling that the testimony of the complainant was not probative of a pattern and practice of discrimination was not sufficient to invoke <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and bar the employee from filing her own complaint of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not apply to Commission decisions that are based on procedural matters. The doctrine only applies to decisions rendered on the merits of a claim. <span class="Italic">Pletten v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05910741 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">Collateral estoppel or "'issue preclusion' recognizes that suits addressed to particular claims may present issues relevant to suits on other claims. Issue preclusion bars the relitigation of issues actually adjudicated, and necessary to the judgment, in a prior litigation between the parties." <span class="Italic">Svenson v. Department of Labor</span>, 01860654 (1986). Collateral estoppel is not invoked simply because the facts involved in the present complaint were stated, by way of background, in the previous complaint. In the <span class="Italic">Svenson</span> case, the EEOC found that neither <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> nor collateral estoppel prevented a complainant from raising a 1984 failure to promote based on the court's dismissal of a discrimination complaint of allegations of agency misconduct occurring in 1982. In a subsequent motion to amend the complaint to include the EEOC as a party, the appellant referenced the alleged failure to promote. Appellant sought no relief with respect to that allegation, and the Commission found that the issue actually was not litigated.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant enters into a settlement agreement that resolves pending complaints of harassment and intimidation, collateral estoppel may bar the complainant from pressing a later claim of constructive discharge based in part on the harassment and intimidation. The complainant can still pursue a constructive discharge claim to the extent that it is based on other incidents that were not the subject of a prior settlement. <span class="Italic">See Montague v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05920321 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Montague</span>, the complainant filed two complaints alleging harassment and intimidation on the basis of a perceived mental disability. Subsequently, she filed a complaint alleging that the prior harassment and intimidation, coupled with new actions by the agency, had led to her involuntary resignation. There was language in the settlement agreement to the effect that the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel would not prevent the complainant from pursuing "factual matters" not resolved by the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found the complainant in <span class="Italic">Montague</span> could not rely on the earlier allegations of harassment and intimidation to support her claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A thorough review of appellant's allegations, including her appellate arguments, shows that she clearly intended to allege that she resigned because of the pattern of alleged harassment beginning in February 1990. That is, she intended to include the actions of alleged harassment challenged in her previous complaints to support a new charge of constructive discharge. The Commission, however, is persuaded by the agency's argument that appellant may not raise the issue of this alleged harassment again in a new complaint. That issue was the subject of prior complaints, and those complaints have been settled. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's constructive discharge allegation, to the extent it was based on the alleged pattern of harassment also challenged in her prior complaints, was properly rejected pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.215(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Commission is also unpersuaded by appellant's argument on appeal that the settlement language regarding <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> <span id="Page_260"></span>and collateral estoppel preserved a right to raise the alleged harassment again in a constructive discharge complaint. These legal doctrines provide that an issue once adjudicated or settled between two parties--directly under <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and indirectly under collateral estoppel--may not be relitigated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kaspar Wire Works. Inc. v. Leco Engineering &#x0026; Machine. Inc.</span>, 575 F.2d 530, 535-536 (5th Cir. 1978). The settlement language referred to herein is vague and does not make clear the intent of the parties to permit appellant's subsequent constructive discharge claim. In any case, however, the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel apply as a matter of law and may not be waived by agreement of the parties. Therefore, we find that the settlement language cited by appellant does not operate to preserve her constructive discharge claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note, however, that the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel would not prevent a complainant from introducing evidence of prior EEO activity to support a claim of retaliation, even if the prior complaints have been settled or litigated. In such a case, the act of filing the previous complaint has independent legal significance and the complainant is not attempting to relitigate the merits of the earlier complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The overlapping jurisdiction of the EEOC and the MSPB can create substantial confusion over whether collateral estoppel applies to a given case. In <span class="Italic">Caple v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932018 (1994), the Commission used collateral estoppel where the Merit Systems Protection Board previously disposed of the case on jurisdictional grounds. The Commission found the doctrine of collateral estoppel could be applied to an MSPB decision premised on jurisdiction because, in some cases, the issues of Board jurisdiction and the merits of the claim are "inextricably intertwined." The Commission subsequently reversed its ruling in <span class="Italic">Caple</span> on a request for reconsideration. The Commission in its initial decision in <span class="Italic">Caple</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case the EEOC AJ determined that there were no material facts in genuine dispute because appellant was collaterally estopped from claiming he was the victim of reprisal when he was demoted effective November 24, 1990. The AJ found that the issue of reprisal had already been litigated by appellant and decided in the Board's July 22, 1992 decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, "once an issue is actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that determination is conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation." <span class="Italic">Montana v. United States</span>, 440 U.S. 147, 153 (1979) (citing <span class="Italic">Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore</span>, 439 U.S. 322, 326 n.5 (1979)); <span class="Italic">see Truxson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920799 (Jan. 21, 1993); <span class="Italic">Fitz-Gerald v. Tennessee Valley Auth.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910573 (Jan. 16, 1992). The Court in <span class="Italic">Montana</span> provided the following rationale for the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To preclude parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate protects their adversaries from the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Montana</span>, 440 U.S. at 153-54 (omitting footnote).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether it was appropriate to apply collateral estoppel in the <span class="Italic">Montana</span> case, the Court first examined whether the cause of action at issue involved a party to the prior litigation<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 154-55. The Court then examined: (1) whether the issues presented in the present litigation were in substance the same as those resolved in the prior litigation; (2) whether controlling facts or legal principles have changed significantly since the prior judgment; and (3) whether other special circumstances warrant an exception to the normal rules of preclusion<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 155.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case the record clearly shows that appellant was also a party to the action before the MSPB which was decided on July 22, 1992. Appellant does not argue, and we find no evidence in the record to suggest, that controlling facts or legal principles have changed significantly since the MSPB decision on July 22, 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next we must determine if the issue in the May 29, 1991 EEO complaint is in substance the same as that resolved in the July 22, 1992 MSPB decision. The issue in the May 29, 1991 EEO complaint is whether or not appellant was the victim of reprisal because of his prior EEO activity when on November 19, 1990, he was issued a Letter of Decision from the Postmaster demoting him, effective November 24, 1990, from the position of Supervisor, Mails and Delivery in the Cockeysville Post Office to the position of Mail Processor, Part-Time Flexible Schedule in the Baltimore Main Post Office and thereby reducing his grade from an EAS-16 to a PS-4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board's initial decision on August 27, 1991 (MSPB Docket No. DC07529110672) stated that appellant was appealing from the agency's rejection on June 21, 1991, of his May 29, 1991 EEO complaint. As shown in the Background portion of our decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, appellant's subsequent appeals from that August 27, 1991 MSPB decision eventually resulted in the Board rendering another Initial Decision on July 22, 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that the July 22, 1992 decision of the Board never resolved the merits of the reprisal allegation because the Board dismissed the consolidated appeals for lack of jurisdiction. We find that the July 22, 1992 decision did dismiss the appeals for lack of jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the Board also stated that appellant's reprisal claim had "also been considered and rejected." We note that appellant stated on appeal that the Board "purported to determine the issue of reprisal" in the July 22, 1992 decision. We also note that in appellant's November 4, 1992 response to the EEOC AJ's proposal to issue findings and conclusions without a hearing, appellant admitted that the MSPB AJ "appeared to make a determination with respect to reprisal, even though [the MSPB AJ] had already determined that there was no jurisdiction to consider the issue." Therefore, we find that the July 22, 1992 decision shows that the Board "actually" determined the reprisal issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we must consider whether the issue of the allegedly retaliatory demotion was "necessarily determined" by the Board. Appellant argues that although the Board may have determined the reprisal issue, it was not necessary because the Board found that it did not have jurisdiction. To understand why the Board reached the reprisal issue we must examine another one of the appeals consolidated in the July 22, 1992 decision. The July 22, 1992 decision presented the following procedural history of MSPB Docket Number DC0752910148-M-1 which was consolidated with the other appeals in the July 22, 1992 decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On September 20, 1990,...appellant's supervisor and Superintendent of Postal Operations (SPO)...proposed the appellant's removal based upon his alleged failure to properly perform his assigned supervisory duties, setting forth nine specifications in the notice of proposed removal.... On November 19, 1990,...the agency deciding official and the Postmaster...mitigated the proposed removal and demoted the appellant to the position of Mail Processor, Part-Time Flexible Schedule, assigning him to the Baltimore Main Post Office, effective November 24, 1990....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The appellant petitioned for appeal of the demotion action to the [Board]...on December 10, 1990. In a February 6, 1991 initial decision, the [MSPB AJ]...determined that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because the appellant had waived his appeal rights to the Board in the February 6, 1990 settlement agreement. The Board denied the appellant's petition for review of the February 6, 1991 initial decision in a June 17, 1991 Order<span class="Italic">. See Caple v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 420 (1991)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant filed a petition for judicial review of the Board's June 17, 1991 Order with the [United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit] on June 28, 1991<span class="Italic">. Caple v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 91-3448. The Board thereafter filed a motion to remand the appeal for a hearing and determination on the issue of whether there was a breach of the February 6, 1990 settlement agreement between the parties under the court's then newly-issued opinion in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 926 F.2d 1146 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The [United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit] granted the Board's motion to remand the appeal in a February 19, 1992 order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148, stated in the July 22, 1992 decision that, in order for the Board to have jurisdiction over appellant's allegations raised in MSPB Docket Number DC0752910148-M-1, appellant must show that the settlement agreement had been breached and that he was in compliance with the settlement agreement. The Board stated that the settlement agreement at issue provided that appellant be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to satisfactorily perform his supervisory duties. The Board explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency effected the appellant's demotion based on charges that he failed to demonstrate that ability. Thus, to establish breach of the settlement agreement, the appellant must show that he demonstrated his ability [to] satisfactorily perform his supervisory duties or that the agency demoted him in bad faith or in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board also provided the following rational in its July 22, 1992 decision as to why it decided the issue of retaliation:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Board may make an initial determination on a claim of prohibited discrimination where the claim is asserted as the sole cause of an involuntary action, and thereby determine Board jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Price v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 MSPR 107, 110 (1991);...<span class="Italic"> See also Baughman v. Department of the Army</span>, 45 MSPR 580, 587 (1990) (in compliance cases, the Board has authority to examine an employee's claims of retaliation). However, throughout this proceeding, the appellant's pleading and testimony on his reprisal and discrimination claims have failed to present a legitimate factual issue of whether there was a breach of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1149.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the MSPB determined that in order for the MSPB to have jurisdiction, appellant would have to prove he was the victim of reprisal which would constitute a breach of the settlement agreement and would thereby deny <span id="Page_261"></span>the agency the right to enforce the waiver provisions of the settlement agreement. Without such a breach, then the waiver provisions remained in effect and the Board would have no jurisdiction over the appeals. Therefore, we find that the Board's ruling on the same issue as in the May 29, 1991 complaint was "necessary" to its determination that it had no jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Commission must determine whether special circumstances warrant an exception to the normal rules of preclusion<span class="Italic">. Montana</span>, 440 U.S. at 155. Appellant argues that special circumstances apply to this case and that collateral estoppel should not be applied because he had not been granted a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of reprisal. The Court in <span class="Italic">Montana</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Redetermination of issues is warranted if there is reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or fairness of procedures followed in prior litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., 440 U.S. at 164 n.11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Second Restatement of Judgments suggests various scenarios whereby a party may have lacked a fair opportunity to litigate the issue in question in the initial action:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he court in the second proceeding may conclude that issue preclusion should not apply because the party sought to be bound did not have an adequate opportunity...to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the first proceeding. Such a refusal to give the first judgment preclusive effect should not occur without a compelling showing of unfairness, nor should it be based simply on a conclusion that the first determination was patently erroneous. But confined within proper limits, discretion to deny preclusive effect to a determination under the circumstances stated is central to the fair administration of preclusion doctrine.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 28 comment j (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that a key witness, a Manager of technical sales and services (hereinafter, Manager), was not allowed to testify at the MSPB hearing on May 13, 1992, and that the MSPB AJ would not admit an affidavit from that key witness into evidence. The MSPB AJ stated in the decision that appellant argued that the Superintendent of Postal Operations (SPO) was employed by the agency as a "hatchet man" to remove appellant and that the SPO was increasingly hostile to appellant after a prior EEOC decision was remanded to the agency on August 13, 1990. The MSPB AJ stated in his decision that the Manager testified that she knew the SPO and was aware that he tends to lose his temper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB AJ stated that the SPO and the Postmaster testified that they were unaware of appellant's protected activities. The MSPB AJ also found that there was no evidence in the record which showed that the Director of Field Operations was involved with, or organized, appellant's proposed removal. The MSPB AJ concluded that there was no basis for concluding that these individuals retaliated against appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, appellant asserts that the MSPB AJ refused to allow the Manager to testify concerning a conversation she had with the Director of Field Operations and that the MSPB AJ refused to admit into evidence the Manager's affidavit provided to the EEO investigator which, according to appellant, confirmed the retaliatory intent of the Director of Field Operations against appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has submitted portions of the transcript of the May 13, 1992 hearing before the MSPB AJ. The hearing transcript shows, at page 175, that the MSPB AJ made the following statement:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Okay. Well, the testimony that we exclude in [the Manager's] situation was concerned the conversation with--the alleged conversation with [the Director of Field Operations] regarding what [the Director of Field Operations] had told [the Manager] about the appellant and the fact that he would repeat whatever removal action or demotion over and over again. That was--you've got to let them bring in a rebuttal witness on that so I don't want to hear any testimony--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The hearing transcript shows that appellant's representative then asked the Manager to look at an affidavit. The record does not contain the portion of the transcript showing whether appellant actually attempted to enter the transcript into evidence and, if so, whether it was accepted into evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applicable to claims of discrimination<span class="Italic">. Fitz-Gerald</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910573; <span class="Italic">Watts v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880963 (Mar. 8, 1989). We find that appellant failed to show that there are special circumstances which warrant an exception to the normal rules of preclusion. We find that the record shows that appellant was granted a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of reprisal. We note that the record shows that the Manager was allowed to testify to some extent at the MSPB hearing. We recognize appellant's argument that he was not allowed to enter all the evidence he wished at the MSPB hearing. Even if appellant has properly characterized the evidence that was purportedly excluded from the MSPB hearing, we find that the MSPB AJ provided appellant a fair opportunity to litigate the reprisal issue. We find that the purported exclusion of certain evidence by the MSPB AJ does not constitute a compelling showing of unfairness in the MSPB hearing. Furthermore, the Commission will not refuse to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel based on a simple conclusion that the first determination (the MSPB hearing) was patently erroneous.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 28 comment j (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that appellant is collaterally estopped from raising his allegation of reprisal, that the EEOC AJ properly decided to issue findings and conclusions without a hearing pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e)(3), and that the agency properly issued a decision finding no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Caple</span>, the Commission held that in order for the doctrine of collateral estoppel to be applied, the prior decision must be on the merits and must be in a case over which the other adjudicatory body had jurisdiction. The Commission explained this reversal of its position in <span class="Italic">Caple v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940808 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its July 22, 1992 initial decision, the MSPB--in determining jurisdiction--examined whether the agency breached the settlement agreement by reprising against appellant. The MSPB found that the agency had not reprised against appellant by demoting him and therefore had not breached the settlement agreement. Consequently, the waiver provision in the settlement agreement precluded the MSPB from having jurisdiction over appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that appellant's EEO-related appeal was beyond the MSPB's jurisdiction not because of the parties' settlement agreement, but because it was a non-mixed action complaint<span class="Italic">. See Caple v. United States Postal Service</span>, No. 92-3645, slip op. at 5 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 7, 1993). By so finding, the court effectively determined that the MSPB AJ improperly reached the merits of appellant's reprisal claim and vacated the MSPB's finding in that regard. As a result, the principle of collateral estoppel no longer is applicable in this case. Consequently, we reverse the previous decision and remand the case to the agency for referral to an EEOC AJ for a hearing and a determination on the merits of appellant's reprisal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's position on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Caple</span> is the correct view of collateral estoppel since there can be no preclusive effect of findings reached in a tribunal that never had jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached the same conclusion in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720060003 (2007), where the agency argued that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or collateral estoppel barred an administrative judge from finding sexual harassment where the MSPB had previously found it lacked jurisdiction over the complainant's constructive removal claim. The Commission found that the claims of sexual harassment were raised as background evidence in the MSPB appeal and "any attempts to raise the issue were found by the MSPB AJ to be outside the scope of the appeal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
