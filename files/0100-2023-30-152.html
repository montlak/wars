<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-143"><span class="space">l.</span> $70,001-$75,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">An award of damages in the relatively odd sum of $72,840 was upheld in <span class="Italic">Nnaji v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A30092 (2003), despite the lack of any medical evidence. The complainant testified that he suffered from stress, depression, sleeplessness, hopelessness, loss of enjoyment of life, memory loss, suicidal ideation and that his diabetic condition was exacerbated when he was removed. He also testified that, after his removal, his wife abandoned him and he was forced to return his children to Africa. In addition, he was unable to complete the purchase of a house he was in process of buying at the time of his removal, had his car repossessed and was unable to afford his medication.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">McCann v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01971851 (1998), was awarded $75,000 in compensatory damages where the agency's discrimination aggravated a previously existing post-traumatic stress disorder. The complainant had received treatment for more than three years prior to the hearing and was still undergoing such treatment at the time of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following its holding in <span class="Italic">McCann</span>, the Commission awarded $75,000 in compensatory damages in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Attorney General</span>, 01983712 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's policy is to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases<span class="Italic">. McCann v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971851 (October 23, 1998). Complainant has presented evidence that the two nonselections by the agency aggravated his Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome so that he went from being a functional employee to someone so distraught that he had to take disability retirement. The record also reveals that the agency's discrimination of complainant caused sleeplessness, insomnia, argumentative behavior, depression, anxiety, low self esteem and increased irritability including fantasies of spraying DEA headquarters with bullets. Commission cases similar to the instant case include: <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971851 (October 23, 1998)($75,000 award in non-pecuniary damages for psychological injuries, including a recurrence of PTSD, which had resulted in the need for more than three years of continuing therapy after the agency's discriminatory actions. At the time of her hearing, complainant had been diagnosed with "chronic" depression, and was taking a number of medications, including Prozac, Haldol and Trazadone.); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995)($75,000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages for deterioration in appellant's medical and emotional condition resulting in his disability retirement. Aggravation of asthma, panic attacks, insomnia, digestive problems, loss of spirit, social withdrawal, feelings of <span id="Page_1886"></span>hostility and irritability, and loss of libido). Given that the instant case is similar to those cases in that, among other similarities, complainant had a condition which was exacerbated by the agency's treatment of him, we find that the complainant should be awarded a total of $75,000 in non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Millard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991535 (2001), the Commission reduced an administrative judge's award of $150,000 to $75,000 where the complainant previously required leave for treatment of depression because of the dissolution of his marriage and was still under treatment at the time of the discrimination. In reducing the award, the Commission noted that the agency was responsible for the harm done after the complainant's return to work from that treatment. In <span class="Italic">Millard v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A10848 (2002), the Commission denied the complainant's request for reconsideration and affirmed its award of $75,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant's termination resulted in his separation from his family for most of a four and a half year period, the Commission awarded $75,000 in damages. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Holler v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01982627 (2001), found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant stated that when he learned he lost his job, he felt very scared, angry, and remorseful, and memories of the removal still upset him from time to time. His self confidence and morale were hurt when he was repeatedly turned down for jobs, and the complainant felt like a failure when people asked him why he was no longer at his old job and had not found employment. For sometime, he emotionally withdrew.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant explained that he lived in his community for 26 years and did not want to uproot his family for an unknown period of time. He stated that moving would have created a major impact on him because he would have to find new services for his daughter with a severe disability, and disruption of her life would be traumatic to her and more so to everyone around her. The complainant affirmed that the conditions of his temporary housing were unpleasant, and it was stressful because he had to pack and unpack each week and was never guaranteed a space during the week. Further, life in the trailer was cramped and lonely, and he routinely felt depressed. The complainant complained that while living in the trailer it was quite unpleasant in the winter because he had to walk outside to a bath house to shower. Further, over a 4 1/2 year period the complainant was tired from the long trips between the two residences and largely deprived of family except on weekends. In fact, a reading of affidavits by the complainant and family members reveals that the complainant arrived home exhausted on Friday evenings after working all day and driving 2 3/4 hours, and went to bed early Sunday evenings to prepare for the long drive Monday mornings. He was in his 60s. He missed birthdays and wedding anniversaries, and the relationship with his wife became strained. The complainant stated that he finally resigned from his job at Twentynine Palms due to the stress caused by the separation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant's wife and grown children also attested about this time. A daughter with a severe mental disability who lived in the family house cried every Sunday before the complainant made his trip back to Twentynine Palms, and this was stressful for the complainant. Instead of being with this family and pets during the week and eating home cooked meals, the complainant lived alone an ate frozen meals. As already noted, the complainant was tired on weekends and on short time. This created conflict between the complainant and his wife because the complainant wanted to stay home and his wife, who did not drive, wanted to go out. They argued more. Their relationship was injured, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, did not talk as much, hold hands, or take walks together. The complainant became irritable and impatient. Family members also attested to the suffering they went through because the complainant was unavailable. Compensatory damages are available to federal sector complainants, not their family members under the Civil Rights Act of 1991. <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995). But pain and suffering caused to the complainant because his family members suffered is compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kathleen P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720150036 (2016), supported an award of $75,000 where the complainant was discriminatorily terminated based on her disability and "experienced considerable stress and emotional disturbance over losing her livelihood, was put at risk when she lost her medical insurance, and even at the hearing was still emotionally volatile."</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $25,000 was increased to $75,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ghazzawi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15327 (2002), where the complainant suffered some eight years of "sustained sleep disturbances, nightmares, fatigue, severe depression, suicidal thoughts, short-term memory deficits, inability to concentrate, feelings of humiliation, feelings of hopelessness, feelings of uselessness, deteriorated relationships with his wife and five children, deteriorated interest in pleasurable activities and feelings of anger." Apparently, while noting the severity and duration of the complainant's suffering in <span class="Italic">Ghazzawi</span>, the Commission felt it was worth less than $10,000 per year.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that is short on detail, the Commission upheld a $75,000 damage award by the administrative judge. In <span class="Italic">Hames v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20042 (2003), the Commission noted the complainant suffered "severe emotional harm, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life, resulting in significant and prolonged personality changes, including developing feelings of embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, depression an obsessiveness, as well as strains with his relationships with his wife, family, and friends..."</p>
<p class="noindent">A damage award of $75,000 by the agency was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Quick v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A13884 (2003), where the complainant demonstrated that</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the agency's discriminatory treatment caused him significant difficulties. Complainant explained that after he was fired, he lost custody of his two daughters, his home, his car, and many of his earthly possessions. He became homeless (and had to live in various shelters and on the streets, where he was forced to fight others to protect himself and his possessions), fell mentally ill, and was hospitalized. Various witnesses testified or provided affidavits indicating that before the discrimination at issue, complainant was a "happy go lucky," vibrant, funny, optimistic, social, helpful person. The same witnesses stated, however, that after he was fired from his job, he became severely depressed, withdrawn, disillusioned, anxiety-ridden and sorrowful. He now is a loner, and prone to anger and emotional outbursts. His self-esteem has been shattered, and his credit has been ruined. Complainant testified that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I'm behind in bills. I can't buy a house. I can't buy a car. I can't do anything because now I look like, they have damaged my credibility. I went from being an upstanding citizen into a panhandling bum, you know, taking bottles and cans. People laughing at you because you stink and you smell.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's Testimony (Apr. 13, 2000), at 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">He therefore claims that he is entitled to $300,000 in non-pecuniary "pain and suffering" damages, and to thousands more in out-of-pocket losses. To determine the proper amount to which he is entitled, we have examined the evidence in the record gathered as part of the agency's compensatory damages investigations. We have also carefully considered all of complainant's arguments on appeal and scrutinized the agency's Compensatory Damages FAD. After this review, we see no reason to disturb the agency's determination that it owes complainant $100 in pecuniary damages and $75,000 in non-pecuniary damages<span class="Italic">. Cf. Ghazzawi v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A15327 (April 23, 2002) (where we similarly awarded $75,000 to a complainant who suffered feelings of humiliation, hopelessness, and uselessness, who became withdrawn and extremely irritable, and whose relationships with is wife and children suffered after an agency discriminated against him unlawfully).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant testified that his life was devastated for a period of six years, and corroborated that testimony through other witnesses, the Commission determined that an award of $75,000 in damages was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20103 (2003), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a March 29, 1999 statement, complainant averred that he has suffered as a result of the discrimination and that his life has been devastated for the last six years. He further maintained that words cannot express the pain and suffering he has experienced. He explained that he chose to ignore the shame he endured which had a "lasting and degrading affect[ ] on [his] morale and job performance." He describes himself as feeling dejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife testified that complainant seemed to have a form of depression, was fearful he would lose his job, and withdrew from the family. She noted that complainant was taking medication for his psychological condition. She further averred that their children were affected by the discrimination as well because complainant was unavailable to them, and that she bore all of the family responsibilities by herself. She stated that the marriage suffered because of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Numerous of complainant's friends testified that complainant experienced stress, anger, and frustration because of the discrimination. One witness described complainant as emotionally upset, and another recalled complainant was not the same person. Similarly, one of complainant's neighbors stated that he thought the entire neighborhood saw a change in complainant. A coworker, who was also a minister, testified that he would speak to complainant on matters of a spiritual nature. He described complainant as having "his defenses up" and noted that complainant had a "Jeckle and Hyde situation sometimes." Some of complainant's coworkers also testified that complainant had difficulties with other employees because he was not a member of the union, and that he experienced stress because of the litigation of the EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an evaluation dated September 23, 1998, complainant's psychiatrist (the Psychiatrist) found that complainant showed some emotions of anger and frustration, and that he appeared to have a certain amount of tension. The Psychiatrist reported his discussion with complainant regarding the various factors that created stress for complainant at work and gave rise to complainant's EEO complaint. The Psychiatrist recommended individual therapy and prescribed Buspar twice a day for its anti-anxiety and calming effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1887"></span>Complainant has established through his statement and the testimony of others that he experienced stress, anger, and frustration because of the discrimination. The record further reflects that complainant's relationships with his wife, children, coworkers, and friends were affected by the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the aforesaid testimony, complainant's statement, and the Psychiatrist's evaluation, we find that the agency's conduct caused complainant to experience stress, anger, and frustration for approximately six years, resulted in a strain on complainant's relationship with his family and friends, and required complainant to seek medical assistance for his anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the issue of whether the AJ's award of $75,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages was appropriate. No precise formula exists for determining the amount of damages for non-pecuniary losses, except that the award should reflect the nature and severity of the harm and the duration or expected duration of the harm<span class="Italic">. Loving v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955789 (August 29, 1997). The Commission's goal is to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases<span class="Italic">. Hogeland v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01976440 (June 14, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971851 (October 23, 1998), the Commission awarded $75,000 in non-pecuniary damages where, after the agency's retaliatory removal, complainant experienced feelings of psychological numbness, anger, and fear, as well as diminished pleasure in activities, some social withdrawal, less confidence on the job, and a constant fear of unjustified job loss. Moreover, complainant presented with insomnia, depression, flashbacks, nightmares, and fatigue. There, the effects of the agency's discrimination lasted approximately four years<span class="Italic">. See also Durrant v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971885 (September 15, 2000) ($70,000 awarded where an agency's failure to reasonably accommodate complainant aggravated her orthopedic condition and resulted in sustained emotional injuries and a progression of her disability from having limitations in walking to having physical pain and using a wheelchair); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01966961 (July 17, 1998) ($80,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages awarded where, over a five year period, complainant experienced symptoms of depression, as well as headaches, ringing in his ears, vomiting, raised blood pressure, grinding of teeth, and insomnia).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ properly determined that complainant suffered harm because of the agency's discriminatory conduct, and complainant has provided sufficient evidence to justify the $75,000 awarded by the AJ in this case<span class="Italic">. McCann v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971851 (October 23, 1998). Complainant proved, through his own testimony, the report of his Psychiatrist and the testimony of thirteen witnesses, that he experienced stress, anger, and frustration for approximately six years; his relationships with his family and friends were strained; and he had to seek medical assistance for his anxiety due to the agency's discriminatory conduct. Based upon the aforementioned precedent, we find that an award of $75,000 is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased the agency's $10,000 award to $75,000 in <span class="Italic">Sherrill S. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120160115 (2017). The length of discrimination was less than the cases above. <span class="Italic">Sherrill S.</span> involved an 11-month period of discriminatory conduct, but, in that time, the complainant was "subjected to a pattern of discrimination because she was pregnant, including a wrongful termination, constructive discharge, and continuous harassment from March 2006 to February 2007." The complainant in <span class="Italic">Sherrill S.</span> further testified that she suffered high levels stress and anxiety while pregnant and on maternity leave.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $75,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Offley v. Postmaster General,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30053.txt">07A30053</a> (2004), where the administrative judge found that the complainant suffered depression and severe humiliation for some 14 months. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Offley</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her supplemental order, the AJ noted that the amount awarded takes into account complainant's credible testimony at hearing corroborated by his medical documentation and the affidavit of his spouse. She further noted that she considered the severity and duration of the suffering the discrimination caused complainant, other cases of similar severity, and finally found the amount awarded was not "monstrously excessive standing alone." The AJ specifically noted that the amount takes into account complainant's pain and humiliation at being compelled to leave agency employment, as a result of not being able to work a day shift due to unlawful discrimination, and to mitigate his financial circumstances by accepting menial jobs while becoming totally dependent on his wife as the sole wage earner. The AJ further considered that complainant suffered the embarrassment and humiliation of having to borrow money from his grown children to pay basic expenses. She noted that complainant credibly detailed how he fell behind in his bills and began to receive debt collection calls. In responding to the agency's claim that complainant willingly abandoned his job as a result of not keeping his Tour of choice, the AJ asserted that complainant was advised by his doctors that there was a "greater danger of death" working night shifts, and an independent medical examination (IME), which the agency finally provided, supported this fact. Finally, the AJ observed that for fourteen months, complainant endured not only great financial difficulty because of his "well-founded fear for his health and even for his life," but when complainant fought for and won the right to an IME, the agency failed to provide him with one for a period of months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To prevail in a claim for compensatory damages, complainant must establish a causal connection between the discriminatory conduct and the harm that he suffered<span class="Italic">. See Browne v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01944256 (July 17, 1995). Complainant and his wife provided detailed testimony as to the pain endured as a result of the agency's unlawful action. Complainant testified to the extreme anxiety he felt in having to choose whether to leave agency employment and somehow attempt to sustain himself and his family, or stay and face greater risk of more severe coronary problems or even death. Complainant's testimony further revealed the continuous strain of trying to maintain menial employment to make ends meet in their home. Complainant's wife detailed his loss of enjoyment of life, as complainant became inactive around the house and did not interact with his grandchildren as he once did before having to leave agency employment. Complainant's wife stated that the "effect this had on my husband was one of devastation," and he became introverted and "worried constantly about our finances and how we were going to survive." She explained that complainant had to borrow money from his siblings as well as his youngest daughter "in order to pick up some food from the grocery store." Complainant's wife detailed his change in mood as cranky and their relationship very strained as complainant suffered through sleepless nights and antisocial behavior as a result of the agency's action. Complainant's medical documentation, while not showing as the agency argues that his coronary condition worsened during the time in question, does explain complainant's emotional turmoil endured as a result of being made to choose between possibly a life or death decision while not knowing how to financially support himself and his family if he left agency employment. This, he ultimately decided to do, and he suffered tremendously. Further, the Commission does find the behavior of the RMO as egregious in that he seemed to play a great part in not just abolishing complainant's medical accommodation, but also stifling complainant's ability to get an IME to support the claims of his personal physicians. The record reveals that the RMO, highest ranking official at that facility, even communicated with complainant's physicians without his consent, and seemed to desperately try to derail complainant's attempts at getting an impartial review of his need for a continued medical accommodation. As complainant correctly summarized in his appeal brief, "the agency's actions prolonged and exacerbated the financial harm caused to complainant and thus prolonged and exacerbated the emotional and psychological harm caused to complainant." <span class="Italic">See Ghazzawi vs. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A15327 (April 23, 2002) ($75,000 in nonpecuniary damages for feelings of humiliation, feelings of hopelessness, feelings of uselessness, deteriorated relationships with wife and five children, deteriorated interest in pleasurable activities and feelings of anger). Also<span class="Italic"> see Toro v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20095 (September 30, 2003) ($85,000 in nonpecuniary damages for discriminatory treatment by supervisor resulting in bouts of depression, extreme humiliation and marital difficulties).</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that while the Commission in <span class="Italic">Offley</span> refers to the egregiousness of the discrimination in a way that, at first blush, might sound as if the damage award was punitive in nature, it ultimately tied the responsible management official's behavior to the fact that it prolonged the complainant's actual harm as a result of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $75,000 in damages by the administrative judge was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Miles v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30019 (2004). In <span class="Italic">Miles</span>, the Commission found the hostile environment lasted not only the four months from the complainant's first report until the termination of the perpetrator, but also through the period of time that the agency failed to return the complainant to her regular duty station after it terminated the perpetrator. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Miles</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency is not liable for any conduct that occurred before complainant notified the agency of the harassment on January 6, 2000, the agency is liable for the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions that complainant suffered because of the agency's inaction. We note that complainant's husband testified that complainant's emotional and mental condition deteriorated after January 6, 2000. Moreover, we note that a psychiatric evaluation dated October 11, 2000, noted that complainant's "passive suicidal ideations" had worsened since March 2000, during the period of the agency's inaction. We further note that in a letter dated March 22, 2000, complainant's psychiatrist stated that complainant missed work for two weeks in February 2000 because of "fear, anxiety and depression regarding going to work in an environment she did not feel safe in...." "She reported that she like <span class="Italic">[sic]</span> her job but cannot perform <span id="Page_1888"></span>at the location where the sexual 'harasser' works because of anxiety and depression," the psychiatrist stated. The psychiatrist also stated that complainant worried a lot about the situation at work, experienced early morning sleeplessness, and suicidal thoughts. The psychiatrist concluded that "at present [complainant] cannot work in an environment that she feels is not safe from sexual or physical threats without exacerbation of depressive and anxiety symptoms." Complainant testified that she wished the agency would have protected her in January 2000 when she reported the harassment because "I wouldn't have been stressed out every time I walked in that station." We conclude that there is ample evidence in the record to support a finding that complainant suffered severe emotional harm caused by the agency's failure to protect her from working with her harasser after January 6, 2000. Finally, we note that the agency's failure to properly address the harassment once it was reported was not only a four-month event as the agency maintains. Instead, the record supports the AJ's finding that the agency's liability includes its inaction from January 6, 2000 through April 26, 2000, as well as its continuous failure to allow complainant to return to her duty station after the harasser was terminated. Based on the testimony and documentation of complainant, her husband, psychiatrist, and psychologist, we determine that complainant's pre-existing Major Depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder were exacerbated and prolonged by the agency's failure to take proper action to address the sexual harassment of complainant, including its ongoing denial of complainant's request to be returned to her oriGINAl duty station.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50027.txt">07A50027</a> (2005), the Commission awarded $75,000 in damages where the agency's discrimination resulted in both psychological and physical symptoms. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find the award of $75,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages was appropriate. The AJ found complainant credibly testified that she suffered from anxiety, anger, victimization, paranoia, crying bouts, sleep disturbances, lost over twenty pounds, has a loss of trust, felt she could not function at work and feels she has been labeled a problem employee. The record reveals that complainant saw her primary care physician in May 2002, for treatment in connection with the stress of her job and was treated for "anxiety and abdominal pain" and was prescribed medication for her situation. The record also reveals that complainant was seen by a care provider in May 2002, for "high anxiety and stress, tearfulness, insomnia, and fatigue." Additionally, complainant saw a psychiatrist in May and June 2002, who both times extended her return to work date and noted that on June 12, 2002, her "[r]eturn to work date extended-individual not capable of handling stress of return to same job situation." The record shows complainant was out of work from May 14, 2002, to July 22, 2002, due to stress related from the work situation. Further, complainant testified that she took a week of leave in October 2003, because she was upset that she had to go back and work for the manager, she states it "was like having a nervous breakdown all over again." We note that the AJ observed complainant was still visibly upset when testifying and "did breakdown in tears when she would have to recount the facts as they were related to this complaint."</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant demonstrated that a failure to promote was based on race, national origin and age discrimination, the Commission upheld an award of $75,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Kim v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0720070048 (2008), the Commission first noted that the administrative judge, in making the award, had accounted for the fact that the complainant could not recover for any harm that was the result of age discrimination. The Commission also rejected an agency argument that the award was "monstrously excessive," finding that the complainant had suffered some 18 months of harm, consisting of depression, forgetfulness, fatigue, excessive irritability and withdrawal from usual activities. The award also noted that the complainant suffered humiliation and harm to his professional reputation when colleagues expressed surprise that he was not promoted while others were.</p>
<p class="noindent">A damage award of $3,000 by the administrative judge was increased by the Commission to $75,000 in <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120082939 (2008), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant over a protracted period of time led to a paranoid disorder. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the damages hearing, complainant's psychologist described complainant's current condition as Paranoid Personality Disorder with Psychotic Features, and attributed complainant with symptoms such as extreme paranoia, fear, an explosive temper, extreme instability, anxiety, and total mistrust in anyone with a voice of authority. Additionally, the psychologist stated that complainant's state was so severe that he may have had to be committed in a mental health facility had it not been for the support of his family. The psychologist also testified that the agency's failure to accommodate complainant caused his current severe condition. Even though the psychologist first had contact with complainant seven months after complainant stopped working at the agency, complainant's wife corroborated the psychologist's testimony. Specifically, she stated that when the agency failed to accommodate complainant she noticed a significant change in his behavior. Complainant's wife testified that he was extremely paranoid when he came home from work and asked her if anyone from the agency or from the police was in the home. He also became hostile, aggressive, and angry. Further, complainant's wife stated that he became very protective of her and was afraid that someone was out to kill her, resulting in her not being to do anything without him present, including using the restroom. Complainant's wife also testified that in September or October of 1996, complainant was hospitalized for a week because of the situation at his work. The record also reveals that complainant was discriminated against for almost two years, during which his symptoms became progressively worse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as complainant has submitted evidence of emotional distress, we note that the Commission has awarded compensatory damages in cases somewhat similar to complainant's in terms of harm sustained. <span class="Italic">See Hakohane v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01991245 (February 20, 2002) (failure to reasonably accommodate when the agency did not provide complainant with the support he needed to structure and organize his work, and his eventual removal, resulted in complainant being awarded $90,000.00 for his severe anxiety, distress, anger, depression, paranoia, panic and self-doubt); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995) (failure to reasonably accommodate resulted in an award of $75,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages for deterioration in complainant's medical and emotional condition where the specific harm was aggravation of asthma, panic attacks, insomnia, digestive problems, loss of spirit, social withdrawal, feelings of hostility and irritability, and loss of libido); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) (failure to reasonably accommodate and failure to select complainant for a lateral reassignment resulted in an award of $80,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages for trouble sleeping and onset of grinding and clenching of teeth at night, irritability, anger, humiliation, fear, moodiness, embarrassment, was short-tempered and hopeless which resulted in a break up with an 11-year relationship with his girlfriend).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds this case is analogous to the above referenced cases with respect to the nature, severity, and duration of the harm. After considering the nature of the agency's action, in conjunction with complainant's testimony, we find that $75,000.00 is an appropriate amount of non-pecuniary compensatory damages to be awarded.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $12,000 by the administrative judge was increased to $75,000 on appeal where the complainant was subjected to months of constant humiliation, felt unwanted and rejected, required medication for elevated blood pressure, had trouble sleeping, and received psychiatric counseling. In <span class="Italic">Regist v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120093445 (2010), the Commission also found that the complainant, an Episcopal priest, was required to work in an extremely small office with no windows or ventilation four about two months, and was publically humiliated when he was ordered to remove his shirt and collar. The Commission also found that the RMO had damaged the complainant's professional reputation in communications with the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a series of consolidated cases, the Commission increased awards of $60,000 to $75,000 in damages to several female complainants who suffered severe harassment from a male coworker. In <span class="Italic">Leggett et al. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720120019 (2012), the Commission made the following $75,000 awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Gail Brunjes</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ awarded Complainant Brunjes $60,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages from the harm she suffered as a result of the male coworker's harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the male coworker's harassment of the Complainants began in approximately 2004. AJ's June 24, 2011 Decision at 2. Further, the AJ noted that the Postmaster stated that he first received complaints about the male coworker from the Complainants in 2003-2004. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant Brunjes testified that she first went to a physician about the stress from the male coworker's harassment in 2005 and was prescribed Wellbutrin. March 21, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 106. The record reflects that because of the coworker's harassment, Complainant began to see a therapist through the Agency's EAP Program in 2007. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 115. In October 2007, the EAP therapist diagnosed Complainant Brunjes as having post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the ongoing harassment at work, March 24, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 8. Further, following the February 4, 2008 incident, the EAP therapist met with all the Complainants as a group and diagnosed each of them, including Complainant Brunjes, with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the workplace harassment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 121-124.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant Brunjes testified that the male coworker's harassment caused her to suffer both emotional and physical symptoms. She stated that the male coworker's harassment caused her to have diarrhea and an upset stomach, and it aggravated her diabetes because the anxiety caused her sugar levels to go up. March 21, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 111-112. She testified that because of the male coworker's harassment she couldn't sleep, and when she did sleep she would wake up every couple of hours and have nightmares about the Post Office. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 113. She stated <span id="Page_1889"></span>that she would often wake crying. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant Brunjes also stated that she often cried while going to and from work and while she was at work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 109. Complainant Brunjes testified that she was scared that the male coworker would act violently towards her and she was afraid to go into the Post Office alone. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 119.

<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, including evidence not specifically mentioned herein, we find an award of $75,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Attorney General</span>, 0120101054 (2012), the Commission increased an agency award of $25,000 in damages to $75,000 where the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment based on sex for a period of one year. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Diaz</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;Evidence of Emotional Harm</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant, H1, C1, and C2 provided detailed testimony regarding how the harassment affected Complainant's life in 2005 and 2006. Moreover, Complainant provided additional testimony about how the harassment has continued to affect her through 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant found her workplace treatment to be "totally debilitating." For example, Complainant testified:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I felt ashamed and humiliated by his words. My entire being felt oppressed...I would go home and still think about the horrible situation I was in. While at home, my mind kept replaying my daily nightmare. Afterwards, I would wonder what would await me the next day. I couldn't focus on things that were important to me. I was not myself...I felt offended, disgusted, degraded, confused, and afraid of my workplace...I felt tortured...I was afraid of what the next day would bring."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant had an extreme fear of S1. For example, Complainant testified, "While I was at work, I was terrified of [S1]. The tension and anxiety inside me kept escalating. I did all I could do to do my job and to avoid him at all costs." In addition, Complainant testified that she would try to hide from S1 whenever possible by doing her work in co-workers' offices, hiding behind another supervisor's door when he walked around, and establishing "safe areas" to be in. Further, Complainant testified that she "truly felt in mortal danger" and told H1, "If I end up dead, you know who did it."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant changed the way she presented herself at work because of her depression and loss of self-esteem. For example, Complainant testified that she began wearing clothes that were looser and less colorful. In addition, Complainant testified that she stopped wearing makeup, heels, and doing her hair nicely. Further, Complainant attributed her change in appearance to feeling "vulnerable by the oppressive and sexually suggestive way that [S1] expressed himself in [her] presence."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1's actions affected Complainant's life outside of work. For example, Complainant testified that, in 2005 and 2006, she regularly cried in the car on the way home. In addition, Complainant testified that she "became distant and fearful in all aspects of [her] life," to the point where it created strain on her relationships with H1 and her children. Further, Complainant testified, "I lost interest in everything. I couldn't stop thinking about my work situation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's emotional distress manifested itself in physical ways. For example, Complainant testified that she had regular headaches. In addition, Complainant testified that she felt tension in her body and pain in her back, and that her body "shook around [her] waistline" from the tension and the fear. Further, Complainant testified that, on one occasion, she was so overcome that she became faint and had to go to the nurse at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1891"></span>Complainant continued to experience the residual effects of S1's actions long after the harassment ended. For example, Complainant testified, "[S1] has forever changed the way I feel around men, male colleagues, and supervisors." In addition, Complainant testified that she continues to experience "discomfort and anguish," and her interactions with S1 "have made [her] feel incredibly vulnerable to this day." Complainant testified about two situations in which she had strong negative reactions to being around a male supervisor and a male coworker. In late 2008, Complainant became claustrophobic while sitting in a male supervisor's office, had to immediately excuse herself, and left his office. In late 2009, a male co-worker made an innocuous comment about her appearance and it brought back "the deep and horrible sense of fear, powerlessness, shame, confusion, and revulsion." Finally, Complainant testified that S1 made her feel "extremely frightened" and that, to this day, she still fears that he "might come back to hurt [her] again."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">H1 described the effect on Complainant from the workplace treatment as "devastating" and testified that it affected her relationship with the family. For example, H1 testified that Complainant became frustrated easily and was "an angry person." In addition, H1 testified that Complainant cried on a daily basis and became "very deeply depressed." Further, H1 testified that Complainant was "desperate" in 2005 and 2006. Moreover, H1 testified that Complainant stopped socializing and became distant from everyone she knew. Finally, H1 testified that Complainant had difficulty sleeping, her physical appearance went downhill, and that her relationship with him and the children changed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C1 testified that Complainant was "terribly stressed by the treatment she was receiving." In addition, C1 testified that Complainant had great difficulty going to work and facing S1. Further, C1 testified that Complainant was "becoming very fearful for herself and her family."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C2 testified that Complainant was miserable and felt completely oppressed by the treatment. In addition, C2 testified that Complainant appeared vulnerable, and "her vulnerability increased as management failed to respond to her complaint." Further, C2 testified that Complainant "exhibited increasingly intense feelings of anguish and anxiety."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Amount of Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that, from 2005 to 2006, Complainant experienced anxiety, fear, humiliation, loss of dignity, loss of self-esteem, feelings of shame, depression, a change in her personality, stress, sleeplessness, crying episodes, headaches, body pains, and a change in her relationship with her husband and children. In addition, the record reflects that, after 2006, Complainant continued to experience lingering feelings of fear, vulnerability, and discomfort when interacting with men, male co-workers, and male supervisors. Despite the lack of medical documentation, the record contains detailed testimony from Complainant and corroborating testimony from her husband and co-workers. Moreover, we find that it is reasonable to infer that Complainant would suffer such emotional harm based on the inherently degrading and humiliating nature of S1's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, we find that the Agency's award of $25,000 is insufficient to compensate Complainant for the harm she experienced due to S1's harassment. We find $75,000 to be an appropriate amount as Complainant presented sufficient objective evidence to establish that S1's actions caused her emotional distress for an extended period of time. We note that this amount is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Crear v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50079 (Jan. 26, 2006) ($70,000 awarded in sex-based harassment case where complainant experienced anger, worry, embarrassment, feelings of disrespect and degradation, sleep problems, hair loss, and problems with her husband and children); <span class="Italic">McTier v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30016 (Mar. 2, 2004) ($85,000 awarded where complainant experienced constant sadness, depression, anxiety, distrust of her supervisors, irritability, guilt, frequent crying, feelings of betrayal, and a lack of energy); <span class="Italic">Miles v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A30019 (Feb. 27, 2004) ($75,000 awarded in sexual harassment case where complainant worked in constant fear for more than three months and became angry, depressed, and distant from her husband); <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A30048 (Jan. 22, 2004) ($70,000 awarded where complainant cried frequently for three months and experienced stress, depression, insomnia, headaches, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, increased back pain, and loss of enjoyment of life).</p>
<p class="noindent">A $25,000 damage award by the agency was found inappropriate by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120131110 (2015), where the discrimination resulted in treatment of emotional distress and lasted some five years and the Commission increased the award to $75,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, Complainant provided evidence that she was injured by the Agency's discriminatory action. She provided statements from individuals who knew her before and after she experienced harassment by the Agency. They supported her assertions that she went from a "bubbly" person to one who became depressed. As a result of the discrimination, she had to seek assistance from the Psychologist, Psychiatrist and counselors. Complainant also provided medical documentation from these individuals that show that she has been treated for depression, anxiety, and insomnia related to the harassment she experienced. The documentation also shows that she has been seeing the specialists starting in February 2007 and has continued to seek help for over the next five years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency used an evaluation that was conducted of Complainant by OWCP on January 11, 2008. The evaluation was conducted by a psychiatrist and the Agency relied on his finding that Complainant was in remission. We find that the medical reports by the Psychiatrist and the Psychologist, who have been treating Complainant over time, hold more weight than the OWCP evaluation done at the request of the insurance company and not for treatment purposes. Furthermore, even the OWCP report stated that Complainant "should remain in treatment with her psychiatrist and physiologist, in order to have the necessary support as she returns to the challenging job environment." Therefore, we find that the Agency's reliance on this evaluation solely for purposes of determining Complainant's harm was not appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find an award of $75,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate even if the emotional harm to Complainant only lasted the 16-17 months claimed by the Agency. This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, other contributing factors, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Crear v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50079 (January 26, 2006) ($70,000 awarded in sex-based harassment case where complainant experienced anger, worry, embarrassment, feelings of disrespect and degradation, sleep problems, hair loss, and problems with her husband and children); <span class="Italic">McTier v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30016 (March 2, 2004) ($85,000 awarded where complainant experienced constant sadness, depression, anxiety, distrust of her supervisors, irritability, guilt, frequent crying, feelings of betrayal, and a lack of energy); <span class="Italic">Miles v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30019 (February 27, 2004) ($75,000 awarded in sexual harassment case where complainant worked in constant fear for more than three months and became angry, depressed, and distant from her husband); <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30048 (January 22, 2004) ($70,000 awarded where complainant cried frequently for three months and experienced stress, depression, insomnia, headaches, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, increased back pain, and loss of enjoyment of life).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased a $12,000 award to $75,000, in <span class="Italic">Arica C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019002357 (2020), noting, in part, that the complainant experienced the harassment while out to sea with nowhere to escape:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find the award of $12,000 to be insufficient. Here, the record contains hundreds of pages of medical documentation. The medical documentation lists numerous stressors in Complainant's life, but it is also clear that the reprisal actions of the Agency on December 21 and 22, 2014 have had a clear and lasting impact on Complainant. We note that following a July 15, 2016 medical exam, the psychiatrist wrote the following regarding Complainant's exam:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The captain of the ship responded to circumstance as if she enabled it and possibly encouraged it. Since she was out to in middle of ocean she had nowhere to go, made her experience even more traumatizing. Her perpetual request for relief of this experience, only made matters significantly worse as well as her description of the gross negligence of how the governing authorities handled this situation once notified. Their response and decisions made seemed to cause an imposition on [Complainant] in a dehumanizing way. She has significant symptoms of PTSD, of qualifying level of severe, which include [but] not limited to: nightly nightmares effecting her sleep, hypervigilance and high strung pervasively all the time causing her to easily startle, emotional, foreshortened future, avoidance, reliving experience, distrust of others and environment, impacting her ability to work and relationships with others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant went to the Wheeler's highest ranking official, the Captain, and asserted serious sexual and physical assault allegations. In return, she was involuntarily confined to her room, without access to a toilet, and without initially understanding how long the confinement would last. Furthermore, when she broke her confinement, she was threatened with arrest and removal by the Coast Guard. Complainant provided testimony from herself, her father, and a coworker aboard the Wheeler demonstrating how her demeanor changed, how she became severely depressed, hyper vigilant, paranoid, suicidal, and unable to maintain employment or relationships. Additionally, despite a desire to return to her marine career, she asserted a severe fear of being trapped on a ship again. Considering the unique circumstances of this situation, the egregiousness and severity of the Captain's reprisal actions, we find the $12,000 award to be wholly insufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1892"></span>In determining a more adequate amount, the Commission has taken into consideration the evidence submitted by the Complainant, other evidence in the record directly related to the finding including the duration, severity, and egregious nature of the reprisal; medical documentation showing that Complainant, while severely impacted by the reprisal, also faced other stressors unrelated to the incidents of reprisal; and, relevant case law. Additionally, we considered the circumstances here; that while the reprisal only occurred over two-days, the severity and the egregiousness of the Captain's order to involuntarily confine Complainant following her allegations cannot be taken lightly. Based on the record and the Commission's research, we conclude that an award of $75,000.00 would better compensate Complainant for the harm she suffered as a result of the reprisal. While the duration of the reprisal was short, the egregiousness of the action is particularly troubling and warrants such an award. We do not find this amount to be motivated by passion or prejudice or be "monstrously excessive." <span class="Italic">Ward-Jenkins v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (Mar. 4, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This award is consistent with similar awards approved by the Commission. For example, <span class="Italic">Coffee v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090012 (Mar. 13, 2009) (complainant was awarded $75,000.00 when the AJ determined that the agency's lack of response was egregious. The AJ noted that the complainant was isolated on a temporary duty assignment, living in a hotel room next to the alleged offending co-worker, and away from her family during much of the time giving rise to these discriminatory events, which lasted over the course of three months); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983712 (June 22, 2000) ($75,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where discrimination caused sleeplessness, insomnia, argumentative behavior, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and increased irritability); <span class="Italic">Pendelton v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720090054 (Sept. 21, 2011) (Commission awarded $80,000.00 for emotional distress for a single instance of discrimination--a failure to promote); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120150940 (Apr. 13, 2016) (three complainants each awarded $110,000 for the suffering, fear, and anxiety endured when it was discovered that a high-ranking government official installed hidden cameras in the restrooms. The hidden cameras were in place for approximately a month, and once discovered the agency moved quickly to rectify the situation. Agency supervisor's video voyeurism determined to have long lasting impacts).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that Complainant requested an award based on the stress and anxiety that she endured waiting for the completion of her EEO complaint. But as noted by the Agency, a complainant it not entitled to recover non-pecuniary damages for pain or stress associated with prosecution of an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060050 (Apr. 15, 2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Appleby v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933897 (Mar. 4, 1994)). Therefore, Complainant is not eligible for an increase based on the stress and anxiety she endured awaiting the results of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the Agency had previously paid Complainant $12,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages, Complainant is now entitled to an additional $63,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages. This brings the total compensation to $75,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">A $75,000 award by the administrative judge was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120120012 (2015), where the complainant was the victim of sexual harassment, but there were several external causes of distress:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next issue before us is whether the AJ properly awarded Complainant $75,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages. Based on the evidence, we agree with the AJ that the amount awarded to Complainant was warranted. While Complainant's treating physician indicated that he believed that the Agency's sexual harassment was the primary factor for Complainant's medical condition, the Agency's physician disagreed noting a long list of life experiences that he believed contributed to Complainant's medical condition. The life events included a nephew committing suicide, two coworkers who committed suicide, her brother being transferred to her work location as an inmate, an inmate assault, an altercation with another female employee, her husband losing his job, and the family home going up for sale to avoid the possibility of foreclosure. Based on this evidence, the AJ found that the discrimination Complainant was subjected to was one of several factors that caused the harm she experienced.</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting the consistency with which the witnesses testified about the effects of the harassment on the complainant, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Roman G. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019005894 (2020), increased a $38,000 award to $75,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant attested that his drinking and smoking increased dramatically because of the sexual harassment. He became more angry, short-tempered, and depressed. Complainant explained that he was verbally abusive to his wife and critical of his son. He was socially distant with friends and family. His pre-existing conditions (PTSD, hyper-vigilance, and hyper-tension) were aggravated by the harassment. For example, Complainant had to always modify his route to work or the grocery store. If he heard a noise at home, he would walk the house, check camera feeds on his phone, and check the security lights. Letters from Complainant's wife, mother, step-mother and uncle reiterated the emotional toll he suffered. They each confirmed his increased smoking and drinking. His step-mother, explained that Complainant changed from "an easy-going, spur of the moment, out and about person, to someone who would rather stay home." Visits to him have to planned in advance, not spontaneous. Once "laid back and carefree," Complainant's wife described his swift mood swings from happy to "upset and agitated."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has already conceded that these witnesses "present a consistent and credible account of emotional distress suffered by Complainant" and establish a nexus between the Agency's conduct and Complainant's harm. After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find an award of $75,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Emmett W. v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120143098 (May 3, 2016) (awarding $80,000 where complainant experienced exacerbated PTSD, depression, sleeplessness, anger, stress, weight loss, familiar strain, and humiliation); <span class="Italic">Mardell B. v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172035 (Oct. 31, 2017) (awarding $70,000 where complainant suffered exacerbated medical conditions, became depressed, suffered emotionally, and experienced physical changes because of the discrimination); <span class="Italic">Crear v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50079 (January 26, 2006) ($70,000 awarded in sex-based harassment case where complainant experienced anger, worry, embarrassment, feelings of disrespect and degradation, sleep problems, hair loss, and problems with her husband and children).</p>
