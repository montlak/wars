<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-87"><span class="space">20.</span> Training, Remedial and Preventive</h4>
<p class="noindent">Education of RMOs is an example of the relief that can be ordered in situations where no specific relief to the individual can be granted within the confines of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Rutt-Hahn v. USPS</span>, 01861619 (1987). Those ordered to take training must participate in good faith. <span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Don F. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 2021005244 (2022) (granting petition for enforcement where RMO took the ordered training by phone and was driving while training; "This is not participating in the EEO training in good faith and makes a mockery of the process.").</p>
<p class="noindent">For instance, in <span class="Italic">Will K. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020000109 (2020), the Commission found that a reference to the complainant's EEO complaint in a letter of counseling constituted <span class="Italic">per se</span> retaliation. Even though the letter of counseling was warranted and the agency's reasons for that letter were legitimized, the Commission ordered training for the agency officials involved:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We remind the Agency that that it has a continuing duty to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity in its policies and practices. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.101 This duty extends to every aspect of agency personnel policy and practice in the employment, development, advancement, and treatment of employees. Agencies are obligated to "ensure that managers and supervisors perform in such a manner as to insure a continuing affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal employment opportunity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date this decision was issued, the Agency is ordered to ensure that M1, M2, and M3 each meet separately with an EEO Officer, HR Specialist, or other Agency official with professional expertise on EEO procedure and EEO rights, for one hour of individualized in-person training and discussion of retaliation under EEO statutes in relation to their role as management officials. The training/discussion must address how the LOC in the instant complaint constituted retaliation <span class="Italic">per se</span>, in violation of Title VII, as well as a plan to avoid retaliation <span class="Italic">per se</span> going forward.</p>
<p class="noindent">The content of the training must be in keeping with the spirit of the order. In <span class="Italic">Rick G. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2019005318 (2020), the Commission ordered the agency to supplement the record with detailed information on the content of the training that was provided to the responsible management officials. On petition for enforcement, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unable to ascertain based on the record before us whether the Agency has complied with provision (4) of OFO's Order, regarding providing training to the responsible management officials (RMOs). Petitioner asserts that the Agency has not complied with provision involving the training of RMOs. Specifically, Petitioner asserts that based on the agendas for the trainings the RMOS received less than eight hours of training based on various breaks that were part of the training. In addition, Petitioner asserts that the brief descriptions of the training do not indicate that the substance of the training was focused on Title VII and nondiscrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that two of the RMOs attended a training entitled "Civil Treatment for Leaders" on July 31, 2019 from 8:30-5:30. We find that this met the "at least 8 hours" requirement as specified in OFO's Order. While the agenda reflects that there were some breaks and a lunch during this training, we find that it is expected that there will be breaks offered during a training course and that the breaks in this matter were reasonable. However, we are unable to determine whether the Civil Treatment for Leaders Training focused on Title VII and nondiscrimination. The agenda for this training is vague with topics such as "What am I supposed to Say" and "What's on your Mind."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that another RMO attended a training on August 28, 2019, from 8:00 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 4:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> We find that this training met the specified time requirement of eight hours which included a reasonable amount of breaks. However, similar to the training referenced above, we are unable to ascertain based on the brief description of the agenda, if the Change Agent Course focused on Title VII and nondiscrimination. Based on the foregoing, we will order the Agency to supplement the record with detailed documentation regarding these training courses in order to determine whether it is in compliance with OFO's Order.</p>
<p class="noindent">Questions arise in terms of who should receive training. Certainly, orders for training of RMOs is appropriate, but the Commission has consistently rejected the notion that training must be limited to the RMOs. In <span class="Italic">Wild v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05A10058 (2001), the agency argued that the Commission lacks the authority to order training for anyone other than those agency officials who have been found to have engaged in discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Wild</span> disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also argues that, assuming the Commission has the authority to require it to conduct training, the Commission should restrict the training to employees who were involved in the discriminatory actions which precipitated the instant complaint. The agency contends that it would be "unjust" to require "innocent" managers and supervisors to undergo training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency misperceives the purpose for which training has been ordered. It is not designed to punish individuals for past discriminatory acts. Rather, it is meant to educate employees concerning the requirements of the law in order to avoid future violations. In appropriate cases the Commission will order training of all employees at a facility, even those having no demonstrated involvement with the prior discriminatory acts<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Horkan v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01976837 (April 6, 2000) (directing training for all employees at facility on agency's anti-harassment policy); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (April 15, 1999) (mandating EEO sensitivity training with emphasis on racial discrimination for "all employees" at facility).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Selene M. v. TVA</span>, 0420170027 (2017), addressed the allowable breadth of an order in terms of who could be ordered to receive training, how long that training should last and the content of the training. The agency in <span class="Italic">Selene M</span>. was found to have harassed and discriminated against the <span id="Page_1781"></span>complainant on the basis of her sex and in reprisal when she was involuntarily transferred from Alabama to Mississippi, subsequently terminated, and permanently banned from employment with the agency. The administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Selene M</span>. ordered, in pertinent part, the following remedial action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;The Agency shall provide training to all of its managers and supervisors, including its EEO, Human Resources (HR), and Legal Departments at all of its facilities on the prohibition of unlawful discrimination on the laws enforced by the EEOC and shall provide training to all its managers and supervisors, Agency-wide, including its EEO, Human Resources, and Legal Departments on the progressive discipline and termination of employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7.&#x2003;The Agency shall take appropriate preventative steps to ensure that no employee is subject to retaliation and to ensure that appropriate steps are taken immediately after Agency management is notified of any such retaliation allegation.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the complainant's petition for enforcement, the agency maintained that it had complied with the order in that it provided EEO training to its managers. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Selene M</span>. noted that the order was far broader than that and that the agency failed to prove full compliance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We ordered the Agency to provide training to all its managers and supervisors, including manager and supervisors within its EEO, Human Resources and Legal Departments, on the prohibition of unlawful discrimination on the laws enforced by the EEOC. We also ordered the Agency to provide training to all its managers and supervisors, as well as EEO, Human Resources, and Legal Department personnel on the progressive discipline and termination of employees. In response to the petition for enforcement, the Agency submitted a brief statement to the Commission in which it reported that it provided online training to 99 percent of 1,447 "required personnel" on the "Prohibition of Discrimination in the Workplace: Principles of Conduct for TVA Managers and Supervisors."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we determine that the Agency has not demonstrated full compliance with the training provisions of our orders. In so finding, we note that our order specified that the training must be given to all Agency managers and supervisors, including managers and supervisors within the EEO, Legal, and Human Resources departments. However, the Agency has not provided documentation that compares the roster of all supervisors/managers with the roster of those who took the class. In fact, the Agency has not provided any information about the supervisory, managerial, or department status of the employees who took the class. The Agency's bare assertion that "required personnel" received training does not demonstrate that specified personnel received the ordered training.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the content and length of the training, in <span class="Italic">Selene M</span>., the Commission similarly found the agency's action inadequate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Agency provides a copy of a three-page document entitled "Prohibition of Discrimination in the Workplace," which presumably was the "training" provided to employees. The document sets forth a general statement of nondiscrimination on protected EEO bases; how to initiate the EEO process; the definition of and examples of harassment; the steps of progressive discipline; and non-disciplinary bases for termination of employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this document is wholly inadequate to comply with our order. Specifically, the document is a mere three pages, which is excessively short and insufficient to provide comprehensive training on EEO laws. Further, the document does not provide tangible examples of workplace conduct that violates EEO laws, beyond a few examples of harassing conduct. Further, the document does not provide instruction about retaliation or reprisal, except for an initial listing of retaliation as one of the protected EEO bases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the document does not provide the type of interactive training that we contemplate when ordering training. We note that EEO training typically contains relevant scenarios and questions that prompt trainees to learn and apply EEO principles in a dynamic manner. Moreover, EEO training ordered by the Commission is usually conducted by in-person EEO professionals for four to eight hours. This brief document simply does not provide adequate information about EEO laws or convey the message that compliance with EEO laws is a high priority for the Agency. As such, we cannot conclude that the Agency has complied with our order to provide EEO training and to take steps to prevent further retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Leos v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40017_r.txt">07A40017</a> (2004), the Commission rejected an agency argument that training should be limited to offenders where the ridicule of deaf employees was pervasive. In <span class="Italic">Leos</span>, the Commission also brushed aside an agency contention that the ordered training would cost $189,000 and encouraged the agency to explore less expensive alternatives:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ ordered the agency to conduct five hours of EEO training, over a four-month period, focusing on the Rehabilitation Act, including an employer's obligation to make reasonable accommodations, and stressing that singling out of a disabled employee, via teasing and ridicule, to include shooting rubber bands at them, is prohibited. The AJ intended the training to be corrective, curative and preventive, and ordered that all employees at complainant's facility, as well as truck and vehicle drivers using the North Dock, be included in the training. We have carefully considered the agency's arguments regarding the cost of such training ($189,000.00), and its argument that the training should only be limited to those responsible for the discrimination and mistreatment of complainant. However, we are persuaded that training for all employees is indicated in this case. Specifically, we find that the AJ visited complainant's facility, and based on her on-site observations, as well as record evidence, including hearing testimony, the AJ concluded that an atmosphere condoning ridicule of deaf employees existed facility-wide. Accordingly, in order to change this work environment, we find that training regarding the rights of the disabled for the entire facility is appropriate, and should include sensitivity training. We additionally find that the agency may use its discretion in determining how it will provide this training, and encourage the use of more cost effective means.</p>
<p class="noindent">A broad remedial training order was also upheld in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720140013 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency challenges the AJ's remedial order that all managers and supervisors at both the Nashville and Chattanooga facilities receive training. The Agency asserts that it is an abuse of discretion for the AJ to order EEO training for managers and supervisors not involved in the discrimination. The Agency maintains that only one supervisor was found to have been responsible for the discrimination. Notwithstanding the Agency's assertions, we find no basis to disturb the AJ's order regarding training. We note that the AJ indicated that the decision to terminate Complainant was ultimately made by the Agency's RN Director for the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, responsible for both the Nashville and Chattanooga facilities. While the Agency asserts that the Chief of Dental Service was entirely responsible for the discrimination, there is no dispute that the Director signed-off on the termination. Therefore, given the fact that one of the responsible management officials was the RN Director for the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, a position of leadership, we cannot find that the AJ erred in issuing the order requiring training for all managers and supervisors at both facilities. <span class="Italic">See Cairo v. Dep't of Justice</span>, Appeal No. 0720100023 (Jan. 13, 2011); <span class="Italic">Burton v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090046 (June 9, 2011). As such, we determine that the AJ's order concerning training was a proper exercise of discretion after hearing the evidence in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did find in that case that the administrative judge exceeded his authority in order the agency to post a notice of violation for 365 days and ordered the notice be posted for 60 days instead. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120122370 (2014) ("We find that this remedy is appropriate as the fact that discriminatory actions were committed by more than one management official suggests that training among management throughout the Tower is indeed warranted.").</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Arteaga v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20086 (2003), the Commission found the administrative judge abused her discretion in ordering training for managers not involved in the discrimination. The Commission noted that "under the circumstances of this case" there was no evidence that any officials outside of the selecting official were involved in the discrimination. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Textor v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720060047 (2008), the Commission found that the administrative judge's training order in a hiring case was too broad where it encompassed all management and supervisory employees involved in making hiring determinations, as well as all personnel and human relations specialists and any other employees involved in making hiring determinations. The Commission found the relevant training order should have been restricted to managers and supervisors involved in making hiring determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="italic">Doyle S. v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 2021003582 (2022), the Commission modified a judge's order requiring the agency to "provide at least forty (40) hours of training on the Rehabilitation Act and the reasonable accommodation process to all Agency employees charged with reviewing, assessing, advising, and granting accommodation requests, which includes but is not limited to managers, Human Resources personnel, Employee and Labor Relations personnel, and attorney-advisors involved in the legal sufficiency review of reasonable accommodation requests." The agency challenged the order as "over-broad," maintaining that only those agency employees involved in the case should be required to attend training. The Commission found a middle ground:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Agency, that the AJ's order is potentially over-broad as it encompasses "all Agency employees who may receive a reasonable accommodation request" (emphasis omitted), including managers and supervisors in any of the Agency's many locations. However, we reject the Agency's contention that the training should be limited to only those individuals specifically involved in the instant case. We find that the highly troubling circumstances of this case indicate a widespread and systemic ignorance of, or indifference to, the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act and the reasonable accommodation process, which <span id="Page_1782"></span>contributed to the egregious nature of the Agency's unlawful actions. The instant record supports the AJ's conclusion that the Agency did not exercise good faith during the interactive process in order to identify an effective accommodation that would have permitted Complainant to return to work. Moreover, we note that the misconduct in this case involves Agency employees from at least three different Agency facilities, and is not limited to Complainant's work facility at Agency Headquarters in Washington, D.C. These employees include: a Human Resources Officer at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), based out of Sterling, Virginia; and the Supervisory Human Resources Specialist (SHRS) in the BSEE Employee and Labor Relations Branch, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Moreover, while the SHRS stated that she coordinated with management and attorneys in the Solicitor's office in responding to Complainant's reasonable accommodation requests, she also testified that she was not familiar at the time with the Agency's Personnel Bulletin 08-09, which lays out the steps for finding a reassignment as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we modify the AJ's order to require the Agency to provide at least forty (40) hours of training on the Rehabilitation Act and the reasonable accommodation process to all Agency employees in any of the Agency's facilities who were involved in any of Complainant's reasonable accommodation requests specifically, as well as all Agency employees within the Office of the Secretary and the Office of the Solicitor at the Agency's Headquarters in Washington, D.C. charged with reviewing, assessing, advising, and granting accommodation requests, regardless of whether they were specifically involved in the instant case. We also order the Agency to provide at least forty (40) hours of training on the Rehabilitation Act and the reasonable accommodation process to all employees in the BSEE Human Resources Division and the Employee and Labor Relations Branch in any Agency facility who process reasonable accommodation requests.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agency-wide training as a remedial measure is only appropriate where a "culture of discrimination" is established. In <span class="italic">Merlin W. v. Secretary of the Navy</span>, 2022000013 (2022), for instance, the Commission ordered "one (1) hour of EEO training for all PSNS&#x0026;IMF supervisors and managers on the Agency's duty to appropriately respond to employees' requests for a religious accommodation" where the agency denied the complainant an accommodation for his <span class="italic">bona fide</span> religious belief against shaving his beard. On reconsideration, the agency argued that the order was too broad:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency, its PSNS&#x0026;IMF has 15,000 employees, including approximately 2,600 supervisors and managers. The Agency further says that PSNS&#x0026;IMF is an industrial facility with workers spread all over the globe at various detachments, including, the detachment in Yokosuka, Japan, where the incidents relevant to this case arose. As such, the Agency argues that it is impossible to train that number of employees within the 90-day time period. The Agency requests that we revise our order, by either limiting training to only the supervisors and managers of its Yokosuka, Japan detachment or extend the time to provide such training.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="italic">Merlin W</span>. agreed and modified its own order:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do find, however, that our previous decision improperly ordered the Agency to conduct EEO training for all its managers and supervisors within PSNS&#x0026;IM. Our previous decision did not specify a reason for issuing the expansive training order. The record reflects that only management within the Agency's Yokosuka, Japan detachment were responsible for the discrimination at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in this case, there is no evidence of a culture of discrimination within the Agency. <span class="italic">See Joey B. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720160023 (Dec. 21, 2016) (ordered EEO training for all employees was overly broad, as there was no evidence of a facility-wide culture of discrimination). Therefore, we modify our order so that only the supervisors and managers within the Agency's Yokosuka, Japan detachment will be provided training.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not surprisingly, the Commission found that the administrative judge's order to provide training to the responsible management officials and all other employees at the facility was too broad in <span class="Italic">Joey B. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720160023 (2017):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ ordered the Agency to implement appropriate preventive measures to ensure that similar unlawful discrimination would be unlikely to recur. As part of that order, the AJ directed the Agency to provide training regarding Title VII to Complainant's Supervisor, the Human Resources Specialist, and "all employees at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis, Indiana." The Commission agrees with the Agency and concludes that the AJ's training remedy is overly broad. There is no evidence in this case of a facility-wide culture of discrimination. The Commission finds that it is sufficient under the circumstances present to require eight hours of training to the management officials in Complainant's chain-of-command and to the Human Resources Specialist regarding the obligations and responsibilities under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the one of the officials determined by the administrative judge to have engaged in discrimination was the facility head, an order that all managers and supervisors at the facility receive two hours of EEO training was not overly broad. In <span class="Italic">Cairo v. Attorney General</span>, 0720100023 (2011), the Commission noted that the warden of the federal correctional institute was one of the offending officials and that the warden "serves in a position that sets the tone for the entire facility." A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Burton v. Attorney General</span>, 0720090046 (2011), where the warden, who was the responsible management official, had retired. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Burton</span>, found that an order to train all management and supervisory staff was not overly broad where "the Warden, who serves in a position that sets the leadership tone for the entire facility" engaged in discrimination and retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0520150377 (2015), the Commission rejected an agency argument that one of the selecting officials should not be required to undergo the ordered training because he was no longer a supervisor, noting "both selecting officials should be required to take the EEO training as long as they continue to be employed by the Agency."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720140011 (2015), the administrative judge ordered the unusual remedy of requiring the agency to provide a copy of the finding of discrimination to former employees who had created the hostile environment. The Commission agreed with the agency that it would be unreasonable to require the agency to determine where its former employees were currently working. It did, however, order that the decision by placed in the personnel files of the offending former officials.</p>
<p class="noindent">Training as relief is not punitive in nature. Rather, it is designed to prevent violations from recurring in the future. Moreover, the scope of the training order can be extremely broad, particularly where the discrimination has been witnessed by others and the agency takes no action to stop it. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wade v. Attorney General</span>, 07A60057 (2006), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We advise the agency that the purpose of such training is not to punish individuals for past discriminatory conduct, but rather, it is mean to educate employees concerning the requirements of the law in order to avoid future violations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency does not specify why the record does not support EEO training as a remedy, we note that the AJ's order is quite broad, to include supervisors, managers, and employees. However, based on our review of the record, we find that the RMO's conduct toward complainant was observed by many witnesses, including supervisors, managers, and co-workers. However, no one took any measures whatsoever to address this situation, which took place frequently, over a period of many months. Moreover, record evidence reflects that the RMO's treatment of complainant was generally well known at this facility, and yet it continued unabated. Therefore, it appears that the staff at this facility may have been unaware that this treatment of complainant by RMO was unlawful under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000e(k) (1978), and constituted sex-based harassment. As such, we find that the AJ properly issued an Order under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501 (a)(2), to require that all personnel at complainant's facility receive pregnancy-based EEO/anti-harassment training.<span class="Italic"> See Horken v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01976837 (April 6, 2000). Finally, while we find that the AJ did not specify the number of hours for this training, we will specify the number of hours in the Order that follows.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission ordered 16 hours of training.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also rejected an agency argument in <span class="Italic">O'Malley v. Attorney General</span>, 0720080013 (2009), that two of the three agency officials ordered to attend training should not be "punished" because they had little to do with the discriminatory acts and were "empathetic to and supportive of Complainant's situation." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">O'Malley</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we address the AJ's Order that the U.S. Marshal for the southern District of Florida and the Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall attend EEO training. The Commission does not consider training to be disciplinary action. Regardless of these particular officials' supposed low level of involvement in the discrimination actions, all agency officials can only benefit from attending EEO training, and it was not an abuse of the AJ's discretion to order training for these individuals. Administrative Judges have broad discretion in the conduct of hearings.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e); Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110) at 7-8 to 7-14 (revised November 9, 1999); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980746 (September 19, 2000). Accordingly, we REVERSE that part of the agency's final order that rejected the AJ's order that these two individuals should attend EEO training.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Young v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A60006 (2006), the Commission held that a training order was overly broad where it required training of all employees at the facility in harassment prevention. The Commission limited the training to the perpetrator and managers at the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one interesting case, the Commission found the complainant was not exempt from the training it ordered after finding that the agency engaged in religious discrimination against him. Between the filing of the complaint and the Commission's order, the complainant had become a supervisor. In <span class="Italic">Harris <span id="Page_1783"></span>v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05A10061 (2001), the Commission found the complainant had to take the training with the other supervisors:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission does not believe that the ordered remedy, that supervisory personnel at the facility receive training in the state of the law on religious discrimination, somehow punishes complainant because he now is a member of the supervisory staff. Pursuant to our regulations, each agency shall maintain a continuing affirmative program to promote equal opportunity and to identify and eliminate discriminatory practices and policies. In support of this program, the agency shall: review, evaluate and control managerial and supervisory performance in such a manner as to insure a continuing affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal opportunity, and provide orientation, training and advice to managers and supervisors to assure their understanding and implementation of the equal employment opportunity policy and program. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614-102(a)(5). (Emphasis added). Hence, as a supervisor, complainant is required to participate in the training attendant to the enforcement of equal opportunity policy. Moreover, having been the recipient of religious discrimination, complainant should be in a position to share the benefit of his experience with his colleagues.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the Commission does lack the authority to order corrective training in the absence of a finding of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Secretary of Army</span>, 07A10065 (2002), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to the issue of whether the Administrative Judge erred in ordering training and discipline. The Administrative Judge held, in pertinent part that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">While the undersigned concludes that complainant has not established discrimination regarding either the issue of his non-selection or the issue of his performance appraisal, I nonetheless conclude that the stereotypical and racially biased comments by [RMO] cannot go unaddressed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency is ordered to take appropriate disciplinary action against [RMO] and provide [her] with proper diversity and sensitivity training. While frequently incidents of this ilk require only diversity/sensitivity training, because of (1) the egregious nature of [RMO's] remarks; (2) her high level and supervisory authority within the agency; (3) the pervasive nature of the conduct; and (4) RMO's clear lack of acknowledgment of her conduct and/or remorse for the same, I conclude that discipline is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have reviewed the record relative to the concerns raised by the Administrative Judge. The Administrative Judge credited testimony which attributed various statements demonstrating discriminatory animus to RMO. We note that these statements were made over time in a variety of different contexts to several different agency personnel. These statements were not made during the selection process itself. RMO was alleged to have stated that: (a) most if not all senior Black civilians in the command were worthless and she wanted to get rid of them all; (b) "the Blacks" kept the Command from doing what it wanted to do; (c) she told non-African American employees that, if they were Black, they would have received promotions; (d) an agency attorney was "that little Jewish guy"; and (f) Blacks are holding the agency hostage, and now is not a good time (to seek promotion) because the N.A.A.C.P. is stirring things up.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commission regulations provide that each agency shall conduct a continuing campaign to eradicate every form of prejudice or discrimination; review, evaluate and control managerial and supervisory performance so as to ensure equal opportunity and provide training to assure their understanding of equal opportunity; and, take appropriate disciplinary action against employees who engage in discriminatory practices. 29 C.F.R. 1614.102(a)(3)-(6). In promulgating this policy, the Commission clearly stated that it could not discipline or order the discipline of employees directly. 52 Fed. Reg. 41920, 41921 (October 30, 1987). Further, the Commission's regulations regarding relief, including training, are applicable when "an agency, or the Commission, finds...that an applicant or employee has been discriminated against..." 29 C.F.R. 1614.501(a). Accordingly, we vacate the Administrative Judge's order only insofar as it ordered the agency to train and discipline RMO because we find that this portion of the Administrative Judge's order exceeded her authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our holding notwithstanding, we remind the agency of its on-going obligations to conduct a continuing campaign to eradicate prejudice and to take appropriate disciplinary action against employees who engage in discriminatory practices. 29 C.F.R. 1614.102(a)(3), (6). Compliance with these regulations, which is not contingent upon a finding of discrimination, could have precluded the Administrative Judge's focus on training and discipline for RMO and rendered this appeal moot.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth above, and after careful consideration of the record, it is the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to AFFIRM the agency's Final Order in so doing, we vacate the Administrative Judge's order to discipline and train RMO.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that one of the offending supervisors transferred to another region does not excuse the agency from compliance with a training order. In <span class="Italic">Duhn v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0420060040 (2008), the Commission ordered the training of four managers. Three of the managers completed the training, but the fourth transferred to another region. The Commission, <span class="Italic">Duhn</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This information tells us that the agency has not fully complied with our order. The order is directed at the FAA, as a whole; it is not directed solely at the FAA's Western Pacific Region. The fact that the Assistant Manager was transferred to Washington, D.C. does not change the fact that he/she remains an FAA employee. As an agency employee, the FAA has "jurisdiction" over the employee, and it has the added obligation to provide the mandated training. In fact, we must highlight that the agency's duty is always, but particularly upon receipt of a finding of discrimination, to take prompt and corrective action against the offending individuals so that discrimination does not recur. It appears from the agency's actions that it merely shuffled a discriminating official from one part of the country to another without effecting any discipline or training aimed at teaching the individual that his/her actions are illegal. To the extent it has not already done so, we instruct the agency to provide the responsible Assistant Manager with training on management's obligations as to employee reports of retaliatory harassment, especially threats made to employees for the purpose of dissuading the employee from pursuing the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC is not confined to order training only directly related to the finding of discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">McFadden v. Attorney General</span>, 0720110034 (2012), the Commission rejected an agency argument that the administrative judge could not order harassment training where the discrimination finding was based on reprisal. The Commission noted that "[t]he evidentiary record demonstrates that, although the sole basis for our finding today is reprisal, there is an indication that the Agency's actions were also racially motivated and indicative of a hostile work environment. The AJ acted within her discretion to require Agency management officials to undergo harassment training in addition to retaliation training."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also expects agencies to order appropriate training based on findings of discrimination in final agency decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Evans v. Attorney General</span>, 0120080335 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">The order of the administrative judge for training does not set the outside limit of what the Commission can order on appeal. In <span class="Italic">Guess v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0520120535 (2013), the Commission rejected the agency's request for reconsideration that argued the Commission erred as a matter of law in increasing the four hours of training ordered by the administrative judge to 32 hours.</p>
