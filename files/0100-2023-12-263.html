<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-249"><span class="space">B.</span> SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Under the November 1999 amendments, the Commission's regulations permit a complainant to amend a formal complaint to include claims arising after counseling that are like or related to the claims raised during counseling. Prior to the amendment the Commission's policy on amending complaints was unclear at best. The complaint can be amended even after a hearing has been requested and the complaint has been forwarded to an administrative judge. The regulations of 29 CFR 1614.106(d) provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant may amend a complaint at any time prior to the conclusion of the investigation to include issues or claims like or related to those raised in the complaint. After requesting a hearing, a complainant may file a motion with the administrative judge to amend a complaint to include issues or claims like or related to those raised in the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of 1614.106(d) is to prevent the so-called fragmentation of claims. Fragmentation is discussed above under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-12-006.html#sec3-7">Avoiding Fragmentation</a>." Under the previous regulations, fragmentation often occurred because complainants would file new complaints over related events that occurred subsequent to the oriGINAl complaint. The result would be multiple and duplicative agency investigations and hearings.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complaint is amended to include a like or related claim, no additional counseling is required. A claim is like or related to the initial complaint if it adds to or clarifies it, or could reasonably be expected to grow out of the initial complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scher v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940702 (1995). A common example occurs when a personnel action taken after the filing of the initial complaint results in a complaint of retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant seeking to amend a complaint should be instructed by the investigator or the agency's EEO office to "submit a letter to the agency's EEO Director or Complaints Manager (or a designee) describing the new incident(s) and stating that s/he wishes to amend his/her complaint to include the new incident(s)." MD-110 at 5-9 to 5-10. The agency's EEO office will review the allegation to determine whether it is like or related to the existing complaint, or whether it forms the basis of a new complaint. The agency must acknowledge the amendment in writing and inform the complainant of the date on which the amendment was filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.106 (e). If the agency determines that the proposed amendment is in fact a separate and new complaint, the agency should refer the complainant to an EEO counselor. The new complaint, once formal, should be consolidated with any pending complaints for processing, as discussed in the following section.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the 1999 amendments to Part 1614, the general rule was that a new complaint should be filed. The complainant was required to initiate the new complaint by contacting a counselor within 45 days of the incident or personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even before the 1999 amendments, however, the Commission would permit the amendment of complaints to include a personnel action not encompassed by the oriGINAl complaint when the new personnel action "grow[s] out of the oriGINAl charge of discrimination." <span class="Italic">In re USPS</span>, 05870417 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc.</span>, 431 F.2d 455 (5th Cir. 1970) (employee permitted to amend complaint over his assignment to night shift to include removal based on his failure to report for work on night shift)). The amendment could be made at any time in the complaint process prior to the decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not every new incident raises a new claim of discrimination. Often, new incidents simply serve as evidence in support of the underlying claim. It is not always easy to determine whether an event subsequent to the filing of a complaint constitutes a new complaint, should be filed as an amendment to the existing complaint, or merely provides additional evidence to the oriGINAl complaint. The Commission, in MD-110 at 5-10 to 5-13, provides some examples to make these distinctions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a complainant raises a new incident of alleged discrimination during the processing of an EEO complaint, it must be determined whether this new incident:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;provides additional evidence offered to support the existing claim, but does not raise a new claim in and of itself;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;raises a new claim that is like or related to the claim(s) raised in the pending complaint; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;raises a new claim that is not like or related to the claim(s) raised in the pending complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to facilitate such a determination, the complainant shall be instructed by the investigator (or any other EEO staff person with whom complainant raises the new incident) to submit a letter to the agency's EEO Director or Complaints Manager (or a designee) describing the new incident(s) and stating that s/he wishes to amend his/her complaint to include the new incident(s). The EEO Director or Complaints Manager shall review this request and determine the correct handling of the amendment in an expeditious manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">New Incident That Is Part of the Existing Claim</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the EEO Director or Complaints Manager concludes that the new incident(s) provides additional evidence offered in support of the claim raised in the pending complaint, but does not raise a new claim in and of <span id="Page_295"></span>itself, then the EEO Director or Complaints Manager should instruct the investigator to include the new incident in the investigation. A copy of this letter should be sent to the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 4</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">During EEO counseling and in her formal complaint, an agency employee has alleged that her co-workers were harassing her because of her gender, and she cites five examples of harassment. During the investigation, she provides an initial affidavit detailing these incidents. Shortly thereafter, the employee contacts the investigator and tells him of several new incidents of gender-based harassment by these same coworkers. In this case, these new incidents are additional evidence offered by complainant in support of her pending claim of discriminatory harassment and the investigator should be instructed to incorporate these new facts into his investigation of the pending claim. In this instance, the investigative period is not extended beyond 180 days, except with the consent of the complainant pursuant to &#x00A7; 1614.108(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">New Incident That Raises a New Claim Like or Related to the Pending Claim</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">While a complaint is pending, a complainant may raise a new incident of alleged discrimination that is not part of the existing claim, but may be part of a new claim that is like or related to the pending claim. In deciding if a subsequent claim is "like or related" to the oriGINAl claim, a determination must be made as to whether the later incident adds to or clarifies the oriGINAl claim, and/or could have reasonably been expected to grow out of the investigation of the oriGINAl claim<span class="Italic">. See Scher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940702 (May 30, 1995); <span class="Italic">Calhoun v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05891068 (March 8, 1990); <span class="Italic">Webber v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01900902 (February 28, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the EEO Director or Complaints Manager concludes that the new incident(s) raises a new claim, but that this new claim is like or related to the claim(s) raised in the pending complaint, the agency must amend the pending complaint to include the new claim. Accordingly, and pursuant to &#x00A7; 1614.106(e), the agency shall acknowledge receipt of an amendment to a complaint in writing and inform the complainant of the date on which the amendment was filed. The EEO Director or Complaints Manager should also send a copy of the letter to the EEO investigator who is investigating the complainant's prior complaint with instructions to include the new incident(s) in the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 5</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">An agency employee files a race discrimination complaint alleging he was not selected for a particular supervisory position, despite his belief that he was the best qualified candidate for the job. During the investigation into his complaint, the complainant is not selected for another supervisory position by the same selecting official. Complainant again asserts he was not selected because of his race. This new claim of a discriminatory nonselection is sufficiently like or related to the oriGINAl nonselection claim that the agency should amend the oriGINAl complaint to include the subsequent nonselection.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 6</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">During the investigation into her claim that the agency is discriminating against her in the terms and conditions of her employment because her supervisor denied her developmental assignments that could lead to upward mobility in the agency, the complainant informs the investigator that her supervisor just issued her a letter of warning for attendance problems. The complainant asserts that the supervisor took this action in retaliation for her complaint about the denial of development assignments. This new claim of retaliation is related to the pending claim because it grew out of the investigation into that claim. The agency should amend the oriGINAl complaint to include this subsequent, but related, claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 7</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">An agency employee files a complaint of discrimination when his request for a hardship transfer is denied. During the investigation into his complaint, the complainant sends a letter to the EEO office stating that he has decided to resign from the agency because of the agency's failure to transfer him and the resulting stress. He further states that he is no longer seeking the transfer as a remedy to his complaint, but asserts he is entitled to a compensatory damages award instead. The EEO office should amend the oriGINAl complaint to include the complainant's new like or related claim of constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">Acknowledgment of an amendment to a complaint must be in writing and must include a notice of right to appeal a dismissal or final action on the amended complaint. 29 CFR 1614.106(e). The notice must also include the time limits for the agency's investigation of the complaint and for the complainant to request a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to constitute an amendment, the new allegation must be like or related to the claim or claims raised in the initial complaint. For example, a new allegation that the complainant has been denied a promotion is not like or related to a pay retention claim. <span class="Italic">Sisteck v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A22620 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a complainant may, as a matter of right, amend a complaint at any time prior to completion of the investigation, if the agency errantly denies the request to amend and the oriGINAl complaint is pending at the hearing stage, the administrative judge retains the discretion to reject the amendment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Haskell v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A22117 (2003), the complainant sought to amend his complaint prior to the completion of the investigation. The agency, however, completed the investigation without addressing the complainant's request to amend the complaint. On appeal, the Commission found the agency should have permitted the amendment of the complaint. But, at that time, the oriGINAl complaint was already before an administrative judge. The Commission remanded the case to the EEOC district office noting "that should the AJ decide that amendment is not appropriate, the agency should continue processing the complaint, or, if appropriate, issue a new decision dismissing [the] complaint..." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission did not explain why the administrative judge should retain the discretion to reject an amendment that should have been allowed as a matter of right.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Broughton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52214 (2006), the Commission, on appeal, remanded an allegation to the agency after finding that the agency had improperly processed the allegation as a amendment and denied the complainant the right to amend his complaint. The Commission found that the allegation was instead just another example of an alleged hostile environment based on retaliation. Because the rest of the complaint was still pending before an administrative judge, the Commission ordered the agency to request the judge to grant an amendment to the complaint, providing the hearing on the remaining complaints was still pending.</p>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that a subsequent action has been taken in retaliation for filing the initial complaint is properly accepted as an amendment because it "could have reasonably been expected to grow out of complainant's oriGINAl complaint." <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120082427 (2008) (agency erred in rejecting as amendment allegation that complainant was verbally counseled in retaliation for filing complaint over nonselection).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency accepts a complaint but later dismisses it for failure to state a claim, subsequent amendments to the complaint made while it is still pending are not subject to counseling. In <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120130446 (2013), the agency initially accepted the complainants claim that it denied payment of travel vouchers on a discriminatory basis. The agency later dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim because the complainant had already challenged the denials through the General Services Administration, a finding that the Commission upheld noting that it was a collateral attack on another proceeding. However, the Commission in Sutton also found that the agency erred in dismissing subsequent amendments to the complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reasoning that the sole issue in the initial complaint (issue 1) was dismissed, the Agency vacated its acceptance of issue 2, and declined to accept issues 3 and 4. It explained that in light of the dismissal of the initial complaint, Complainant must seek EEO counseling on all his claims which were subsequently added by amendment. We disagree. Here, the Agency accepted Complainant's complaint, and prior to its dismissal he properly amended it pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(d). The amendments do not fall away, as the Agency argues, simply because the issue in the oriGINAl complaint was subsequently dismissed, and the amendments were not counseled. The Agency cited two EEOC cases in support of its argument. The first did not involve amendments. The second involved amendment that were not like or related to the complaint, and hence required counseling. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(d). In its FAD, the Agency conceded that issues 2, 3 and 4 were like or related to issue 1.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the Commission found it would have had jurisdiction over the complaint if the complainant had not previously proceeded before GSA.</p>
