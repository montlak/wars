<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-87"><span class="space">G.</span> DIRECT EVIDENCE OF REPRISAL</h3>
<p class="noindent">When there is direct evidence of reprisal on the basis of protected EEO activity, the traditional Title VII analysis is inapplicable. <span class="Italic">See Carson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01871596 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston</span>, 469 U.S. 111, 105 S. Ct. 613 (1985)); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. City of Aliceville</span>, 779 F.2d 631 (11th Cir. 1986). In the <span class="Italic">Carson</span> case, one selecting official condemned the complainant's previous EEO activity as lacking tact and diplomacy and another selecting official had expressed contempt for the EEO process and the complainant's previous participation in the process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Direct evidence of discrimination cannot be overcome merely by introducing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the personnel action. The agency must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">Carson, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Formerly, the EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, 8-II(E)(1) defined direct evidence as:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Direct evidence of a retaliatory motive is any written or verbal statement by a respondent official that s/he undertook the challenged action because the charging party engaged in protected activity. Such evidence also includes a written or oral statement by a respondent official that on its face demonstrates a bias toward the charging party based on his or her protected activity, along with evidence linking that bias to the adverse action. Such a link could be shown if the statement was made by the decision-maker at the time of the adverse action. Direct evidence of retaliation is rare.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example</span>--CP filed a charge against Respondent A, alleging that her supervisor sexually harassed and constructively discharged her. CP subsequently sued A and reached a settlement. When CP applied for a new job with Respondent B, she received a conditional offer subject to a reference check. When B called CP's former supervisor at A Co. for a reference, the supervisor said that CP was a "troublemaker," started a sex harassment lawsuit, and was not anyone B "would want to get mixed up with." B did not hire CP. She suspected that her former supervisor gave her a negative reference and filed retaliation charges against A and B. The EEOC investigator discovered notes memorializing the phone conversation between A and B. These notes are direct evidence of retaliation by A because they prove on their face that A told B about CP's protected activity and that A gave CP a negative reference because of that protected activity. These notes are not direct evidence of retaliation by B because they do not directly prove that B rejected CP because of her protected activity. However, the fact that B gave CP a conditional job offer and then decided not to hire her after learning about her protected activity is strong circumstantial evidence of B's retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted). Although the section has been replaced by new guidance, the definition of direct evidence still applies.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Garay v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A51058 (2006), the Commission found that the complainant had produced direct evidence of retaliation through the statement of a supervisor to the effect that he did not believe he should assign the complainant as an acting floor manager because he had filed a complaint. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Garay</span>, explained the evidentiary burden on the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to claim (2), we note that direct evidence of discriminatory motive may be any written or verbal policy or statement made by a respondent or respondent official that on its face demonstrates a bias against a protected group and is linked to the complained of adverse action. Revised <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory</span>, III(A) (July 14, 1992) (Revised Enforcement Guidance). Where direct evidence of discrimination exists, there is no need to employ the burden-shifting mechanism of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Unless the agency can impeach the evidence or can establish an affirmative defense, liability will be established. Revised Enforcement Guidance, at III(B)(1). We find that based on the record, the statement made by S1 is direct evidence of discriminatory motive that demonstrated a bias against complainant for his protected EEO activities. Although in the hearing, S1 stated that he had no knowledge of complainant's pending EEO complaint, we note that S1 contradicts this in a statement made during the investigation. S1 was asked by the investigator "did knowing [complainant's] EEO protected activity,...did that influence any of your decisions with regards to [claim (2)], sir, in his complaint?" OCI On-Site Fact-Finding Investigation, at 83. S1 responded "at the time this happened, I didn't think that I was suppose to assign him to take the floor because of the complaint." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 84. Therefore, we find that complainant established that S1 knew of his EEO complaint when S1 decided not to assign complainant to the acting supervisor position on May 31, and June 1, 2001. In addition, we note that the statement is sufficiently linked to having a chilling effect on protected EEO activity because S1, although mistaken, stated that he did not assign complainant to the acting supervisor position on the days at issue because of his EEO complaint. As such, we find that the agency did not impeach or establish an affirmative defense for S1's statement and therefore, we find that the agency's retaliated against complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Wardle v. National Science Foundation</span>, 07A50004 (2006), the Commission found direct evidence of discrimination where the complainant was not selected for an acting director position and her complaint activity was one of the reasons she was not selected. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Wardle</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that the selecting official told her that he did not select her because of her lawsuits against the agency directly referring to her EEO complaints. The selecting official stated that he told complainant that one reason he did not select her was because she was uncomfortable working with some people because of her complaints of harassment. Direct evidence is an action or statement of an employer which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude, and which correlates to the challenged act. <span class="Italic">See Caban-Wheeler v. Elsea</span>, 904 F.2d 1549, 1555 (11th Cir. 1990) Once the trier of fact has accepted the direct evidence, liability is established. EEOC Policy Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, No. 915.002, July 14, 1992, Section III. The AJ found the complainant's testimony credible with respect to the statement made by the selecting official. The selecting official conceded that part of the reason complainant was not selected was her discomfort with working with certain people as a result of her harassment complaint. Absent her complaints of harassment, complainant would have been selected for the Acting Director position. That causal relationship is precisely what is prohibited by Section 704(a) of Title VII, which prohibits taking adverse employment actions against an individual "because" of opposition to discrimination or participation in the EEO process. The agency contention that the selecting official's statement did not show retaliatory bias is simply incorrect. The selecting official's explanation to complainant that it would be difficult for her to work for senior officials appears also to refer to complainant's EEO activity. Here, we find the AJ's findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record, and we find that he correctly found that complainant established that she had been retaliated against for her EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120122475 (2014) (agency's decision to hold off an performance award pending resolution of EEO complaint was direct evidence of retaliation); <span class="Italic">Muvaney v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120071617 (2008) (plant manager's statement indicating he would not take action on complainant's request for a transfer pending outcome of EEO litigation was direct evidence of retaliation).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mannon v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070074 (2012), the Commission found direct evidence of retaliation linking a request for accommodation to the complainant's termination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Direct evidence of a retaliatory motive is any written or verbal statement by a respondent official that he or she undertook the challenged action because the charging party engaged in protected activity. EEOC <span id="Page_1541"></span>Compliance Manual Section 8: Retaliation, No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998), at 8-17. We find that the record contains direct evidence of the Agency's retaliatory motive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports the AJ's finding that Complainant requested a reasonable accommodation. A reasonable accommodation may consist of modifications or adjustments to the work environment or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held is customarily performed that enables a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(ii). Complainant may use "plain English" and need not mention the Rehabilitation Act or use the phrase "reasonable accommodation" when requesting a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Notice No. 915.002, Q. 1 (rev. Oct. 17, 2002). Accordingly, although Complainant did not explicitly state that she was seeking a reasonable accommodation, we find that her request for a Casual Clerk position was a reasonable accommodation request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's proffered reason for terminating and providing Complainant with a negative evaluation demonstrates a bias against Complainant's actions of requesting a reasonable accommodation. The record reveals that on April 13, 2005, Complainant discussed her injury and her medical needs with SM. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant also informed SM about her discussions with HRO to reassign her to a Casual Clerk position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 48-49, 196. On April 13, 2005, SM also discussed Complainant's possible resignation and reassignment with a Customer Service Support Supervisor (CSSS). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 198. The CSSS instructed SM to write an evaluation of Complainant because SM expressed reservations regarding Complainant's performance to CSSS. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. SM wrote an evaluation rating Complainant's work performance as "unacceptable" in all areas. Additionally, SM commented that "[e]mployee did not complete assigned duties [April 12, 2005]. Called [April 13, 2005] to say she was not coming into work and was resigning. I asked her to come in and resign properly. She refused." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 204. SM also indicated that she did not recommend that Complainant be rehired. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the hearing, SM testified that she terminated Complainant because "if she is not productive for me, there is no indication for me to believe that she is going to be productive for somebody else. If she would have come in to discuss it with me, it might have been an option...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 213. We find that the SM's statement clearly shows animus towards Complainant's choice to resign through the HRO and be reassigned, rather than resign with SM. SM further testified that Complainant was under no obligation to come in and resign with her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, due to Complainant's insistence to resign with the HRO, SM terminated Complainant, as established by her statement that "[i]f she would have come in to discuss it with me, it might have been an option..." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, we find that the Agency clearly engaged in adverse treatment that is reasonably likely to deter individuals from engaging in protected activity when SM terminated Complainant and gave her a poor evaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the Agency failed to put forth sufficient evidence to impeach Complainant's evidence or present an affirmative defense. Although SM testified that Complainant's work and attendance were unsatisfactory, we find that there is no evidence to show that these reasons alone were enough to terminate Complainant and provide her with a negative evaluation. Further, we note that, to the degree that any of these other reasons were true, it would only affect the remedy to which Complainant might be entitled, not whether she established that the Agency subjected her to retaliation. Accordingly, we find that the AJ's determination that the Agency subjected Complainant to retaliation is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120092749 (2012), the Commission also found direct evidence linking the complainant's protected activity to the denial of a request engage in outside work, an email denying her request to work at home, and placement on administrative leave pending a fitness-for-duty examination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Allegation 3: October 2007 Denial of Request to Engage Outside Employment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 stated that she denied Complainant's request for outside employment because Complainant's June 2007 e-mail contained insufficient information, Complainant had not been forthcoming about the extent of her real estate activity, and Complainant was working under restrictions and could not fully perform the duties of her position. Complainant's request for a one-month travel restriction constituted a request for reasonable accommodation, and the agency granted the request when it allowed Complainant to work without travel. Although it was the AMO who initially imposed additional work restrictions on Complainant, it appears that Complainant's psychologist subsequently agreed to the additional restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The denial of Complainant's request to engage in outside employment is an adverse action that is reasonably likely to deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity. S1's reference to Complainant's medical restrictions constitutes direct evidence of retaliatory motivation, and her reliance on the restrictions as a reason for denying Complainant's request constitutes retaliation for protected activity. The Agency may not punish Complainant for requesting or using reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of reprisal when, in October 2007, it denied her request to engage in outside employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual &#x00A7; 8-II.D, E, at 8-11-17; <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation</span> at Question 19.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that, absent the retaliatory motivation, the Agency would have allowed Complainant to submit additional information to support her request. S1 states that Complainant provided insufficient information and was not forthcoming about the extent of her real estate activities. In October 2007, however, S1 told Complainant that she would not approve the request while Complainant was on restrictions. There is no showing that Complainant subsequently had an opportunity to provide additional information or, if necessary, to modify her request. In that respect, we note that S1 apparently gave Comparator 1 an opportunity to provide additional information and to modify his request for outside employment. Compare ROI Ex. 24 (Comparator 1's request to engage in outside employment states that he will sell real estate for a commission) with <span class="Italic">id</span>. Ex. 25 (approval of request states that Comparator 1's primary reason for the request is to sell his own residence). Accordingly, we direct the Agency to provide Complainant with an opportunity to provide additional information concerning her request to engage in outside employment and to consider the request without regard to Complainant's medical restrictions or other EEO activity or protected bases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of reprisal, we need not determine whether the Agency discriminated on the basis of sex or disability when it denied Complainant's request to engage in outside employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Allegation 7: November 15, 2007, E-mail Regarding Working at Home</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a November 15, 2007, e-mail, S1 questioned why Complainant had contacted the AAIC rather than S1 about working from home on November 15-16 and stated that she would not allow Complainant to work from home under her "current working conditions, the restrictions." Complainant used sick leave on November 16, 2007. EEO Counselor's Report at 28-30; ROI Aff. A at 88-90; Agency Prehearing Report Ex. 5q.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The denial of Complainant's request to work at home is an adverse action that is reasonably likely to deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity. S1's reference to Complainant's medical restrictions constitutes direct evidence of retaliatory motivation, and her reliance on the restrictions as a reason for denying Complainant's request constitutes retaliation for protected activity. There is no evidence that Complainant's medical restrictions prevented her from working at home. Accordingly, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of reprisal when it denied her request to work from home on November 16, 2007, and instead required her to take sick leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual &#x00A7; 8-II.D, E, at 8-11-17; <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation</span> at Question 19.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of reprisal, we need not determine whether the Agency discriminated on the basis of sex or disability when it denied her request to work at home on November 16, 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Allegation 9: January 15, 2008, Placement on Administrative Leave</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency placed Complainant on Administrative Leave pending the FFDE request four days after the AMO, having spoken with Complainant's psychiatrist, cleared Complainant to return to full duty. In her attempt to justify the request for the FFDE, S1 expressly noted that Complainant had accused her of harassment. The ACI approved the request based on S1's written statement, a discussion with S1, and her knowledge of S1 as a "concerned manager." After the AMO requested more information, S1 again referred to Complainant's harassment accusation and cited Complainant's EEO complaint as support for her assertion that Complainant had a "distorted picture of what was going on around her at work." The AMO, in concurring with the request, stated that Complainant "held what was viewed as a distorted picture of what was going on around her at work" and "apparently viewed directions that differed from her opinions about how things should be done as harassment." ROI Ex. 11; <span class="Italic">id</span>. Aff. C at 2; Agency Prehearing Report Exs. 1b, 2h.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency ultimately did not send Complainant for the FFDE, it subjected her to an adverse action when it placed Complainant on Administrative Leave pending the FFDE. A reasonable person likely would be deterred from complaining about harassment or filing an EEO Complaint if such complaints resulted in FFDE requests and placement on Administrative Leave. S1's explicit references to Complainant's harassment allegation and EEO complaint, and the AMO's casual acceptance of those references as evidence of Complainant's allegedly "distorted view" of her work environment, constitute direct evidence of retaliatory motivation. The Agency's reliance on Complainant's allegations and EEO complaint <span id="Page_1542"></span>as reasons to place Complainant on Administrative Leave pending the FFDE constitutes reprisal for protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has a continuing duty to promote the full realization of equal opportunity in the employment, advancement, and treatment of employees. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10040 (Jan. 13, 2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Crespo v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05920842 (Sept. 17, 1993)). S1, the ACI, and the AMO treated Complainant's harassment allegation and EEO complaint as reasons to question Complainant's fitness for duty. Rather than encourage equal opportunity in the workplace, they punished Complainant for engaging in protected activity. We find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of reprisal when it placed her on Administrative Leave on January 15, 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the Agency discriminated against Complainant on the basis of reprisal, we need not determine whether the Agency discriminated on the basis of sex or disability when it placed Complainant on Administrative Leave.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did, however, find that the agency did not engage in retaliation in issuing a mandatory travel schedule to the complainant in <span class="Italic">Watkins</span> because it presented a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason--complainant spent insufficient time in the Virginia office when scheduling her own travel--and the complainant failed to demonstrate the reason was pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent">In denying the agency's request for reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520120553 (2013), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request for reconsideration, the Agency maintains that the statements identified in our previous decision as direct evidence of retaliatory animus are "merely oblique references to the Complainant's work restrictions and or/EEO claim activity." The Agency further maintains that S1 's actions could not have been reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in protected activity because Complainant continued to engage in EEO activity after Sl's retaliatory actions. Additionally, the Agency maintains that Complainant was not subjected to an adverse action when the Agency denied her request to work from home and denied authorization for outside employment. Finally, the Agency maintains that Complainant was not aggrieved when she was placed on administrative leave because she retained all pay and benefits when she was placed into administrative leave status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that a "request for reconsideration is not a second appeal to the Commission." Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110) (rev. Nov. 9, 1999), at 9-17; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Lopez v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520070736 (Aug. 20, 2007). Rather, a reconsideration request is an opportunity to demonstrate that the previous decision involved a clearly erroneous interpretation of material fact or law; or (2) will have a substantial impact on the policies, practices, or operations of the Agency. The Agency has not done so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that statements identified in our previous decision as direct evidence of retaliatory animus are "merely oblique references to the Complainant's work restrictions and or/EEO claim activity." Contrary to the Agency's assertions, S1 's references to Complainant's EEO activity as a basis for Agency actions were not merely oblique. Instead, S1 directly asserted that Complainant should be denied outside employment, denied her request to work from home, and placed her on administrative leave because of her EEO activity. As such, S1 's statements clearly reflect bias against Complainant and are related to claims 3, 7, and 9. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8: Retaliation, EEOC No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998). Therefore, we conclude that our previous decision properly found that Sl's comments about Complainant's EEO activity constituted direct evidence of retaliatory motive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Agency maintains that placing Complainant on administrative leave, denying her request to work from home, and denying her request for outside employment do not constitute adverse actions or render her aggrieved. The Commission has stated that adverse actions need not qualify as "ultimate employment actions" or materially affect the terms and conditions of employment to constitute retaliation. <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05980410 (Nov. 4, 1999) (citing EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8 (Retaliation) at 8-13, 8-14 (May 20, 1998)). Instead, under the Commission's broad view of reprisal, any adverse treatment that is based upon a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity states a claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Agency further maintains that Sl's actions could not have been reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in protected activity because Complainant continued to engage in EEO activity after S1's retaliatory actions. However, in assessing whether an employer's actions are reasonably likely to deter EEO activity, we must consider the potential impact of an employer's actions on all its employees, even if a particular complaint has not yet been deterred. In this case, we find that our previous decision properly found that the Agency's actions are reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in EEO activity. Therefore, we deny the Agency's request for reconsideration.</p>
