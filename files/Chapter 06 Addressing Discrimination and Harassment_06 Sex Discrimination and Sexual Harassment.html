<h2 class="h2">SEX DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Sex discrimination is probably the type of discrimination that has earned the most attention, inside and outside of government, if only because of the associations we have with its best known manifestation, sexual harassment. The media features high-profile cases, we read about major court decisions, and we could get the impression that sex discrimination and sexual harassment are a normal part of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The truth is very different in most federal workplaces. Federal managers regularly receive training in the prevention of sexual harassment and other forms of sex discrimination. Most managers understand that sex discrimination and sexual harassment are illegal, disruptive to the workplace, and bad for morale and productivity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But we are all human, so sex keeps coming up in the workplace in one way or another, and you are obliged as a manager to make sure there is no place in your unit for discriminatory or inappropriate behavior. This is more than a legal obligation -- it's good management.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sex or gender discrimination can occur any time an employee or applicant is treated less favorably than employees of the opposite gender without a legitimate reason. This could mean being denied an employment opportunity such as a promotion, special training, or management opportunities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Sexual harassment.</b> Sexual harassment occurs when an employee is subjected to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. The employee's response or lack of response to the conduct may be used by a supervisor as a basis for employment decisions. The conduct may also change the conditions of the employee's employment by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment that interferes with the employee's job performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given all the training, social awareness, and illegality of sexual harassment, why does it persist? There could be several reasons, including:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Failure to understand what types of behavior are sexual harassment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The mistaken belief that some people are oversensitive to harmless attempts at humor or friendliness.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reluctance by victims or managers to confront employees engaged in harassing activity out of a fear of provoking antagonism or hostility in the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">It's your job to recognize sexual harassment in whatever form it might take and take immediate and appropriate action to end it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Sex-based harassment.</b> Less common than sexual harassment, sex-based harassment occurs when hostile comments or conduct are directed toward an individual because of that person's gender. Although any gender can be a victim, this type of harassment is typically directed toward older women, sometimes of a particular race, and women who work in a male-dominated environment. For example, male coworkers might call a female employee a "dumb blonde," address an older female employee as "Grandma," or target the lone woman at a worksite with unwelcome pranks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because there are no sexual overtones, it may be more difficult to spot sex-based harassment, particularly in a work environment that normally includes some joking. To further complicate matters, the victims may be reticent about protesting, not wanting to rock the boat.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You can prevent this type of harassment by monitoring workplace conduct and conversations and making sure that any joking or teasing doesn't get out of hand.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Sex discrimination</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Sex discrimination is sometimes called gender discrimination because it is based on whether employees are male or female and does not involve sexual behavior. You may be guilty of sex discrimination if you make employment decisions -- hiring, firing, promoting, training, or assigning -- based on the gender of the employee concerned.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sex discrimination most often occurs because managers and employees operate on deep-rooted feelings about male and female roles. Since these beliefs are ingrained by upbringing and culture, managers usually do not realize they've committed a violation of EEO law until they are shocked by a complaint. By then, it may be too late to limit the damage. It is better to examine our sex-based assumptions, conscious or unconscious, first and adjust our behavior before complaints arise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> One of these assumptions involves sex discrimination itself. We assume that the victims are female employees and the perpetrators are male supervisors. Two things are wrong with this assumption:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Everyone can be discriminated against because of sex, including both women and men, and individuals who have other gender identities.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Although the most instances of sex discrimination involve two parties of different sexes, this is not always the case. Women are perfectly capable of discriminating against women, and men against men.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">The best way to avoid claims of sex discrimination is to make sure your employment actions are based on the merits of the individuals involved. Fair decisions that are supported with careful documentation will help you keep yourself above EEO trouble. However, as we've noted, assumptions and stereotypes sometime have a way of creeping in. Let's discuss some of the most common stumbling blocks to achieving sex-neutral decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Family obligations.</b> Most instances of sex discrimination involve discrimination against women by men -- typically supervisors and selecting managers. Sometimes they involve family obligations. While the federal government has become more aware of the challenges of balancing career and family, supervisors may not always recognize the discrimination issues that can arise from caretaking responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This may come up during interviews of job candidates. Consider these real-life examples from the federal government:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A woman interviewed for the position of fire program clerk. The selecting manager asked her whether her husband would permit her to travel and whether she had or was planning on having any children. The manager asked the man who was eventually selected for the position only if he were available for travel. The manager showed no interest in the woman's fire training experience, and yet cited the selectee's prior fire management experience as making him the best qualified. As a result of her complaint, the woman was eventually offered the position.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The selecting manager questioned a woman candidate about her marital status and children but did not question the man who was selected in the same manner. The manager's explanation that he was just trying to ease tension during the interview was not believed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">These two examples provide some practical guidance. When you interview any candidate, avoid questions about family status and obligations. A general question about willingness to travel or about the acceptability of certain work schedules is perfectly legitimate, if you ask it of all candidates, but probing about family life is definitely out. It inevitably will create an impression of bias. "I was just trying to break the ice" is no excuse.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The denial or misapplication of child- or family-related leave also can create problems if decisions are not based on legitimate, gender-neutral factors. Fathers have as much right to parental leave as mothers. Just be sure you consult with HR before you decide on any family-related leave request. The rules on both sick leave and Family and Medical Leave Act leave can be complex.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also, take special care when handling requests from people who are pregnant, out on leave after childbirth, or nursing children after their return to work. They are specifically protected by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. In particular, be prepared to offer some reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Standards of conduct.</b> Applying sex-based standards of conduct can also invite claims of sex discrimination. Make sure your expectations and discipline are fair. It would be sex discrimination if, for example, you disciplined a female employee for being late to work several times because of child care issues but did not discipline a similarly situated male employee who was late to work several times because of car trouble.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Sex and occupation.</b> Women who are not selected for "traditional male occupations" may believe they have been the victims of gender discrimination. It is important for you to avoid any action or procedure in your selections for hiring or promotion that might lead to that conclusion. This not only avoids complaints but is also a best practice for management. After all, you want to select the best person for the job, not the best man -- and above all, you want all your employees to know that it is their performance that counts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You must clearly justify the selection you make based on merit principles, both for your own reference and for the record. When traditional male occupations are involved, as in law enforcement, firefighting, and certain industrial and crafts jobs, make a special effort to examine position requirements that involve:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Height and weight.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Lifting and other strength criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">These requirements may have the effect of disparate treatment against women. If they are not genuinely needed, they should be eliminated or amended. If they are genuinely needed, they should be justified by clearly linking the requirements to essential job elements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Preselection.</b> Preselection -- acting upon a preconceived idea that a particular individual may be the best candidate for a particular position -- is not by itself prohibited by law. However, if a preselection is tainted by unlawful discriminatory intent (such as sex discrimination), it is prohibited. If you find yourself in a situation where there is potential for a finding of sex or any other form of Title VII discrimination, talk to HR about how to properly proceed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Let's take a look at a real-life situation that illustrates how this can play out. In one case, the EEOC found an agency subjected a manager to discrimination based on race and sex when it did not select her for a supervisory position. The manager showed the selectee, a white male, was preselected for the position. Before the vacancy, another white male held the position. After his retirement, the selectee was noncompetitively detailed into the position and remained in the position after he was selected for the job on a permanent basis. The EEOC explained that evidence of preselection was evidence that the selection process "was a sham" and that the selectee would have been offered the job irrespective of the manager's interview performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The manager also had a greater level of education, experience, and training than the selectee. The EEOC found her qualifications were "vastly" or "plainly" superior.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>'Reverse discrimination.'</b> Historically, some courts have referred to sex discrimination against men as "reverse discrimination." Although ideas about gender roles are changing, men may still face discrimination when they apply for positions in fields that have been traditional female occupations, such as nursing and child care. Again, unsuccessful candidates may raise sex discrimination claims. To avoid this, you need to avoid improper interview questions, such as:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">All the other employees in the unit are women. How do you feel about working in that sort of environment?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It's unusual to see a man applying for a job like this. What led you to choose this field?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Would you have any problem working for a woman?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once again, your best practice is to make your selection based on merit principles, and to be able to show that you've done so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> You can get your agency into EEO trouble if you misunderstand federal diversity goals and hire a woman rather than a man, solely to improve the diversity picture in your unit or agency. Federal diversity programs are designed to increase the opportunities for diverse populations to be hired and to advance -- not to dictate whom you should hire or promote.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Sexual harassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when one of the following is true:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Giving in to it is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Giving in to or rejecting such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Note these key points, which grow out of the EEOC's definition:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Any action of a sexual nature -- whether physical, verbal, or even nonverbal (e.g., gestures and objects) -- may constitute sexual harassment if it is unwelcome.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>And</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">If it amounts to a term or condition of employment (i.e., must be tolerated in order to maintain employment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Or</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is considered in making employment decisions regarding an employee (e.g., promotions, performance ratings or assignments).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Or</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">It creates an intolerable, hostile work environment that negatively impacts an employee's performance or ability to remain employed in that workplace.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Types of sexual harassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">There are two primary types of sexual harassment:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Tangible employment action (formerly quid pro quo) harassment.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Hostile environment harassment.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Tangible employment action (formerly quid pro quo) harassment.</b> Tangible employment action -- once called quid pro quo harassment -- is the easiest to recognize. It occurs when sexual harassment culminates in a significant change in employment status. The "tangible employment action" might impact, for example, a performance evaluation, assignment, or promotion decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The perpetrators of this type of harassment are always supervisors because they are the individuals empowered to make adverse employment decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Precisely because tangible employment action harassment fits a pattern most people recognize -- and know is illegal -- it actually has become less common in recent years than the second type of sexual harassment -- hostile environment harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Hostile environment harassment.</b> Hostile environment harassment can be more difficult for employees and managers to recognize than tangible employment action harassment, and this makes it potentially more dangerous. Every federal manager needs to know what it is and to be prepared to take action to prevent or eliminate it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Hostile environment harassment is usually found where a pattern of workplace behavior exists that is sexually oriented, severe, and pervasive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here's how those descriptive terms have been defined in actual workplace situations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Sexually oriented behavior</b> has been found to include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Letters, telephone calls, magazines, pictures, and objects of a sexual nature or content.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Deliberate touching, brushing, cornering, pinching, or leaning over a person.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Suggestive looks, comments, gestures, or whistles.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Comments on various physical attributes.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Discussion of actual or imagined sexual activities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Crude, gross, or sexually profane language.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Unwelcome pressure for dates or sexual favors.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Sexual jokes, teasing, remarks, and questions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Pervasive behavior</b> is behavior that is widespread, common, or repeated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Severe behavior</b> of a sexual nature is conduct that would be considered objectionable by a "reasonable person" under the circumstances, such as touching of an intimate body part or extremely lewd language.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Putting it all together, an employee may be found to be the victim of hostile environment sexual harassment if subjected to sexually oriented behavior that is either severe or pervasive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Still not sure what you should do about the atmosphere in your unit? Look at it this way: We all know that there are differences between men and women, and nothing about EEO policy prohibits you or your employees from making an appropriate acknowledgement of gender differences. It is sexual behavior that doesn't mix with work. Sexual behavior that may seem harmless enough -- casual joking, mild teasing -- can easily turn aggressive or hostile. Your best bet is to let your employees know the limits of appropriate behavior and to model that behavior yourself.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some of your employees still don't get it? Speak plainly to them: "At work we have gender. We don't have sex."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> Although most complaints of hostile environment harassment involve problems between men and women, the courts and the EEOC have found that same-sex harassment with a sexual content also may be sexual harassment. This means, for example, that if male coworkers email pornography to the computer of a male employee who finds it unwelcome, despite (or because) they know it is unwelcome, and if the supervisor does not respond to the situation with corrective action as soon as it becomes known, the victim may have a valid claim of hostile environment harassment.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Preventing sexual harassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal supervisors and higher managers are specifically charged with the prevention of sexual harassment. They may expect assistance from HR and EEO staffs, particularly when it comes to training, but management is on the front line of prevention. When prevention fails, the agency may be exposed to serious liability, and negative effects on employee morale and productivity also are likely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How can you help prevent sexual harassment? Take a few simple steps:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>1. Make sure the agency's policy on sexual harassment is posted where it will remain highly visible, and explain it to every employee and new hire under your direction.</b> Every agency can formulate its own policy and complaint procedure. Make sure your employees understand all its elements. According to the EEOC, every policy should contain, at a minimum:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A clear explanation of what constitutes prohibited conduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Assurance that employees who make complaints of harassment or provide information related to such complaints will be protected against retaliation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A clearly described complaint process that provides accessible avenues of complaint.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Assurance that the employer will protect the confidentiality of harassment complaints to the extent possible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A complaint process that provides a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Assurance that the employer will take immediate and appropriate corrective action when it determines that harassment has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>2. Watch for warning signs of sexual harassment:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The display of sexually oriented pictures, objects, or written materials.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Frequent jokes of a sexual nature.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Open use of sexual innuendo or pressure for dates.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Routine occurrence of sexually oriented profanity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>3. Respond promptly to complaints of sexual harassment.</b> Conduct -- or ask for -- a thorough investigation. Take prompt corrective action, when appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>4. Clearly inform those who engage in inappropriate sexually oriented behavior that you find it objectionable.</b> Let them know you will not tolerate it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>5. Seek assistance promptly.</b> Look for help if you are the target of sexual harassment, or if you observe severe or repeated instances of behavior that you believe qualify as sexual harassment. Encourage your staff to do the same.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>6. Provide refresher training, briefings, or reminders periodically.</b> Regularly remind all employees of the agency's policy on sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of course, these tactics won't always work. When it comes to sexual behavior, some folks will just not get it, or they will get it and misbehave anyway. But this is no excuse to ignore these tips or give up the struggle. Precisely because a very large number of federal supervisors do all they can to prevent sexual harassment and to correct it promptly when it occurs, many legitimate sex discrimination and sexual harassment questions are settled quickly, without reaching the formal complaint stage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">And because managers have increasingly understood what they need to do to protect their agencies from liability, the overwhelming majority of formal complaints that are filed by employees are unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>7. Don't overreact.</b> Ignoring sexual harassment is one way to get into trouble. Overreacting to charges of sexual harassment is another. Here are two mistakes to watch out for:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> When sexual harassment charges are made and appear to be legitimate, managers may naturally want to move quickly to separate the victim and the alleged perpetrator. Very often, that is what the victim wants. But be careful not to do this in a way that could be construed as a "punishment" of the victim, such as reassignment to a less desirable work location or to lower-level duties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Because of concerns about agency liability and an awareness of the need to act promptly and effectively, managers may move too quickly to discipline or otherwise act against an alleged perpetrator before all the facts are in. Federal employees are always entitled to due process. Alleged perpetrators of sexual harassment have been successful in their own complaints and grievances.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>8. Harassment beyond the federal workforce.</b> Federal employees have the right to be protected from sexual harassment, whatever the source. Most complaints arise because of harassment by coworkers, but these days many workers in federal facilities are contract employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Managers must respond promptly and take corrective action when harassment comes from contract employees, patients, vendors, or members of the public. It also works the other way around. Federal managers and employees have been disciplined for sexual harassment directed against contractors and members of the public.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In addition, managers cannot simply point to the job duties as the basis for allowing the person to be subjected to sexual harassment. Here's an example: Two nurses were awarded over $1.5 million because they were subjected to severe and pervasive sexual harassment by a patient, including sexual assault, verbal requests for sex, vulgar and explicit language, and exposure to bodily fluids due to his sexual acts. Even though they agreed the conduct "was uniquely egregious and flagrant," management told the nurses to continue to care for the patient without providing additional assistance or medical care to stop the sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Continued harassment even to a lesser degree is proof the response is not effective, and therefore, the agency is liable. In this case, the agency placed the patient on emergency medications twice, developed a behavioral plan, called the police, and changed to a male nurse. However, because these actions were not prompt and did not end the harassment, the nurses were subjected to this maltreatment for months throughout his stay. Consequently, the agency was liable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Check with HR and notify contractor management when these issues arise.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Sexual orientation</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Sex discrimination is specifically prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The U.S. Supreme Court and the EEOC have determined that claims of sexual orientation discrimination are claims of sex discrimination that can be raised under Title VII. Sexual orientation discrimination also is prohibited in the federal government by executive order and is recognized as a prohibited personnel practice, in violation of merit principles.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This means managers must not discriminate against a federal employee or applicant for employment in any personnel action because of the individual's sexual orientation. Managers also should be aware that the language describing sexual orientation has evolved over the years and now goes beyond lesbian, gay, and bisexual, which forms the first three letters of the commonly known acronym LGBT. The government now uses the acronym LGBTQI+ to encompass more sexual orientations and gender identities. Therefore, managers may not discriminate against employees or applicants based on them being:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Gay or lesbian.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Bisexual or pansexual.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Asexual.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Queer or another sexual orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Sexual orientation also may be involved in instances of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Actual or perceived sexual orientation can also be the basis for gender discrimination. This can happen when an employee is punished or harassed for dressing or acting in a manner that is perceived as being inappropriate for their gender. For example, a female employee may experience bullying because she has a masculine haircut.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You can safely leave the fine points to your agency's specialists in EEO and employee relations. It is enough to know that any form of discrimination or harassment of federal employees or applicants because of their real or perceived sexual orientation has no place in the federal government. It is your responsibility as a federal manager to model nondiscriminatory behavior, to prevent discrimination when possible, and once you are aware of discriminatory conduct to respond immediately by contacting your HR office for advice on how to proceed.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Gender identity</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Gender identity is the internal sense of one's gender -- being as male, female, both, or neither. A person's gender identity can be different from or the same as the sex assigned at birth. Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from societal expectations of the sex they were assigned at birth. While gender expression refers to outward expression of gender through behavior, clothing, voice, or other characteristics, gender identity is not outwardly visible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a manager, you should not make any assumptions about transgender employees' sexual orientation because transgender people may identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or another sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You also should be aware that the language around gender identity and expression evolves over time. So, some people may use terms more commonly used in the past to describe their gender identity while others may use terms that are more popular now. As a general rule, you should use the term the individual prefers in a respectful and professional manner. Here are some terms used to describe gender identity:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Cisgender, or 'cis,' describes someone whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Transgender, or 'trans,' describes someone whose gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth. A transgender man is someone who was listed as female at birth but identifies as male. A transgender woman is someone who was listed as male at birth but identifies as female.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Nonbinary or genderqueer are terms used by individuals whose gender identity does not fit into a male or female category.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Agender describes people who do not identify as any gender.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">While transgender people do not have to transition to be able to call themselves transgender, individuals may choose to transition genders to align themselves or their bodies with their gender identity. This process is different for each individual but often involves numerous steps and stages. Transitioning can include notifying people of one's gender identity, changing one's name and pronouns, or updating legal documents. Transitioning also can involve medical treatment, such as counseling, hormone therapy, or reassignment/gender confirmation surgery.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regardless of any medical treatment a transgender individual may seek, all transgender employees should be treated with dignity and respect, both during the time they transition and after their transition is complete.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Legal protections.</b> The U.S. Supreme Court and the EEOC have ruled that discrimination against a person based on gender identity is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII. Therefore, transgender individuals are protected from discriminatory treatment under equal employment opportunity law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Guidance.</b> When someone notifies you of their gender identity and/or their intent to transition, you must treat them with dignity and respect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are some best practices you should observe:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Confidentiality and privacy.</b> An employee's transition should be treated with as much sensitivity and confidentiality as any other employee's significant life experiences such as reasonable accommodations, hospitalization, or marital difficulties. Employees often want as little publicity about their transition as possible. They may be concerned about safety and employment issues if other people become aware of the transition. Moreover, if you receive medical information about an employee's transition, you must keep this information confidential and store it separately from the employee's personnel files. Managers and supervisors should be sensitive to privacy concerns and advise employees not to spread information through gossip or rumor concerning the employee. Questions regarding the employee should be referred to the employee. However, an agency may, if appropriate, have a trainer or presenter answer general questions regarding gender identity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Dress and appearance.</b> During transition, an individual shifts from living and working as one gender to another. This transition includes dressing in the clothes generally associated with the target gender. Once an employee has informed management of the transitioning, the employee may begin wearing the clothes associated with the gender to which the person is transitioning. Agency dress codes should be applied to employees who are transitioning in the same way they are applied to employees whose gender identity corresponds to the gender assigned at birth. Dress codes should not be used to prevent a transgender employee from living in the role consistent with their gender identity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Names and pronouns.</b> In all forms of communication, managers, supervisors, and coworkers should use the employee's preferred name and pronouns. For example, people should not refer to a "deadname" -- a no-longer-used name given at birth to a transgender, gender nonconforming, or nonbinary person -- as a "real name" because this can be taken to mean that the chosen true name and corresponding gender identity are not real, but rather fake or false.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Recordkeeping.</b> Consistent with the Privacy Act, the records in the employee's official personnel folder and other employee records should be changed to show the employee's new name and gender, once the employee has begun representing themself consistent with the employee's gender identity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Bathroom facilities.</b> The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines require agencies to make access to adequate bathroom facilities as free as possible. Denying access to a bathroom or locker room that corresponds to the transitioning gender could cause sanitary and health consequences for all employees. While a reasonable temporary compromise may be appropriate in some circumstances, transitioning employees should not be required to have undergone or to provide proof of any particular medical procedure (including gender reassignment surgery) to have access to facilities designated for use by a particular gender. Under no circumstances may an agency require an employee to use facilities that are unsanitary, potentially unsafe, or located at an unreasonable distance from the employee's workstation. Work with HR to ensure the employee has access to appropriate facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">The General Services Administration issued a bulletin making it clear that agencies must allow individuals to use the restroom facilities and related areas consistent with their gender identity because gender identity discrimination -- including transgender status -- is a prohibited form of sex discrimination. Therefore, at any facility under GSA's jurisdiction, custody, or control, the bulletin requires agencies to abide by the following:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An individual's self-identification of gender identity is sufficient to gain access to a specific gender's restroom or other single-sex facilities.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Transgender individuals do not have to be undergoing or have completed any medical procedure to use the facility associated with their gender identity. This means agencies cannot require transgender individuals to show proof of surgery to be treated in accordance with their gender identity or to obtain access to the restroom corresponding with their gender identity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Agencies may not require only transgender individuals to use single-occupancy restrooms, but may make individual-user options available to those who voluntarily want additional privacy. Examples of single-occupancy restrooms include family restrooms or accessible facilities open to all genders.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">These guidelines apply to any individual, not just federal employees, at any facility operated by GSA.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Pregnancy discrimination</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Learning that an employee is pregnant can sometimes lead managers to take inappropriate actions. One manager might feel protective and make work decisions based on heartfelt concern about the well-being of mother and child. Another might be annoyed at the thought of the employee being absent during maternity leave and distracted by a child, and decide that she shouldn't be promoted to a more responsible position. And yet another might deny the employee training, assuming that she will not return to work after her child is born. All of these reactions are based on stereotypes and assumptions that should have no place in employment decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</b> Under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the prohibition against sex discrimination is specifically extended to cover discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The PDA provides that women who are affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions must be treated the same in employment situations as other individuals who are not affected by pregnancy but are similar in their ability to work. Women are also protected from discrimination based on their capacity to become pregnant or their intention to become pregnant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Any sort of policy or practice that excludes qualified applicants or employees from employment or other work-related opportunities based on pregnancy or related conditions alone is usually a violation of the law. This is true even if the exclusion is not for hostile reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Managers generally should not ask pregnancy-related questions because any subsequent unfavorable employment decisions could be used as evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Areas where pregnancy discrimination often surfaces include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Leave.</b> As long as an employee can perform the duties of her job, an agency cannot compel her to take leave simply because she's pregnant.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Forced reassignment.</b> An agency should not reassign a qualified employee based on her pregnancy or pregnancy-related medical restrictions while treating similarly situated employees who are not pregnant more favorably.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Training.</b> A refusal to provide training opportunities to an employee based on her pregnancy is evidence of sex discrimination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Advancement opportunities.</b> An agency should not deny a pregnant employee career advancement or other job opportunities. Concerns about a pregnant employee's ability to perform higher level work or the impact of higher level work on her parenting are evidence of sex discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Although pregnant employees with medical restrictions cannot be treated less favorably than other employees with medical restrictions, an agency may take action based on pregnancy-related medical restrictions if they impact the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of her job and it would take the same action with regard to an individual with medical restrictions who is not pregnant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Harassment.</b> Harassment of an employee on the basis of her pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions such as breastfeeding is unlawful sex discrimination. The EEOC gives the following examples of this type of harassment: unwelcome and offensive jokes or name-calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule, insults, offensive objects or pictures, or interference with work performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In one case, the EEOC found a manager subjected an employee to discriminatory harassment when he expressed the view that women should choose between being law enforcement officers or mothers and when he made degrading and humiliating remarks about the employee in a meeting. In another case, a supervisor harassed an employee by revealing her pregnancy to others and stating that her career was in jeopardy because she had too many children.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Managers should be aware of their own comments and conduct with regard to pregnant employees but must also be aware of any misconduct on the part of other employees. Any offensive comments or actions must be stopped immediately or the agency could be found responsible for unlawful harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Nursing mothers.</b> An employee's status as a nursing mother is considered to be related to pregnancy and childbirth and therefore protected under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The EEOC has stated that because only women lactate, a practice that singles out lactation or breastfeeding for less favorable treatment affects only women and therefore is sex-based on its face. The EEOC noted, for example, that it would be a violation of the law for an employer to permit employees to use break time for personal reasons except to express breast milk.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Disability issues.</b> Although pregnancy itself is not a disability, some pregnant employees and applicants may have medical conditions related to their pregnancies that qualify as disabilities under the law. These individuals are entitled to protections from disability-based discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The EEOC provides the following examples of conditions that might arise during pregnancy that could be disabilities:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pregnancy-related anemia (affecting normal cell growth).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pregnancy-related sciatica (affecting musculoskeletal function).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pregnancy-related carpal tunnel syndrome (affecting neurological function).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Gestational diabetes (affecting endocrine function).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Nausea that can cause severe dehydration (affecting digestive or genitourinary function).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Abnormal heart rhythms that may require treatment (affecting cardiovascular function).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Swelling, especially in the legs, due to limited circulation (affecting circulatory function).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Depression (affecting brain function).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Women with pregnancy-related disabilities could be entitled to reasonable accommodation. An employer may only deny a reasonable accommodation to an employee with a disability if it would result in an undue hardship. An undue hardship is defined as an action requiring significant difficulty or expense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers with disabilities might include more frequent breaks, changing how a job is done, providing a temporary light-duty assignment, approving a more flexible schedule that allows for a later start time, or granting leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The following examples are taken from actual cases that appeared before the EEOC:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The female complainant's female supervisor subjected her to a discriminatory hostile work environment when she engaged in unwelcome verbal and physical sex-based conduct. In part, she made remarks about the complainant wearing bikinis and lace underwear and pushed her. The EEOC found the supervisor's conduct constituted "unusually severe conduct," emphasizing the public nature of the complainant's humiliation in front of coworkers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The EEOC found that the U.S. Postal Service improperly dismissed a claim by a male complainant that he was harassed after announcing his marriage to another man in a local newspaper. It held that the claim was based, at least in part, on the complainant's failure to adhere to a traditional male stereotype -- i.e., that men should marry women -- and as such came within the ambit of Title VII.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The complainant, a transgender woman who had transitioned to living as a woman while working for the Army, was subjected to sex-based harassment and disparate treatment when she was not allowed to use the women's restroom and when a supervisor repeatedly referred to her by her previous male name and used male pronouns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Caregiver discrimination</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the policies and procedures aimed at helping employees balance their work and personal lives, they sometimes experience problems at work that are related to their family relationships or responsibilities. These problems don't always have EEO implications, but issues can arise that fall within federal antidiscrimination laws.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The fact that an employee is a caregiver for a family member doesn't give them protected status. It is stereotyping or other forms of disparate treatment based on the established EEO protected categories that may occur in a caregiver situation that would violate antidiscrimination laws.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an employee needs time off or other workplace flexibility for caregiving responsibilities, make sure you don't act upon stereotypes -- consciously or unconsciously -- about their protected category. You also need to avoid treating individuals in one protected group (or intersectional group) more or less favorably than people in another group when it comes to handling requests regarding caregiving responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>When does caregiver discrimination violate EEO laws?</b> Treating caregivers less favorably than other employees or applicants violates federal employment discrimination laws when it is based on:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An applicant's or employee's sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, or gender identity), race, color, religion, national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information (such as family medical history).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An applicant's or employee's association with an individual with a disability, or on the race, ethnicity, or other protected characteristic of the individual for whom care is provided.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Intersections among these characteristics (for example, discrimination against Black female caregivers based on racial and gender stereotypes, or discrimination against Christian female caregivers based on religious and gender stereotypes).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Examples of caregiver discrimination.</b> To learn how to recognize potential caregiver discrimination, it's helpful to review examples of when EEO laws would be violated. The EEOC has issued guidance that provides scenarios in which antidiscrimination laws would be violated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Sex discrimination against females.</b> An agency may not decline to assign female caregivers demanding or high-profile projects that increase employees' advancement potential but require overtime or travel, or reassign such projects from female caregivers, based on assumptions that such actions will make it easier for female employees to juggle work and personal obligations, or based on the belief that female caregivers cannot or would prefer not to work extra hours or be away from their families if a family member is infected with or exposed to COVID-19. It's unlawful for employment decisions to be based on gender stereotypes, even if those decisions are well-intentioned.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Sex discrimination against males.</b> An agency may not deny men leave or permission to work a flexible schedule to care for a family member with COVID-19 or to handle other pandemic-related caregiving duties if such requests have been granted when made by similarly situated women. Agencies may not discriminate against male caregivers based on their gender or based on gender stereotypes of men as breadwinners and women as caretakers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Sex discrimination against LGBTQI+.</b> Agencies may not impose more burdensome procedures on LGBTQI+ employees who make caregiver-related requests, such as requiring proof of a marital or other family relationship with the individual needing care, if such requirements are not imposed on other employees who make such requests. Agencies also may not deny caregiving leave to an employee with a same-sex partner based on the sexual orientation or gender identity of the employee or the employee's partner.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Disability discrimination.</b> An agency may not refuse an employee's request for unpaid leave to care for a parent with long COVID that is a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Rehabilitation Act, while approving other employees' requests for unpaid leave to handle other personal responsibilities. This would violate the Rehabilitation Act. Depending on the circumstances, it also may violate the Family and Medical Leave Act.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Disability discrimination.</b> It would be unlawful for an agency to refuse to promote an employee who is the primary caregiver of a child with a mental health disability that worsened during the pandemic, based on an assumption that the employee would not be fully available to colleagues and clients, or committed to the job, because of the employee's caregiving obligations for the child.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Age discrimination.</b> If an older worker is caring for a grandchild while the child's parent recovers from COVID-19, it would be unlawful for an agency to require the worker to accept a reduced schedule out of concern that, because of the worker's age, the worker lacks the stamina to perform full-time job duties effectively while also caring for a young child. Employment decisions may not be based on assumptions that older workers with caregiving responsibilities need special treatment, or unilaterally impose different terms and conditions of employment on older workers with caregiving responsibilities, based on age or age-related stereotypes about older workers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Race or national origin discrimination.</b> It would be unlawful to require that Black or Asian employees submit requests for leave, flexible schedules, or telework in writing and wait several days for a response, while permitting similarly situated employees of other races or national origins to make such requests verbally and receive responses immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Accommodations for caregiving responsibilities.</b> Generally, EEO laws do not provide employees with a right to reasonable accommodations such as telework, flexible schedules, or reduced travel or overtime to handle caregiving duties. However, employees who are unable to perform their job duties because of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions must be treated the same as other employees who are temporarily unable to perform job duties. Review the Pregnancy discrimination section for more information.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Note, however, that employees with caregiving responsibilities may have rights under other laws, such as the right to leave for covered caregiving purposes under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Federal employees also may use sick leave to care for an ill or injured family member. Agencies have the discretion to provide accommodations for caregiving responsibilities, as long as they do so in a nondiscriminatory manner.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are the most common mistakes supervisors and managers make in dealing with sex discrimination and sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fall into a pattern of gender discrimination</b> because of assumptions you may make about gender roles in the workforce and in meeting family obligations.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to train</b> all employees in how to recognize and prevent sexual harassment. Supervisors need particular training on gender discrimination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Assume that because some employees do not complain</b> about sexually oriented behavior, others will not find it objectionable.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to object</b> to sexually harassing behavior when it is observed or experienced.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to report incidents</b> of sexual harassment in hopes that they will end without intervention.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Penalize an alleged victim</b> in some way, e.g., with a transfer to a lower-level job in another building in order to keep the parties separated.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore warning signs</b> of sexual harassment in your organization.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore complaints</b> of sexual harassment because you believe the individuals involved have a romantic relationship.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Assume that because individuals are the same gender,</b> sexual harassment cannot take place.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Ignore sexual orientation discrimination</b> in the mistaken belief that it is not prohibited.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to respond to complaints</b> of sexual harassment with a prompt and thorough investigation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Assume an individual accused of sexual harassment is culpable</b> before obtaining all the relevant facts.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to take prompt, effective, corrective action</b> where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are job qualifications such as height, weight, and lifting requirements legitimate, even if they result in the disparate treatment of women by encouraging the hiring of men?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes, they are legitimate, if there is a demonstrated need for the requirements. However, if the connection between job qualifications and the essential elements of the job description is not clear, or if the connection to mission requirements is dubious, a charge of sex discrimination stands a good chance of success.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. In my facility, a position is open with a core function of strip searching female inmates. The position requires a female, but I'm concerned that a male applicant can file a successful sex discrimination complaint if he's not selected for the position.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> An agency will not engage in discrimination based on sex when sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for a position. In the example given, if agency policy requires that a strip search be routinely performed by employees of the same sex as the inmate, then the sex of the applicants must be considered. Hiring a female for a position with the core responsibility of strip searching females is not discriminatory based on sex because sex is a legitimate factor in the selection decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are questions about family obligations ever appropriate in a job interview?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. You may ask if there is anything that would prevent the candidate from meeting particular shift or travel requirements, but make sure you keep it general, and ask the question of all candidates you interview.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I do anything if a contract employee working at our site makes inappropriate remarks or otherwise harasses employees?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Federal employees are protected from sexual harassment on the job, regardless of whether the persons causing the harassment are federal employees. Notify the HR office and the contractor's supervisor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Would it be accurate to say that it's never a good idea to express a sexual or social interest in a coworker?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. Remember, the EEOC guidelines define sexual harassment as involving "unwelcome" activity. Asking a coworker for a date, for example, isn't harassment unless the coworker has made it clear such invitations are unwelcome.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. If the boss is romantically involved with an employee and favors the employee in various personnel decisions, is that sexual harassment?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No, it's not sexual harassment for the most part, according to the courts and the EEOC. But the EEOC has said that it is possible for sexual favoritism to create a discriminatory hostile work environment if the granting of sexual favors in the workplace is so widespread it becomes a typical part of the work environment. Even employees who do not have the objectionable conduct directed at them may be subjected to an "abusive working environment." In any case, even if it's not sexual harassment, if personnel decisions are based on romance rather than merit, the boss is likely to end up in hot water for engaging in prohibited personnel practices and violating agency conduct rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. If I were accused of sexual harassment, what rights would I have?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The same rights you would have in dealing with any other accusation that might arise, including the presumption that you are innocent unless and until facts indicate otherwise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Am I personally liable for harassment that I'm unaware of?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No, although your agency may be held liable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. When may my agency be liable for harassment it is unaware of?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> An agency may be found liable for "tangible employment action" harassment even when it was not aware of it. An agency also may be found liable for "hostile work environment" harassment perpetrated by a supervisor, even if it was unaware of the harassment, unless it can show:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> It exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> The victim unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the agency or otherwise failed to avoid harm.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency can help its case if it can prove it had a stated antiharassment policy with an effective complaint process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What should I do if an employee comes to me with a complaint?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Take it seriously and follow up immediately. If you are not up to speed on your agency's policy on dealing with sexual harassment issues, contact your HR or EEO office for help. And document your actions. If it looks like there is any substance at all to the complaint, or if it seems the employee will proceed regardless, go to HR right away -- and notify higher management.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What should I do if employees resist a transgender employee using the bathroom consistent with the gender to which they are transitioning?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Once an employee begins living full time as the gender that reflects their gender identity, agencies should allow them to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity. Although a temporary compromise may be appropriate, such as designating a gender-neutral bathroom, managers must be firm and sensitive in ensuring the employee is able to use the bathroom that best corresponds with their gender identity.</p>
