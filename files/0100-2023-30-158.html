<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-149"><span class="space">r.</span> $150,001-$200,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120090062 (2010), the Commission increased an agency award of $15,000 in damages to $165,000 even though the complainant submitted no medical evidence to support his claim. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Padilla</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant asserts that he has suffered emotional and physical suffering since his termination. He states that he lost custody of his daughter because of testimony at the custody hearing by Agency officials regarding his termination. He avers that he has not seen his daughter since she and his former wife were granted permission by the court to relocate to New Mexico. Complainant asserts that he has lost friendships, has slept in his car, and frequently did not have any food. Complainant avers that he has suffered mentally because of this ordeal and a psychologist would have helped, but he could not afford medical care and had no medical insurance. Complainant was able to obtain counseling in July 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by Complainant, we find the Agency's award of non-pecuniary, compensatory damages in the amount of $15,000 to be inadequate. Thus, based on the record, the Commission finds that Complainant is entitled to the requested award of $165,000 in light of the emotional distress suffered. This amount takes into account the nature of the discriminator actions and the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">Blount v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (Oct. 21. 2009) ($200,000 awarded where Complainant lost custody of his child, struggled in satisfying child's spousal support obligations, and suffered depression after Agency's discrimination): <span class="Italic">Mack v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (June 23, 2000): <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied</span>, Request No. 05A01058 (Oct. 26, 2000) (Complainant awarded $185,000 where Complainant was depressed, hurt, embarrassed, lost his house and automobiles, and lost custody of his daughter as a result of discrimination). An award of $165,000 meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Cygnar, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed an award of $174,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Maryanne S. v. Attorney General</span>, 0720140028 (2015), finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's award of $174,500 in non-pecuniary damages. We find that the AJ in <span id="Page_1925"></span>a detailed analysis set forth her reason for this amount. Specifically, the AJ stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Management's conduct and the hostile work environment Complainant experienced existed from June 2009 through January 2011, or approximately 18 months however, the effects of this unlawful treatment persist. Complainant asserts that prior to the incidents raised in this complaint, she had neither been diagnosed nor bad experienced depression, insomnia, or anxiety...Complainant was treated [by a named Licensed Practical Counselor (C1)] from February 2009 through July 2009, during which [C1] diagnosed Complainant with depression and anxiety. ...[C1] referred Complainant to a private clinical psychologist (P1)...[P1] affirmed that Complaint experienced high levels of stress and anxiety, which culminated in panic attacks at work and home. In her evaluation of Complainant, [P1] diagnosed Complainant with Anxiety Disorder. [P1] further explained that even with medication, to date, Complainant continues to suffer from symptoms of depression, including poor sleep, poor appetite, fatigue, and has difficulty in making decisions. [Another named Licensed Practical Counselor (G2)] diagnosed Complainant with Generalized Anxiety Disorder...[C21 concluded that Complainant's symptoms were not improving and in fact were becoming worse. As a result, [C2] referred Complainant to a named Psychiatrist, for more intensive therapy and psychotropic medication...Complainant reported that she experienced suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, depression, and anxiety...Complainant was proscribed a more stringent regiment of medication and treatment, and continues to pursue therapy...Complainant further explains that due to the Agency's actions, she lost the camaraderie and friendship of her co-workers...Complainant further testified that reporting to work became miserable and she experienced constant anxiety about possible discipline and/or her job security.</p>

Postmaster General</span>, 0720060029 (2008), where the complainant suffered and exacerbation of his previously existing post-traumatic stress disorder and suffered severe psychological distress over a three year period. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Cahn</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the issue of remedies, we note that the agency has challenged the AJ's award of $175,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The agency argues that the AJ's award is excessive because there was no evidence presented to demonstrate a causal relationship between the injury sustained by complainant and the agency's actions at issue. The agency further argues that the award should be reduced because the requested accommodation was ultimately provided in November 2001, and as such, the duration of any harm was limited. The record shows, however, that the AJ based his award of $175,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages on the testimony of complainant and complainant's co-workers, a written statement from complainant's wife, and the medical documentation of record. The AJ found that the agency's actions exacerbated complainant's PTSD such that complainant suffered significant emotional and psychological injuries over a period of three years. Specifically, complainant suffered insomnia, frequent migraines, a substantial decrease in his ability to concentrate, think, focus, or recall information, extreme stress, and an inability to complete projects or organize. Additionally, the AJ found that the agency's actions forced complainant to become secluded due to his heightened anxiety, which resulted in him becoming separated from his wife.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the AJ's award of $175,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages was not excessive. There is no evidence that the amount is "monstrous" or the result of passion or prejudice. The Commission has awarded comparable amounts in other cases where the discrimination caused depression and other adverse psychological and physical conditions. <span class="Italic">See Tyner v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720060032 (October 23, 2007) ($150,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered from major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, with symptoms that included problems sleeping, problems with appetite, feeling sad and tearful, and problems with self-esteem); <span class="Italic">Furch v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40094 (August 5, 2005) ($150,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered from depression, loss of enjoyment of life, interference with family relationships, permanent diminishment in quality of life, and physical symptoms.); <span class="Italic">Goodridge v. Department of Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720050026 (November 15, 2006) ($150,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered from depression, loss of enjoyment of life, interference with family relationships and physical symptoms); <span class="Italic">Glockner v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> Appeal No. 07A30105 (September 23, 2004) ($200,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and stress which caused her to bite her cheeks so badly that surgery was required.).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="italic">Ashely H. v. National Transportation Safety Board</span>, 2020002145 (2021), increased a $110,000 award to $175,000 where the complainant was subjected to "numerous sexually explicit remarks" by a coworker over the course of six years which exacerbated her PTSD:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of her request, Complainant submitted her own statement, a joint statement from her mother and father, and reports from two health care providers. In her statement, Complainant stated that as a result of the sexual harassment she encountered, she suffers from PTSD, major depression, severe anxiety, migraines, stress related back and neck pain, fatigue, and feelings of low self-worth. She stated that she also suffered from sleep loss, hostility, mistrust, suspicion, resentment and immense fear, pain, embarrassment, and humiliation from having panic attacks which has resulted in her urinating on herself in public. Complainant stated that she has inconvenienced her parents by calling them when she is suicidal and crying while having a nervous breakdown. She does not attend family functions or communicate with family members any more due to the shame she feels. She felt that her federal career and reputation have been negatively impacted due to her PTSD. Before the sexual harassment and the PTSD, she stated that she was mentally stable, but now has been rendered medically unable to perform the duties of her position, which led to her removal. Complainant stated that she became more suicidal after she was terminated and started calling family members asking them who wanted to read her obituary at her funeral. She stated that she was in financial ruin, destitute, and living in a "sober living facility" in California. Complainant noted that due to the sexual harassment she had to uproot her life, move across country, and leave everyone and everything behind.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's parents submitted a joint witness impact statement. They stated that before the sexual harassment Complainant was a happy, loving, and proud daughter, but after the sexual harassment she changed. She was unhappy and cried all the time. When they called her, she would tell them to go away or would not want to speak to them. They stated that she misses family functions because she feels ashamed about the sexual harassment and does not have the close family relationships she once had. They live in Massachusetts, and she lives in Maryland, but sometimes they must leave in the middle of the night and drive to Maryland because she has indicated that she wanted to kill herself. On a few occasions, they had to call the police in Maryland because she had a nervous breakdown, and they could not get her on the phone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">They noted that the years of sexual harassment have caused Complainant to have nervous breakdowns, panic attacks, fainting spells, migraines and high blood pressure. They also noted that Complainant previously enjoyed singing, writing, the park, museums, family activities and cooking, but she no longer does any of these activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted a report from her treating Psychiatrist, D1, from Westwind Recovery located in Los Angeles, California, dated November 11, 2019. He stated that Complainant was admitted for treatment of PTSD and alcohol abuse resulting from sexual harassment at work. He stated that Complainant informed him that the first symptoms of PTSD and alcohol abuse occurred in 2013, and that she continued to struggle with these symptoms for the past six years. He stated that upon admittance, Complainant exhibited hypervigilance, flashbacks and nightmares about her trauma, difficulty sleeping and focusing, panic attacks, isolation and self-destructive behavior. Complainant reported high suicidal ideation because of her continued distress and fear related to her sexual trauma. He opined that Complainant suffered from emotional and psychological injuries that were a direct result of the sexual harassment she experienced while working at the Agency. He felt that Complainant's trauma has had severe consequences on her physical and emotional well-being and that she would need to continue treatment for PTSD for the foreseeable future due to the severity of her symptoms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also submitted copies of the letters forwarded to the Agency in 2014 by B1, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. She initially diagnosed Complainant with major depression and PTSD and opined that it was a direct result of sexual harassment being committed by a coworker. She added that Complainant's symptoms included vomiting, severe headaches, nightmares, anxiety, difficulty focusing, avoidance, not being sociable, and a lack of concentration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on Complainant's statement, the statement of her parents, and the statements of her medical providers, the Agency found that she suffered from PTSD and major depression with additional symptoms including severe headaches, vomiting, nightmares, anxiety, difficulty focusing, hypervigilance, flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance of social situations, suicidal ideation, difficulty sleeping, and panic attacks. Using our decision in EEOC Appeal No. 0120180038 as its benchmark, the Agency found, regarding the duration of the sexual harassment, that it began as early as August 17, 2011, and continued to January 2017, and entailed numerous inappropriate comments, incidents, and emails of a sexual nature. Given the nature and severity of the harm to Complainant and the duration or expected duration of the harm, the Agency concluded that an award of <span id="Page_1926"></span>$110,000 in nonpecuniary, compensatory damages was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence from a health care provider or other expert is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional harm. <span class="italic">See Lawrence v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (Apr. 18, 1996) (citing <span class="italic">Carle v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (Jan. 5, 1993)). Objective evidence of compensatory damages can include statements from Complainant concerning her emotional pain or suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character or reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other non-pecuniary losses that are incurred as a result of the discriminatory conduct. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Statements from others including family members, friends, health care providers, other counselors (including clergy) could address the outward manifestations or physical consequences of emotional distress, including sleeplessness, anxiety, stress, depression, marital strain, humiliation, emotional distress, loss of self-esteem, excessive fatigue, or a nervous breakdown. <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission has long held that a complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a case, can suffice to sustain the burden in recovering compensatory damages for emotional harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The more inherently degrading or humiliating the agency's action is, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action. Therefore, somewhat more conclusory evidence of emotional distress will be acceptable to support an award for emotional damages. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Lawrence v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (Apr. 18, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of nonpecuniary, compensatory damages should reflect the extent to which the Agency's discriminatory action directly or proximately caused the harm, as well as the extent to which other factors also caused the harm. <span class="italic">See Johnson v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961812 (June 18, 1998). It is Complainant's burden to provide objective evidence in support of her claim and proof linking the damages to the alleged discrimination. <span class="italic">Papas v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01930547 (Mar. 17, 1994); <span class="italic">Mims v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933956 (Nov. 23, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency itself found that the harm in this case began as early as 2011, which encompassed a period of six years before she went on OWCP. The Agency did not contest D1's opinion that Complainant would need to continue treatment for PTSD for the foreseeable future due to the severity of her symptoms. Her symptoms included PTSD, major depression, severe headaches, vomiting, nightmares, anxiety, difficulty focusing, hypervigilance, flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance of social situations, suicidal ideation, difficulty sleeping, and panic attacks. Based on the above, we find that an award of $175,000 is warranted in this case. Our award considers the severity of the harm suffered and its duration and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="italic">See Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141161 (Feb. 3, 2015)($150,000 in nonpecuniary damages awarded where due to discriminatory harassment, complainant experienced embarrassment, humiliation, panic attacks, anxiety, withdrawal from coworkers and family, and sleeping problems); <span class="italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120130887 (May 31, 2013) ($175,000 in nonpecuniary damages awarded where discriminatory termination significantly worsened complainant's depressive disorder and caused complainant to experience poor sleep, stress, suicidal thoughts, and have trouble maintaining gainful employment); <span class="italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720100040 (Nov. 23, 2011)($200,000 in nonpecuniary damages awarded where discriminatory conduct led to physical pain (from denial of a reasonable accommodation) and a loss of enjoyment of life that imperiled complainant's marriage and hindered her ability to care for her young child), denial of request for reconsideration, EEOC Request No. 0520120171 (April 24, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Attorney General</span>, 0120102516 (2011), the Commission increased an agency award of $25,000 in damages to $175,000 in damages where the complainant, a senior corrections officer, had a prisoner expose his penis to her several times and ultimately violently sexually assaulted the complainant. The Commission found that the complainant suffered both physical and psychological injuries from the harassment and rejected the agency's argument that the complainant did not establish the harm was ongoing. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lemons</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that Complainant suffered actual physical injuries as a result of the sexual assault. Complainant was diagnosed with a Cervicothoracic Sprain after the attack, which caused her extreme pain in her neck and back and required her to go to therapy and see a chiropractor. Complainant stated that following the attack she was in "excruciating agony" when she tried to perform basic activities, such as walking, driving or laying down. Complainant stated that while her pain is not nearly as bad as it was the first several months after the attack, she still feels pain to this day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also suffered emotional harm from the sexual harassment and the sexual assault. Complainant's psychiatrist diagnosed Complainant with post traumatic stress disorder and major depression. The psychiatrist noted that when she first came to him her condition was "rather severe." The psychiatrist stated that Complainant has depression and severe anxiety to the point where she is unable to go to work as a correctional officer. He stated that the post-traumatic stress has had a severe impact on her life activities on and off the job. Complainant reported to him that she was extremely anxious, hyper, and so sick to her stomach that she vomits. She could not focus and was extremely afraid that something would happen to her. She had difficulty concentrating, low energy, difficulty enjoying things, and tearfulness. She had insomnia and recurrent intrusive thoughts of the sexual assault. Complainant was prescribed medication for her depression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychologist stated in a May 24, 2006 letter that Complainant was experiencing severe difficulties with concentration, sleep, anxiety and depression. The psychologist stated that Complainant was having intrusive thoughts and memories of her sexual assault and has been prescribed medications. He stated that her condition was not likely to improve, even with treatment, for at least a year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the final agency decision, the Agency placed much emphasis on its finding that Complainant did not offer sufficient evidence to establish that she is currently experiencing effects from the sexual harassment, and therefore she only experienced emotional and physical effects from the harassment for a limited time. After a review of the record, we disagree with the Agency and find that Complainant provided sufficient evidence to establish that the effects from the harassment and the sexual assault are ongoing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Documentation provided by Complainant's representative establishes that he submitted to the Agency updated medical documentation from Complainant's psychiatrist dated November 10, 2009. While the Agency makes no mention of this documentation in its April 1, 2010 final decision, the documents show that on Monday, December 14, 2009, Complainant's counsel submitted documentation of Complainant's current medical condition to Agency Counsel via email, and on December 15, 2009, he mailed the updated medical documents to DOJ's Complaints Adjudication Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The medical documentation included Complainant's psychiatrist's notes from a visit with Complainant on November 10, 2009. The notes contained a letter from Complainant's ex-boyfriend and addressed to Complainant's psychiatrist in which he relays to the doctor his concerns for Complainant. The ex-boyfriend told the doctor that Complainant recently ran out of a grocery store for no reason and was breathing hard and shaking. The ex-boyfriend also informed the doctor that Complainant had not left the house in a month, and no longer leaves the house to go to church, the gym, or over to meet her new 6 month old grandson. The ex-boyfriend stated that Complainant's moods go from depressed to hyper, she breaks down crying at a moments notice, and she gets mad at everyone for no reason. The doctor's notes reflect the concerns raised by the ex-boyfriend, and noted that Complainant stated that she cries "over the stupidest things," has low energy, sleeps half the day, gets uncomfortable around other people, does not trust anyone, cannot stay focused, has feelings of hopelessness and paranoia, and she still has dreams of the sexual assault. The doctor noted Complainant has post traumatic stress disorder and agoraphobia (an anxiety panic disorder in which there are repeated attacks of intense fear and anxiety).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the medical documentation, Complainant also submitted a personal statement and statements from her children about her current medical condition. Complainant stated that to this day she is still experiencing flashbacks and nightmares of what happened to her. She stated that she also has panic attacks and experiences feelings of being trapped, breathlessness, and rapid heart beat. Complainant still feels extreme anger inside over what her "supervisors let happen to [her]." Additionally, her husband was unable to deal with all of the problems that resulted from the sexual assault, and the strain on her marriage resulted in a divorce. Complainant also noted that while the physical pain is not as severe as it was a few years ago, she still experiences back pain from the sexual assault.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's youngest son provided a statement dated October 20, 2009, and stated the ongoing harassment and the ultimate sexual assault caused his mother and their family great agony. He stated that his mother changed from a loving, caring, respectful and trusting person into what is now a shell of her former self. The son explained that after the assault his mother became weary of people, lost respect for authority, and had feelings of betrayal, fear, and sadness. He said his mother became desperate and more anxious as the days went by and felt lonely, betrayed, and violated. He said his mother has isolated herself from the world and her family and now leads a meager, pitiful existence. The son stated that because his mother has isolated herself they rarely talk and when they do she rarely says much. The son also stated that because his mother does not leave the house, she has not yet met his 6 month old son.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1927"></span>Complainant's older son provided a statement dated November 2, 2009, and stated that after the sexual harassment and assault his mother was "not the same mother that I grew up to know and love." He stated that he has never seen his mother in such bad shape, that she wakes up every day with no reason to live and is spiritually dead. He stated that his mother has nightmares and flashbacks, and her marriage failed because of her mental and financial instability from the sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find an award of $175,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent.<span class="Italic"> See Glockner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30105 (September 23, 2004) ($200,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where Complainant suffered humiliation, depression, significant fears, her professional reputation was damaged, and she suffered physical effects); <span class="Italic">Looney v. Dep't of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A40124 and 01A53252 (May 19, 2005) ($195,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where Agency's actions caused depression, destruction of spirit and confidence, feelings as if no purpose in life, anxiety, nightmares related to discrimination, and difficulty coping); <span class="Italic">Padilla v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120090062 (Sep. 21, 2010) ($165.000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where a hostile work environment caused the Complainant to have a strain on his relationships, suffered financial instability, and suffered emotional distress); <span class="Italic">Franklin v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A00025 and 01A03882 (Jan. 19, 2001) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where testimony of Complainant and his wife established that he was withdrawn, depressed, embarrassed, humiliated, lost self esteem, and he experienced financial difficulties, emotional distress, personality changes, and severe strain on relationships). Accordingly, we conclude that an award of $175,000 will adequately compensate Complainant for the physical and emotional harm she suffered as a result of the sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01201308877 (2013), the Commission increased an agency award of $30,000 to $175,000 where the complainant's discriminatory termination exacerbated his preexisting depression. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, on January 6, 2011, Complainant's physiatrist noted that Complainant was being treated for major recurrent depressive disorder. Complainant's physiatrist noted that Complainant was seen once in 2005, but had been seen more regularly since 2008. Complainant's physiatrist noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Patient lost his job at the Post Office, resulting in a severe depression, which subsequently contributed to the patient losing his home and becoming homeless with he [sic] and his 2 kids. The patient now is able to afford adequate housing due to his disability. The patient was homeless until November of 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Supplemental Report of Investigation (Supp. ROI), Aff. A, at 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The physiatrist further noted that Complainant expressed frustration over loss of his job, and was finally able to afford some basic housing from his disability check. The physiatrist noted that Complainant complained of poor sleep, stress, and experienced suicidal thoughts of wishing he was dead. The physiatrist noted that Complainant has severe difficulty related to stress as well as attention and concentration issues related to his depression, which has hampered his ability to work and attend college. The physiatrist noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]t is felt that patient's more severe depression resulting in patient's homelessness, inability to work etc. were significantly exacerbated and caused by the situation of unlawful termination at the Post Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The physiatrist also noted that Complainant has been treated with multiple psychiatric medications, and is severely disabled from depression. The physiatrist noted that the termination aggravated and worsened Complainant's depression, and that Complainant "has limited ability to work or participate in life with a tendency to isolate himself." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychologist in a letter dated October 19, 2012, noted that Complainant complained of symptoms of chronic insomnia, difficulty, irritability, anger, and vague suicidal ideations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 12. The psychologist noted that Complainant had been homeless and was a single parent trying to raise two children. The psychologist noted that Complainant's marital status had worsened, and he was on a downward spiral into a deeper depression. The psychologist noted that the "termination appeared to have aggravated and precipitated a significantly worsening in his depression to the moderate to severe range...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The psychologist also noted that Complainant "struggles with his activities of daily living and providing adequate care for his children." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The psychologist found that Complainant has major recurrent depressive disorder that was exacerbated by his termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">See Wallis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (Nov. 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co</span>., 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987)). However, the Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a complainant has a preexisting condition, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. Second, if the complainant's preexisting condition inevitably would have worsened, the agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination; the burden of proof is on the Agency to establish the extent of this entitlement. <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (citing <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, while Complainant suffered from depression prior to his termination, Complainant's physiatrist and psychologist opined that the discrimination he suffered significantly worsened his depressive disorder. As noted above, Complainant, among other things, experienced poor sleep, stress, suicidal thoughts, and had trouble maintaining gainful employment. Complainant had also been prescribed psychiatric medication. We also note that Complainant's physiatrist opinioned that the termination contributed to the Complainant losing his home and becoming homeless with his two children, a thirteen-year-old son and an eight-year old daughter.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case involving two complainants subjected to a hostile work environment, the Commission reduced a $200,000 award for one complainant to $175,000 and affirmed the award of $175,000 to the other complainant. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Meachum and Abbott v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720120003 (2013), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, Complainant M and Complainant A were granted $200,000 and $175,000, respectively, in compensatory damages. On appeal, the Agency argues that the awards are monstrously excessive and impermissibly punitive. It requests that the Commission reduce the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the Agency argues that there was no finding of intentional discrimination so compensatory damages are not appropriate. According to the Agency, although the AJ concluded that Complainants were subjected to a hostile work environment, she "never found intentional discrimination." We find, however, that the Agency's argument is flawed. Here, the AJ found that Supervisor K's reasons were pretexual and that each Complainant was harassed due to her sex and age. This nexus sufficiently establishes intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency contends that Complainants' generalized testimony does not support the AJ's award. The Agency asserts that although Complainant M felt like she was having a heart attack when she was escorted from the building, she did not go to the hospital. The Agency also asserts that while her weekend was awful because she feared she was going to be fired, she was only verbally admonished upon her return to the office. As for her husband's testimony, the Agency contends that their relationship did not deteriorate and "they did not fight all the time." The Agency argues, moreover, that Complainant M's spouse admitted that their marriage was also affected by the deteriorating health of Complainant M's mother. Regarding her reputation, the Agency argues that only Complainant M perceived such harm and that she failed to offer concrete evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that the AJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence. Colleagues testified to witnessing Supervisor K yelling at Complainant M, and subjecting her to a "ridiculous" level of review and scrutiny. Fellow attorneys joked that Complainants were being "babysat" when Supervisor K started attending hearings to observe their oral arguments. Following an exchange with Supervisor K, Complainant M was escorted out of the office by a federal police officer. While Supervisor K claimed Complainant M was removed because she felt threatened by her, Supervisor K waited over an hour, after Complainant was back working at her desk, to contact the officer. According to Complainant, when the supervisors stopped speaking to her, she became shunned by the rest of the office as her colleagues were afraid to be seen talking to her. She left her job to get away from Supervisor K, causing her to sell her home and move in with her mother.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, with respect to Complainant A, the Agency argues her testimony was "vague and generic." The Agency argues, for example, that during the "horrible" meeting with Supervisor K after Complainant A's return from year-long leadership training, Complainant A did not adequately explain how she experienced emotional harm because of the meeting. The Agency also argues that while Complainant A claimed that she became sick during the meeting with Supervisor K over the Salazar brief and went to the nurse's office, she later returned and worked with Supervisor K on revisions. The Agency asserts that Complainant A never <span id="Page_1928"></span>sought medical treatment, but simply went to a "handful of sessions" with an EAP counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant record, Complainant A describes being berated for fifteen minutes during the meeting, causing her to feel physically ill and leave for the nurse's station. The incident was so severe that every other attendee stopped by Complainant's office afterwards to comment on how awful it was. Complainant learned that after the incident, Supervisor K mocked her to another employee. Complainant A she was "berated" and "bashed" "with no hesitation." She "was ashamed that I was allowing someone to treat me this way in my profession capacity...." As for returning later and working with Supervisor K on revisions, Complainant A testified that she had no choice. If she did not make the changes, her performance evaluation would be impacted. Supervisor K came to her office, sitting next to her so closely that Complainant could not back up or turn sideways. Complainant felt "trapped" and "stuck." She worked with Supervisor K until approximately 8:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> that evening. Others observed that Supervisor K was overseeing Complainant A's work for hours and found it to be unusual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ conducted a hearing and found Complainants had proven emotional and physical changes as result of the discrimination. She also based her finding on the duration of the harm, noting that Complainant M "still experiences anxiety attacks." Complainant M's testimony was also corroborated by her husband. He testified that their marriage was changed by harassment, that they no longer enjoyed the things they used to do together. Complainant M's spouse explained that she has anxiety attacks, difficulties with sleep, problems with her weight, and depression. The AJ also noted that while Complainant A may have suffered for a shorter time, she was "more sensitive and suffered similar mistreatment until she retired...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we note that evidence from a health care provider or other expert is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional harm. A complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can suffice to sustain his or her burden. The more inherently degrading or humiliating the defendant's action is, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action. <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency asserts that the AJ failed to consider that compensatory damages are not available under the ADEA. While the Agency is correct that neither compensatory damages nor attorney's fees are available as remedies for a violation of the ADEA, the record evidence supports that either claim--under the ADEA or Title VII--can stand independently. As compensatory damages and attorney's fees are remedies fully available under Title VII, the AJ's decision appropriately provided these remedies. While the Agency seems to argue that Complainant's damages should somehow be reduced because she also prevailed under the ADEA, it presents no legal support for this.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the instant record, we find that the AJ's award of compensatory damages is supported by substantial evidence of record. The amount set by the AJ for Complainant A was proper. The award provided by the AJ for Complainant M should be moderately reduced to $175,000, to account for the effects of the stress caused by her mother's illness, which was not the result of the discriminatory harassment. These amounts appropriately account for the harm suffered and are consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Looney v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A40124 and 01A53252 (May 19, 2005) ($195,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where Agency's actions caused depression, destruction of spirit and confidence, feelings as if no purpose in life, anxiety, nightmares related to discrimination, and difficulty coping); <span class="Italic">Padilla v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120090062 (Sep. 21, 2010) ($165,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where a hostile work environment caused the Complainant to have a strain on his relationships, suffered financial instability, and suffered emotional distress); <span class="Italic">Franklin v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A00025 and 01A03882 (Jan. 19, 2001) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where testimony of Complainant and his wife established that he was withdrawn, depressed, embarrassed, humiliated, lost self esteem, and he experienced financial difficulties, emotional distress, personality changes, and severe strain on relationships).</p>
<p class="noindent">Arising out of a default judgment award, the Commission affirmed a $180,000 compensatory damages award in <span class="Italic">Chere S. v. General Services Administration</span>, 0720180012 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of her claim for non-pecuniary compensatory damages, Complainant presented sworn statements from herself, family members, friends and coworkers detailing the existence of a hostile work environment that began in February 2011, and continued through December 13, 2017, the date that the AJ ordered the Agency to award Complainant damages, and perhaps beyond. In her own affidavit, Complainant described her physical, mental, and emotional states, particularly how what happened to her caused her to feel confused and numb, how she was terrified at the prospect of not being able to feed her children, and how the emotional distress she experienced affected her physically; including headaches, stomach problems, and diarrhea. She averred that her self-esteem had plummeted to such an extent that she had contemplated suicide, and that the only thing that kept her going was the thought of not wanting to leave her children motherless. Complainant's Motion for Compensatory Damages, Exhibit A. Members of her family described her physical and emotional deterioration to the point at which they had to take caring for her two children because of how withdrawn and depressed she was. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Exhibits C, D. Four of Complainant's coworkers also described how she went from being happy and friendly to suffering abrupt mood changes, becoming easily agitated, traumatized, and fearful. Her coworkers also noted that her condition was not alleviated by her reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Exhibits E, F, G, H. We find that Complainant's symptoms and condition were severe and lasted for more than six years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We must now ascertain whether the AJ's award of $180,000 is consistent with awards made in similar cases. In <span class="Italic">Lauralee C. v. Dept. of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720150002 (Sept. 25, 2017), an AJ entered default judgment finding the Agency liable for gender-based nonsexual harassment and awarded the employee $200,000. The default judgment was based on the Agency's failure to timely comply with AJ's order to conduct an expedited supplemental investigation. Factors influencing the size of the award included the employee's constant crying, inability to exercise due to severe anxiety resulting in panic attacks, feelings of exhaustion, helplessness and hopelessness. The employee's constant fear left her unable to leave her house except to visit a doctor or buy groceries. She suffered loss of trust and reliance and other people as well as harm to her reputation. She withdrew from relationships. She experienced stress-related physical symptoms such as insomnia; gastrointestinal distress, pancreatitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. Her condition endured for between one and three years. In addition to affidavits from herself, her family and friends, and coworkers, the employee submitted medical documentation that included a diagnosis of depression and reactivation of post-traumatic stress disorder that she had suffered before the harassment occurred. <span class="Italic">See also McCormick v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720100040 (Nov. 23, 2011) (awarding $200,000 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who suffered damage to her professional reputation, severe migraines, lack of sleep, and strains on her relationships); <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102516 (Nov. 16, 2011) (awarding S175,000 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who suffered emotional harm, including low energy, insomnia, loss of life enjoyment, and tearfulness, which resulted from sexual assault and harassment). On the basis of the foregoing, we find that the AJ's award of $180,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a decision that truly makes one wonder what must occur in the way of harm to warrant a $300,000 award, the Commission awarded $185,000 in compensatory damages to a complainant who was terminated several days after disclosing his HIV-positive status to the agency. In <span class="Italic">Mack v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01983217 (2000), the Commission described the harm that befell the complainant after his termination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the agency's discriminatory termination of complainant, he lived in a well-furnished apartment and owned two late-model automobiles. Complainant was well-groomed and well-dressed. He had custody of his seven-year-old daughter and had a good relationship with her. He drank moderately but did not use drugs. He was experiencing some depression related to his HIV status, which was controlled with minimal medication. He also had emphysema, but that condition did not require any treatment. Following the agency's discriminatory termination of complainant, which occurred almost immediately after complainant disclosed his HIV status, complainant was unable to pay his rent on time, which led his landlord to refuse to renew his lease, whereupon complainant moved out of his apartment. Complainant was forced to sell one automobile, and the other was repossessed, leaving complainant liable for the loan balance. Complainant no longer had a home, and so lost custody of his daughter. He had no one with whom he could leave his and his daughter's possessions, and so he put them in storage. When he could no longer pay the storage fees, the storage company impounded his possessions and sold them at auction, giving complainant none of the proceeds. Stripped of all of his worldly goods, complainant lived a nomadic existence for over two years, unable to obtain employment and unable to put a roof over his head. He slept wherever he could, including in the street, and was unable to keep himself and his clothing clean. He was twice beaten and robbed. Eventually he succumbed to the lure of illegal drugs, although he later voluntarily went through a detox program. His depression increased, and now requires multiple medications, and his emphysema worsened, now requiring medication. He suffers from migraines and insomnia, and takes medication for both. His relationship with his young daughter has been damaged. Having established the <span id="Page_1929"></span>causal relationship between the agency's discriminatory termination and these events, the Commission finds that complainant is indeed entitled to non-pecuniary compensatory damages in the amount of $185,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reaffirmed its decision in <span class="Italic">Mack v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05A01058 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">In another adverse action/harassment case, the Commission in <span class="italic">Sona B. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2021000656 (2021), reminded that the length of the harassment, especially long periods of same, will generally yield a large compensatory damage award. In that case, the harassment lasted for five years. The Commission, however, reduced the AJ's $300,000 award to $200,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant argues that the AJ's decision included sufficient justification for the award of $300,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. Complainant reiterated the AJ's finding in Complainant's favor on all claims and the AJ's conclusion that Complainant's all-male team of supervisors made her life nearly intolerable for five years. Three different managers issued five discriminatory disciplinary actions against her. Management was found to have discriminatorily challenged her security clearance and fitness for duty on multiple occasions. Complainant asserts that the five years of a hostile work environment, and it's lingering effects, harmed Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we observe that Complainant's appeal brief focuses on the Agency's actions rather than the resulting harms or losses suffered by Complainant. As previously noted, particularly humiliating or degrading Agency actions can lead to a reasonable inference that distress was experienced by the employee. In this case, Complainant was a successful, female, high-level manager who returned to work, following her own health problems, and the death of her young child, to be subjected to ongoing unlawful discrimination. She was placed on a PIP without a clear ending, moved to a basement office, given a change in tour of duty, asked to provide medical documentation to prove she could perform her lower-graded job, and subjected to harassment by the individual placed in her AFSD-I position. She was issued discipline from her new supervisor just two weeks before her MSPB hearing and, one day after the MSPB revoked her demotion and she was suspended for seven days. This disciplinary action was then used to exclude her from consideration for her former position after AFSDI-P left. We agree that these repeated and public adverse actions lead to a reasonable inference that Complainant suffered humiliation and emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While not highlighted in the appeal brief, the hearing transcript does include testimony by Complainant's spouse. He described Complainant, before the discrimination, as "enthusiastic" about her career. It was an "important part of her life" and "she put everything into it." Consequently, she continued to advance and was "highly regarded." However, when she returned to work after her extended absence, Complainant's spouse testified, she would come home exasperated and frustrated. Complainant became short-tempered. While rarely one to cry, she then would cry "from time to time." Complainant, previously one to easily fall asleep, would wake in the middle of the night and be unable to return to sleep. Complainant's husband explained that the workplace stress impacted her emotional health, which also caused Complainant to worry this would, in turn, also affect her physical health.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's own testimony echoed these sentiments. She noted that "other than these five years of harassment I have an exemplary career with the government, and my career has meant a lot to me." Complainant explained that the harassment at work "bled into [my] personal life...[my] husband got to the point he didn't want to hear about it anymore." She began smoking again, only at work, in order to calm herself down. Complainant noted that, at the time of the hearing in 2018, she was still in counseling and on medication for depression. Additionally, she expressed her intention to retire soon.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ based her award on the testimony from Complainant and her husband, as well as the five-year span of the harm. We agree that the record contains substantial evidence to support a significant award. However, while the AJ awarded the maximum amount of non-pecuniary compensatory damages that are available, we find that an award of $200,000 is more appropriate. This modified award recognizes the existence of Complainant's pre-existing condition (depression) and the impact of other sources on her emotional distress (i.e. the recent loss of her young child), and is consistent with prior Commission cases where an Agency's discrimination caused similar harm. <span class="italic">See Alene S. v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720150038 (April 6, 2016) (Commission reduced AJ award to better reflect existing conditions of PTSD and depression, but also compensate aggravation of such conditions and headaches, sleeplessness, and hives); <span class="italic">McCormick v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal 0720100040 (Nov. 23, 2011) (Commission upheld AJ award of $200,000 non-pecuniary damages resulting in severe physical damages and pain to Complainant's neck and shoulders, harm to professional reputation, migraines, sleep disruptions, and strain on familial relationships); <span class="italic">Tyner v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060032 (October 23, 2007) (AJ award of $150,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages upheld by Commission based on testimony by Complainant, psychologist, and Complainant's father. Complainant was particularly vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behavior due to witnessing sexual abuse as a young person. Agency's actions caused Complainant sleeplessness, problems with her appetite, tearfulness, and PTSD).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sebek v. Attorney General</span>, 07A00005 (2001), the Commission upheld a nonpecuniary damages award of $200,000 because the agency failed to submit adequate information on appeal to dispute it. The agency argued that the complainant "did not provide adequate evidence to sustain an award of non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $200,000." The agency determined that "an appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages would be $25,000." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Sebek</span> upheld the award because the agency failed to submit evidence on appeal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the AJ erred in awarding complainant $200,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. Pursuant to the regulation set forth at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.403(e), the agency must submit the complaint file to the Office of Federal Operations within 30 days of submission of an appeal by the agency. "If the complaint was adjudicated by an Administrative Judge, the complaint file must include copies of all documents issued by or served on the Administrative Judge, orders from the Administrative Judge, and motions and briefs on the parties." Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 CFR Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), 9-12 (November 9, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the agency issued its final order on November 29, 1999, and timely filed an appeal with the Commission on December 2, 1999. We note that although the agency challenges the amount of non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded by the AJ, it failed to submit the testimony and exhibits presented by the parties during the damages phase of the hearing. The AJ's decision states that by agreement of the parties, evidence in support of and in opposition to claims for compensatory damages were submitted to the record without a hearing. Both the hearing transcript and the agency's final order indicate that with regard to compensatory damages, statements were submitted by complainant's attorney, a report was submitted by complainant's doctor, a report was submitted by the agency's doctor, and declarations were taken of complainant's witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In August 2000, the Commission contacted the AJ to obtain the necessary information to decide the issue of compensatory damages. The AJ stated that upon the conclusion of the case, the entire record was submitted to the agency. In August and September 2000, the Commission contacted the agency twice by telephone and requested that the agency submit the relevant information on compensatory damages. The agency replied that it did not have the requested information concerning compensatory damages. Thus, in filing its appeal the only evidence submitted by the agency regarding the amount of compensatory damages was the report by the agency's doctor. The EEO Management Directive-110, Chapter 9, Section VI (C)(1) (Nov. 9, 1999), provides: "On appeal, the burden is squarely on the party challenging the [AJ's] decision to demonstrate that the [AJ's] factual determinations are not supported by substantial evidence." As the agency failed to meet its burden of providing a complete record on appeal, the Commission finds that the agency is barred from challenging the amount of the AJ's non-pecuniary compensatory damages award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Though as a general matter, large compensatory damage awards require medical evidence, the degree of evidence required is somewhat dependent upon the nature of the discrimination. Compensatory damages are not intended to punish an employer's conduct, but to compensate the victim of discrimination. Still, as the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Glockner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30105.txt">07A30105</a> (2004), the more degrading the employer's conduct the more likely it is that the complainant will suffer humiliation and distress. In upholding an award of $200,000 in compensatory damages, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Glockner</span> also dismissed the agency's argument that the award should be reduced because of a preexisting condition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency first contends that the evidence in the record did not support a conclusion that complainant's migraine headaches were caused by her workplace condition and that, by her own admission, her headaches could have been triggered by alcohol, cheese, cold cuts, and monosodium glutamate. The record reveals that complainant suffered from recurrent migraine headaches since age sixteen, and, that they occurred particularly when complainant was stressed or fatigued. Further, the record reveals that around November 14, 1996, prior to the start of the discrimination alleged herein, complainant experienced particularly severe headaches, which lasted five days and then had a further recurrence over that same weekend. Complainant underwent a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) test at that time to conclusively rule out physiological causes for the migraines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that the stress of adjusting to a new country when she was younger caused her migraines, but that they went away and she only had occasional migraines thereafter. However, with the onset of the harassment and stress at work in 1998, she noted that the migraines <span id="Page_1930"></span>intensified and were more frequent and severe to the point where she was having migraines once a week or every other week with each bout lasting two or three days. Due to her concern about their severity and frequency, complainant testified that she went to a neurologist and had an MRI's performed in October 2000 to rule out physiological causes. After ruling out such causes, complainant testified that her neurologist attributed her migraines to stress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also reveals that as far back as 1999, complainant's doctor attributed the exacerbation of complainant's headaches to work related stress. Further, the Chief of Administrative Medicine (Staff Physician) at the complainant's facility, testified that after several visits from complainant, he believed that complainant's headaches originated from her working conditions. We note that there is no evidence that complainant suffered migraines as severe or as frequent as the ones she suffered in 1996 until the time period of the discriminatory events herein. Further, we find that there was no medical or testimonial evidence in the record to show that the frequency and severity of the migraines would have worsened over time, absent the increased stress that was placed on complainant as a result of the harassment and discrimination she suffered. We also note that contrary to the agency's contention, the record reveals that complainant does not drink, and that the other identified triggers, i.e., cheese and monosodium glutamate, were noted from past not current use. Therefore, we find that complainant has shown that her migraines were in fact significantly exacerbated by her hostile working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency further contends that the AJ's award of $200,000 in compensatory damages was not supported by testimony at the hearing or the evidence contained in the file. We note that complainant testified that, as a result of the ongoing harassment and stress at work, she started to experience severe intestinal distress, which she was told by her physicians was consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) triggered by stress, and serious sleep disturbances. She also testified that she experienced the stomach disorders on a nearly daily basis. Complainant testified that she started to bite her cheeks and developed an irritational fibroma, which required surgery. Further, she suffered from depression, anxiety and exhaustion. She further testified that while she once loved her job, she now drives to work in tears and often does not want to go to work at all. She testified that she continues to feel isolated at work in that her supervisors treat her like a pariah or like she is invisible and her co-workers often avoid her because of the negative things said about her by her supervisors. She testified to the deep humiliation she experienced and the psychological loss caused by the damage to her reputation. Moreover, while she once felt that she had the respect of her professional colleagues and the doctors in the community and in the agency, she had been isolated from them and her performance has been constantly criticized to them. Additionally, professional relationships that she had with doctors in the diabetic clinic and other sub-speciality clinics, developed over many years, have been severed, causing her great pain and a sense of loss. Complainant also avers that she has not recovered from any of the injuries or conditions that she alleges were caused by the agency, and that her life outside the agency had been dramatically impacted and that she has significant fears and concerns about the future in that the Chief of Pharmacy encouraged her to look for employment outside the agency. Several witnesses also testified that on several occasions during the period when the discrimination occurred, they observed complainant crying at work, complaining of stress from how she was being treated by her supervisors, or suffering from migraine headaches.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the agency argues that complainant's doctor never diagnosed her irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in that he testified that a diagnosis required additional studies beyond what he performed. The agency further contended that, assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that complainant was diagnosed with IBS, the record did not show that it was caused by her workplace conditions. We note however, that while the doctor did not make an official diagnosis, he noted that if he had to offer a medical opinion, he believed that her workplace distress was causing her irritable bowel syndrome. Further, complainant testified that her IBS problems started around the time that she was being scheduled to work on Saturdays, her Sabbath day, and that she continues to suffer from bloating and other symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, which at times results in her not being able to fit in her clothes. Therefore, we find that complainant has shown a nexus between her IBS and her working conditions. In addition, the record shows that after the harassment began in 1998, complainant began biting her cheeks from stress. This resulted in an irritational fibroma, which she needed to have surgically removed in July 1999. Complainant also averred that she developed kidney stones because she was afraid to take breaks due to the harassment she suffered at work. Further, as the AJ found, there was creditable evidence provided by complainant that employees and management resented that complainant was not required to work on Saturdays and that her religious practices made her the target of hostility. Moreover, complainant was also the subject of hostility because she filed an EEO complaint in that complainant was told to stop being a "princess" and encouraged to drop her complaints. Additionally, as the AJ noted, much of the harassing conduct complainant suffered, occurred directly following complainant's protected activity. In view of the evidence in the record, we find that complainant has persuasively shown a nexus between her physical ailments and the agency's discriminatory actions. Further, we find that complainant provided sufficient medical documentation of her conditions, including the MRI scan from her doctor diagnosing her migraines, and the letters from her doctors regarding the treatment of her kidney stones and removal of the irritational fibroma.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that while complainant contends that she suffered from depression because of the discriminatory actions of the agency, she testified that she was not under a doctor's care for her alleged symptoms nor did she take prescribed medication to alleviate her symptoms. We note however that, medical evidence is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages.<span class="Italic"> Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No, 01945652 (July 17, 1995). In the absence of this evidence, a complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can suffice [to meet] his/her burden in this regard.<span class="Italic"> See U.S. v. Balistrieri,</span> 981 F.2d 916,932 (7th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert, denied,</span> 114 S. Ct. 58 (1993) (housing discrimination). As the court noted in<span class="Italic"> Balistrieri,</span> "[t]he more inherently degrading or humiliating the defendant's action is, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action; consequently, somewhat more conclusory evidence of emotional distress will be acceptable to support an award for emotional damages." Nonetheless, the absence of supporting evidence may affect the amount of damages deemed appropriate in specific cases.<span class="Italic"> Lawrence v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996). We note however, that complainant submitted ample evidence of how she was devastated by the discrimination she suffered. For example, complainant noted that she was isolated and humiliated with respect to the assignment of clinics, in that despite complainant's exemplary work and expertise in the clinics, she was removed from her speciality clinic in 1999 and never assigned to another one. Complainant also noted that she was described by her supervisors as "slow" and a "troublemaker" to new employees. Further, while complainant may not have taken medication for her depression, complainant testified that she often cried over the events at work, withdrew from her family and friends, and while she once loved to cook and go out, she no longer performs those tasks and goes out socially only infrequently. Complainant's coworkers also testified to seeing complainant upset and crying at work and also suffering from migraines as a result of the treatment from her supervisors. The evidence in the record also revealed that complainant sought out treatment for her migraines and took large doses of over-the-counter medications (well above those she would permit her patients to take) as well as the prescription drug Fiorinal to combat her migraines. Further the record reveals that complainant avoided taking any stronger drugs for her conditions, including depression, because she knew that as a pharmacist, most drugs available to her had side effects which would not allow her to stay clear headed for her job. Therefore, we cannot find that complainant should be penalized for otherwise refraining from taking medication which could negatively impact her ability to perform her job, or that such failure lessens the degree of harm she suffered from the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the agency argues that complainant was not entitled to the amount awarded by the AJ because the facts of complainant's case were distinguishable from cases where larger amounts were awarded in that complainant continued to work during the period of discrimination and did not undergo treatment or take medication for the alleged symptoms of depression and anxiety from which she suffered. The agency then cited favorably to <span class="Italic">Benson v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952854 (June 27, 1996), and<span class="Italic"> Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950342 (June 13, 1997), as examples of cases and awards that where comparable to the injury that complainant suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that damage awards for emotional harm are difficult to determine and that there are no definitive rules governing the amount to be awarded in given cases. A proper award must meet two goals: that it not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and that it be consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989) at 574. Further, several Commission decisions have awarded significant compensatory damages in a wide range of amounts depending on the facts of the particular case, and the supporting evidence presented<span class="Italic">. See generally, Mack v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> (June 23, 2000) (award of $185,000.00 where individual was left homeless for two years as a result of discriminatory termination); <span class="Italic">Franklin v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07 A00025; 01A03882 (January 19, 2001) (award of $150,000 where emotional distress caused by denial of reasonable accommodation, with no medical evidence, but extensive evidence by family, including testimony of wife on break-up of marriage); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) (award of $80,000.00 where <span id="Page_1931"></span>complainant presented testimony that over a five year period he became depressed, withdrawn, cynical, angry, and during part of this time had ringing in the ears, headaches, teeth grinding and insomnia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ, who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, considered the severity of the harm caused by the agency's action; and the extent to which other factors in complainant's life may have exacerbated complainant's pre-existing condition and determined that $200,000.00 was a reasonable amount to compensate complainant. We note that the instant case, wherein complainant was continually harassed and degraded for a period of close to five years, is immediately distinguishable from the cases referenced by the agency in that, in <span class="Italic">Benson,</span> the damages were awarded based on four discriminatory incidents related, in relevant part, to the agency failing to provide complainant with information concerning a whistleblower charge, and interference with the supervisory relationship. Similarly, complainant's case is distinguishable from the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> appeal in that the period of harassment complainant suffered through was significantly longer than the fourteen months in the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> case. Moreover, complainant twice had her pay step reduced and was deprived of various career opportunities. We note as did the AJ, that many of the incidents that comprise complainant's harassment claim will permanently impact complainant's career, and cannot be remedied other than through compensatory damages. For example, the agency's obstruction of complainant's professional growth and damage to her professional reputation by not permitting her to teach classes or attend team meetings when she was assigned to the diabetic clinic and its denial of complainant's scope of practice credentials which repeatedly caused complainant humiliation when she, unlike pharmacists with much less experience, was unable to order lab tests. This made it necessary for complainant to ask physicians to order her tests for her, which resulted in them asking complainant why she could not order her own lab tests. We also note that complainant introduced medical evidence of her injuries, and statements from her co-workers about how she was impacted by the discriminatory harassment. Further, we note that complainant avers that she has not recovered from any of the injuries or conditions that she alleges were caused by the agency, and that her life outside the agency has been dramatically impacted and that she has significant fears and concerns about the future. We also find that the record is devoid of substantive evidence of problems outside of the discriminatory work environment which contributed to the development or exacerbation complainant's ailments. Therefore, we are unpersuaded by the agency's argument that there was insufficient evidence or testimony in the record to support the AJ's award or that it was inconsistent with awards issued by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $200,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Fonda-Wall v. Attorney General</span>, 0720060035 (2009), the Commission awarded $200,000 in damages where the complainant was subjected to a long pattern of retaliation that resulted in the suspension of her security clearance, two relocations to other states to nonsensitive jobs, the dissolution of her marriage and significant and protracted psychological harm. In increasing the award of $150,000 by the administrative judge, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Fonda-Walls</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record we agree with the AJ that the harm complainant endured was a direct result of the agency's retaliatory actions. Complainant's doctor testified that she had never seen complainant in such a state, that her symptoms were not related to any prior or unrelated issues, and that her emotional harm was directly attributable to her work conditions. Additionally, complainant's doctor was so concerned about complainant's mental and physical health that she advised complainant not to return to the office unless S1 was not present.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant established that she suffered a significant amount of emotional harm from the agency's actions, which manifested itself into physical harm. Specifically, complainant's doctor found that complainant was more anxious and upset than she had ever seen her, that her demeanor changed after the interactions with S1, and that she endured a great deal of psychological trauma. Complainant felt physically threatened and afraid that S1 was going to hurt her after he verbally assaulted her, had her cornered against a wall, lunged toward her, and chased her down the hall to the extent that she had to call for M1's protection. Complainant did not feel safe at work, and often cried, shook, was depressed, became anti-social, and felt panicked. Complainant was in constant fear of S1's next retaliatory act, which left her always feeling apprehensive, nervous, and concerned for her safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, complainant established that her reputation and professional life was damaged as a result of S1 and his subordinates lying about the events that occurred and attributing them to fabricated mental health problems, which resulted in her being treated as an outcast and a trouble maker. Complainant was always uncomfortable around her coworkers, who isolated and alienated her because they were afraid of retaliation from S1, which caused complainant to be denied special assignments and other lucrative career opportunities. Further, complainant suffered humiliation and shame when the rumors about her mental health spread, and she suffered additional stress and anxiety when she was given a negative performance evaluation for the relevant time period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports complainant's assertion that the agency's actions wreaked substantial havoc on her life outside of the agency. Due to the two involuntary relocations to two different states, complainant was alienated from her children and husband, and the moves placed enormous stress upon her marriage that ultimately resulted in divorce. She also was forced to endure a custody battle when her ex-husband fought against complainant taking their children out of state. Complainant also suffered the stress and anxiety of having to quickly sell her home, the lost profits from that home, and being forced to place her belonging in storage during the interim. Further, complainant suffered additional emotional harm when she was forced to watch the impact the involuntary reassignments had on her children who were forced to move to another state, were forced to leave their home, family, and friends, had to struggle in a new school, were (and still are) separated from their father, and had to endure the divorce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we note that the AJ failed to take into consideration the length of time complainant suffered the harm. Complainant's harm began when she first spoke out against S1's harassment towards her coworker in March 2001. Complainant is still assigned to Texas to this day, and she continues to deal with the effects of the divorce and child custody issues, and the emotional effects of watching her children's separation anxiety from their father. Further, complainant has continued to suffer the embarrassment and humiliation of having her security clearance revoked, being involuntarily transferred, and dealing with the consequences of a ruined reputation from the lies that S1 spread about her. In fact, the long term and continuing impact of the agency's actions were evident during the hearing, when complainant broke down into tears twice. The record establishes that complainant's harm has spanned over eight years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several Commission decisions have awarded significant compensatory damages in cases similar to this case. For example, in <span class="Italic">Glockner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30105 (September 23, 2004), the Commission affirmed an award of $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where complainant was subjected to harm for five years and she suffered humiliation, depression, significant fears, and her professional reputation was damaged. In <span class="Italic">Looney v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40124 (May 19, 2005), the Commission affirmed an AJ's award of $195,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. In that case, complainant was retaliated against when she was detailed to a location for an extended period of time far from her home. Complainant's harm included crying, humiliation, depression, destruction of her spirit and confidence, tension, inability to sleep, difficulty coping with life, and a physical change in her appearance. Further, in <span class="Italic">Mack v. Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (June 23, 2000); <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied</span>, Request No. 05A01058 (October 26, 2000), the Commission awarded complainant $185,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. In that case, complainant was depressed, hurt, embarrassed, felt demeaned, lost his house and automobiles, and lost custody of his daughter as a result of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, there are District Court cases which are similar to the instant case with respect to the nature, severity, and duration of the harm that complainant endured. <span class="Italic">See Peyton v. DiMario</span>, 287 F.3d 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (upheld the reduction of a jury's non-pecuniary compensatory damage award from $482,000.00 to $300,000.00, where employee was retaliated against under Title VII, and as a result was distressed, fearful, and depressed); <span class="Italic">Koster v. TWA</span>, 181 F.3d 24 (1st Cir. 1999) (employee was awarded $250,000.00 for discrimination that resulted in emotional damages such as stress on his family life, trouble sleeping, and anxiety); <span class="Italic">O'Sullivan v. City of Chicago</span>, 474 F. Supp.2d 971 (N.D. Ill. 2007) (employee was awarded $250,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages when retaliation resulted in loss of reputation, humiliation, anxiety, headaches, nausea, and withdrawal from her family). Further, we note that the more egregious the agency's actions are, the more likely it is that a complainant will suffer significant emotional harm. Here, the agency's retaliatory conduct was severely egregious, and complainant has established that her harm was significant. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to an award of $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award by the administrative judge of $200,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Attorney General</span>, 072010040 (2011), where the agency's failure to accommodate led to long-term physical damage and emotional distress that continued from 2007 and was still ongoing at the time of the decision. In addition, negative comments by the complainant's supervisors about her lack of productivity caused her to have concerns that she would be fired. In upholding the award in <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ awarded $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages because the Agency engaged in egregious, substantial discriminatory and retaliatory conduct that increased the physical pain <span id="Page_1932"></span>and damage to Complainant's neck and shoulder, and caused her to suffer severe depression. Furthermore, the negative memorandums circulated about Complainant caused her emotional distress in that she feared the Agency was trying to fire her rather than accommodate and help her. According to her doctor, the emotional distress led to permanent spasms that further damage the discs in her back. Today she suffers from migraines, lack of sleep, and severe and chronic pain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the discriminatory conduct also led to a loss of enjoyment of life from August 2007 to the present; changes in her demeanor, outlook, and physical and mental conditions that imperiled her marriage, hindered her ability to properly care for her young child; created a serious and potentially permanent rift with a child in college.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Non-pecuniary losses are losses that are not subject to precise quantification, i.e., emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing, and loss of health. See EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at 10 (July 14, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After establishing entitlement to an award of compensatory damages, there is no precise formula for determining the amount of damages for non-pecuniary losses, except that the award should reflect the nature and severity of the harm and the duration or expected duration of the harm.<span class="Italic"> See Loving v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955789 (Aug. 29, 1997). It should likewise be consistent with amounts awarded in similar cases.<span class="Italic"> See Hogeland v. Dep't of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01976440 (June 14, 1999). Moreover, we point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the Agency for its discriminatory actions. Furthermore, compensatory damages should not be motivated by passion or prejudice or be "monstrously excessive" standing alone but should be consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Commission should reduce the AJ's award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages to $60,000.00 because it did not engage in egregious, substantial discriminatory and retaliatory conduct. Rather, management made efforts to accommodate Complainant during the interim period while she was waiting for her two primary accommodations. Although their attempts were inadequate, management comported with the recommendations of Complainant's physicians, and she eventually received the accommodations she requested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record and Commission precedent, we find that the AJ did not err in awarding Complainant $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. We find that the AJ properly rejected the Agency's characterization of management's actions as good faith, but inept attempts to help Complainant. Here, management initially attempted to assign Complainant tasks that further injured her and caused tremendous pain, without engaging in any serious efforts to quickly secure the accommodations that would actually help her do her job. When she alerted management that she could not perform such tasks because of the pain, management threatened her with absence without leave and sent her home, without any sense of urgency to quickly secure her two primary accommodations so she could return to work. Moreover, management consistently emailed their superiors, unfairly characterizing Complainant's actions as "refusals" to work, which led headquarters to view this as an insubordination issue, warranting possible discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is substantial evidence in the testimony of Complainant's doctors, family, friends, and Complainant herself, about the physical and mental harm Complainant has endured. Complainant has suffered severe physical damage and pain to her neck and shoulders, as well as permanent spasms that have damaged the discs in her back. Her professional reputation was damaged by the portrayals as an insubordinate employee who refuses to do assignments. She has suffered from severe migraines, lack of sleep, and serious strains on her relationships with her family. She has withdrawn socially from friendships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We determine that the AJ's award is consistent with amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brown-Fleming v. Dep't of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667 (Oct. 28, 2010) (awarding $150,000 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who suffered from depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, disassociation, crying spells, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, short-term memory loss, nightmares, panic, worsening abdominal pain, worsening hypertension, dramatic weight-loss, and worsening psoriasis brought on by stress); <span class="Italic">Franklin v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00025 (Jan. 19, 2001) (awarding $150,000 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who experienced extensive symptoms of emotional distress, resulting in changes in complainant's personality, the ending of his marriage, severe strains in his relationships with those close to him, including his children, and diminished enjoyment of life); <span class="Italic">Blount v. Dep't of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (Oct. 21, 2009) (awarding $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who suffered from severe depression, an inability to work, and difficulty in meeting child and spousal support obligations).</p>
<p class="noindent">In another reasonable accommodation case, <span class="Italic">Doyle S. v. Secretary of the Interior,</span> 2021003582 (2022), the Commission upheld a $200,000 award where the complainant testified that, after suffering a nervous breakdown as a result of previous discrimination, the agency denied him a reasonable accommodation to help his transition back into work. He and his wife credibly testified that the agency's failure to accommodate caused the complainant to become suicidal requiring six weeks of in-patient treatment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the instant record and Commission precedent, we find that the AJ did not err in awarding Complainant $200,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The AJ determined that Complainant and his wife credibly testified as to the severity of the distress he suffered as a result of the Agency’s harassment and failure to accommodate him beginning on July 29, 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ emphasized that the Agency's actions so exacerbated Complainant's mental conditions that, early 2017, he became suicidal and required six weeks of in-patient mental health treatment. Further, the AJ reasoned that there was no evidence to demonstrate that Complainant's pre-existing condition would have worsened absent the Agency’s unlawful conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is substantial evidence in the record documenting the extent and severity of the mental and emotional harm Complainant has endured. Complainant and his wife both testified, at length, as to the severity of Complainant's depression. His condition affected every aspect of his life, testified Complainant, causing serious financial difficulties for his family, problems in his marriage, and strain on his relationship with his children. Complainant's spouse testified that the Agency's actions resulted in a significant decline in Complainant's mental condition. She noted that Complainant would wear the same clothes for days, became unkempt and unshaven. He had difficulty sleeping and would stay up pacing. See id. He could not help with things around the house, testified Complainant's wife, noting that her requests would yield a response like "you're rattling me." She explained that Complainant isolated himself from his family and friends, no longer joining the family for dinner or vacations, causing her to "fe[el] like [she] was a single parent" and as if Complainant was "like another child…another person [she] had to take care of." </p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ's award of $200,000 properly reflects the duration of the harassment, while also recognizes Complainant's pre-existing conditions, and compensates Complainant for the additional, serious, aggravation of those conditions caused by Agency's discriminatory actions Moreover, the award is consistent with similar Commission cases where the Agency's conduct caused serious psychological harm. <span class="Italic">See Lauralee C. v. Dep't of Homeland Sec'y,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720150002 (Sept. 25, 2017) (awarding $200,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where the stress from the harassment complainant was subjected to resulted in complainant being diagnosed with depression, reactivated PTSD, gastrointestinal distress and other physical conditions); <span class="Italic">Alene S. v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720150038 (April 16, 2016) (awarding $200,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where the harassment complainant was subjected to exacerbated her PTSD so that she disconnected from her children and was ultimately rendered unable to work again); <span class="Italic">Blount v. Dep't of Homeland Sec'y,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (Oct. 21, 2009) (awarding $200,000 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who suffered from severe depression, an inability to work, and difficulty in meeting child and spousal support obligations). Therefore, we affirm the AJ’s award of $200,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant's consensual relationship with a coworker led to her removal and the male comparator was not similarly disciplined, the Commission awarded $200,000 in damages finding the breakdown of the complainant's marriage was the result of her emotional distress from discrimination and not her affair. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720130039 (2014), found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has reviewed the entire record, including the statements made by Complainant and witnesses, as well as extensive documentary evidence admitted into the record during the AJ's hearing regarding damages. We consider the witness statements describing the deterioration of her physical appearance and decline of her day to day happiness into a state of anxiety and desperation after Complainant was notified she was on D1's "radar." Complainant described as a result of the discrimination, her feelings of humiliation, emotional distress, anger, sense of helplessness and hopelessness, and the ultimate demise of her marriage that was able to withstand the prior revelation of Complainant's relationship with E1. We note the testimony of Complainant and witnesses who confirmed that Complainant experienced sleeplessness, weight loss, and visible damage to her skin and hair from the stress created by the Agency's actions.</p>
\<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1933"></span>We also consider evidence pertaining to the emotional impact of Complainant's economic hardship caused by the discrimination. Complainant was the chief income earning parent for her children. Complainant described in detail: the difficulties she faced in locating work; her decision to relocate to find work; the impact discrimination had upon her relationships with her young children and friends; and the damage to Complainant's professional reputation among peers and prospective employers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the AJ's award of $200,000 is reasonable under the circumstances. This amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, the prior state of Complainant's marriage, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g [ ] v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720120027 (Apr. 2, 2014) ($210,000 awarded where Complainant became deeply troubled, anxious, depressed, lonely, vulnerable, suspicious, mentally unfocused, highly emotional and volatile, with reduced self esteem, weight loss, hair loss, difficulty in sleeping and bouts of tearfulness, crying, dizziness, suicidal thoughts, and chest pains); <span class="Italic">Sebek v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00005 (Mar. 8, 2001) (awarding $200,000 in nonpecuniary damages for a complainant who experienced sexual harassment and assault from Agency management).</p>
<p class="noindent">Emotional stress that manifested in several new medical conditions, as well as "reactivation of a previously diagnosed condition" justified a $200,000 award in <span class="Italic">Lauralee C. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720150002 (2017). Citing not only the physical symptoms of the harm, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lauralee C</span>. also noted that the duration of the harassment (more than two years) coupled with the agency's failure to take preventive or corrective action to stop the harassment contributed the $200,000 award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requested non-pecuniary compensatory damages at the cap amount of $300,000.00, and pecuniary compensatory damages in the amount of $1,903,163.02. The AJ found that Complainant submitted evidence in the form of doctor's reports that support her claim for non-pecuniary compensatory damages, and documentation in the form of receipts and statements for medical expenses, psychiatric expenses, physical therapy expenses, legal fees, and other out-of-pocket expenses in support of her claim of pecuniary compensatory damages which established that the expenses she incurred were directly related to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was diagnosed with several new medical conditions, as well as "reactivation of a previously diagnosed condition," since the Agency began subjecting her to discriminatory harassment. Some of the conditions with which Complainant was diagnosed have only one known significant contributing factor or cause, i.e., stress. Complainant was diagnosed with depression, reactivation of post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD),4 insomnia, gastrointestinal distress, pancreatitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant reported that, as a result of the discrimination she suffers from emotional pain, and that she now feels "hollow, exhausted, hopeless and helpless." Complainant reported that she cries all the time, and that she cannot exercise anymore due to severe anxiety resulting in panic attacks. Complainant stated she lives in constant fear which has resulted in her inability to leave her house unless she is attending a medical appointment or purchasing groceries. Complainant questioned whether she will be able to trust or rely upon anyone again. She complained of having her reputation harmed, and of a loss of interest in interacting with others and sustaining personal relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends the compensatory damages award is monstrously excessive standing alone, and is completely out of line with the amounts awarded in similar cases where complainants have pre-existing emotional and psychological harm prior to the agency's discrimination. One of the chief arguments the Agency raises in support of these contentions is that the AJ failed to take into account the many other sources of emotional stressors Complainant had in her life. We find the Agency's argument to be without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the AJ took account of several factors that limited Complainant's damages award. The AJ explicitly stated that, among other things, Complainant's pre-existing medical condition limited the overall damage award to which she was entitled. While acknowledging that Complainant suffered emotional harm from the hostile work environment, the AJ reasoned that Complainant was diagnosed with PTSD previously, and that she has experienced some emotional harm from circumstances unrelated to her job with the Agency. While her conditions may have been exacerbated by the Agency's actions, the AJ clearly found that the Agency was not the sole cause of Complainant's emotional and psychological harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record before us, we disagree with the Agency's contentions that the AJ failed to take in to account prior sources of emotional stress that Complainant was subjected to when determining the non-pecuniary compensatory damages award, or that the award amount of $200,000.00 is too high. Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by Complainant, we find no reason to lower the amount the AJ awarded in the instant matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This amount takes into account the duration of the harassment, the nature and severity of the harm suffered by Complainant, the existence of previous conditions, and it is consistent with prior Commission precedent. In the instant case, the AJ found that "[t]he record reveals the severe ongoing harassment that the Agency has subjected Complainant to because of her sex and in retaliation for her protected EEO activity has resulted in her leave of absence. Since April 2010, Complainant notified the Agency that she was subjected to discriminatory harassment creating a hostile work environment yet, the Agency has never conducted an internal investigation into her harassment allegations, or taken any preventative or corrective measures to address Complainant's work environment." We determine that the AJ's award is consistent with amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Brendon L. v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141161 (Feb. 3, 2015) (awarding $150,000 in non-pecuniary where complainant was subjected to harassment nearly every day for almost two and one-half years. The harassment led Complainant to skip family dinners, become less communicative, have difficulty sleeping, become isolated at work and home, have panic attacks and blood pressure issues, experience embarrassment, and humiliation); <span class="Italic">Brown-Fleming v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667(Oct. 28, 2010) (awarding $150,000 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who suffered from depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, disassociation, crying spells, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, short-term memory loss, nightmares, panic, worsening abdominal pain, worsening hypertension, dramatic weight-loss, and worsening psoriasis brought on by stress); <span class="Italic">Blount v. Dept of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (Oct. 21, 2009) (awarding $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant who suffered from severe depression, an inability to work, and difficulty in meeting child and spousal support obligations).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cassandra L. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720180029 (2019) ($200,000 awarded where the agency constructively removed the complainant and subjected her to retaliatory harassment, resulting in a reactivation of her PTSD and an acute stress disorder, which stemmed directly from the harassment; the complainant also experienced loss of appetite, weight loss, back pain, stress-related diarrhea, flashbacks and nightmares, frequent crying, fear, indigestion, migraines, a strong startle reflex, hypervigilance to threats of danger, anger, depression, concentration problems, extreme irritability with suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, and insomnia.)</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">Jason L. v. Attorney General</span>, 2022000528 (2022), the Commission upheld a $200,000 award where the agency failed to take prompt and adequate corrective action when the complainant raised incidents of harassment based on his sexual orientation including "constant offensive comments about his sexual orientation, including when a coworker revealed that Complainant was gay, or 'outed' him in the workplace" and "ongoing derogatory remarks about gay men and anyone else not conforming to their views and beliefs related to heterosexual masculine man, such as transgender individuals." When the complainant became the aggressor in an altercation with his harasser, the agency transferred him and changed his work schedule. The Commission found that the complainant's actions were the "natural, foreseeable, and to-be-expected consequence of management's inaction to severe and pervasive harassment by coworkers." By way of harm, the complainant in <span class="italic">Jason L</span>. alleged that the harassment worsened his preexisting, but otherwise managed anxiety:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has argued against the AJ's decision to award Complainant $200,000.00 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The Agency argues that the AJ's award should be reduced to $150,000.00, at least, because the current damages are not consistent with the severity and harm suffered by Complainant and awards in similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency argues that the damage calculation seemingly ignores that the Agency should only be liable for the worsening of Complainant's symptoms, and not for all of the symptoms he testified about. The Agency contends that the cases cited to by the AJ regard similar or worse harm than Complainant's without even considering pre-existing conditions. The Agency also contends that Complainant's recent conduct is not probative, as he was removed from the Agency in 2020, which is the subject of another pending case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency argues that Complainant's testimony is rife with references to the impact of non-discriminatory conduct on his anxiety and overall stress level. Lastly, the Agency argues that even considering the alleged harm on its face, it is not severe enough to justify such a monstrously large award. In support of this position, the Agency argues that the medical documentation does not corroborate such harm. The Agency also argues that each of the cases cited by the AJ features more severe harassing conduct, lack of pre-existing conditions, and or more serious harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1934"></span>In the instant case, the Commission finds that the AJ's decision to award $200,000.00 in compensatory damages is supported by substantial evidence in the record. The AJ relief upon four cases, namely <span class="italic">Shameka M. v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120172281, 0120181116, 012018117 (Apr. 4, 2019), <span class="italic">Lauralee C. v.

Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667 (Oct. 28, 2010), as comparable cases to determine the award of non-pecuniary damages. We find that the cases cited by the AJ reflect the same nature and/or severity comparable to the case at hand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="italic">Shameka M</span>., $225,00.000 was awarded in non-pecuniary damages to a complainant with pre-existing diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder when two years of sexual harassment led to symptoms including the aggravation of her depression, alcohol abuse, loss of religious faith, flashbacks and nightmares, anger, irritability, crying episodes, anxiety, confusion, embarrassment, sleep disturbance, and more, which required continuing medical and physiological treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="italic">Lauralee C</span>., $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages was awarded to a complainant with a pre-existing history of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder who, after two years of sex-based harassment and retaliation, was diagnosed with new medical conditions such as depression, insomnia, gastrointestinal distress, pancreatitis, and more, with lingering effects of severe emotional harm and the agency was not the sole cause of harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="italic">Brendon L</span>., $150,000.000 in non-pecuniary damages was awarded where complainant was subjected to harassment for two and a half years which led complainant to change from being a good-natured person to one who was depressed and in a bad mood, skip family dinners, become less communicative, have difficulty sleeping, become isolated at work and home, have panic attacks and blood pressure issues, and experience embarrassment and humiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And in <span class="italic">Brown-Fleming</span>, $150,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages was awarded to complainant who suffered from depression, anxiety, insomnia, crying spells, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, short-term memory loss, nightmares, weight loss, and worsening abdominal pain, hypertension, and psoriasis, despite pre-existing conditions and additional stressors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the AJ and note that Complainant's emotional harm started to worsen around May 2016, and continued to worsen throughout the events of this case, especially throughout the nine months that Complainant was involuntarily assigned to the evening shift, and well after he was returned to his morning shift in June 2017. Moreover, Complainant began to self-medicate and drink due to the events of this case well into January 2019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was first diagnosed with anxiety around 1998; he visited his doctor approximately two times per year, and he utilized cognitive techniques and learned to manage his anxiety, resulting in panic attacks that occurred every one or two months. However, due to the events at issue in this case, Complainant's anxiety worsened, his doctor visits increased to two to three times per month, and his panic attacks increased to three times per month. Complainant also switched from cognitive techniques to deal with his anxiety to weekly medication. Throughout the record, Complainant described how the aggravation of his anxiety impacted his ability to work, especially when his shift was changed. He described having anxiety attacks on the way to work and on occasion reaching the parking lot of work only to call in sick and leave. Complainant also reported feeling embarrassment as a result of being outed in the workplace; he provided that it should be him who made the decision about whether or not to share his sexual orientation and with whom. His harasser, Coworker, took that power away from him. Complainant endured fear of being assaulted by his coworkers, stating, "People like me we get beat up. We get assaulted. It's all over the news. I'm sure it happens everywhere I fear it. I feared going to work a couple times I don't hear of straight men getting beat up because they're straight. I hear the opposite." <span class="italic">See</span> AJ Hearing Final Decision at 79.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the exacerbation of his pre-existing anxiety, Complainant was first diagnosed with depression after his shift change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This diagnosis occurred during a visit with his doctor where he once again discussed work and his issues with his coworkers, and how those issues were not resolved. <span class="italic">See</span> AJ Hearing Final Decision at 80. Around the same time, Complainant developed a habit of daily drinking alcohol in order to "bury his pain." <span class="italic">Id</span>. Further, Complainant stopped participating in anything fun outside of work, and secluded himself from his friends and family. <span class="italic">Id.</span> He saw his mom and dogs, only. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Even after returning to his regular schedule, Complainant's anxiety and depression did not improve. He reported that the animosity, attitude, and confrontation was still present at work. He stated that he was constantly minimizing contact with Coworker out of fear of what would come out of her mouth. As recently as 2020, Complainant continued to experience emotional harm from the harassment he experienced at work. He continues to suffer from anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and insomnia, requiring daily medication.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency has argued that Complainant's case exhibits less severity, we do not agree. It is apparent not only that Complainant's pre-existing condition was exacerbated significantly, but also that he developed a new mental illness in direct response to his harassment at work. Complainant's life was negatively altered, including a notable reduction in the enjoyment and ability to interact outside of work. Complainant suffered severely and acutely in direct response to his harassment at work, and the failure of management to take timely corrective actions in response to his harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, upon review of the record as a whole, we find that Complainant is entitled to $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The Commission finds that this amount takes into account the severity and the duration of the harm suffered and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. We note that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="italic">See Jackson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (Apr. 15, 1999) (citing <span class="italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F. 2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
