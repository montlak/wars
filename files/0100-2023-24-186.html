<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-160"><span id="Page_1425"></span><span class="space">JJ.</span> WORKERS' COMPENSATION</h4>
<p class="noindent">An employee may not use the EEO process to challenge an OWCP finding. However, whether a complaint is a "collateral attack" on the OWCP process or is a challenge to the agency's alleged discriminatory processing of a workers' compensation claim is decided on a case-by-case basis. For a complete discussion of whether an allegation concerning an OWCP claim states a claim for relief under EEO procedures, see Chapter 3, section on "<a href="0100-2023-12-114.html#sec3-113">Failure to State a Claim: Investigations and Other Proceedings--Collateral Attacks</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">For employees who become disabled through an on-the-job injury, workers' compensation may provide benefits. A finding that an employee is a qualified individual with a disability does not entitle him or her to workers' compensation, or vice versa. Allegations that an agency treats employees injured off-the-job less favorably than employees injured on-the-job is not within the purview of the Rehabilitation Act<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952268 (1997) (holding that an employee who sustains an on-the-job injury is not similarly situated to an employee who is injured away from work); <span class="Italic">Karsten v. USPS</span>, 01851818 (1987). A determination by OWCP on the extent of an employee's work-related disability is irrelevant to whether the person is a qualified individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walsh v. USPS</span>, 01853056 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee's receipt of OWCP benefits does not preclude a complaint of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kleinman v. Postmaster General</span>, 05921086 (1993). Since OWCP benefits do not amount to full pay, relief is still possible under the Rehabilitation Act. Conversely, a determination that an employee is not entitled to OWCP benefits does not equate with a finding that the employee is not disabled and therefore not entitled to a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04625 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not defend a claim of failure to make reasonable accommodation of a disability by asserting the disability did not derive from an occupational injury. <span class="Italic">Beilfelt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10475 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not rely solely on the OWCP process to discharge its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. The question as to whether an agency has reasonably accommodated a complaint is a separate inquiry from an OWCP determination. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Tyra F. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120182247 (2020), the AJ dismissed the complainant's reasonable accommodation claim as a collateral attack on an unfavorable OWCP determination. Complainant sustained on-the-job injuries and filed a workers' compensation claim. Complainant accepted a modified-duty assignment but maintained that it was outside her work restrictions because it did not address her reaching restrictions and requested additional accommodation. A referee physician found no restriction on her lifting, carrying or reaching, and her request was denied. Upon her return to work, she presented her supervisor with a doctor's note restricting her reaching. Management directed her back to work and noted that the referee opinion controlled. The complainant filed an EEO complaint, and the AJ granted summary judgment in favor of the agency, finding that the agency reasonably accommodated the complainant and complainant's disagreement regarding the OWCP findings was a collateral attack. The complainant filed another EEO complaint a year later with similar results. Before the Commission, the complainant argued that discrimination complaints are outside the purview of the OWCP process. Reversing summary judgment, the Commission agreed in <span class="Italic">Tyra F</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon careful review of the record, we find that the AJ erred when he concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to claims 1 and 5. In finding no discrimination, the AJ found that Complainant's claims regarding the denial of reasonable accommodation were yet another attempt to challenge OWCP's unfavorable determination. The AJ concluded that Complainant could not use the EEO process to challenge OWCP's determination, as such attempt constituted a collateral attack on another administrative process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's primary contention on appeal is that the AJ erred in finding that her claim constituted a collateral attack on the OWCP process. She notes that discrimination is outside the purview of the OWCP process and even, if the Commission were to find in her favor, that finding would have no bearing on the OWCP determination. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, reliance on the OWCP process does not, by itself, discharge an agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. While OWCP regulations may require an agency to find jobs for disabled employees that are within their medical restrictions, the Commission's regulations, in contrast, require agencies to provide reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability absent undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(o) and (p). The question as to whether an agency has satisfied its obligation to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee is a separate inquiry from any determination that OWCP might make about that employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Lux v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120092392 (Dec. 22, 2010), the Commission emphasized that the fact that a complainant's OWCP claim was approved does not alter the agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Lux</span> sustained injuries in an on-the-job accident and filed a workers' compensation claim with OWCP. When complainant returned to work, she was given a limited-duty assignment with modified duties reflecting her medical restrictions, but there was considerable disagreement as to the extent of her restrictions. In this regard, complainant's treating physician opined that complainant could only work four hours a day, could not drive, and could not lift over 40 pounds. OWCP's physician, however, opined that complainant could work eight hours a day with restrictions. To resolve the conflicting medical opinions, OWCP referred complainant to a referee physician who conducted an IME. That physician determined that complainant could work eight hours per day with restrictions of no lifting over 40 pounds and no driving beyond two hours. The agency's modified job offer to complainant was consistent with the referee physician's opinion, but contrary to the medical opinion from complainant's treating physician. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Lux</span> accepted the modified job offer under protest and subsequently filed an EEO complaint alleging that the agency discriminated against her on the basis of disability when she was given a direct order to sign a limited-duty job offer that violated the medical restrictions set forth by her primary treating physician. Over complainant's objections, the AJ assigned to the case granted the agency's motion for a decision without a hearing because the AJ determined that the claim constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the OWCP process. On appeal, the Commission held that summary judgment should not have been granted as a matter of law because the agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act were distinct from its obligations in workers' compensation claims. The Commission also held that conflicting evidence concerning complainant's medical restrictions raised the issue of witness credibility, thereby necessitating the weighing of opposing evidence at a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, while we acknowledge the AJ's finding that Complainant's disagreement as to the controlling medical opinion constitutes a collateral attack on the OWCP process, we find that the AJ erred in relying solely on OWCP's determination without considering whether the Agency met its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. As in <span class="Italic">Lux</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, Complainant in this case submitted statements from her treating physician indicating a need for restrictions on reaching due to her medical conditions. These restrictions were more restrictive than the ones imposed by an OWCP physician. To resolve the conflicting medical opinions, OWCP referred Complainant to a referee physician, whom OWCP had hired to assess Complainant's OWCP claim. As in <span class="Italic">Lux</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the referee physician sided with the OWCP physician's determination that Complainant could perform the duties of the light duty assignment offered by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the Agency relied on the opinion of OWCP's referee physician, as well as OWCP's decisions, to determine that Complainant could perform the duties listed in the Agency's June 13, 2011 modified-duty assignment offer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration, we conclude that Complainant's disagreement as to the controlling medical opinion does not, by itself, constitute a collateral attack on the OWCP process, as the record reflects that Complainant is also alleging that the Agency, in relying on OWCP's findings, failed to reasonably accommodate her medical restrictions. Given the evidence noted above and the totality of the record, we find that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the Agency provided effective reasonable accommodation to Complainant. We emphasize that the key question in cases such as this is not whether a complainant can perform the duties of a modified-duty assignment, but rather whether he or she can perform the essential functions of his or her position with or without reasonable accommodation. We conclude that the AJ's issuance of a decision without a hearing was improper because the conflicting medical evidence concerning Complainant's medical restrictions raises the issue of witness credibility and necessitates the weighing of opposing evidence. <span class="Italic">See Lux</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee claims discrimination in the context of a workers' compensation claim, the complaint must be analyzed to determine if the allegation relates to the processing of the workers' compensation claim, in which case it is within the province of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, or whether it relates to the agency's attitude toward workers who file claims, in which case it is within the EEO purview. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">In re Postmaster General</span>, 05870508 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[S]ince appellant's complaint does not actually concern the manner in which his workers' compensation claims were processed but, rather, points to the hostile environment that was created because of the submission of his claims, this issue is properly before the EEOC, not OWCP. As previously stated, we view appellant's complaint as raising a justiciable issue of handicap discrimination. Thus, even if the agency routinely questions all workers' compensation claims, this merely would be a possible defense for the supervisor's action. Such an explanation about how workers' compensation claims are usually processed, however, does not place appellant's allegation outside of the agency's jurisdiction to process his complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1426"></span><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910795 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's guidance is confusing, at best. The suggestion seems to be that an allegation that a workers' compensation claim was discriminatorily processed is not within the EEO purview. For example, using the Commission's test above, it would not have jurisdiction over a complaint alleging that an agency does not controvert the workers' compensation claims of white workers, but does controvert those of black workers. It would seem that such an allegation is clearly within the purview of Title VII. What may be affected is the Commission's ability to order relief. It could order the agency to take corrective action to process claims in a nondiscriminatory manner. However, it would not have authority to order OWCP to grant a claim that had been controverted on a discriminatory basis. From a complainant's perspective, it is important to analyze the relief sought in such a situation and to determine which of the two agencies actually has the authority to order sought-after relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lau v. National Credit Union Association</span>, 05950037 (1996), the Commission attempted to clarify its position on discrimination complaints that involve OWCP claims. In deciding whether the issue raised is properly within the purview of EEO, or should be raised with the Department of Labor, the Commission held that the primary consideration is whether the allegation constitutes a collateral attack on the OWCP proceeding. In <span class="Italic">Lau</span>, the Commission found there was insufficient evidence on the record to make that determination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An allegation that can be characterized as a collateral attack, by definition, involves a challenge to another forum's proceeding, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the grievance process, the EEO process in a separate case, the unemployment compensation process, the workers' compensation process, the tort claims process, and so forth<span class="Italic">. See Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931059 (July 15, 1994) (challenge to agency's appeal within the workers' compensation process fails to state a claim as an EEO complaint); <span class="Italic">Lingad v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930106 (June 24, 1993) (challenge to evidentiary ruling in grievance process fails to state a claim as an EEO complaint); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950472 (January 26, 1996) (challenge to agency's litigation tactics at EEO hearing fails to state a claim in subsequent EEO case).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has recognized very narrow exceptions to the general prohibition on collateral attacks<span class="Italic">. See Ellis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920011 (March 12, 1992) (discriminatory application of grievance process may state a claim). Thus, for example, if an agency refused to accept grievances from all persons within a protected class, such as race or disability, that allegation would state a claim. We have previously held that an allegation related to the discriminatory failure to process a workers' compensation claim by failing to provide necessary information to the Department of Labor states a claim<span class="Italic">. O'Neal v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900620 (August 30, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, appellant alleges discrimination based on disability and reprisal. With regard to disability, we observe that where questions are not posed with precision, an employee's answers to questions from OWCP about the ability to work may appear to be inconsistent with answers to issues about the ability to work with reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, when in actuality, there is no inconsistency. Thus, for policy reasons, it is especially important that we identify the boundaries of a true collateral attack, so as to prevent employees with disabilities from having their rights trammeled or constrained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given all the foregoing, we find that there is insufficient development of the allegations in this case. If appellant is alleging that the agency attorney, without proper authority, released information to the OWCP, then the allegation states a claim, for it involves the wrongful release of information, as opposed to the agency's representation of its position and interest in the OWCP forum. To consider whether the attorney was acting outside his proper authority, it is necessary to look at what the ordinary scope of his work responsibilities were and whether any laws or agency regulations were violated by the release of information. If, on the other hand, appellant alleges that the agency attorney was acting with proper authority, but that the information itself was false or misleading, the allegation fails to state a claim, for it merely serves to attack the manner in which the agency represented its position in the OWCP forum. In this situation, as is the case with a true collateral attack, the proper forum for appellant to raise her dispute is the original one--the workers' compensation process. Thus the agency should allow appellant the opportunity to clarify her allegation in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Simien v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962663 (1996), the Commission held that an allegation that an agency official controverted an OWCP claim failed to state a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is apparent from our review of the record that appellant is challenging the RO's decision to controvert his claims. In this regard, it is well-settled that an agency has an obligation to controvert an employee's compensation claim where there is a dispute as to an employee's entitlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945595 (February 23, 1995). For this reason, we are not persuaded that appellant is aggrieved, to the extent he has not demonstrated how the agency's action affected a term or condition of his employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, we find the agency properly dismissed appellant's complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Corcoran v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A20013 (2002) (an allegation that a supervisor lied in conjunction with an OWCP claim is a "collateral attack on workers' compensation process"); <span class="Italic">Bonham v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991149 (2002) (an allegation that false statements were made to OWCP does not state a claim). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Muhammad v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03678 (2001) (an allegation that agency failed to provide necessary information to OWCP to process a claim states a claim for relief); <span class="Italic">Danelishen v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963240 (1997) (an allegation that the agency discriminatorily failed to process worker's compensation forms correctly states a claim); <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Postmaster General</span>, 01964472 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that an agency is slow in processing OWCP claims does not, by itself, state a claim of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Briand v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951937 (1997), the appellant emphasized that the agency was criticized by OWCP during a review of the program for its administrative delays in processing the majority of workers' compensation claims. The Commission noted that even if appellant proved that the agency was uniformly slow in processing OWCP claims, this would not prove disability discrimination because the practice would apply equally to non-disabled employees with work-related injuries as to employees with disabilities recognized by the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that the agency delayed in issuing continuation of pay states a claim. In general, an agency must pay an employee who receives a traumatic on-the-job injury his or her regular salary for the first 45 days of disability. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01965776 (1997), the Commission determined that the agency's dismissal of the appellant's claim on the ground that the delay in appellant's continuation of pay was caused by the appellant's failure to supply the agency with his medical documentation was improper because it went to the merits of the claim. It is worth noting that a distinction between continuation of pay and other elements of workers' compensation is that, in the first instance, the agency decides whether the employee is entitled to continuation of pay. Most other workers' compensation matters are decided in the first instance by OWCP. However, in <span class="Italic">Bonham v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991149 (2002), the Commission held that an allegation that the agency discriminatorily contested the complainant's claim for continuation of pay benefits was a collateral attack on the OWCP process and did not state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant may be eligible for workers' compensation benefits for an action that is the subject of an EEO complaint does not preclude the EEO claim. In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120063745 (2008), the complainant claimed that the agency had ordered her to go home from work because of her disability. The agency argued that the claim was a collateral attack on the OWCP process because it was a work-related injury and the complainant was entitled to continuation of pay. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, the Commission finds that, inasmuch as complainant's compensation was affected by the agency's decision to send her home, the agency subjected her to an adverse employment action as defined by Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act as amended in 1992 to apply the standards in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1); 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). Moreover, contrary to the agency's contention, complainant's claim does not constitute a collateral attack. Here, complainant is not challenging an action or decision that occurred in another forum, but rather raises a claim that she was discriminated against by the agency on the bases of sex, disability, and reprisal. <span class="Italic">See Wills v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970596 (July 30, 1998) (An employee cannot use the EEO complaint process to lodge a collateral attack on another proceeding.); <span class="Italic">Kleinman v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940585 (September 22, 1994) (same); <span class="Italic">Lingad v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05930106 (June 25, 1993) (same), For these reasons, we find that the agency cannot dispense with complainant's claim procedurally.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complaint that the agency denied reimbursement of health care premiums made to OWCP on a discriminatory basis does state a claim. <span class="Italic">Daniels v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21500 (2002). The complainant was not disputing any action by OWCP, but an action taken by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mares v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01960499 (1998), the Commission upheld the finding of an administrative judge that the complainant's supervisors made negative statements about his EEO activity in their response to an OWCP claim as reprisal for the EEO activity. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mares</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1993, while employed at Lackland as a Maintenance Mechanic, WG-9, appellant filed a work-related injury claim with OWCP. Lackland management controverted the claim and requested that Supervisor A and Manager B, who were still employed by the Army, submit statements in support of Lackland's position. In Supervisor A's letter he wrote, "[Appellant) would use the EEO system, at his convenience, every time I would try to make mention of his job performance.... In my opinion, [appellant] was an employee who likes to use the systems available to him <span id="Page_1427"></span>to cover up the fact that he was incompeten[t] in his job performance." Manager B wrote: "[Appellant] claimed that he was discriminated against on several occasions and went to E.E.O. several times although discrimination was only alleged and never proven." Both these letters were submitted to OWCP as part of the controversion of appellant's claim. OWCP eventually denied appellant workers' compensation benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 8, 1994, appellant filed a formal EEO complaint with the agency alleging that Supervisor A and Manager B had unlawfully retaliated against him as referenced above. The agency accepted the complaint and conducted an investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, appellant requested an administrative hearing....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 19, 1995, the AJ issued a recommended decision concluding that the evidence of record supported a finding that appellant had been unlawfully retaliated because of his prior EEO activity as a result of the actions of his two former supervisors in connection with his OWCP claim. Specifically, the AJ found that the statements submitted to OWCP by Supervisor A and Manager B constituted "direct evidence" of reprisal on the basis of protected EEO activity, noting that such evidence "proves by itself what a respondent's motivation was in taking an adverse employment action." The AJ held that both statements characterized appellant's participation in the EEO process in a negative light and were made for the express purpose of persuading OWCP to deny appellant's claim for benefits. The AJ found that the agency offered no other reason for the references to appellant's EEO activities other than to discredit appellant in the eyes of OWCP as a chronic complainer. Based on this evidence, the AJ entered a finding of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a final decision dated October 4, 1995, the agency rejected the findings and conclusions of the AJ, and dismissed appellant's complaint for failure to state a claim. The agency asserted that EEOC regulations require that a complaint be filed with the agency that allegedly discriminated against the complainant. The agency found that appellant's OWCP claim did not involve his employment while under the Army's supervision and further asserted that Supervisor A and Manager B were not acting on behalf of the Department of the Army at the time the statements at issue were made, but rather as individuals responding to an action initiated by the Air Force. The agency concluded that "[s]ince the Army had no control over this action, it can not be held liable." From this decision that appellant now appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record in its entirety, including the statements submitted on appeal, the Commission finds that the AJ's recommended decision sets forth the relevant facts and properly analyzes the appropriate regulations, policies and laws. Nothing proffered by the agency in its final decision or on appeal differs significantly from the arguments presented at the hearing and given full consideration by the AJ. Therefore, the Commission finds that the evidence of record fully supports the AJ's finding of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's case law in this area is confusing, at best, and no clearly delineated rule has emerged.</p>
