<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-37_1"><span class="space">a.</span> Pre-ADAAA Case Law</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under case law prior to the ADAAA, in <span class="Italic">LeBate v. USPS</span>, 01851097 (1987), the Commission determined that temporary physical and mental impairment as the result of a sex change operation did not impact substantially on a major life function and, thus, the employee was not a qualified individual with a disability. The Commission found that the complainant had produced no evidence to show that transgender transsexualism is "a recognized physical impairment which substantially limits a person's major life activities..." and that she also had presented no specific evidence that the temporary effects limited a major life activity. (Note that under the ADA, transgender (previously "transsexualism") is specifically excluded as being a disability.) The Commission reached a similar decision in <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01931730 (1993). It is unclear from the Commission's decision to what extent the complainant introduced medical evidence regarding his condition and its effects upon major life activities. In any event, the Commission also found that the complainant's performance deficiencies, and not prohibited discrimination, were the reasons for his termination. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hieno v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994965 (2002) (no evidence that a wrist fracture was significant enough as to duration to establish disability); <span class="Italic">Wolfe v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993796 (2002) (evidence that a fractured knee cap required the complainant to be on crutches for six months was not of sufficient duration to establish disability where there was no evidence the condition continued to affect the complainant after that time).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a physical condition lasted several years and, during that time, substantially limited a major life activity, then the complainant was a qualified individual with a disability. The fact that the condition improved over a significant period of time did not prevent such a finding. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Flowers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984878 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence establishes that appellant was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease nearly four years before his release to full duty in 1996, and experienced chronic pain, exacerbated by heavy lifting, prolonged standing, squatting and certain repetitive movements. Following an automobile accident in early 1994, appellant's condition worsened and he was placed under numerous physical restrictions, which varied over time, but prevented him from performed a variety of manual tasks and resulted in a series of requests over two-and-one-half year period for reassignment to a light-duty position. Based on its examination of the medical evidence of record, and the testimony offered at the hearing, the Commission finds that appellant's physical impairment substantially limited his ability to engage in a wide range of manual tasks, rendering him an "individual with a disability" under the Rehabilitation Act<span class="Italic">. See Hawkins v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03000006 (February 11, 1999) (back injury rendered an employee substantially limited in major life activities where medical restrictions prohibited him for kneeling, stooping, pushing, pulling, heavy lifting, and standing or walking for over four hours).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although short-term, temporary restrictions generally are not substantially limiting, an impairment does not necessarily have to be static or permanent to rise to the level of a disability. Rather, the Commission has found that an impairment, although not permanent, meets the definition of a disability if it is "long lasting" and has "significantly restricted...major life activities for an extended period." <span class="Italic">See EEOC's Compliance Manual</span>, Volume 2, EEOC Order 915.002, Section 902, Definition of the Term "Disability," at 902-30 to 902-34 (March 14, 1995) (hereinafter referred to as "Compliance Manual"). In this case, the evidence shows that appellant had numerous physical restrictions because of his back condition which limited his ability to perform a wide range of manual tasks over a period of at least two-and-one-half years (February 1994 to September 1996). It was during this period that the agency denied his continuous requests for light-duty assignments, resulting in the instant EEO complaint. Moreover, the Commission notes that the evidence shows that many of appellant's physical restrictions were designed by his physician to lessen the likelihood of an exacerbation of his back condition. The Compliance Manual indicates that this type of situation, especially with back conditions, is substantially limiting because of its chronic nature. Compliance Manual at 902-34.</p>

Postmaster General</span>, 01985730 (2001) (lifting restriction that lasted two-and-a-half years was substantial limitation); <span class="Italic">Henry v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972312 (2001) (lifting restriction that lasted eight months was substantial limitation).</p>
<p class="noindent">But treatment for bronchitis that required supplemental oxygen for a period of two months did not substantially limit a major life activity. <span class="Italic">See Nuanez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990984 (2002). Similarly, a condition that imposed medical restrictions for 12 weeks did not rise to the level of a substantial limitation. <span class="Italic">See Dame v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11367 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a condition caused by a temporary disability abates, so too does the agency's obligation to provide accommodation. <span class="Italic">Chandler v. USPS</span>, 01841705 (1986). The agency did not discriminate against an employee by withdrawing the accommodation when her condition improved to the point where it was no longer required.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is error for the agency to reject a complaint prior to investigation on the basis that the disability is temporary. <span class="Italic">In re Veterans Administration</span>, 05860323 (1987). The Commission noted that the alleged temporary wrist injury had occurred some nine months prior to the EEO counselor's report and, apparently, had still not healed. The Commission found the agency was required to conduct an investigation to determine the duration of the disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although temporary conditions are not within the ambit of the Rehabilitation Act, the administrative judge errs when he determines, as a matter of law, that the appellant is not disabled without permitting the introduction of evidence on that issue. In <span class="Italic">Hall v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932840 (1993), the Commission remanded the case where the appellant suffered from a broken ankle, generally a temporary condition, but alleged that it still affected her ability to walk 18 months later. The Commission found the ruling of the administrative judge was tantamount to a determination on the merits without a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in the first instance, it is the responsibility of the agency to permit sufficient factual development in the investigative stage on the issue of the duration and nature of the claimed disability. In <span class="Italic">McGee v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01933127 (1994), the Commission found it was necessary to remand the case for further investigation where the agency dismissed the employee's claim that contagious hepatitis was a disabling condition on the basis that the condition was temporary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record indicates that appellant was restricted from working in areas where he may suffer from cuts or abrasions. The physician's medical statement provided that contagious hepatitis may be transmitted through blood contact and that until the infection clears appellant's system he should be allowed to work within the above referenced restrictions. The agency stated in its final decision that appellant's "[physician] did not give a date for appellant's complete recovery, nor did he indicate that the disability was permanent in nature." The agency then argues that since appellant's illness was diagnosed as transitory, he does not meet the definition of a person with a disability. Appellant argues on appeal that the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Arline</span> provided that persons suffering from contagious diseases, may be disabled pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. In apparent response, the agency states that the issue is not whether appellant is considered disabled because hepatitis is contagious, but rather whether appellant can be considered disabled because his disease is temporary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, the record at the present time does not adequately address whether appellant is a disabled person. First, the agency is correct if appellant's condition is merely transitory, then appellant would not be viewed as having physical impairment which substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880560 (September 22, 1988). However, the instant medical record does not adequately address the duration of the risk.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Commission notes appellant's argument that hepatitis may be comparable to tuberculosis (the disease discussed in <span class="Italic">Arline</span>) and therefore he is covered by the Rehabilitation Act. Again, for the above stated reasons the record is inadequate to address this argument. The medical record does not adequately address the severity of the risk of contagion, the nature of the risk or whether any of the risk will be recurring. Because the Commission is unable to determine from the record whether appellant is a person with a disability and subject to the protection of the Rehabilitation Act, we must remand appellant's complaint for a supplemental investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission had set no bright-line rule on the length of time that a condition must exist before it is considered to be more than transitory. However, a condition that lasted only a few months was not of sufficient duration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Conkle v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981545 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Melnure v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A31389 (2004), the Commission gave some guidance in distinguishing between temporary impairments that rose to the level of substantial limitations and those that did not:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03637 (February 1, 2002), the Commission noted that an impairment lasting eight months "arguably" constitutes a record of a disability. That case, however, is distinguishable from the instant matter. In <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> the employee fractured his leg in September 1994 and although he was able to return to work by November 1994 with his leg in a cast, in January 1995 he was under numerous medical restrictions, and in March 1995 his physician said that these restrictions were indefinite. It was not until April 1995, eight months after his injury, that his condition improved enough <span id="Page_1127"></span>to make his restrictions less onerous. In the present case, complainant underwent ankle surgery on January 25, 2000 and testified that he sought to return to work on or around March 6. 2000 with the restrictions of no lifting and no ladder-climbing. ROI, Affidavit B1, pp. 4-5, 10. Thus when he first sought to return to work, he had been recovering for less than two months. Significantly, however, he gave no indication of the length of time the restrictions would last, or even that their duration was unknown. While there may be instances in which it can be assumed, from the nature of a condition, that limitations will be permanent or long-term, that is not the case here. In fact, subsequent documentation, submitted in July (no lifting over 20 lbs., no ladder climbing), ROI, Exhibit Cl, and September (no ladder climbing), suggests that the condition was temporary in nature, improved steadily, and in fewer than eight months had shown significant improvement. Under the circumstances, complainant has presented insufficient evidence to establish that he had a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act when he sought to return to work in March.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that complainant fractured the ankle in 1993 or 1994 and had to wear a cast on the ankle during part of 1999. Complainant, however, presented no evidence of long term effects on a major life activity that were substantially limiting. Complainant's testimony in fact, indicates that any restrictions on these occasions were short-lived, ROI, Affidavit B1, pp 6-7, 12-13, 16, and furthermore, he has presented no evidence indicating that such restrictions were substantially limiting even during the periods they were in effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While a medical certificate dated September 5, 2000, stated "no climbing, no ladders," we find that, unlike lifting, ladder-climbing is not a major life activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, Definition of Term 'Disability' &#x00A7; 902.4(d) (examples of major life activities include caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, working, sitting, standing, and lifting, as well as mental and emotional processes such as thinking, concentrating, and interacting with others).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor does the evidence show that complainant had a record of an impairment that was substantially limiting, or that he was viewed as having such an impairment. As noted above, he had a record of intermittent restrictions, and we note that the supervisor testified that he did not consider complainant's ankle disorder to be a disability ROI, Affidavit B 2, p.4. For these reasons, we find that complainant is not a person with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. Thus, we find that the agency did not discriminate against him on the basis of disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the above, we find that the AJ's decision properly summarized the relevant facts and referenced the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws....</p>
