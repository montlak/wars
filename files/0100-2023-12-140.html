<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-134c"><span class="space">b.</span> Agency Policies Mandating Vaccinations</h5>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Colby S. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022000976 (2022), issued a directive requiring employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to weekly testing and wear masks. Colby S. maintained that neither were necessary for him because, as a result of contracting COVID-19, he had built up natural immunities to the virus and alleged that this requirement subjected him to religious discrimination. The agency in <span class="Italic">Colby S</span>. dismissed for failure to state a claim and the Commission agreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we conclude that the Agency has not erred in determining that Complainant's claim should be dismissed because it does not appear that he is presently an "aggrieved" employee. As an initial matter, we note that the EEO Counselor's Report indicates that Complainant asserted that the Agency granted him a religious exemption from being vaccinated. However, in his complaint and on appeal, Complainant claims that the mere existence of VA Directive 1193 has caused him to be stigmatized as a result of his religious decision not to be vaccinated, including possibly hurting his prospects for future advancement, and putting him on a "crash course for discipline and removal." However, Complainant does not contest the Agency's assertion on appeal that VA Directive 1193 was never enforced and, therefore, he has not been subjected to any of its requirements. The harm Complainant anticipates is speculative at best and EEOC precedent has long required that an aggrieved individual must suffer "present" harm in order to state a viable claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Diaz, id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, during EEO counseling, Complainant stated that the resolution he was seeking was "[f]or the VA Policy on COVID-19 to be updated to acknowledge natural immunity." However, it is unclear how this relates to his religious discrimination claim, and "natural immunity" is not a basis of prohibited discrimination under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude Complainant has failed to state a viable claim of discrimination that can be adjudicated within the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process because he does not allege that he is has suffered a present harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Norris D. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022004182 (2022), was similarly aggrieved where the agency refused his request for an exemption to the mandatory vaccination policy for medical reasons. The complaint alleged the denial amounted to disability discrimination. The agency dismissed the claim finding that the claim "amounted to a generalized grievance" because it related to COVID-19 vaccine policies which were uniformly applied to all employees, and the complainant was never actually required to vaccinate nor subject to any adverse action. The Commission disagreed in <span class="Italic">Norris D</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we conclude that Complainant's complaint was improperly dismissed pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1), for failure to state a claim. The essence of the subject claim is that Complainant has been denied a reasonable accommodation for a medical condition in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. Complainant further alleges that the Agency's unwillingness to approve his request for an exemption to the vaccine mandate, and alternatively use masking and testing, has resulted in his remaining on an extended unpaid leave. This allegation is sufficient to render Complainant aggrieved and require an investigation into his denial of accommodation claim. The Agency advances reasons for its decision—that the medical exemption to vaccination posed an undue hardship because the alternatives were insufficient to mitigate the safety risks to vulnerable patients in units such as intensive care where Complainant worked. However, that articulation addresses the merits of the complaint without an investigation as required by regulation and is irrelevant to the procedural issue of whether or not Complainant had stated a justiciable claim. <span class="Italic">See Osborne v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960111 (July 19, 1996); <span class="Italic">Lee v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930220 (August 12, 1993); <span class="Italic">Ferrazzoli v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910642 (August 15, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's encouragement of employees to vaccinate against COVID-19 does not render an employee aggrieved. That's what the Commission decided in <span class="Italic">Ryan L. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2021004679 (2022), where the complainant alleged discrimination based on religion, disability, and genetic information when the agency required all unvaccinated employees to wear masks at work. More specifically, in <span class="Italic">Ryan L</span>. the complainant contended:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]earing a mask amounts to a "medical practice" that requires his consent because it could have health consequences, including aspiration of airborne pathogens trapped in the mask. Complainant asserts that the mask mandate also is intended to force him to become vaccinated against COVID-19, another medical procedure he opposes. He asserts that the Agency has violated the "Nuremburg Code," a set of ethical principles concerning medical experimentation, in which one of the primary principles is the consent of the test subject.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld the dismissal for failure to state a claim in <span class="Italic">Ryan L.:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant is alleging that his compliance with the Agency's mask mandate, as well as its vaccination policy, violate the tenets of his religion and discriminates against him due to an unidentified disability. However, while Complainant has asserted he felt pressured to get vaccinated against COVID-19, he has not alleged that he was required to be vaccinated or was subjected to any disciplinary or other adverse employment action because he chose not to be vaccinated. As such, we find Complainant has failed to sufficiently allege that he is aggrieved with regard to the Agency's encouragement of vaccination by its employees. In addition, Title II of GINA has not been implicated by the Agency's vaccination policies, even if Complainant had agreed to be vaccinated, because there is no allegation that pre-vaccination medical screening involved questions about family medical history or any other type of genetic information. <span class="Italic">See</span> What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and Other EEO Laws, EEOC Technical Assistance Questions and Answers (updated on July 12, 2022), Questions K.14 and K.15. With regard to the mandate to wear a mask at work, Complainant has not alleged that he requested, and was denied, a reasonable accommodation to be exempt from wearing a mask due to a disabling medical condition and so again has not asserted a present harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission similarly upheld dismissal of the complainant's religious discrimination claim based on the agency's requirement that he self-administer a nasal swab test for COVID-19 weekly in <span class="Italic">Reese W. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022002734 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_229"></span>Here, we conclude that the Agency has not erred in determining that Complainant's claim should be dismissed because it does not appear that he is presently an "aggrieved" employee. The sole basis identified by Complainant in his EEO complaint, as well as during EEO counseling, was discrimination because of his religion. However, it is undisputed that the Agency granted Complainant, a registered nurse at an Agency medical facility, an exemption from being vaccinated against COVID-19 as a requested religious accommodation. In lieu of vaccination, the Agency required him to engage in weekly testing for COVID-19 to avoid the spread of the disease at the medical facility. <span class="Italic">See</span> What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and Other EEO Laws, EEOC Technical Assistance Questions and Answers—Updated on July 12, 2022, Question A.6 (if job-related and consistent with business necessity, employers can require mandatory COVID-19 viral testing to evaluate an employee's continued presence in the workplace). Ultimately, Complainant consented to take the COVID-19 test, but now alleges he was physically harmed by the test. However, what Complainant has described is a potential claim of job-related physical injury that might serve as the basis for a workers' compensation claim, but not a viable claim of religious discrimination in violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Colby S. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2022000976 (April 18, 2022).</p>
<p class="noindent">To be aggrieved, the complainant must allege actual harm. In <span class="Italic">Norris D. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022004182 (2022), the complainant did just that where he alleged the agency's refusal to approve his request for an exemption to the agency's mandatory vaccination policy resulted in a failure to accommodate and his need to remain on extended unpaid leave:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the period at issue, Complainant worked for the Agency as a Registered Nurse in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at the Agency's Medical Center in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Agency instituted a policy that required all health care personnel to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This policy apparently provided for exceptions based upon medical, religious, or pregnancy reasons. Complainant alleged that he requested an exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for medical reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that on April 15, 2022, he received written notice that his request was denied because it had been determined that the accommodation would pose an "undue hardship" for the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 14, 2022, Complainant filed a formal complaint alleging that the Agency subjected him to discrimination based on disability (adverse cardiac reaction to initial COVID-19 vaccination diagnosed resulting in inability/unwillingness to receive further vaccinations) when, on April 15, 2022, Agency management advised Complainant that his request for an exemption to its COVID-19 vaccine mandate was being denied. Complainant also alleged that on May 11, 2022, he received an additional notification from the Agency which stated, "[i]t has been determined that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your current &#x00A7; disability(ies)...." In response, Complainant asserted he submitted further documentation from his medical provider and again requested an exemption from vaccination, with masking and testing in the alternative. Complainant alleged the Agency refused to reconsider its decision denying him the exemption. In his brief submitted on appeal, Complainant has asserted he has remained on "unpaid leave ever since."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 22, 2022, the Agency issued a final decision dismissing the formal complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1). The Agency found that Complainant's claim amounted to a generalized grievance because his claim related to the Agency's COVID-19 vaccine policies which it asserts have been applied uniformly to all similarly-situated Agency employees. The Agency also asserted Complainant was not aggrieved because he was not required to be vaccinated and was not subjected to any adverse action as a result of not receiving further vaccinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we conclude that Complainant's complaint was improperly dismissed pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1), for failure to state a claim. The essence of the subject claim is that Complainant has been denied a reasonable accommodation for a medical condition in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. Complainant further alleges that the Agency's unwillingness to approve his request for an exemption to the vaccine mandate, and alternatively use masking and testing, has resulted in his remaining on an extended unpaid leave. This allegation is sufficient to render Complainant aggrieved and require an investigation into his denial of accommodation claim. The Agency advances reasons for its decision—that the medical exemption to vaccination posed an undue hardship because the alternatives were insufficient to mitigate the safety risks to vulnerable patients in units such as intensive care where Complainant worked. However, that articulation addresses the merits of the complaint without an investigation as required by regulation and is irrelevant to the procedural issue of whether or not Complainant had stated a justiciable claim. <span class="Italic">See Osborne v.
