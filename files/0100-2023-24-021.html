<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-22"><span class="space">1.</span> Proving Undue Hardship</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is not sufficient that the agency merely articulate a reason an accommodation would be an undue hardship. The undue hardship burden is a "rigorous one" and the agency must "prove convincingly" that such a hardship actually exists. <span class="Italic">Swafford v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01831944 (1984). The agency failed to meet its burden, even though it gave the appellant extra time to find another position within the agency, since it made no attempt to show that an accommodation could not be provided for the job he held before termination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency does not carry its burden by demonstrating that accommodation would be inconvenient. A mere loss of supervisors' flexibility in making work assignments is not an undue burden where the employee could perform 80-90% of the job duties and the agency accommodated him for a two-year period prior to his termination. <span class="Italic">Bridges v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01790826 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further explained the agency's burden in <span class="Italic">Lopez, et al. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03910091, 03910092 (1991). After determining that the complainants had impairments which substantially limited a major life activity, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lopez</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found the petitioners meet the threshold requirement which would entitle them to the protection of the Rehabilitation Act, the next inquiry is whether petitioners have established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination. Under pertinent analysis of cases alleging handicap discrimination, it is incumbent upon a handicapped person to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. United States Postal Service</span>, 662 F.2d 292 (Fifth Circuit 1991). A necessary component of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination is a showing that petitioners are "qualified handicapped persons" within the meaning of 29 CFR 1613.702(f). That section defines "qualified handicapped person" as meaning, with respect to employment, "a handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the <span class="Italic">position in question</span> without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...." (Emphasis supplied). The Commission has previously determined that the phrase "position in question" is not limited to the position occupied or held by the employee, but also includes positions which the employee could have held as a result of reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03840005 (September 4, 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, Special Panel No. 1 (February 27, 1986). Reassignment is authorized by Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act's affirmative action requirement and Congressional intent that the federal government be a model employer of persons with disabilities. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the agency erred when it determined that it did not consider reassignment as a possible accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question thus presented by these cases is whether the agency truly "considered" petitioners for reassignment, <span class="Italic">i</span>.<span class="Italic">e</span>., whether the agency adequately established that reassigning petitioners would have resulted in an undue burden. The AJ found that the agency met this burden. Although he acknowledged that petitioners' suggested modifications to the PDP program were worthy of agency consideration, he found that petitioner-1 was not entitled to reassignment to the single position for which he was referred, and petitioner-2 was not entitled to any of the seven positions for which he was referred. The AJ did not elaborate on this finding. He merely held that the agency has "unfettered discretion" as to whether it will waive a qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission acknowledges that the agency is not required to reassign a handicapped employee to a position for which he/she is not qualified. In this regard, the Commission recognizes that the duty of the agency to provide reasonable accommodation is limited by the concept of "undue hardship." Nonetheless, if the agency argues that it would unduly burden its operation to reassign a handicapped employee because he/she is not qualified for the vacancy, the Commission finds that it is incumbent upon the agency to submit evidence which supports this conclusion. Such evidence can only be produced after an individualized assessment, which considers the employee's abilities and limitations as they relate to particular job requirements. This process is a process of matching an individual employee with a particular job for the purpose of providing an equal employment opportunity. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">The United States Commission on Civil Rights</span>, <span class="Italic">Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities</span> (1983).... The Commission finds that in the instant case the agency failed to produce evidence establishing that an individualized assessment was done, and based upon the results of the assessment, petitioners were not qualified for any vacancy. Therefore, the agency failed to meet its burden of showing that reassigning petitioners 1 and 2 would result in an undue hardship on the agency's operation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency bears the burden of proof to show not only that accommodation would impose an undue burden, but that it actually considered accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In most cases, agencies fail to demonstrate that a specific accommodation would create an undue hardship because they fail to present specific evidence of the effects of an accommodation on its operations instead relying upon the conclusory testimony of supervisors that the accommodation would create an undue hardship. An agency's rejection of a reasonable accommodation request must be specific and detailed in order to withstand an employee's challenge to the agency's efforts. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Wilmer M. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120160352 (2018), for example, held that the agency did not satisfy its obligation to engage in the interactive process with conclusory statements that the accommodations could not be provided because of the nature of the employee's position or because they are "outside the scope of reasonable accommodations" where the complainant made requests that were "specific, reasonable and not only possible, but have been recommended by the EEOC and other reasonable accommodation experts. The Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Wilmer M</span>., noted that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act with its "conclusory rejection" of more than a dozen possible accommodations suggested by the complainant without any showing of undue hardship:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, as set forth in the Agency's final decision, Complainant first told his Director in February 2014 that he had PTSD. In April 2014, Complainant contacted the Agency's Disability Reasonable Accommodation Division (DRAD). On September 17, 2014, Complainant submitted a reasonable accommodation request form, that listed approximately eight accommodations. According to the Agency, he also provided a Medical Questionnaire for Assessment of Disabilities/Reasonable Accommodations executed by his doctor, as well as a letter from his doctor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More than six weeks later, on November 3, 2014, the individual assigned to Complainant's request (hereinafter "DRAD-S") emailed Complainant to set up a time to meet. Days later, DRAD-S sent Complainant a link to the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) Guidance, asking him to review the information and respond with specific accommodations he believed would be helpful. On November 19, 2014, after reviewing the information over the weekend, Complainant responded with a list of more than a dozen possible accommodations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, regarding his "lack of concentration," Complainant suggested the following options: a reduction in distractions in the work environment; space enclosures or a private space; and planned uninterrupted work time. In order to improve his time management and completion of tasks, Complainant sought weekly meetings with his supervisor, manager or mentor. He asked that his supervisor provide feedback at the end of the day instead of during each task, in an effort to maintain his focus. Complainant suggested a flexible start time or end time, a "straight shift" or "permanent schedule," and a modification to the Agency's attendance policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an email dated December 5, 2014, DRAD-S responded to Complainant's request. After acknowledging that Complainant was found to be a person with a disability and "approved" to receive reasonable accommodations, DRAD-S stated that none of the fourteen accommodations requested could be provided "due to either the nature of your position or said accommodations being outside the scope of reasonable accommodations." Each accommodation was listed and broadly rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, the reduction of distractions, planning for uninterrupted work time, and modifying the attendance policy were simply considered by the Agency to be "outside of the scope of reasonable accommodations." According to the Agency, providing partitions or a private space, were not possible due to "the nature of your position." Permitting time-off for Complainant to attending counseling, was denied as "not a reasonable accommodation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Agency failed to show undue hardship when it failed to grant any of Complainant's requested accommodations. We acknowledge that some of the accommodations requested by Complainant may have been overly broad (i.e. restructure job to include only essential functions, and modify attendance policy). The Agency, however, should have responded with follow-up questions and engaged in the "interactive process."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Many of Complainant's requested accommodations were specific, reasonable and not only possible, but have been recommended by the EEOC and other reasonable accommodation experts. The Agency, however, erroneously dismissed Complainant's request, for example, for reduced distractions and uninterrupted work time as "outside the scope of reasonable accommodation." As noted above, providing employees with a quiet work area, through a variety of methods, is a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, Complainant asked that his supervisor provide daily feedback at one point of the day. According to Complainant, whose impairment has an impact upon his focus and concentration, "constant interruptions" by his supervisor did not allow him to perform his job effectively. Instead, he asked that the supervisor's instructions be given at the end of the day. As discussed in the Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: <span id="Page_1280"></span>Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC No. 915.002 (March 1, 1999), "An employer does not have to provide an employee with a new supervisor as a reasonable accommodation...[but] the ADA may require that supervisory methods be altered as a form of reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 46. The Agency erred in denying Complainant's request as beyond the scope of a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's denial of many other suggested accommodations, due to "the nature of your position" are not supported by the record. For example, the Agency asserted that it was unable to provide Complainant with an enclosure or private space, or work from home part-time simply because of his position "requires you to be available to the public." A review of his position performance evaluations, however, reference both "desk adjudications" and "counter adjudications," suggesting that desk adjudications could possibly be completed in a private area or at home. Additionally, his Position Description describes tasks such as the following: analyzing facts, documentary evidence, and affidavits; researching policy and regulatory material; and expressing decisions clearly and concisely in both written and oral form. It is unclear how such responsibilities could not be performed in an enclosed office or from home. Similarly, the Agency failed to describe why specifically it could not modify Complainant's start time. Based on our review of Complainant's job description, it seems reasonable and possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to show that providing any of the many requested reasonable accommodations would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Petitioner v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320110053 (July 10, 2014). The Agency's broad rejection does not reflect the specificity required of an individualized assessment, nor a consideration of the factors comprising an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we are troubled by the Agency's lack of participation in the interactive process. The numerous emails between DRAD-S and Complainant reflect that the Agency continually placed the burden exclusively on Complainant to propose accommodations. We note that in its December 5, 2014 email to Complainant, rejecting his second submission of numerous possible accommodation, DRAD-S noted that he was "working with management to come up with alternatives...." However, not only did the Agency fail to suggest any alternatives, but it proceeded to blame Complainant for the alleged breakdown in the interactive process when he did not respond with more alternatives, in what would have been his third submission. It is not surprising that Complainant described the process to obtain a reasonable accommodation for his disability as on that "created additional stress because I did everything I was asked to do to receive the accommodations and it was all denied--which was highly discouraging and made me feel hopeless and unsupported."</p>
<p class="noindent">A last-minute need for an accommodation does not rise to the level of undue burden, especially where the disability is known and accommodated in the past. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Darius C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020000613 (2021), where the agency failed to provide interpretative services for a hearing-impaired employee during a last-minute meeting called to relay that there had been a COVID-19 positive individual at the work site. The complainant alleged that the agency's failures at this meeting and one other left him unable to participate in the meeting and to ask questions. The agency defended that "due to the exigent circumstances of the emergency meeting, it was not a violation when management failed to provide Complainant with his preferred accommodation of a live interpreter" and it effectively communicated the happenings at both meetings by providing the complainant with pertinent meeting notes. Emphasizing the fact that the agency had previously provided interpretive services to the complainant, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Darius C</span>., held the agency failed to provide the complainant with a reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant has essentially alleged a denial of an effective reasonable accommodation when the Agency failed to provide effective interpreter services during the October 30, 2018 CFC event and the emergency May 13, 2020 meeting. The Commission has previously found that an employer must provide reasonable accommodation to enable an employee with a disability to have equal access to information communicated in the workplace. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (March 1, 1999) at question 14. We have previously held that "for a severely hearing-impaired employee who can sign, reasonable accommodation, at a minimum, requires providing an interpreter for safety talks, discussions on work procedures, policies or assignments, and for every disciplinary action so that the employee can understand what is occurring at any and every crucial time in his employment career, whether or not he asks for an interpreter." <span class="Italic">Feris v. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01934828 (Aug. 10, 1995); <span class="Italic">see also Funk v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01984772 (July 27, 2001); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01982321 (Feb. 2, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Rehabilitation Act requires that an agency reasonably accommodate hearing-impaired employees by providing effective interpreter services during work-related activities where hearing-impaired employees are expected to be present. <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05960270 (Oct. 16, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency officials here noted that Complainant was repeatedly accommodated in the past as an effort to demonstrate that the Agency adheres to the Rehabilitation Act. Past accommodation only serves to emphasize the Agency's failure to provide effective reasonable accommodations during both work place events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the October 30, 2018 CFC event, RMO2 acknowledged that the Agency failed to provide a sign language interpreter during the event but asserted that management arranged to have an interpreter present for a second and equal CFC event presentation on November 2, 2018. RMO2 also noted that she provided Complainant, and other hearing-impaired employees, the opportunity to communicate with any of the charity representatives after the oriGINAl event. RMO1 and RMO2 asserted that the second event provided Complainant an effective accommodation. Complainant asserted that the secondary event was segregated and did not give him a chance to understand and contribute to the discussion portion of the October 30, 2018 CFC event, and/or communicate with the charity representatives, who could not attend the second event.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the May 13, 2020 event, RMO3 and RMO4 repeatedly asserted that it was the emergency nature of the meeting that barred them from scheduling a sign language interpreter. Despite the lack of in-person interpretation, RMO3 and RMO4 asserted that Complainant essentially received an effective alternative accommodation when management exchanged notes during the meeting. RMO3 and RMO4 asserted that the notes sufficed to provide the pertinent information. Complainant asserted that he was again shut out from the conversation that occurred. We remind the Agency that the Commission has previously found that providing written materials does not excuse an agency from its obligation to provide a deaf employee with an interpreter simply because the employee can otherwise understand written material. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05880750 (Apr. 18, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Complainant did not request the presence of a sign language interpreter at either event, Agency management was well aware that he needed and was entitled to such a reasonable accommodation. Moreover, even if an in-person interpreter was unavailable on the last-minute May 13, 2020 meeting, the Agency had access to Video Remote Interpreting (VRI), or Video Relay Service (VRS) as per its own April 2017 Reasonable Accommodation, An Interactive Process Handbook EL-307 (Handbook), which also refers individuals to a separate September 9, 2013 Management Instruction (MI) guideline titled, MI Providing Communication Accommodations for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, EL-670-2013-6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, this issue is a recurring concern at this facility, particularly with management failing to utilize all available interpretation services when an in-person interpreter is unavailable. <span class="Italic">Coralee H. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172277 (Feb. 15, 2019) (finding that the management at the same facility failed to provide complainant videophone and video remote interpreting services). The record demonstrated that effective alternatives to a live sign language interpreter services were feasible and readily available for this facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record, we find that the Agency failed to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, when interpretation services were not provided during the October 30, 2018 CFC event and May 13, 2020 emergency COVID-19 meeting. Moreover, what was provided in terms of the second CFC event fails to qualify as an effective accommodation as it lacked the charity representatives from the first event and did not make up for Complainant's inability to engage in the discussions and interactions provided to other employees at the oriGINAl event.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the record and history at this facility, we find that the Agency is clearly aware of its obligations to reasonably accommodate Complainant, and other hearing-impaired employees. Additionally, Complainant previously filed a complaint on the same issue where the Commission found that management failed to provide an interpreter, or an effective alternative. <span class="Italic">Darius C. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120160004 (Nov. 1, 2016) (Agency failed to provide interpreter during a scheduled service talk); <span class="Italic">see also Darius C. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120171165 (Oct. 12, 2018) (Agency ordered to pay $1,000 in nonpecuniary damages).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record, including those not specifically addressed herein, we find that the Agency failed to engage in good faith efforts to provide Complainant with an effective reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission then proceeded to audit the agency's reasonable accommodation handbook, finding the content lacking in two principal respects. First, the manual failed to establish that providing a hearing-impaired <span id="Page_1281"></span>employee with "notes" from a meeting does not qualify as a reasonable accommodation. Second, the policy excused management from providing a reasonable accommodation where an interpreter cancels or is a no show. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Darius C</span>. clarified the agency's obligations and ordered the agency to work with the Federal Sector Programs to issue "updated and compliant" policies and procedures in accordance with the following findings:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's MD-715 is the policy guidance which the Commission provides to federal agencies for their use in establishing and maintaining effective programs of equal employment opportunity under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. MD-715 provides a roadmap for ensuring that all employees and applicants for employment enjoy equality of opportunity in the federal workplace regardless of race, sex, national origin, color, religion, disability, or reprisal for engaging in prior protected EEO activity. Compliance with MD-715 is mandatory for all Executive agencies. See Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Management Directive 715 (MD-715) ("Responsibilities") ("Agency Heads are responsible for the following: 1. Ensuring compliance with this Directive and those implementing instructions issued by EEOC in accordance with existing law and authority."). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.103(b)(2) ("This part applies to...Executive agencies as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105..."); and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102(e) ("Agency [EEO] programs shall comply with this part and the Management Directives and Bulletins that the Commission issues").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we acknowledge that the Agency provided a copy of its April 2017 Reasonable Accommodation, An Interactive Process Handbook EL-307 (Handbook) regarding reasonable accommodation. The Handbook generally outlines the Agency's policy and obligations on procedures, guidance, and instructions on reasonable accommodation matters. While the Handbook does not cover details regarding accommodations for hearing-impaired or deaf employees, it does refer individuals to a separate Management Instruction (MI) guideline titled, MI Providing Communication Accommodations for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, EL-670-2013-6, and last updated September 9, 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While this MI covers a variety of matters related to accommodations for the deaf and hard of hearing, we conclude that the MI fails to effectively communicate the EEO policies and procedures in accordance with MD-715 because it does not clearly establish that written, exchanged notes do not qualify as an effective, reasonable accommodation. In the instant complaint, the Agency argued that the May 13, 2020 emergency meeting qualified as an exigent circumstance under the MI. The Agency argued that as such, management did not violate Complainant's rights when they only provided passed notes regarding the COVID-19 emergency meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, providing written materials does not excuse an agency from its obligation to provide a deaf employee with an interpreter simply because the employee can otherwise understand written material. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05880750 (Apr. 18, 1989). The MI's guidelines fail to make this abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the MI provides that management is not in violation of the MI if there is a cancellation or failure of an in-person interpreter to appear as scheduled. The MI deems a cancellation or no-show as an exigent circumstance which releases the Agency of its obligation to provide interpretation services at an event. The MI further only requires the Agency to provide an accommodation as soon as "reasonably" as possible. This policy fails to consider that should there be a cancellation or a no-show, the Agency still has effective alternative methods, such as Video Remote Interpreting (VRI), or Video Relay Service (VRS), and should make every reasonable effort to provide such alternative resources to the employee(s) on the same day as the oriGINAlly scheduled in-person interpretation. The current MI indicates that should an in-person interpreter cancel or fail to show, then an Agency is free of its obligations until it can "reasonably" reschedule. What the MI guidelines fail to make clear is that should in-person interpretation cancel or is a no-show, then the Agency is still obligated to attempt scheduling of VRI or VRS services. <span class="Italic">See Coralee H. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172277 (Feb. 15, 2019). To this end, we find that the Agency shall work with the Commission's Federal Sector Programs to update and issue its reasonable accommodation procedures as ordered below.</p>
<p class="noindent">See <a href="0100-2023-11-001.html#sec2-1">Chapters 2</a><span class="blue">, and</span> <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec3-1">3</a> for more on COVID-19; and see "<a href="0100-2023-24-080.html#sec15-61">COVID-19 Considerations</a>" later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, an agency meets its burden of establishing an undue hardship when it presents specific evidence that accommodating the complainant would prevent other employees from doing their jobs. For example, in <span class="Italic">Liebsch v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A21614 (2003), the Commission found that the agency had established undue hardship in declining to modify the complainant's work hours as an accommodation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Liebsch</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that complainant was an individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act and the medical note constituted an accommodation request, the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act in failing to accommodate complainant. In so finding, we note that the Commission has held that an employer must make reasonable accommodation to enable an otherwise qualified employee with a disability to meet a conduct standard (such as tardiness) in the future, barring undue hardship, except where the punishment for the violation is termination. Enforcement Guidance at question 36. The Commission has also held that if the result of modifying one employee's work hours (or granting leave) is to prevent other employee's from doing their jobs, then the significant disruption to the operations of the employer constitutes an undue hardship. Enforcement Guidance at question 43. As such, we find that the agency has demonstrated that it would have been an undue hardship to accommodate complainant's reasonable accommodation request. In so finding, we note the testimony of S1 that complainant usual reporting time was 8:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, and her position required her to be at work at the scheduled time as she had to open the office, answer the phones and greet agency customers. Further, S1 stated that when complainant was not in the office at the required time, she and other employees had to perform complainant's job duties to the detriment of their own work. S1 noted that she met with complainant on several occasions to explain to her that she was required to be at the facility at the scheduled times, and stated that complainant understood her job requirements but continued to be AWOL. In the instant case, we find that due to the specific nature of complainant's position, and the fact that other employees could not do their work if they had to perform complainant's job, the agency demonstrated that accommodating complainant would have constituted an undue hardship. Further, we find that there is no evidence in the record that complainant or her physician proffered evidence suggesting that she could have been accommodated by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">That the agency must submit evidence to support its contention that accommodation would impose an undue hardship was emphasized by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Orosz v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01970955 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the above finding, the burden now shifts to the agency to show that no reasonable accommodation of complainant's disability is possible, or that the suggested accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency<span class="Italic">. Prewitt v. United States Postal Service</span>, 662, F.2d 292 (5th Cir. 1980). The Commission finds that the agency has not met this burden. When provided with complainant's suggestions for a reasonable accommodation, the RO refused to consider such in light of his assessment that complainant could not perform an essential function (rotation to other sites) of the GS-11 position. We note that the only explanation the RO offered as to why he could not provide a reasonable accommodation by waiving the rotational requirement for complainant was that the small staff working for the System Development Group was already overtaxed. We find that this explanation is not adequate in order to satisfy the agency's obligation for providing a reasonable accommodation. The agency's conclusory statement regarding the "overtaxed staff" does not establish an undue hardship. For instance, the agency has not explained how often emergencies or extenuating circumstances have occurred in the past in support of its cause to amend the position. Furthermore, other than explaining why complainant's accommodation suggestions are not possible, the agency does not offer any of its own reasonable accommodations. Under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(p), in determining whether accommodation is reasonable, the agency should consider a number of factors, including, for example, the nature and net cost of the accommodation needed; the overall financial resources of the facility involved, the number of persons employed at such facility, and the effect on expenses and resources; and the impact of the accommodation upon the operation of the facility. We further note that the agency is not limited to considering only those accommodations specifically requested by the employee<span class="Italic">. See Walsh v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01853056. Since we find that the agency made no attempt to show that an accommodation could not be provided for the GS-11 position, the agency failed to meet its burden to show an undue hardship. Accordingly, we find that complainant has met her burden of establishing that she was subjected to disability discrimination when she was denied a reasonable accommodation in order to perform the duties of the GS-11 promotion position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the single greatest agency shortcoming in reasonable accommodation cases is the failure to fully appreciate the need to actually prove, through the submission of evidence, that a proposed accommodation would impose an undue hardship on its operations. Two cases illustrate this point. In <span class="Italic">Vitale v. Social Security Administration</span>, 02980014 (2001), the agency failed to demonstrate that providing a full-time interpreter to the complainant would impose an undue hardship on its operations. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Vitale</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only question remaining is whether the agency met its legal obligation under the Rehabilitation Act to reasonably accommodate grievant. Grievant requested either a full-time or a part-time interpreter or job restructuring to facilitate her "hardship transfer" to a Svce Rep, GS-8 position. Rather than provide the grievant with her requested accommodations, the agency offered and grievant accepted, out of necessity, a clerical, GS-5 position. Unless to do so would impose an undue hardship, the agency was obligated to provide grievant a full-time <span id="Page_1282"></span>or part-time interpreter or to provide some other effective reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. See</span> Enforcement Guidance. The agency, however, was not required by regulation to restructure the Svce Rep job by reallocating an essential function, such as face-to-face interviewing<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR app. 1630.2(o). The agency stated that the above-cited accommodations would impose an undue hardship because they were economically unfeasible. However, the agency did not provide any detailed data to support its contention that such an accommodation would be an undue hardship, but instead made only general conclusory statements about the associated economic hardship. Considering the overall size of the agency, which during the period at issue was approximately 60,000 employees in over 1300 nationwide facilities; the fact that a profoundly deaf claims representative in the agency's Washington, DC field office had an interpreter for 35 1/2 hours per week; and the intent of Congress that the Federal government undertake measures to reasonably accommodate that would involve more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost; we find that the cost of hiring either a full-time or part-time interpreter for grievant would not be an undue hardship. Accordingly, the agency has failed to meet its obligation to reasonably accommodate grievant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Kearns v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01986333 (2001), the Commission found the agency proved it would impose an undue hardship on the agency's operations to permit the employee to work at home on a part-time basis as an accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, the Commission finds that the reasonable accommodation requested by complainant involved working on a part-time basis from home. We note that complainant had Intelligence Specialist position for three months; did not possess any expertise in Marine Air Ground Task Force intelligence; and was supposed to have the system software developed and accredited by June 1994. In his absence from work, other agency personnel were working up to 100 hours per week on the project. In addition to developing and testing the system, complainant was to act as a coordinator between the programmers and the Fleet Marine Force personnel who would operate the system. This required traveling to numerous sites and observing field operations, and complainant also had to have access to classified material that was kept at Camp Pendleton. In light of complainant's inability to travel to his work site and the critical deadlines the Intelligence Analysis System was facing, we find that the agency established that to accommodate complainant in his position would have posed an undue hardship on the agency. We further find that there were no vacant, funded positions to which complainant could have been reassigned for which he was qualified and which could have been performed on a part-time basis from his home. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination. Furthermore, we find that complainant has not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency's decision to grant him leave without pay and leave under the Family Medical Leave Act was motivated by retaliatory animus. After a careful review of the record and for the reasons set forth herein, we discern no basis to disturb the Administrative Judge's finding of no discrimination, and we affirm the agency's final decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">A particularly good description of the agency's burden and means of proof is provided in <span class="Italic">Rice v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120064438 (2008). In that case, the complainant contended that her disability required the reasonable accommodation of working at home. The Commission found that, assuming the complainant was a qualified individual with a disability, the agency had proved the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency where the essential functions of the position could not be performed at home. The Commission also found that there was no failure to accommodate in a several month delay in finding a reassignment position where the complainant presented no evidence that any other positions were available earlier. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rice</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden is on the agency to provide case-specific evidence proving that reasonable accommodation would cause an undue hardship in the particular circumstances. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett,</span> 122 S. Ct. 1516, 1523 (2002). Generalized conclusions will not suffice to support a claim of undue hardship. Instead, undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Order No. 915.002, p. 54-55 (October 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that complainant established that she is a qualified individual with a disability, we find that complainant failed to establish that the agency discriminated against her when it did not allow her to work from home. A careful review of the record reveals that the accommodation complainant requested would not have been effective because complainant could not perform the essential functions of the position from home and it would have caused an undue hardship on the agency. Specifically, the agency policy which did not permit Special Agents to work from home reflects the fact that the criminal investigative work carried out by the agency's Special Agents does not lend itself to working from home. For example, the essential functions of the Special Agents in the OIG office include a significant amount of time in the field conducting interviews, executing search warrants and surveillances, making arrests, assisting in wiretaps, meeting with prosecutors, witnesses, other law enforcement agents, and confidential sources. Additionally, the work complainant sought to bring home was particularly unsuitable for work at home insofar as it involved highly confidential and protected grand jury material which generally cannot be removed from the office and must be safeguarded at all times, as per rule 16(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Had complainant worked from home she would not have been able to perform the essential functions of her position, resulting in the accommodation being ineffective and creating an undue hardship for the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Rehabilitation Act entitles qualified individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodation, it does not necessarily entitle them to the accommodation of their choice. <span class="Italic">See Castaneda v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01931005 (Feb. 17, 1994); <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Question 9 (rev. Oct. 17, 2002). In this case, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that complainant is an individual with a disability, it is clear that complainant required reassignment to a position which would have provided her with a reasonable accommodation and allowed her to perform the essential functions of the job. While the agency did eventually offer complainant such a reassignment, it was not until nine months after complainant's initial request for a reasonable accommodation. It is complainant's burden, however, to make the showing that there was some other vacant position at the agency for which she qualified and to which she could have been reassigned as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Gruber v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120064068 (January 3, 2008). Complainant failed to make this showing, and thus failed to establish that the agency failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. Complainant also failed to offer any evidence that her national origin or sex was a motivating factor in the agency's decision to not allow her to work from home. Therefore, we find complainant failed to establish that the agency's actions were motivated by discrimination and we AFFIRM the agency's finding of no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Moreover, while cost is a consideration in whether a particular accommodation is reasonable, the agency is not making a simple "business decision" about the employment of disabled persons. In <span class="Italic">Laughlin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953571 (1997), the agency attempted to justify its exclusion of potential employees who were deemed to pose a moderate risk to their own health on the basis that it was more prudent, from a cost perspective, to hire employees who posed no risk. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Laughlin</span>, rejected that argument finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission finds particularly troubling the statement in the final agency decision that given "the pool of employees from which to select, it was a prudent business decision...which led to [appellant] not being hired." The final agency decision was executed on behalf of the Manager, Human Resources for the Southeast Area Office. This statement lends itself to being construed as a declaration that no prudent business would consider hiring individuals with disabilities so long as a suitable applicant pool of non-disabled individuals was available. The expression of such a misconception of the agency's obligations by the Manager of Human Resources for an area office indicates that the agency's need to educate its officials is not limited to officials in one small facility.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Preston v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120054230 (2007), the Commission rejected an agency argument that providing the complainant with a straight eight-hour shift would be an undue hardship because it would require the agency to incur overtime costs. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Preston</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has not provided specific information concerning exactly what the cost would be to the agency if it were to provide complainant with a straight 8 hour shift, nor has it provided information concerning the overall budget of the facility, or of the agency. As noted above, in determining whether an accommodation is too costly, we are required to consider the overall financial resources (budget) of the agency, and not simply the resources of the facility in question. Here, we are not persuaded that the reasonable accommodation that complainant sought was so costly as to impose an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lisner v. USPS</span>, 01832069 (1986), the Commission noted that the obligation to make detailed determinations with respect to undue hardship rests upon the agency in the first instance. Although the agency may obtain outside help, it cannot place the onus of the decision on a state rehabilitation center. The Commission remanded the case to the agency to determine if the employee's disability of severe depression could be accommodated without imposing an undue burden on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">To fulfill its reasonable accommodation obligations, the agency must make an "individualized assessment of an employee's impairment and qualifications and of possible accommodations..." prior to deciding that an accommodation would impose an undue burden. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Army</span>, 03910110 (1992). "Such an evaluation necessarily requires the gathering of substantial information by the employee...since it was the intent of Congress to prevent <span id="Page_1283"></span>employers from refusing to give much needed opportunities to handicapped individuals on the basis of misinformed stereotypes." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, (quoting <span class="Italic">Mantolete v. Bolger</span>, 767 F.2d 1416, 1422 (9th Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bustamante v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a41462.txt">01A41462</a> (2005), the Commission found that it would impose an undue hardship to accommodate the employee by insuring that she would not encounter two other employees that triggered severe psychological symptoms for her. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bustamonte</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the record, complainant presented medical documentation reflecting that she was disabled with a psychiatric disorder, but that she was able to work as long as she had no contact whatsoever with M and S. Based on our review of the medical evidence of record, we find that complainant's restrictions precluded any contact with M or S, even indirectly, as this would cause complainant to experience disabling psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, to provide a reasonable accommodation for complainant, the agency had to completely eliminate the possibility of contact with M and S. The record further reflects that the agency reviewed complainant's medical documentation, and determined that it could not provide complainant with this accommodation without undue hardship. Specifically, the agency determined that both M and S have duties (secret shopper and audit duties) which might bring them into contact with complainant irrespective of where the agency might reassign her within the district, and to restrict M and S in performing these duties would create an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the incidents at issue occurred before June 20, 2002, such that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g) was applicable. Under that regulation, an agency satisfied its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act when it searched for a vacant funded position for a complainant within the local commuting area only as a reasonable accommodation. In this case, the agency satisfied this obligation based on record evidence that it determined that a risk of contact existed no matter which facility within the district complainant was reassigned. The agency indicated that it would be an undue hardship to keep M and S from ever entering complainant's work facility because their duties require at least occasional presence at facilities throughout the district.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful review, we find that requiring the agency to eliminate all risk of contact between complainant and M and S constitutes an undue hardship. Even restricting M and S from entering complainant's work facility would not be sufficient to eliminate this risk. In particular, we note record evidence that after the agency returned complainant to work in September 2000, following the OWCP's determination, complainant had occasion to attend an all-employee conference on diversity goals, on March 17, 2001, where M and S were also in attendance. According to OWCP documentation of record, dated October 11, 2001, complainant saw M and S at the conference, and experienced disabling psychiatric problems. Based on this indirect contact, the OWCP accepted complainant's claim of for aggravated adjustment disorder, finding a violation of her work restrictions. In a Memorandum to the File, as well in a "Statement of Accepted Facts" regarding complainant's OWCP claim, both dated October 11, 2001, the OWCP noted that complainant's work restrictions consist of: "absolute elimination of any possibilities that [complainant] will be in any way, fashion, or mode in direct or indirect contact with [M and S]." The record reflects that the March 17, 2001 sighting of M and S caused complainant to be off work due to psychiatric problems from April 4, 2001 until at least October 11, 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this evidence, we find that the "absolute" elimination of the risk of any type of contact in "any way, fashion, or mode" whatsoever, between complainant and M and S, all working within the same district, over the course of time, would constitute an undue hardship for the agency. Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we find no violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ's findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and that the AJ's decision properly summarized the relevant facts and referenced the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws. We discern no basis to disturb the AJ's decision as to the ultimate conclusion of no discrimination in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that under the current reassignment regulations, the agency in <span class="Italic">Bustamante</span> would have had an obligation to conduct more than a local search for reassignment positions but that does not alter the undue hardship analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent">In making an undue hardship determination, it is proper for the administrative judge and the EEOC to base that determination on credibility findings. In <span class="Italic">Kauppila v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0720040093 (2007), the Commission simply found that the reasons the agency contended it would have been an undue hardship to give the complainant a later starting date because of eye surgery were not credible:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also concur with the AJ's finding that the agency failed to proffer evidence that complainant's accommodation request posed an undue hardship. Like the AJ, the Commission finds the agency's statement that the delayed start of complainant's employment at the facility would have caused an undue hardship to the agency was not credible. AJ's Decision at 19. In so finding, we note that the evidence establishes that the workload "crisis" which caused the Officer to want complainant to begin working as soon as possible, was resolved in January of 2001. Further, we find that the agency's explanation that the job offer was rescinded due to a hiring freeze following the presidential inauguration in 2001 did not constitute an adequate justification for the agency's failure to provide an accommodation for complainant's disability. The record indicates that the hiring freeze implemented by the new administration in 2001 was not permanent, and thus was not an adequate justification for the rescission of the job offer. AJ's Decision at 19. We note that following the rescission of the job offer to complainant, the position was re-advertised and later filled in July of 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find the agency has proffered no evidence to suggest that complainant's request for a later starting date could not have been provided. As found by the AJ, the workload "crisis" which the agency stated required complainant to begin her new position no later than January 17, 2001, was resolved due to the work of other staff and thus we find there is no indication that she could not have been allowed to start her position on January 28, 2001. As such, we find that the record contains no evidence to support a finding that allowing complainant to begin her new position at a later date, or providing an alternative accommodation, would have posed an undue hardship to the agency. As noted by the AJ, those responsible for hiring complainant initially agreed to allow her to begin work as late as February of 2001; however, the Acting Division Director withdrew the job offer when complainant did not report for work on January 17, 2001. The agency failed to engage in the interactive process with complainant following her e-mail of December 19, 2000 requesting an accommodation. We concur with the AJ's finding that the agency's statement that it accommodated complainant by providing her with at least three (3) starting dates is not credible. AJ's Decision at 19. As such, we concur with the AJ's finding that the agency discriminated against complainant when it withdrew the job offer on January 16, 2001.</p>
