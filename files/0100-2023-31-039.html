<h4 class="h4" id="sec22-39"><span class="space">2.</span> Fee Enhancements</h4>
<p class="noindent">The issue of fee enhancements in cases where recovery of fees is ultimately available under statute has come full circle. Largely, the Commission has attempted to follow the lead of the Supreme Court. That has not always been easy because, at times, the Supreme Court's position regarding so-called "fee shifting" statutes has been less than clear. The current state of the law is that the Supreme Court now has ruled that there is no fee enhancement under "fee shifting" statutes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 112 S. Ct. 2638 (1992). Before turning to <span class="Italic">Dague</span>, the history of fee enhancement is traced below.</p>
<p class="noindent">OriGINAlly, the Commission held that a fee enhancement was only warranted in those cases where it was shown that the fee awarded was unreasonably low, or the quality of the services rendered was "superior to that one reasonably should expect in light of the hourly rates charged and that the success was 'exceptional.'" <span class="Italic">Ewers v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01850792 (1986) (quoting <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 1549 (1984)). The overall success rate in EEO cases, and the novelty or complexity of the issues involved were not appropriate considerations in determining if a fee enhancement was warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent">There were several factors which did not normally justify a fee enhancement, including: "(1) the novelty and complexity of issues (which normally are reflected in the number of billable hours); (2) the special skill and experience of the attorney (which normally are reflected in the reasonable hourly rate); (3) the extent to which a plaintiff has prevailed (fee awards are reduced by the number of hours spent on unsuccessful claims); and (4) the number of persons benefitted (not relevant to the question of statutory award of reasonable fees)." <span class="Italic">Tom v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01911245 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">It was the complainant's burden to demonstrate a fee enhancement was warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_2001"></span>After initially relying on <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, the Commission later adopted the two-prong test set forth in <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. 711 (1987), for determining whether a fee enhancement is warranted. The problem with the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> case--the second time that case reached the Supreme Court--was the lack of clear majority opinion. Rather, the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor came to represent the views of the court.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the EEOC adopted the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> test: "First, the party proposing the enhancement must establish that the relevant legal community adds a premium to contingent fee cases as a class. Second, it must be established that without the upward adjustment the prevailing party would have had substantial difficulty finding an attorney in the relevant legal market." <span class="Italic">Baker v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01910685 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Baker</span>, the Commission declined to grant a fee enhancement noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the record, we find that it contains an inadequate basis to meet either prong of the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> test. To show that the relevant legal community adds a premium for contingency, appellant's attorney asserts that only two other area lawyers will accept EEO cases, and only one of those will consider a contingency fee arrangement provided he receive a 100% enhancement of his regular hourly rate. While caselaw indicates that it is unlikely that an elaborate market survey of attorneys in the geographic [area] would be required to meet the first prong of the test, we find the declarations submitted inadequate to meet appellant's burden of proof because they are only from two attorneys and provide little detail or explanation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Kennickell</span>, 875 F.2d 330, 334-36 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (attorney submitted over 20 affidavits from area practitioners to bolster claim for enhancement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find inadequate evidence in the record to meet the "substantial difficulty" prong of the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> test. This portion of the test is "counterfactual" in the sense that the attorney seeking enhancement is not required to show that the appellant actually encountered difficulty. <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Kennickell</span>, 875 F.2d at 337-38. Rather, appellant must establish that her case in a class-wide sense is such that she would have faced substantial difficulty in securing counsel absent the availability of a fee enhancement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>...</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, it was assumed that the risk of contingency entered into the calculation of the reasonable hourly rate that was established.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Tom v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission further elaborated on fee enhancements for contingency agreements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plurality opinion of four Justices in the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> case concluded that the risk of losing a lawsuit may not be an independent basis for increasing the amount of an otherwise reasonable statutory fee, but that if the Court were to permit contingency enhancements, it should limit them to the exceptional cases in which there is evidence in the record indicating that without risk enhancement the plaintiff would have faced substantial difficulty in finding counsel in the relevant market. <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. at 725-26, 729-31 (White, J. plurality opinion). The dissenting opinion of four justices would permit enhancement for contingency where an attorney and a client were unable to mitigate the risk of nonpayment (<span class="Italic">e</span>.<span class="Italic">g</span>., by exchanging the risk of nonpayment for the prospect of compensation greater than the prospective lodestar amount). <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v.

<p class="noindent-1">Courts have relied on Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> case as providing guidance as to when a contingency enhancement is permissible under attorney's fees statutes. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e</span>.<span class="Italic">g</span>., <span class="Italic">Islamic Center of Miss. v. Starkville, Miss.</span>, 876 F.2d 465, 470-72 (5th Cir. 1989) and cases cited therein at 471 n.26. Justice O'Connor indicated in her concurring opinion in the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> case that there are four constraints on a court's discretion in awarding enhancement of contingency: (1) a court should treat a determination of how a particular market compensates for contingency as controlling future cases involving the same market; (2) the fee applicant bears the burden of proving the degree to which the relevant market compensates for contingency; (3) the fee applicant must establish that without an adjustment for risk, the prevailing party would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market; and (4) a court should not award any enhancement based on "legal" risks or risks peculiar to the case....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found the complainant had submitted insufficient evidence to justify an enhancement.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was obtained in <span class="Italic">McClendon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01883431 (1989). The Commission rejected arguments for a fee enhancement based on the contention that, without a contingency enhancement, the complainant in <span class="Italic">McClendon</span> would not have found competent counsel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has recognized that the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable hourly rate (the "lodestar") normally provides a reasonable attorney's fee, but that in cases of exceptional success an enhanced award may be justified. <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35. The Court has subsequently held that several factors normally justify an upward adjustment of the lodestar: (1) the novelty and complexity of issues (which normally are reflected in the number of billable hours); (2) the special skill and experience of the attorney (which normally are reflected in the reasonable hourly rate); (3) the extent to which a plaintiff has prevailed (fee awards are reduced by the number of hours spent on unsuccessful claims); and, (4) the number of persons benefitted (not relevant to the question of statutory award of reasonable fees). <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. at 897-901. The Court further indicated in the <span class="Italic">Blum</span> case that only in the rare case would an upward adjustment to the presumptively reasonable lodestar fee of rate times hours be appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 901, n.18.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant requested a fee enhancement of 50% for [Attorney] #1 and 100% for [Attorney] #2 based on the contingent nature of the fee agreement. In its final decision, the agency's decision denied the appellant's request based on her failure to establish that without an adjustment for risk she would have faced substantial difficulty in retaining counsel in the local or other relevant market. The agency further stated that fee enhancement is appropriate only in cases of exceptional success, and that appellant has presented insufficient justification for a fee enhancement in this case. On appeal, appellant contends that the Supreme Court has held that an enhancement may be awarded for the fact of contingency in an ordinary contingent fee case, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. 711, 733, 747 ((1987) (O'Connor, J. concurring; Blackmun, J. dissenting).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Courts have relied on Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> case as providing guidance as to when a contingency enhancement is permissible under attorney's fees statutes. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Islamic Center of Miss. v. Starkville, Miss</span>., 876 F.2d 465, 470-72 (5th Cir. 1989) and cases cited therein at 471 n.26.

Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. 711 at 733-34 (O'Connor, J. concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that she established the prerequisites for a contingency enhancement in this case by the affidavits submitted by her representatives. However, the Commission finds that appellant's representatives have failed to meet their burden to justify any enhancement to their fees. First, we find that the affidavits submitted by [Attorney]#1 and [Attorney]#2 are insufficient to establish the degree to which the Tidewater area market compensates for contingency cases as a class. <span class="Italic">Accord Guidry v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01910266 (February 5, 1991) (Affidavits from two attorneys, with little detail or explanation, insufficient to satisfy the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> test). Moreover, we find that the affidavits submitted by [Attorney]#1 and [Attorney]#2 are insufficient as a basis for determining how the Tidewater area compensates for contingency; nor should it be controlling in future cases involving the Tidewater area market. [Attorney]#1 indicated that, in accordance with the fee memorandum and the retainer agreement with appellant, he requested at least double the normal hourly rate because the case was taken on a purely contingent basis. [Attorney]#2 further states that every attorney he deposed, testified that he or she expects an upward adjustment of their normal hourly rate when a case is taken on a contingent fee basis. However, despite several affidavits submitted in support of his position, [Attorney]#2 did not indicate the period of time addressed in the depositions and the degree to which the deposed attorneys themselves compensated for the contingency risk. [Attorney]#2 <span id="Page_2002"></span>also did not indicate whether his firm's expectation of double the normal hourly rate was based on specific fee agreements which were binding on their clients, or whether the firm's expectation was based on prior and/or anticipated court awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that appellant has failed to establish that, without an adjustment for risk, she would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the relevant market. Appellant contends that, because her initial representative was subject to disciplinary actions while her complaint was under consideration, she was forced to seek other competent counsel in a timely manner. Appellant also contends that she would have faced difficulty in obtaining a representative without the possibility of a contingency enhancement since every attorney in the Tidewater area who takes a contingent case expects to be paid more than the normal hourly rate to compensate for the risk of receiving no fee at all. This assertion does not address the possibility that competent counsel would have been willing to represent appellant without a contingency agreement. Therefore, after careful review of the evidence of record, we find that appellant's attorney's request to apply a multiplier to the charges for services in this case is unreasonable as the relief obtained in this case has benefitted only appellant, it has not had class wide application and it has not resulted in any major policy change. We also find that the risks assumed by [Attorney]#1 and [Attorney]#2 were minimal. We have considered all of the relevant factors in determining whether a fee enhancement is appropriate in this case, and we find that this case was not exceptional and that appellant has failed to justify a deviation from the standard fee calculation of a reasonable hourly rate times the number of hours reasonably expended. Based on the foregoing reasons, we find that appellant has failed to establish that the lodestar fee amount should be enhanced.</p>
<p class="noindent">Any fee enhancement had to be based on actual evidence that the relevant legal community added a premium to contingency fee cases as a class. The fact that the attorney handling the case routinely added such a premium did not constitute evidence demonstrating the practice of the relevant legal community. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Army</span>, 01911966 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that the enhancement should be granted under the holding under the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span>. In the plurality opinion of that case, Justice O'Connor established two prerequisites for enhancement of a fee award based on contingency. <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> 483 U.S. at 731 (O'Connor, J. concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). First, the party proposing the enhancement must establish that the relevant legal community adds a premium to contingent fee cases of the class. Second, it must be established that without the upward adjustment the prevailing party would have had substantial difficulty finding an attorney in the relevant legal market.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the record, we find that it contains inadequate evidence to meet either prong of the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> test. To show that the relevant legal community has a premium for contingency, appellant's attorney submits that he was allowed a twenty percent enhancement in a similar case against the agency. Investigation by the agency's Labor Counselor revealed that such an enhancement was allowed because of the attorney's recognized expertise in the field of labor law and the fact that he represented agency employees and/or their union in approximately eighty percent of labor disputes with the agency (See Memorandum through Labor Employment Office dated January 21, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While case law indicates that it is unlikely that an elaborate market survey of attorneys in the geographic area would be required to meet the first prong of the test, we find the evidence submitted above inadequate to meet appellant's burden of proof because it stems from appellant's attorney himself, and provides little detail or explanation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Kennickell</span>, 875 F.2d 330, 334-36 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (attorneys submitted over twenty affidavits from area practitioners to bolster claim for enhancement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find inadequate evidence in the record to meet the "substantial difficulty" prong of the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> test. This portion of the test is "counter factual" in the sense that the attorney seeking enhancement is not required to show that the appellant actually encountered difficulty. <span class="Italic">McKenzie</span>, 875 F.2d at 337-338, rather, appellant must establish that her case, in a class-wide sense, would have posed substantial difficulty in securing counsel absent the availability fee enhancement<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> For the same reasons enunciated in our findings in the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> test, we find that appellant has not met her burden on the "substantial difficulty" portion....</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant's attorney had been successful in obtaining systemic relief, in addition to the relief for his client, did not, standing alone, justify an enhancement of a fee award. <span class="Italic">Baitey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01914005 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Baitey</span>, the complainant's attorney was successful not only in proving that his client had been discriminated against on the basis of a disabling condition in failing to hire the complainant, but he also demonstrated that the agency's hiring policy discriminated against disabled persons as a group. The Commission, in overturning a fee enhancement recommended by its administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Baitey,</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ in the instant case, citing 29 CFR 1613.271(d)(2)(i)(B), recommended that appellant's attorney be awarded enhanced attorney's fees based on the difficulty of the issues, the attorney's skill, the preclusion of other employment, the time limitations that were imposed upon the attorney, and the fact that the attorney "was brought in days before the case went to hearing" and "presented a very impressive...and successful case." In its FAD, the agency accepted the AJ's recommendation that appellant be awarded attorney's fees; however, the agency rejected the recommendation that the fees be enhanced, finding, <span class="Italic">inter</span> <span class="Italic">alia</span>, that the case was not an "exceptional success." On appeal, appellant asserts that the AJ's recommendation regarding enhanced attorney's fees should be reinstated. (footnote omitted). Appellant contends further that enhancement of fees is justified by the systemic nature of the discrimination findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to the provisions of 29 CFR 1613.271(d), attorney's fees are awarded to complainants who prevail on a discrimination complaint and are represented by an attorney. To determine the proper amount of the fee, a lodestar amount is reached by calculating the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983). Adjustments, both upward and downward, may be made to the lodestar amount as necessary in the "exceptional" case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 434-436. Enhancements, or upward adjustments, of the lodestar figure are proper only in certain "rare" and "exceptional" cases supported by both "specific evidence" on the record and "detailed findings" by the factfinder. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air (Delaware Valley I)</span>, 478 U.S. 546, 565 (1986); <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 897, (1984). Factors to be considered in adjusting the initial fee are set out in the federal regulations. 29 CFR 1613.271(d)(2)(i)(B). However many of these factors have been held by the Supreme Court to be usually "subsumed within the initial calculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly rate." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434 n.9. Courts have found that the burden of justifying any deviation from a fee calculation of reasonable hours times reasonable hourly rate rests on the party proposing the deviation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with other factors listed in 29 CFR 1613.271(d)(2)(i)(B), quality of representation generally is reflected in the reasonable hourly rate and may justify an upward adjustment only in the rare case. There is "very little room for enhancing the award based on...post engagement performance.... Because considerations concerning the quality of a prevailing party's counsel's representation normally are reflected in the reasonable hourly rate, the overall quality of performance ordinarily should not be used to adjust the lodestar, removing any danger of 'double counting.'" <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I</span>, 478 U.S. at 566. An upward adjustment will only occur where the success was exceptional and the fee applicant offers specific evidence to show that the quality of service rendered was superior to that one reasonably should expect in light of the hourly rates charged. <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, 465 U.S. at 899. (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the AJ's decision indicates that he was particularly impressed by the quality of representation afforded appellant. However, after considering the evidence of record and the case law on this issue, the Commission determines that insufficient evidence has been put forth to justify enhancement of attorney's fees. Although, arguably, the systemic nature of the discrimination finding herein indicates that the case was an exceptional success, no specific evidence has been presented as to any of the other factors listed in the Commission's regulations. On appeal, appellant submits no specific evidence to support the request for enhancement other than the assertion that the systemic nature of the relief is justification enough. The Commission is unable to conclude as much after a consideration of the case law cited above.</p>
<p class="noindent">A claim that services were rendered at a contractual rate below the prevailing market rate did not, in itself, justify a fee enhancement. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01911385 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Attorney General</span>, 0120122033 (2013), the Commission upheld a fee enhancement of 20% for the attorney representing a class of female special agents in a foreign assignment and promotion case. In doing so, the Commission noted that counsel had obtained "exceptional results" for the class, and the litigation was extremely complex and took several years.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 2640-43 (1992), the Supreme Court undertook to resolve the question that was answered with less than certainty in <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span>, we reversed a judgment that had affirmed enhancement of a fee award to reflect the contingent risk of nonpayment. In the process, we addressed whether the typical federal fee-shifting statute (there, 304(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 USC 7604(d)) permits an attorney's fees award to be enhanced on account of contingency. In the principal opinion, Justice WHITE, joined on this point by three other Justices, determined that such enhancement is not permitted. 483 U.S., at 723-727, 107 S. Ct., at 3085, 3088. Justice O'CONNOR, in an opinion <span id="Page_2003"></span>concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, concluded that no enhancement or contingency is appropriate "unless the applicant can establish that without an adjustment for risk the prevailing party would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market,"...and that any enhancement "must be based on the difference in market treatment of contingent fees as a class, other than on an assessment of the 'riskiness' of any particular case."...Justice BLACKMUN's dissenting opinion, joined by three other Justices, concluded that enhancement for contingency is always statutorily required....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn again to this same issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7002(e) of the SWDA and Section 505(d) of the CWA authorize a court to award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney...fees)" to a "prevailing or substantially prevailing party.' 42 USC 6972(e); 33 USC 1365(d). This language is similar to that of many other fee-shifting statutes, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> 42 USC 1988, 2000e-5(k), 7604(d); our case law construing what is a "reasonable" applies uniformly to all of them....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "lodestar" figure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light of our fee-shifting jurisprudence. We have established a "strong presumption" that the lodestar represents the reasonable" fee, <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley 1, supra,</span> 478 U.S., at 565, 106 S. Ct., at 3098, and have placed upon a fee applicant who seeks more than that a burden of showing that "such an adjustment is necessary to the determination a reasonable fee." <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson,</span> 5 U.S. 886, 898, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 1548, 79 L. Ed.2d 891 (1984). The Court of Appeals held, and Dague argues here, that a "reasonable" fee for attorneys who have been retained on a contingency fee basis must go beyond the lodestar, to compensate for risk of loss and of consequent nonpayment. Fee-shifting statutes should be construed, he contends, to replicate the economic incentives that operate in the private legal market, where attorneys working on a contingency-fee basis can be expected to charge some premium over their ordinary hourly rates. Petitioner Burlington argues, by contrast, that the lodestar fee may not be enhanced for contingency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note at the outset that an enhancement for contingency would likely duplicate in substantial part factors already subsumed in the lodestar. The risk of loss in a particular case (and, therefore, the attorney's contingent risk) is the product of two factors: (1) the legal and factual merits of the claim, and (2) the difficulty of establishing those merits. The second factor, however, is ordinarily reflected in the lodestar--either in the higher number of hours expended to overcome the difficulty, or in the higher hourly rate of the attorney skilled and experienced enough to do so. <span class="Italic">Blum, supra,</span> at 898-899, 104 S. Ct., at 1548-1549. Taking account of it again through lodestar enhancement amounts to double-counting. <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span>, 483 U.S., at 726-727, 107 S. Ct., at 3087-3088 (plurality opinion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first factor (relative merits of the claim) is not reflected in the lodestar, but there are good reasons why it should play no part in the calculation of the award. It is, of course, a factor that always exists (no claim has a 100% chance of success), so that computation of the lodestar would never end the court's inquiry in contingent-fee cases.... Moreover, the consequence of awarding contingency enhancement to take account of this "merits" factor would be to provide attorneys with the same incentive to bring relatively meritless claims as relatively meritorious ones. Assume, for example, two claims, one with underlying merit of 20%, the other of 80%. Absent any contingency enhancement, a contingent-fee attorney would prefer to take the latter, since he is four times more likely to be paid. But with a contingency enhancement, this preference will disappear: the enhancement for the 20% claim would be-a multiplier of 5 (100/20), which is quadruple the 1.25 multiplier (100/80) that would attach to the 80% claim. Thus, enhancement for the contingency risk posed by each case would encourage meritorious claims to be brought, but only at the social cost of indiscriminately encouraging nonmeritorious claims to be brought as well. We think that an unlikely objective of the "reasonable fees" provisions. "These statutes were not designed as a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of lawyers.<span class="Italic">" Delaware Valley I,</span> 478 U.S., at 565, 106 S. Ct., at 3098.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead of enhancement based upon the contingency risk posed by each case, Dague urges that we adopt the approach set forth in the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span> concurrence. We decline to do so, first and foremost because we do not see how it can intelligibly be applied. On the one hand, it would require the party seeking contingency enhancement to "establish that without the adjustment for risk [he] 'would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market."'... On the other hand, it would forbid enhancement based "on an assessment of the 'riskiness' of any particular case."... But since the predominant reason that a contingent-fee claimant has difficulty finding counsel in any legal market where the winner's attorney's fees will be paid by the loser is that attorney's view his case as too risky (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, too unlikely to succeed), these two propositions, as a practical matter, collide. <span class="Italic">See King v. Palmer,</span> 292 U.S. App. D.C. 362, 371, 950 F.2d 771, 780 (1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. pending sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Ridley,</span> No. 91-1370.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A second difficulty with the approach taken by the concurrence in <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span> is that it would base the contingency enhancement on "the difference in market treatment of contingent fee cases as a class."... To begin with, for a very large proportion of contingency-fee cases--those seeking not monetary damages but injunctive or other equitable relief--there is no "market treatment." Such cases scarcely exist, except to the extent Congress has created an artificial "market" for them by fee-shifting--and looking to that "market" for the meaning of fee-shifting is obviously circular. Our decrees would follow the "market," which in turn is based on our decrees.... But even apart from that difficulty, any approach that applies uniform treatment to the entire class of contingent fee cases, or to any conceivable subject matter-based subclass, cannot possibly achieve the supposed goal of mirroring market incentives. As discussed above, the contingent risk of a case (and hence the difficulty of getting contingent-fee lawyers to take it) depends principally upon its particular merits. Contingency enhancement calculated on any class-wide basis, therefore, guarantees at best (leaving aside the double-counting problem described earlier) that those cases within the class that have the class-average chance of success will be compensated according to what the "market" requires to produce the services that all cases having above-class-average chance of success will be overcompensated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Looking beyond the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span> concurrence's approach, we perceive no other basis, fairly derivable from the fee-shifting statutes, by which contingency enhancement, if adopted, could be restricted to fewer than all contingent-fee cases. And we see a number of reasons for concluding that no contingency enhancement whatever is compatible with the fee-shifting statutes at issue. First, just as the statutory language limiting fees to prevailing (or substantially prevailing) parties bars a prevailing plaintiff from recovering fees relating to claims on which he lost,<span class="Italic"> Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 424, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983), so should it bar a prevailing plaintiff from recovering for the risk of loss.... An attorney operating on a contingency-fee basis pools the risks represented by his various cases: cases that turn out to be successful pay for the time gambled on those that did not. To award a contingency enhancement under a fee-shifting statute would in effect pay for the attorney's time (or anticipated time) in cases where his client does not prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, both before and since <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II,</span> "we have generally turned away from the contingent-fee model"--which would make the fee award a percentage of the value of the relief awarded in the primary action--"to the lodestar model." <span class="Italic">Venegas v. Mitchell,</span> 495 U.S. 82, 87, 110 S. Ct. 1679, 1682, 109 L. Ed.2d 74 (1990).... To engraft this feature onto the lodestar model would be to concoct a hybrid scheme that resorts to the contingent-fee model to increase a fee award but not to reduce it. Contingency enhancement is therefore not consistent with our general rejection of the contingent-fee model for fee awards, nor is it necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And finally, the interest in ready administrability that has underlain our adoption of the lodestar approach...and the related interest in avoiding burdensome satellite litigation...counsel strongly against adoption of contingency enhancement. Contingency enhancement would make the setting of fees more complex and arbitrary, hence more unpredictable, and hence more litigable. It is neither necessary nor even possible for application of the fee-shifting statutes to mimic the intricacies of the fee-paying market in every respect....</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Price v. Attorney General</span>, 07A20104 (2003), the Commission approved a fee enhancement from $175 to $225 per hour where the increased rate was consistent with the prevailing community rate and the attorney continued to represent the complainant even when she fell in arrears on payment of the fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">While fee enhancements are unusual, the administrative judge has the discretion <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> to award an enhancement. In <span class="Italic">Kann v. Secretary of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50039.txt">07A50039</a> (2005), and <span class="Italic">Turton v. Secretary of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50040.txt">07A50040</a> (2005), the Commission held that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in awarded a 20% fee enhance even though no enhancement had been requested by the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Kann</span>, the administrative judge awarded $360,000 in damages and then reduced them to $300,000 because of the statutory cap. In <span class="Italic">Turton</span>, the judge awarded $380,000, then reduced it to $300,000. Although the Commission further reduced the awards to $100,000 and $110,000, respectively, it held:</p>

Complainant argues that she submitted a petition for attorney's fees at the AJ's request. Complainant argues that at the time the petition was submitted, a decision had not been rendered in the case. Complainant argues that because the issue of damages and attorney's fees were not bifurcated, it would have been impossible to determine the level of success in the case, thus making an enhancement request premature.

United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A32565 (July 14, 2004). We find that the AJ did not abuse his discretion in awarding the 20% enhancement. Thus, we find that complainant is entitled to $102,893.06, in combined attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070020 (2010), the Commission granted a fee enhancement of $1,000 where a management official refused to revise schedules to accommodate witnesses, told them they would not be paid for their time while testifying and that they could go to jail if they lied. The decision contains no discussion of why the Commission decided to treat this as a fee enhancement case as opposed to a sanction case.</p>
