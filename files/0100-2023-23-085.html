<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-83"><span class="space">2.</span> 1991 Civil Rights Act and ADA</h4>
<p class="noindent">Congress has significantly restricted the rights of workers who illegally use drugs, whether they are simply casual users or fit a clinical definition of drug dependent persons. Through 512 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress has exempted persons who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs from the definition of a person with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Section 105 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides that employers may impose rules barring the employment of persons who knowingly and currently use or possess drugs, provided the rules do not discriminate against persons on traditional Title VII grounds. The Act, at 42 USC 2000e-2(k)(3), states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, a rule barring the employment of an individual who currently and knowingly uses or possesses a controlled substance, as defined in schedules I and II of section 102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 USC 802(6)), other than the use or possession of a drug taken under the supervision of a licensed health care professional, or any other use or possession authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or any other provision of Federal law, shall be considered an unlawful employment practice under this title only if such rule is adopted or applied with an intent to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 21 USC 802(6), controlled substances are classified into five schedules defined at 21 USC 812. Included in those substances under schedules I and II are opium and opiate derivatives, cocaine, hallucinogens and marijuana.</p>
<p class="noindent">Both the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act further clarify the scope of protection by excluding those individuals who illegally use drugs. The Rehabilitation Act, at 29 USC 706(8)(C), excludes current drug users from the definition of qualified individuals with disabilities. The ADA, at 42 USC 12114, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Qualified individual with a disability.</span>--For purposes of this subchapter, the term "qualified individual with a disability" shall not include any employee or applicant who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when the covered entity acts on the basis of such use.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Rules of construction.</span>--Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed to exclude as a qualified individual with a disability an individual who-</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use, but is not engaging in such use; except that it shall not be a violation of this chapter for a covered entity to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures, including but not limited to drug testing, designed to ensure that an individual described in paragraph (1) or (2) is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the ADA primarily involves drug use, it also addresses alcohol use. For example, under subsection (c), agencies:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;may prohibit the illegal use of drugs and the use of alcohol at the workplace by all employees;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;may require that employees shall not be under the influence of alcohol or be engaging in the illegal use of drugs at the workplace;</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;may hold an employee who engages in the illegal use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the drug use or alcoholism of such employee; and</p>

<p class="noindent">Subsection (d) permits, but does not encourage, agencies to conduct drug testing on employees and applicants for employment. It also provides that such tests are not considered medical examinations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In general.</span>--For purposes of this subchapter, a test to determine the illegal use of drugs shall not be considered a medical examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Construction.</span>--Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the conducting of drug testing for the illegal use of drugs by job applicants or employees or making employment decisions based on such test results.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations mirror the ADA exclusion of current illegal users of drugs from the definition of qualified individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(h); 29 CFR 1630.3.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the ADA exclusion is for illegal drug users and not simply users of illegal drugs. In other words, the exclusion applies to individuals who use legal drugs illegally, such as individuals who illegally obtain and take legal prescription drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complainants who are former drug abusers can establish they are qualified individuals with disabilities by showing they have a history of drug abuse or are perceived as a drug addict. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Payne v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971277 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 512 of Title V of the ADA amended Section 7(8) of the Rehabilitation Act to exclude persons who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs from the definition of "individual with a disability." <span class="Italic">See</span> also 29 CFR 1630.3(a). We also note, however, that an individual who has "successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs" may be considered to be disabled. 29 CFR 1630.3(b)(1). In this regard, such an individual can establish coverage under the Rehabilitation Act based on having a history of drug addiction or being "regarded as" a drug addict. Technical Assistance Manual on the Employment Provisions (Title I) of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Section 8.5.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission held that a complainant may not escape the consequences of drug-related conduct merely by enrolling in after-the-fact treatment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Diggins v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01931313 (1993), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner's removal and the incidents supporting his removal occurred subsequent to July 26, 1990, the date on which the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law. Thus, the Commission finds that Title V, Section 512 of the ADA is applicable to this case. Section 512 of Title V of the ADA amends Section 7(8) of the Rehabilitation Act to exclude from the definition of an individual with a disability persons who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs. The amendment states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)(i) For purposes of Title V, the term 'individual with handicaps' does not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs when a covered entity acts on the basis of such use.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to exclude as an individual with handicaps an individual who-</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(I)&#x2003;has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(II)&#x2003;is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(III)&#x2003;is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use, but is not engaging in such use....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Testimony and other evidence of record established that petitioner was engaging in the illegal use of drugs for approximately eighteen months prior to his removal, and that he was diagnosed with "cocaine dependence." Although the record shows that he entered a rehabilitation program on April 2, 1992 and successfully completed it, the Commission finds that petitioner does not fall within one of the exceptions outlined in Section 512. Policy concerns dictate that persons who are disciplined for drug use or misconduct related to drug use, not be permitted to invoke the Act's protection simply by showing "after-the-fact" that they are rehabilitated. For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that petitioner is not an individual with a disability by virtue of his drug addiction and therefore is not entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Smalle v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03930174 (1994). In overruling the MSPB on a finding of disabled status based on drug addiction, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Smalle</span>, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the finding of the MSPB that petitioner has a disability, as defined by the Rehabilitation Act, based on his cocaine use. Petitioner's removal and the incident supporting the removal occurred subsequent to July 26, 1990, the date the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 was signed into law. Section 512 of Title V of the ADA amends Section 7(8) of the Rehabilitation Act to exclude from the definition of an individual with a disability persons who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs. The amendment states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)(i) For purposes of Title V, the term 'individual with disabilities' does not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs when a covered entity acts on the basis of such use.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to exclude as an individual with disabilities an individual who--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(I)&#x2003;has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(II)&#x2003;is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(III)&#x2003;is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use, but is not engaging in such use....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner testified that he engaged in the illegal use of drugs for four or five months prior to the charged incidents which occurred on February 15, 1992, and that by the time the incident occurred, he was smoking three to four vials of crack a day. A certified addictions counselor, who treated petitioner, testified that petitioner was a drug addict. Although petitioner sought rehabilitation after the charges were made, the Commission finds that petitioner does not fall within one of the exceptions outlined in Section 512. Policy concerns dictate that persons who are disciplined for drug use or misconduct related to drug use not be permitted to invoke the Act's protection simply by showing "after-the-fact" that they are rehabilitated<span class="Italic">. Tommy Thomas v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920076 (April 23, 1993). For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that petitioner is not an individual with a disability by virtue of his drug addiction and therefore is not entitled to the protection of the Rehabilitation Act with regard to his drug addiction.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not uncommon for persons with drug addictions to have similar problems with alcohol. Although a person who is actively illegally using drugs is excluded from the definition of a person with a disability, this does not preclude the same person from showing that he is disabled by his alcoholism. Nor does it preclude that person from establishing a nexus between his misconduct and his alcoholism even when the person is under the influence of both illegal drugs and alcohol at the time of the incident in question. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Army</span>, 03930085 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Smalle, supra</span>, the Commission noted that demonstrating a connection between the alcoholism and any misconduct can be extremely difficult when the employee also suffers from a drug addiction. In the <span class="Italic">Smalle</span> case, the complainant, in addition to his alcoholism, was addicted to crack cocaine. However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Smalle</span> determined the complainant was not a disabled person based on his addiction because of his continued use of illegal drugs:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that alcoholism is a disabling condition for the purposes of the disability discrimination protection of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973<span class="Italic">. Ruggles v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03840216 (November 17, 1989). The finding by the MSPB that petitioner is an alcoholic is supported by the record as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As petitioner is a person with a disability, the next question is whether there is a nexus between petitioner's disability and the agency's decision to remove petitioner for: (1) unauthorized possession of government property, and (2) unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia and a controlled substance (cocaine) on a military installation. Petitioner argues that he misappropriated the baby formula on February 15, 1992 because he was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol, and that his life was out of control due to his alcoholism and drug addiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that petitioner failed to prove that there was a nexus between his alcoholism and the charged misconduct. First, petitioner is not protected by the Rehabilitation Act to the extent that he committed the charged <span id="Page_1193"></span>acts due to his drug addiction or related drug use. Given this drug use, it is difficult for the Commission to discern the nexus between petitioner's misconduct and his alcoholism.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, petitioner testified that he stopped drinking approximately four hours before MP 1 observed him take baby formula. MP 1, who is trained in identifying whether a suspect is under the influence of a substance, testified that he did not smell alcohol on petitioner's breath, and there were no signs that petitioner was intoxicated. While petitioner may have been under the influence of alcohol, he has failed to show that the influence of alcohol was significant or that this was the reason he took the baby formula.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record reflects that petitioner engaged in the misappropriation of government property for personal gain. Petitioner testified that he took the baby formula so he could sell it to buy crack cocaine. This suggests that petitioner's conduct was intentional in nature. The Commission finds that the intentional nature of this misconduct is an intervening factor that defeats petitioner's nexus argument with regard to his alcoholism and the taking of the baby formula<span class="Italic">. Eaton v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03910145 (August 19, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as to the second charge of being in unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia and a controlled substance on a military installation, petitioner offered no evidence or testimony that he was so impaired by alcohol that he was unaware of his actions of reporting to work on a military installation while in possession of drug paraphernalia and a controlled substance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that there is no nexus between petitioner's disability and his removal, and thus we need not proceed further with an analysis of whether he is a qualified person with a disability and whether the agency must provide reasonable accommodation. The Commission concurs with the MSPB's finding that petitioner failed to show that he was discriminated against on the basis of a disability when he was removed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission now consistently holds that employees who are engaged in current drug use are not included within the definition of an individual with a disability under the ADA amendments to the Rehabilitation Act. Likewise, enrolling in "after-the-fact" treatment when the agency discovers the drug use does not entitle the individual to reasonable accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Dorman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953551 (1996), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, the Commission agrees with the AJ that appellant's drug abuse does not constitute a disability for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. Appellant's removal and the incident supporting that action occurred subsequent to July 26, 1990, the date the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 was signed into law. Section 512 of Title V of the ADA amends Section 7 (8) of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USC &#x00A7; 706(8)) to exclude from the definition of an individual with a disability persons who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs. The amendment states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)(i) For purposes of Title V, the term "individual with disabilities" does not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs when a covered entity acts on the basis of such use.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to exclude as an individual with disabilities an individual who--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(I)&#x2003;has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(II)&#x2003;is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(III)&#x2003;is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use, but is not engaging in such use....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant admitted that she engaged in the illegal use of drugs during the period immediately preceding her removal, and appellant pled guilty to possession of marijuana. In addition, we concur with the AJ that while appellant declined to testify as to whether she was involved in the sale of narcotics, it is reasonable to conclude from the record that appellant did engage in such activity. Appellant asserted, on appeal, that the agency failed to present testimony from Postal Inspectors or the Informant. However, the record contains a copy of the Postal Inspection report concerning appellant's activity, and appellant presented no evidence to rebut the statements contained therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, although appellant sought rehabilitation after the agency learned of her current drug use, the Commission finds that appellant does not fall within one of the exceptions outlined in Section 512. The Commission has previously stated that policy concerns dictate that persons who are disciplined for current drug use not be permitted to invoke the Act's protection simply by showing "after-the-fact" that they are rehabilitated<span class="Italic">. Wartley v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940136 (December 9, 1994). Therefore, for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that appellant, at the time of her removal, was not an individual with a disability by virtue of the fact that she was currently using drugs, and, as such, was not entitled to the protection of the Rehabilitation Act with regard thereto.</p>
<p class="noindent">While a person currently using drugs illegally is excluded from the definition of a qualified person with a disability, a person who has successfully completed rehabilitation and no longer uses drugs does fit the definition. Moreover, the regulations include a person who is regarded as currently using drugs illegally, but is in fact not using such drugs. In <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Postmaster General</span>, 01945642 (1996), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a complaint alleging discrimination based on a disability, a complainant must first establish that he or she is a member of the class of individuals protected by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. An individual with a disability is one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of his or her major life activities, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203 (a). Major life activities are defined as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(3). Excluded from this definition is "an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when an agency acts on the basis of such use." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(h). This provision, however, does not exclude an individual who "[h]as successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(h)(i). In addition, the regulations do not exclude an individual who is erroneously regarded as engaging in illegal drug use but is not engaging in such use. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(h)(iii). An individual seeking the protection of the Rehabilitation Act also must show that he or she is a qualified person with a disability, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that he or she can perform the essential functions of the position in question with or without accommodation. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6). Finally, an individual alleging that he or she was subjected to disparate treatment based on a disability must show that there is a nexus between the alleged adverse action or treatment and his or her disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, appellant does not allege that she was discriminated against because she currently has an impairment that substantially limits one or more of her major life activities; rather, she alleges that she was discriminated against (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, refused a transfer) because she has a record of a substantially limiting impairment, namely drug addiction. In this regard, appellant asserted, and her supervisor confirmed, that she was addicted to cocaine and heroin for several years and that she entered and successfully completed a rehabilitation program in 1990. Accordingly, although the record does not contain the medical documents pertaining to appellant's prior drug addiction, the Commission finds that appellant meets the definition of a person with a disability in that she has a history of dependence on illegal drugs, but was not engaging in such use during the period in question, and had successfully completed a rehabilitation program. The Commission also finds that appellant is a qualified person with a disability in that her job performance consistently was rated satisfactory and above.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, the complainant also must demonstrate a causal connection between her disability and the adverse employment action.</p>
