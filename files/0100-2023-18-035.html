<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-35"><span class="space">B.</span> DEFINITION OF REASONABLE TIME</h3>
<p class="noindent">The use of official time by employees and representatives is restricted to "reasonable time." In MD-110 at 6-17 to 6-18, the Commission establishes general guidance regarding the use of official time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">1.&#x2003;Reasonable Amount of Official Time</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Reasonable" is defined as whatever is appropriate, under the particular circumstances of the complaint, in order to allow a complete presentation of the relevant information associated with the complaint and to respond to agency requests for information. The actual number of hours to which complainant and his/her representative are entitled will vary, depending on the nature and complexity of the complaint and considering the mission of the agency and the agency's need to have its employees available to perform their normal duties on a regular basis. The complainant and the agency should arrive at a mutual understanding as to the amount of official time to be used prior to the complainant's use of such time. Time spent commuting to and from home should not be included in official time computations because all employees are required to commute to and from their federal employment on their own time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">2.&#x2003;Meeting and Hearing Time</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most of the time spent by complainants and their representatives during the processing of a typical complaint is spent in meetings and hearings with agency officials or with EEOC Administrative Judges. Whatever time is spent in such meetings and hearings is automatically deemed reasonable. Both the complainant and the representative are to be granted official time for the duration of such meetings or hearings and are in a duty status regardless of their tour of duty. If a complainant or representative has already worked a full week and must attend a hearing or meeting on an off day, that complainant or representative is entitled to official time, which may require that the agency pay overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">3.&#x2003;Preparation Time</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since presentation of a complaint involves preparation for meetings and hearings, as well as attendance at such meetings, conferences, and hearings, complainants and their representatives are also afforded a reasonable amount of official time, as defined above, to prepare for meetings and hearings. They are also to be afforded a reasonable amount of official time to prepare the formal complaint and any appeals that may be filed with the Commission, even though no meetings or hearings are involved. However, because investigations are conducted by agency or Commission personnel, the regulation does not envision large amounts of official time for preparation purposes. Consequently, "reasonable," with respect to preparation time (as opposed to time actually spent in meetings and hearings), is generally defined in terms of hours, not in terms of days, weeks, or months. Again, what is reasonable depends on the individual circumstances of each complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when an employee is entitled to official time for EEO complaint purposes, the employee is still expected to spend the majority of her time completing work assignments. In <span class="Italic">Matuszeski v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01956479 (1997), the Commission found it was not improper for the complainant's supervisor to limit her to two hours of official time per week to pursue her EEO complaints. The Commission found that, while reasonableness is determined by the particular circumstances of a complaint, the agency is within its rights to insist that the employee continues to complete assigned work. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Matuszeski</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant further contends that her supervisor improperly limited her use of time to pursue her EEO complaints to two hours per week. Commission regulations provide that agency employees shall be given reasonable amounts of official time to prepare complaints and respond to agency requests for information. 29 CFR 1614.605(b). Reasonable is defined as whatever is appropriate under the circumstances of the case, but agencies may restrict the overall hours to the extent necessary to ensure that employees spend most of their time doing the work for which they are employed. EEO Management Directive 110, Chapter 5, pp. 14-15 (October 22, 1992); <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930872 (June 2, 1994). The supervisor testified without rebuttal that, between October and December 1991, appellant devoted more hours to the processing of her EEO complaints than to her assigned work, and that appellant had appeared to have stopped working on her assigned cases during that period. IR 955, 963. The supervisor imposed the two-hour limit upon advice from the personnel office and on the basis of his own observations of appellant's difficulties in completing her assignments, but did not impose any limits on time that appellant used for meetings with EEO and union representatives. IR 1054-56; HT 186, 208, 213-14. We therefore agree with the AJ in finding that two hours of official time per week was reasonable. Moreover, aside from not establishing that the agency violated 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(b), appellant has not presented any evidence, other than her own testimony, which tends to show that the supervisor's decision to limit her official time was motivated by considerations of appellant's sex or previous EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Shjeflo v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a55789.txt">01A55789</a> (2006), the Commission, noting its guidance envisions grants of official time to be measured in hours, found that the agency had not violated the official time regulations in granting the complainant between eight and 16 hours of official time, instead of the 80 hours he had requested. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kea v. Postmaster General,</span> 01A55657 (2006) (complaint provided with more than 84 hours official time, which was more than 20% of his work time for the relevant period)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In deciding whether the hours of official time requested for preparation for the hearing are reasonable, the agency may consider how many hours its own representative spent preparing for the hearing. <span class="Italic">See Segura v. USPS</span>, 01841339 (1986). The agency did not abuse its discretion in granting appellant 16 hours of official time instead of 24, where its own representative only spent eight hours preparing. Preparation time also includes a reasonable amount of time to prepare the formal complaint and appeals to the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See</span> MD-110 at 6-16.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether to grant a specific amount of official time, the agency is entitled to a reasonable explanation of how the employee plans to spend that time. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bodenheimer v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01A52776 (2006), the Commission determined that the agency did not err in granting the complainant 16 hours of official time to prepare for EEO hearings instead of the 40 she requested because she had not provided an adequate explanation. Without an explanation, the Commission could not determine that the agency's denial of the additional time was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">In deciding whether to grant an official time request, the agency may balance its own work needs with the need of the complainant to prepare or process an EEO complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A60226 (2006), the Commission determined that the agency was justified in denying a request for official time to the complainant based on the fact that, at the time of the request, the agency was understaffed at the reception desk. The agency also presented evidence that the supervisor, prior to denying the request, consulted with the EEO director on whether the complainant had an imminent EEO deadline and also gave the complainant an opportunity to demonstrate that she had an imminent deadline. The supervisor further informed the complainant that he could have official time for EEO purposes the following week when a coworker returned from vacation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Salas v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120065120 (2009), the Commission found that it was proper for the agency to insist that the complainant attend critical training and contact an EEO counselor by telephone rather than use official time for an actual meeting. In that case, the complainant had failed a Refuge Field Training Program, in part, because he had accidentally discharged a firearm during training. The complainant was required to take remedial training that was scheduled at the time he wanted to meet with an EEO counselor. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Salas</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee may suffer unlawful retaliation if his supervisor interferes with his EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See Binseel v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970584 (October 8, 1998);<span class="Italic"> see also</span> <span class="Italic">Marr v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941344 (June 27, 1996); and <span class="Italic">Whidbee v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120040193 (March 31, 2005). In this case, complainant claimed that he told his supervisor that he wanted to talk to an EEO counselor, and his supervisor stated that he would terminate complainant if he met with an EEO counselor and it delayed complainant from going "out to the field" the following week.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the supervisor provided a different account of this incident. The supervisor stated that complainant told him that he was not reporting to the training site the following week because he had a meeting scheduled with an EEO counselor on June 2 or 3, 2004 and his <span id="Page_671"></span>attorney on May 30, 2004. The supervisor stated that he did not threaten to terminate complainant if he met with the counselor, but he did contact the Regional Office Equal Employment Manager to determine if the meetings with the counselor and attorney would take precedence over the scheduled training. The supervisor stated that normally EEO counseling initially occurs over the telephone, and the Equal Employment Manager instructed him to inform complainant that he would be given the opportunity to contact an EEO counselor over the telephone from the training site, which he did. Complainant has the burden to prove that his account is true. However, we find that the supervisor's account is more credible because it is much more detailed than complainant's account and is corroborated by a Human Resources Specialist, who stated that he informed complainant's supervisor that sending complainant to field training took precedence over other matters because the training was a condition of complainant's employment, and the agency provided complainant time to contact the EEO counselor during training. We further note that the totality of the supervisor's testimony is strongly supported by documentation from other officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we are persuaded that the supervisor did not threaten complainant about contacting an EEO counselor. We are further persuaded that the supervisor informed complainant that he must attend training critical to his position, but he would be provided access to an EEO counselor while completing the training. The record supports the supervisor's contention that completion of the training was critical to complainant's continued employment with the agency. Moreover, unlike cases wherein management officials intimated or interfered with employees' EEO activity, in this case the agency reasonably offered to provide complainant access to EEO officials while complainant completed training critical to his position. <span class="Italic">See John B. Whidbee v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120040193 (March 31, 2005) (Commission found reprisal when supervisor informed all employees that if they wanted to file an EEO complaint, they needed to discuss it with him first); <span class="Italic">See also Henry G. Minor v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120064925 (September 25, 2008) (Commission found reprisal when supervisor rescheduled complainant's appointment with the EEO Counselor without asking complainant, did not initially have any information for complainant regarding when the new appointment would be, and told complainant that he would "just have to miss his EEO appointment"). In essence, the supervisor's actions in this case were not reasonably likely to deter complainant from engaging in the EEO process; in fact, they provided complainant access to the EEO process while training at a remote site. Consequently, we find that the supervisor did not engage in unlawful retaliation against complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120132043 (2015), the Commission found there was no denial of official time where the supervisor held the request for one day because a new supervisor was coming on board the following day.</p>
