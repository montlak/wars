<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-55"><span class="space">a.</span> Current Conventions and Past Practice</h5>
<p class="noindent">In the past, the Commission had a difficult time deciding whether attendance is an essential function of a position. Its current position is that job attendance is not an essential function of the position in question if the complainant can establish a sufficient nexus between any absences and his or her disability. If the complainant establishes such a nexus, it must be determined whether accommodating his or her attendance problems would impose an undue hardship on the agency. When dealing with attendance, absences and tardiness are generally treated the same.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's position has been at variance with most federal courts, which has held that attendance is an essential job function because the employee who does not appear for work cannot perform any essential job functions. However, the latest trend has been that the federal courts are coming to accept the Commission's position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC's position on attendance has to do with whether the complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. Only an individual who is qualified is entitled to reasonable accommodation consideration. Under the Commission's rationale, if attendance were considered as an essential job function then any individual with a disability that interfered with attendance would not be qualified. As a result, the employer would never have to consider whether there was a way to accommodate the attendance problem and, if so, would it impose an undue hardship on the employer. In the Commission's view, whether an attendance issue can be accommodated is a function of undue hardship and not whether the individual is qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's view on the relationship between attendance was most recently adopted by the Special Panel in <span class="Italic">Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 MSPR 613, 2014 MSPB 77 (September 29, 2014). In a 2-1 decision, with MSPB Vice Chair Anne Wagner dissenting, the Panel held that the Department of Homeland Security had failed to accommodate Alvara's sleep apnea by requiring him to work the graveyard shift. In doing so, the Panel rejected the position of Homeland Security and the MSPB that working the graveyard shift was an essential function of a border protection office. <span class="Italic">Alvara</span> is discussed fully later under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-23-058.html#sec14-57">Job Attendance--Essential Functions and Undue Hardship.</a>"</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to fully understand this position, it is necessary to discuss how the Commission arrived at that position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission succinctly summarized its position on the relationship between job attendance and being a qualified individual in <span class="Italic">Martinez v. General Services Administration</span>, 0120122326 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that requests for paid or unpaid disability-related leave can constitute requests for a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Corbett v. Gen. Serv. Admn</span>., EEOC Petition No. 03A10017 (Apr. 12, 2001). The Commission has also held that an agency violates the Rehabilitation Act to discipline an employee for work missed during leave taken as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Ricco v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A10007 (Feb. 21, 2002. In a case involving excessive absence from work, an individual with a disability may establish that he or she is qualified by showing that there is a sufficient nexus between the absences and the claimed disability. <span class="Italic">Roscoe v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974138 (Sept. 21, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an individual's disability or need for a reasonable accommodation is not obvious, and the individual fails to provide reasonable documentation requested by the employer, the employer will not be held liable for failure to provide the requested accommodation. Enforcement Guidance, q. 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency does not have a duty to excuse an employee's misconduct as a form of reasonable accommodation to that employee's disability where <span id="Page_1159"></span>such misconduct would result in discipline or discharge if committed by another employee. <span class="Italic">See Stallworth v. Dep't of Veterans Aff</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01893705 (Jan. 29, 1990). <span class="Italic">req. to reconsider den. Stallworth v. Dep't of Veterans Aff</span>., EEOC Request No. 05900416 (Aug. 2, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Martinez</span> went on to find that the complainant was not qualified explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant was charged AWOL, placed on leave use restriction, and suspended because of her excessive use of leave and failure to follow procedures for using leave and arriving to and departing from work. It was Complainant's repetitive history of unscheduled and excessive leave usage with little improvement by Complainant which led the Agency to engage in the actions that Complainant claims were discriminatory. Accordingly, the Agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that Complainant has not shown that her often unscheduled absences were linked to her alleged disability. Complainant was repeatedly asked to provide medical documentation to support her absences and failed to do so. The sparse medical notes which Complainant has provided do not link her alleged disabilities to her use of leave and unscheduled absences. A complainant who has an excessive amount of absences must show a nexus between the absences and the disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See Tsai v. Fed. Deposit Insur. Corp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120035347 (June 14, 2007); <span class="Italic">Roscoe v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974138 (Sept. 21, 2000); <span class="Italic">Southerland v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05930714 (July 15, 1994). Complainant herself stated that she was tardy or absent at times because of her unreliable transportation and because of her daughter. Also, as set forth earlier, the Agency had no duty to excuse Complainant's misconduct by her continued failure to request leave in advance as required and to report her arrival and departure as she was instructed to do. The mere fact that a complainant may have a disability or has engaged in EEO activity does not immunize the complainant from appropriate disciplinary action. When Complainant repeatedly failed to follow the required procedures, the actions taken by the Agency were a matter of discipline and not one related to her disability. <span class="Italic">See Hobbs v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073032 (Mar. 25, 2010) (where complainant was charged with AWOL, placed on leave restriction, and suspended for one day, Commission found that complainant did not follow leave procedures and record lacked discriminatory animus).</p>
<p class="noindent">Originally, the Commission held that attendance was an essential element of any job and a person whose disabling condition prevented him from attaining regular attendance was not a qualified individual with a disability. "[I]t is elemental that one who does not come to work cannot perform any of his job functions, essential or otherwise." <span class="Italic">Margotta v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01911253 (1991), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Wimbley v. Bolger</span>, 642 F. Supp. 481, 485 (W.D. 1986). However, the Commission acknowledged that reduced work attendance is generally a fact of life for disabled persons, and a mere reduction in attendance does not remove a person from the protections of the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 03910062 (1991). The Commission did not establish any bright-line guidance for when a reduction in attendance became so significant that it interfered with the ability of the employee to perform the essential functions of his or her position. Rather, it approached the issue on a case-by-case basis, analyzing the requirements of the particular position and the pattern of attendance involved.</p>
<p class="noindent">In later cases, the Commission continued to be unclear on the precise relationship between job attendance and reasonable accommodation. Initially, the Commission issued some opinions indicating that job attendance was an essential function of job performance. Poor attendance could prevent an employee from being considered a qualified individual with a disability. The Commission has since rejected that view and now evaluates job attendance in light of the agency's burden of demonstrating an undue hardship. There are no bright-line rules as to the extent that job attendance must be impaired before accommodation would impose an undue hardship. However, an undue hardship is placed on an agency when the employee has been out of work for a year and his doctors cannot make a prediction as to a return date. <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 03940025 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to accommodate an employee by allowing her to work whenever she is able. Although the Commission misanalyzed the case by focusing on whether the requested accommodation was reasonable and not whether it imposed an undue hardship on the agency, <span class="Italic">Silvestri v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01A22175 (2004), still gives a good account of some of the parameters of dealing with requests for a flexible work schedule:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will assume, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that complainant is an individual with a disability. After establishing that she is an individual with a disability, however, complainant must still show that she is a "qualified" individual with a disability within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). A "qualified individual with a disability" is an individual with a disability who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The agency must provide reasonable accommodations for known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless the accommodation would impose a undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(a). In the context of providing an accommodation, undue hardship means significant difficulty or expense incurred by the agency. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency denied complainant's request for a flexible work schedule. The agency argues, even assuming that complainant is an individual with a disability, she is not a qualified individual with a disability, because regular attendance is an essential function of the job. According to the Production Manager, between July 1996 through October 1997, the period in which he directly supervised complainant, complainant was absent from work approximately 20% of the time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations contemplate the creation of an accommodation through "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that [would] enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(1). A modified work schedule is a type of reasonable accommodation contemplated by the Commission's regulations. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2). A modified work schedule may involve adjustment to arrival or departure times, periodic breaks, altering when certain functions are performed, or providing additional unpaid leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC No. 915.002 (Revised Oct. 17, 2002) at question 22 ("Reasonable Accommodation Guidance").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act when it denied complainant's requests for a flexible work schedule between 1994 and 1998. First, a reasonable accommodation must be effective. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Airways v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391, 400 (2002) (cited in <span class="Italic">Wiley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20105 (September 15, 2003), <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A40147 (December 11, 2003)). It is unclear exactly what kind of flexible schedule complainant sought, as complainant does not request any a specific schedule, other than one that would allow her to work when she was able, "intermittently or consecutive[ly] as necessary." An attempt by the Production Supervisor of the HED, who took over the Business Office, shows that even if complainant's requests for that type of flexible work schedule had been granted, her problems regarding attendance and keeping up with her workload would not have been resolved. In his affidavit the Production Supervisor explains that he "made her a slot to work at, at her own pace, and time to where she wouldn't...be felt pressured down." He testifies that complainant "was coming in late and staying late, and she did real well. She kept her eight hours real well, and that went on a couple of weeks or so and then it sort of filtered off. She started missing again." Second, a reasonable accommodation must be reasonable on its face, i.e., plausible or feasible. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 401-02. The record indicates that the only accommodation that would have been effective would be one that would have allowed complainant to report to work whenever she felt able; however, such an accommodation is not reasonable on its face. <span class="Italic">See Wiley</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20105, <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A40147. The Production Manager stated in his affidavit that a number of employees had to do complainant's work during her absence, and "her unavailability for work severely impacted the efficiency of the organization." The Production Supervisor stated that complainant's absences were "really interrupting the business." The Acting Business Manager stated that due to complainant's frequent absences, complainant had to be given work without deadlines, and that she could never be given work assignments with the expectation that they would be completed on any particular date. As stated in <span class="Italic">Wiley</span>, "It is not 'plausible' or 'feasible' for an employer to excuse chronic erratic absenteeism and tardiness by an employee who cannot provide timely notice sufficient to enable the employer to ensure adequate staffing." EEOC Appeal No. 07A20105, <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05 A40147. Therefore, the Commission concludes that complainant is not a qualified individual with a disability, and that she did not establish that the agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her alleged disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">While attendance <span class="Italic">per se</span> is not an essential job function, the ability to be present in the workplace is when the functions of a position cannot be performed at any place other than the worksite. In <span class="Italic">Lewandoski v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120060102 (2008), the complainant was a supervisory pharmacist who had a life-threatening allergy to latex. In addition to filling and verifying prescriptions, she was responsible for supervising the pharmacy technicians. The Commission found that since none of the essential functions could be performed at home and the complainant could not be in the workplace where it was impossible to eliminate all possible exposure to latex, the complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a somewhat different situation, the Commission found that a supervisory medical support assistant who could work only four hours a day was not <span id="Page_1160"></span>qualified because the essential functions of the position could not be performed on a part-time basis. Not only did the essential functions of the position require the employee's presence in the workplace, but the nature of the duties themselves required the employee's presence for a full shift. In <span class="Italic">Luellen v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120111273 (2011), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant, in essence, is asking that the Agency create a job. Her position of Supervisory Medical Support Assistant is a full-time position, and permanently reducing it to four hours a day would create a different position. The Agency is not required to do this. Also, the Agency has shown that essential functions of this full-time job could not be performed part-time, i.e., Complainant supervised 10 full-time employees and was unable part-time to provide the required and necessary management of her program and monitoring and assisting her employees, such as ensuring they were at their work stations, helping with daily questions regarding individual patient registration difficulties as they occurred, delegating staff to high demand locations as needed, and participating in unscheduled meetings which occur at the discretion of direct care staff to prevent disruption of patient care. Further, she is not available to fill in for staff on leave and during high demand times to assure prompt customer service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Agency permitted Complainant to work part-time for a short period, she was unable to perform essential functions of her job, examples of which are listed above, and this was disruptive to the Agency because her supervisor had to step in and perform her job, which interfered with his ability to manage nine other departments and provide executive oversight.</p>
