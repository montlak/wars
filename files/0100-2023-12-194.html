<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-182"><span class="space">H.</span> STANDING: FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM--REPRISAL COMPLAINTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">In retaliation cases, as noted above, there was a split in the courts, as well as a split between some courts and the Commission, about the standing requirement. Some courts had become increasingly strict in their interpretation of what actions on the part of an employer fall within the ambit of Title VII. Other courts and the Commission took a far more liberal view. The standing requirement in reprisal complaints also is referred to as the "adverse action" requirement and is discussed further in this chapter in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-12-114.html#sec3-113">Failure to State a Claim: Investigations and Other Proceedings--Collateral Attacks</a>," and Chapter 17, subheadings "<a href="0100-2023-26-048.html#sec17-49">Adverse Treatment Requirement</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-12-199.html#sec3-187">Chilling Effect</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's present view of the adverse treatment requirement is summed up in <span class="Italic">Pflanz v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A55645 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding complainant's claim of reprisal, the Commission has stated that adverse actions need not qualify as "ultimate employment actions" or materially affect the terms and conditions of employment to constitute retaliation.<span class="Italic"> Lindsey v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980410 (Nov. 4, 1999) (citing EEOC Compliance Manual, No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998)). Instead, the statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based upon a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that complainant has asserted a claim of unlawful retaliation. We note that in its final decision, the agency cited to<span class="Italic"> Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A51780 (March 31, 2005) which found that emails between co-workers regarding a complainant's malfeasance failed to state a claim of retaliation. The scenario presented by complainant's complaint is not an email between co-workers. Complainant claims that the email was printed and posted on the board for employees and visitors to see. Complainant asserted that the action by the Supervisory Special Agent was taken based upon his prior protected activity. Further, we find that such action is reasonably likely to deter the complainant and others from engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, the Commission's view was essentially adopted by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern &#x0026; Sante Fe Railway Co. v. White</span>, 126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006). In <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span>, the Supreme Court upheld a liberal interpretation of the antiretaliation clause of Title VII finding that the section bars any action by an employer, inside or outside of the workplace, that could reasonably deter an individual from filing or pursuing a complaint of discrimination. The Court, in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span>, held that the "anti-retaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace. We also conclude that the provision covers those (and only those) employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant. In the present context that means that the employer's actions must be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." The Court found that provision has a substantially larger ambit than the section of Title VII prohibiting discrimination on the bases of race, color, sex, national origin and religion. See Chapter 17, subsection on "<a href="0100-2023-26-048.html#sec17-49">Adverse Treatment Requirement</a>" for a full discussion of <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern,</span> the Commission adopted the position that a reprisal complainant need not show a concrete employment action or a material change in working conditions. A complainant need only show "adverse treatment." Moreover, the Commission, consistent with <span class="Italic">Hashimoto v. Dalton</span>, 118 F. 3d 671 (9th Cir. 1997)<span class="Italic">,</span> has indicated that the issue of tangible harm goes to the amount of damages and not to the question of liability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's most cogent position on the subject is set forth in the EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, 8-II(D):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;ADVERSE ACTION</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The most obvious types of retaliation are denial of promotion, refusal to hire, denial of job benefits, demotion, suspension, and discharge. Other types of adverse actions include threats, reprimands, negative evaluations, harassment, or other adverse treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Suspending or limiting access to an internal grievance procedure also constitutes an "adverse action." For example, in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Board of Governors of State Colleges &#x0026; Universities</span>, a university's collective bargaining agreement provided for a specific internal grievance procedure leading to arbitration. The agreement further provided that this procedure could be terminated if the employee sought resolution in any other forum, such as the EEOC. The Seventh Circuit ruled that termination of the grievance process constituted an adverse employment action in violation of the anti-retaliation clause of the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Adverse Actions Can Occur After the Employment Relationship Between the Charging Party and Respondent Has Ended</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Shell Oil Company</span>, the Supreme Court unanimously held that Title VII prohibits respondents from retaliating against former employees as well as current employees for participating in any proceeding under Title VII or opposing any practice made unlawful by that Act. The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> alleged that his former employer gave him a negative job reference in retaliation for his having filed an EEOC charge against it. Some courts previously had held that former employees could not challenge retaliation that occurred after their employment had ended because Title VII, the ADEA, and the EPA prohibit retaliation against "any employee." However, the Supreme Court stated that coverage of post-employment retaliation is more consistent with the broader context of the statute and with the statutory purpose of maintaining unfettered access to the statute's remedial mechanisms. The Court's holding applies to each of the statutes enforced by the EEOC because of the similar language and common purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examples of post-employment retaliation include actions that are designed to interfere with the individual's prospects for employment, such as giving an unjustified negative job reference, refusing to provide a job reference, and informing an individual's prospective employer about the individual's protected activity. However, a negative job reference about an individual who engaged in protected activity does not constitute unlawful retaliation unless the reference was based on a retaliatory motive. The truthfulness of the information in the reference may serve as a defense unless there is proof of pretext, such as evidence that the former employer routinely declines to offer information about its former employees' job performance and violated that policy with regard to an individual who engaged in protected activity. See Section 8-II E. below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Retaliatory acts designed to interfere with an individual's prospects for employment are unlawful regardless of whether they cause a prospective employer to refrain from hiring the individual. As the Third Circuit stated, "an employer who retaliates cannot escape liability merely because the retaliation falls short of its intended result." However, the fact that the reference did not affect the individual's job prospects may affect the relief that is due.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Adverse Actions Need Not Qualify as "Ultimate Employment <span id="Page_251"></span>Actions" or Materially Affect the Terms or Conditions of Employment to Constitute Retaliation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some courts have held that the retaliation provisions apply only to retaliation that takes the form of ultimate employment actions. Others have construed the provisions more broadly, but have required that the action materially affect the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission disagrees with those decisions and concludes that such constructions are unduly restrictive. The statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity. Of course, petty slights and trivial annoyances are not actionable, as they are not likely to deter protected activity. More significant retaliatory treatment, however, can be challenged regardless of the level of harm. As the Ninth Circuit has stated, the degree of harm suffered by the individual "goes to the issue of damages, not liability."</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span>--CP [Complaining Party] filed a charge alleging that he was racially harassed by his supervisor and co-workers. After learning about the charge, CP's manager asked two employees to keep CP under surveillance and report back about his activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The surveillance constitutes an "adverse action" that is likely to deter protected activity, and is unlawful if it was conducted because of CP's protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 2</span>--CP filed a charge alleging that she was denied a promotion because of her gender. One week later, her supervisor invited a few employees out to lunch. CP believed that the reason he excluded her was because of her EEOC charge. Even if the supervisor chose not to invite CP because of her charge, this would not constitute unlawful retaliation because it is not reasonably likely to deter protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example 3</span>--Same as Example 2, except that CP's supervisor invites all employees in CP's unit to regular weekly lunches. The supervisor excluded CP from these lunches after she filed the sex discrimination charge. If CP was excluded because of her charge, this would constitute unlawful retaliation since it could reasonably deter CP or others from engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's position is based on statutory language and policy considerations. The anti-retaliation provisions are exceptionally broad. They make it unlawful "to discriminate" against an individual because of his or her protected activity. This is in contrast to the general anti-discrimination provisions which make it unlawful to discriminate with respect to an individual's "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." The retaliation provisions set no qualifiers on the term "to discriminate," and therefore prohibit any discrimination that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity. They do not restrict the actions that can be challenged to those that affect the terms and conditions of employment. Thus, a violation will be found if an employer retaliates against a worker for engaging in protected activity through threats, harassment in or out of the workplace, or any other adverse treatment that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity by that individual or other employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This broad view of coverage accords with the primary purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions, which is to "[m]aintain[ ] unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms." Regardless of the degree or quality of harm to the particular complainant, retaliation harms the public interest by deterring others from filing a charge. An interpretation of Title VII that permits some forms of retaliation to go unpunished would undermine the effectiveness of the EEO statutes and conflict with the language and purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's current regulations at 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(5) require that agencies dismiss complaints that involve a proposal to take action or a preliminary step to an employment action. In July 2012, the Commission amended section (a)(5) to read that an agency shall dismiss a complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That is moot or alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel action, is discriminatory, unless the complaint alleges that the proposal or preliminary step is retaliatory;...</p>
<p class="noindent">77 Fed. Reg. 43498. The intent is to bring the Commission's regulation in line with the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the harm must be present rather than merely speculative as the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Milissa H. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120161158 (2016). In that case, the complainant received counseling on three allegations of alleged ongoing retaliatory harassment. When the complainant filed her formal complaint, she did not specifically list the three allegations for which she received counseling, but instead noted "[t]his is continued harassment based on [her] original complaint filed in August of 2014 after being assaulted by a co-worker (kicked multiple times)." The Commission reversed the agency's dismissal for failure to state a claim in <span class="Italic">Milissa H</span>., holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's alternate dismissal for claim (a), failure to state a claim pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1). The Agency argues that even applying the "broader" standard of review reserved for complaints of reprisal, the alleged "continued harassment" and management's failure to uphold the "zero tolerance" policy, either do not threaten or inflict any actual harm, or concern harm that is merely speculative. Citing our decision in <span class="Italic">Gorrasi v. Nat'l Inst. Of Health and Human Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120150744 (Apr. 17, 2015), the Agency concludes that the allegation in claim (a) is "unlikely to reasonably deter protected activity and does not state a viable claim retaliation." We disagree with this application because the Agency improperly failed to consider claim (a) within the context of an ongoing harassment complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The alleged speculative harm in <span class="Italic">Gorassi</span> was a "more difficult work life" due to the removal of one of Complainant's staff, which Complainant expected would make it harder to meet her performance goals. We determined in that instance that Complainant suffered no present harm and the alleged future harm was speculative. Here, Complainant alleges present harm in the form of ongoing harassment, which she attributes to management's failure to implement the "zero tolerance" policy. Unlike <span class="Italic">Gorassi</span>, which involved a single incident and addressed anticipated, rather than actual, harm, claim (a) alleges a present pattern of ongoing harassment and management's improper handling of the matter. When viewed within the context of a harassment complaint, claim (a) states a viable retaliation claim pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1), and should not have been dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan S. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120170316 (2017) (reversing a dismissal for failure to state a claim where the complainant alleged reprisal when management recommended that she be reassigned to a different department, but took no action to effectuate the transfer).</p>
