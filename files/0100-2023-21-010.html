<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-11"><span class="space">3.</span> Preferential Treatment for Submission to Advances</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is possible to base an allegation of tangible employment action sexual harassment on the preferential treatment that is given to another individual because of submission to sexual advances. In the Commission's view, the nature of the claim that may be brought by a party other than someone subjected to sexual advances depends on whether the favored individual's submission to the advances was voluntary or involuntary, and whether the favoritism was widespread. The Commission has set forth two different rules depending on the circumstances present: (1) If submission to the sexual advances was involuntary and involved a tangible employment action, then only individuals of the favored employee's gender are aggrieved; (2) regardless of whether submission to the sexual advances was voluntary or involuntary, if the favoritism was widespread, then a hostile environment claim can be brought by a complainant of either gender.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission set forth this position in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912961 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the complainant alleged that she was not selected for a promotion on the basis of sexual harassment. The complainant did not contend that she had been harassed herself; rather, she contended that the selectee was being rewarded for submission to sexual harassment by the selecting official. In <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n the instant case, appellant states on appeal that she is basing her complaint on the provisions of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(g):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Where employment opportunities or benefits are granted because of an individual's submission to the employer's sexual advances <span id="Page_807"></span>or request for sexual favors, the employer may be held liable for unlawful sex discrimination against other persons who were qualified for but were denied that employment opportunity or benefit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant is alleging not that she was personally subjected to "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" sexual harassment, but that the harassment is favoritism to which the selectee was subjected and her submission to such harassment resulted in the selectee's promotion and appellant's nonselection. The Commission has stated that sexual favoritism in the work place which adversely affects the employment opportunities of third parties may take the place of "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" harassment or "hostile work environment" harassment. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Policy Guidance on Employer Liability under Title VII for Sexual Favoritism, (January 12, 1990), p. 1-2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission's position is that Title VII does not always prohibit instances of preferential treatment based upon consensual romantic relationships. Although an isolated instance of favoritism towards a spouse or friend may be unfair, it does not discriminate against men or women in violation of Title VII because both groups are equally disadvantaged by the favoritism. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Aluminum Co. of America</span>, 679 F. Supp. 495 (W.D. Pa.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">mem.</span>, 856 F.2d 184 (3rd Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">DeCintio v. Westchester County Medical Center</span>, 807 F.2d 304 (2nd Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span> 108 S. Ct. 89 (1987); EEOC Policy Guidance, <span class="Italic">Supra</span> p. 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, favoritism based on coerced sexual conduct may constitute "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" harassment. If a female employee is coerced into submitting to unwelcomed sexual advances in return for an employment opportunity or benefit, other female employees who were qualified for but were denied the benefit may be able to establish that sex was, in general, made a condition for receiving such employment benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Policy Guidance, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, p.3-4. Courts have held that Title VII violation may be established when an employer affords preferential treatment to a female employee who has submitted to sexual advances or other conduct of a sexual nature, when such conduct is a matter of common knowledge. <span class="Italic">Broderick v. Ruder</span>, 685 F. Supp. 1269, 1277 (D.D.C. 1988) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the present circumstances, appellant must show that the submission to unwelcomed sexual advances was used as a basis for making the selection at issue. However, after a thorough review of the record as a whole and all of appellant's contentions, the Commission finds no persuasive evidence tending to show:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1) The selectee and the SO were engaged in a romantic relationship, either consensual or coerced; (2) The selectee submitted to the SO's advances; or (3) That the SO made the selectee's submission to his advances a condition for the granting of employment benefits in general or this promotion in particular. As noted by the Court in <span class="Italic">DeCintio</span>, EEOC Guidelines addressed the granting of employment benefits because of an individual's "submission" to sexual advances, therein, use of the word "submission" connotes a lack of consent. <span class="Italic">DeCintio</span>, 807 F. 2d. at 307-308.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has considered all of the evidence presented; however, there is no evidence suggesting that the SO forced or coerced the selectee or anyone else to submit to sexual advances in order to win promotion. Appellant asserted the SO gave the selectee flowers on one occasion, a birthday cake, and a ride to her interview on another occasion, and that he engaged in certain other preferential treatment toward the selectee. Both the SO and the selectee denied that a personal relationship existed, and appellant has failed to offer any persuasive evidence to refute their contentions in this regard. The selectee admitted that she received flowers and certain other types of attention from the SO; however, she stated that after she discussed the situation with the SO and asked him not to give her flowers again, he stopped this behavior. The SO admitted that he gave the selectee flowers and that she asked him not to do so again. Although the record suggests the SO liked the selectee, the incidence of favoritism cited by appellant without more, are insufficient to establish "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's Policy Guidance also states that if favoritism based upon the granting of sexual favors is widespread in a work place, both male and female employees who do not welcome such conduct can establish a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII, regardless of whether any objectionable conduct is personally directed at them, and regardless of whether those who are granted favorable treatment willingly bestowed the sexual favors. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Policy Guidance, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, p. 5. In this case, appellant has not alleged, nor is there other evidence suggesting, that the alleged behavior of the SO was more widespread or was extended to employees other than the selectee, or that supervisors generally conveyed the message that female employees could be promoted by engaging in sexual conduct. There is no evidence in the record sufficient to establish such a pattern of conduct....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> held that, in situations where a female employee is coerced into sexual favors by a male superior in order to attain an employment benefit, only the other females who were qualified for and denied the benefit may be aggrieved. The qualified females who were not selected would need to show that submission to sexual advances was made a condition for receiving the employment benefit. The Commission apparently reasons that males are not aggrieved in such cases because submission to sexual favors would gain them nothing. The problem with this approach is twofold. First, males are just as aggrieved as non-consenting females because of their sex under this type of scenario. When the male supervisor conditions employment benefits upon submission to sexual favors, males are, because of their sex, excluded from receiving those benefits to the same degree as are females who refuse to submit to the advances. The second problem concerns remedies. If every qualified female who is not selected for any given promotion has a cause of action, there is no way to fashion a remedy that grants the employment benefit at issue to each aggrieved female. In <span class="Italic">Cooper v. General Services Administration</span>, 01951368 (1997), the complainant alleged that she was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment when she was not promoted, while a female employee who socialized after hours with certain of the selecting officials was promoted and a female employee who received backing from a male director was promoted. In contrast to <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the complainant did not assert, and nothing in the record indicated, that management officials conditioned the promotion on submission to sexual advances. In addition, a male was promoted along with the two females. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> found the basis of the allegation was favoritism and not sex discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that appellant's allegations regarding sexual favoritism towards A-1 (and to some extent A-2), even if true, constituted isolated incidents not rising to the level of sexual harassment of appellant. We note, also, that appellant failed to present probative evidence demonstrating that the RO or any other male officials would have or did treat male employees differently with regard to promotional opportunities. Rather, assuming that any unfairness occurred, male applicants shared the same disadvantages relative to the female selectees. We note, additionally, that appellant did not adequately support her allegation that widespread private "partying" occurred between A-1 and the RO. In this regard, numerous witnesses persuasively testified that the after-hours "parties" referred to by appellant were open to all employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find appellant's arguments relating to her failure to be selected for one of the vacancies equally unpersuasive because she did not show that she was more qualified for the positions than either of the female selectees. We find that the selection of A-1 and A-2 was supported by the evidence, namely the testimony of the Panelists and the documentary evidence regarding the qualifications of the applicants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, to the extent that appellant alleged that she was subjected to a hostile environment because of the alleged discriminatory conduct, the Commission finds that appellant has not established a pattern of conduct sufficiently pervasive or severe to amount to harassment and to create a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. at 69. Accordingly, having considered the aforementioned arguments, along with those arguments not explicitly addressed herein, we find that appellant has not established that she was subjected to sexual harassment or sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Turner v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A20239 (2003), the Commission found that there was no actionable sexual harassment where the complainant alleged that a supervisor was romantically involved with the selectee. "In the instant case, complainant alleged merely a romantic relationship between the selectee and the supervisor, but made no allegation of any coercion on the part of the supervisor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>; s<span class="Italic">ee also</span> <span class="Italic">Roy v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A50021 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">When employment decisions are premised upon the granting of sexual favors, even if on a consensual basis, all other employees, females and males alike, may be aggrieved. It does not matter that the conduct is not directed toward them, provided the conduct involved is sufficiently pervasive to alter the work environment. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Bernardi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922970 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission finds that appellant's allegation of sexual harassment was mischaracterized by the agency and the MSPB AJ. In this regard, we note that the agency emphasized periodically throughout the processing of this case that appellant did not cite a particular instance of sexual harassment which was directed against her. EEOC Policy Guidance on Employer Liability under Title VII for Sexual Favoritism, No. N-915-048, (January 12, 1990) makes clear that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If favoritism based upon the granting of sexual favors is widespread in a workplace, both male and female colleagues who do not welcome this conduct can establish a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII regardless of whether any objectionable conduct is directed at them and regardless of whether those who were granted favorable treatment willingly bestowed the sexual favors. In these circumstances, a message is implicitly conveyed that the managers view women as "sexual playthings," thereby creating an atmosphere that is demeaning to women. Both men and women who find this offensive can establish a violation if the conduct is "sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of (their) employment and create an abusive working environment.'" <span class="Italic">Vinson</span>, <span id="Page_808"></span>477 U.S. at 67, (quoting <span class="Italic">Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 904, 29 EPD 32,993 (11th Cir. 1982)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, it is not dispositive that appellant did not cite any instance of discrimination which was directed at her personally. Rather, appellant's claim of sexual harassment is that given the atmosphere of favoritism and sexual conduct, which she found offensive, she was forced to resign....</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Cavanuagh v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03287 (2002), the Commission held that there was no actionable claim under Title VII where the complainant alleged that the supervisor's wife was given preferential treatment. The Commission held that the preferential treatment was not based on sex, but on the spousal relationship.</p>
<p class="noindent">A consensual relationship that affects the work environment, however, generally will not rise to the level of sexual harassment, even when the relationship results in some unfair treatment of other employees. In <span class="Italic">Ball v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930708 (1994), the Commission noted that "'Title VII does not prohibit isolated instances of preferential treatment based upon consensual romantic relationships. An isolated instance of favoritism toward a "paramour" may be unfair, but it does not discriminate against women or men in violation of Title VII, since both are disadvantaged for reasons other than their genders.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting EEOC Policy Guidance on Employer Liability under Title VII for Sexual Favoritism, N-915-048 (January 1990)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hauser v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01960361 (1998); <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01965466 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Dailey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15091 (2002), the Commission found the complainant stated an actionable claim of hostile environment harassment based on allegations that her supervisor's treatment and pursuit of "younger, cuter" female employees created a hostile environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that the agency improperly dismissed complainant's complaint. Complainant asserts that the Postmaster manipulated the work schedule to allow himself and a female employee to spend time together, demonstrating favoritism and rewards toward the female employee. Further, complainant claims that the relationship and the Postmaster's other purported actions toward female employees have subjected her to a sexually-charged work environment. We have held that evidence of the general work atmosphere, involving employees other than a complainant, is relevant to the issue of whether a hostile work environment existed<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (April 15, 1999); <span class="Italic">Broderick v. Securities Exchange Commission,</span> 685 F. Supp. 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the agency's dismissal of complainant's complaint is REVERSED, and the claim is REMANDED to the agency for further processing consistent with the ORDER set forth herein.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the voluntary acceptance of sexual favors from an employee does not create a claim for other employees. In <span class="Italic">Becerra v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 94 F.3d 145, 149-50 (4th Cir. 1996), the court rejected a claim from a male plaintiff that he was being subjected to sex discrimination because the selecting official favored his paramour:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[B]ecerra claims that there is evidence of a sexually hostile environment wherein Pallas was trading sexual favors for promotional opportunities to Becerra's career detriment. Becerra relies on 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(g) to establish this definition of sexual harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other related practices: Where employment opportunities or benefits are granted because of an individual's submission to the employer's sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, the employer may be held liable for unlawful sex discrimination against other persons who are qualified but denied that employment opportunity or benefit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court relied on <span class="Italic">DeCintio v. Westchester County Medical Center</span>, 807 F.2d 304 (2d Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 484 U.S. 825 (1987), one case in a line of cases that holds that an employer who promotes his lover or paramour, or otherwise accords the lover or paramour preferential treatment, is not liable for sexual harassment under Title VII. In <span class="Italic">DeCintio</span>, the male plaintiffs claimed discrimination when a female who was engaged in a sexual relationship with the selecting official was promoted over them. The Second Circuit held that promotion of a paramour does not violate Title VII:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[The selecting official's] conduct, although unfair, simply did not violate Title VII. [The plaintiffs] were not prejudiced because of their status as males; rather, they were discriminated against because [the selecting official] preferred his paramour. [The plaintiffs] faced exactly the same predicament as that faced by any woman applicant for the promotion: No one but [the paramour] could be considered for the appointment because of [the paramour's] special relationship to [the selecting official].</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 308. The Fourth Circuit has cited <span class="Italic">DeCintio</span> in holding that promotion of a friend and political ally is not racial discrimination under Title VII<span class="Italic">. Autry v. North Carolina Dept. of Human Resources</span>, 820 F.2d 1384 (4th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that even accepting as true the fact that the commanding officer was accepting sexual favors from Pallas, this conduct does not amount to sexual discrimination against Becerra under Title VII.</p>
