<h3 class="h3" id="sec16-19"><span class="space">A.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">BABB V. WILKIE</span></span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.</span>, 129 S. Ct. 2343 (2009), called into question whether the shifting burden analysis of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> does indeed apply to age discrimination cases. The Commission determined that <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, a private sector case, did not apply to the federal sector. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01990787 (2002) ("under the ADEA, complainant must show that his age was a determining factor in the agency's action, that is, considerations of age made a difference in the agency's action."). In 2020, the Supreme Court held differently as it relates to federal sector age discrimination cases in <span class="Italic">Babb v. Wilkie, Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. 18-882 (Supreme Court April 6, 2020). The <span class="Italic">Babb</span> Court held three things. First, under the ADEA's federal sector provision, 29 USC 633a(a), liability attaches if "there is any consideration of age in the decision-making process." Age need not be a but-for cause of the employment decision to establish a violation of the ADEA. Second, the but-for analysis will inform remedies. Third, the Federal Government can be held to a stricter standard than other employers.</p>
<p class="noindent">Babb was a clinical pharmacist with the VA. When the VA took away her "advanced scope" designation, making her ineligible for a promotion, denied training opportunities, passed her over for certain positions, and placed her in a new position, she alleged age discrimination. By way of proof, she alleged that supervisors made a variety of age-related comments. The VA moved for summary judgment which the District Court granted, finding that the VA had proffered legitimate reasons for the personnel decisions. Babb appealed, arguing that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analytical framework "is not suited for 'mixed motives' claims." Under the ADEA's federal-sector provision, she argued, even if the VA's reasons were not pretextual, "a personnel action is unlawful if age is a factor in the challenged decision. The Eleventh Circuit panel concluded that her argument was "'foreclosed' by Circuit precedent but added that it might have agreed with her if it were "'writing on a clean slate.'" The Supreme court agreed with <span class="Italic">Babb</span>. First analyzing the text of 29 USC 633a(a) in <span class="Italic">Babb</span>, the Court wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1449"></span>[W]e start with the text of the statute, <span class="Italic">see Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc</span>., 557 U.S. 167, 175 (2009), and as it turns out, it is not necessary to go any further. The plain meaning of the statutory text shows that age need not be a but-for cause of an employment decision in order for there to be a violation of &#x00A7; 633a(a). To explain the basis for our interpretation, we will first define the important terms in the statute and then consider how they relate to each other.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 633a(a) concerns "personnel actions," and while the ADEA does not define this term, its meaning is easy to understand. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which governs federal employment, broadly defines a "personnel action" to include most employment-related decisions, such as appointment, promotion, work assignment, compensation, and performance reviews. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). That interpretation is consistent with the term's meaning in general usage, and we assume that it has the same meaning under the ADEA. Under &#x00A7; 633a(a), personnel actions must be made "free from" discrimination. The phrase "free from" means "un-tainted" or "[c]lear of (something which is regarded as objectionable)." <span class="small">WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY</span> 905 (def. 4(a)(2)) (1976); 4 <span class="small">OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY</span> 521 (def. 12) (1933); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="small">AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY</span> 524 (def. 5(a)) (1969) (defining "free" "used with from" as "[n]ot affected or restricted by a given condition or circumstance"); <span class="small">RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</span> 565 (def. 12) (1966) (defining "free" as "exempt or released from something specified that controls, restrains, burdens, etc."). Thus, under &#x00A7; 633a(a), a personnel action must be made "untainted" by discrimination based on age, and the addition of the term "any" ("free from any discrimination based on age") drives the point home. And as for "discrimination," we assume that it carries its "normal definition," which is "differential treatment." <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed</span>., 544 U.S. 167, 174 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 633a(a), the type of discrimination forbidden is "discrimination based on age," and "[i]n common talk, the phrase 'based on' indicates a but-for causal relationship." <span class="Italic">Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr</span>, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007); <span class="Italic">cf. Comcast Corp. v. National Assn. of African American Owned Media, ante</span>, at 6. Therefore, &#x00A7; 633a(a) requires that age be a but-for cause of the discrimination alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What remains is the phrase "shall be made." "[S]hall be made" is a form of the verb "to make," which means "to bring into existence," "to produce," "to render," and "to cause to be or become." <span class="small">RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</span>, at 866. Thus, "shall be made" means "shall be produced," etc. And the imperative mood, denoting a duty, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="small">BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY</span> 1233 (5th ed. 1979), emphasizes the importance of avoiding the taint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">So much for the individual terms used in &#x00A7; 633a(a). What really matters for present purposes is the way these terms relate to each other. Two matters of syntax are critical. First, "based on age" is an adjectival phrase that modifies the noun "discrimination." It does not modify "personnel actions." The statute does not say that "it is unlawful to take personnel actions that are based on age"; it says that "personnel actions...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." &#x00A7; 633a(a). As a result, age must be a but-for cause of discrimination--that is, of differential treatment--but not necessarily a but-for cause of a personnel action itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, "free from any discrimination" is an adverbial phrase that modifies the verb "made." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Thus, "free from any discrimination" describes how a personnel action must be "made," namely, in a way that is not tainted by differential treatment based on age. If age discrimination plays any part in the way a decision is made, then the decision is not made in a way that is untainted by such discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is the straightforward meaning of the terms of &#x00A7; 633a(a), and it indicates that the statute does not require proof that an employment decision would have turned out differently if age had not been taken into account.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To see what this entails in practice, consider a simple example. Suppose that a decision-maker is trying to decide whether to promote employee A, who is 35 years old, or employee B, who is 55. Under the employer's policy, candidates for promotion are first given numerical scores based on non-discriminatory factors. Candidates over the age of 40 are then docked five points, and the employee with the highest score is promoted. Based on the non-discriminatory factors, employee A (the 35-year-old) is given a score of 90, and employee B (the 55-year-old) gets a score of 85. But employee B is then docked 5 points because of age and thus ends up with a final score of 80. The decision-maker looks at the candidates' final scores and, seeing that employee A has the higher score, promotes employee A.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This decision is not "made" "free from any discrimination" because employee B was treated differently (and less favorably) than employee A (because she was docked five points and A was not). And this discrimination was "based on age" because the five points would not have been taken away were it not for employee B's age.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is true that this difference in treatment did not affect the outcome, and therefore age was not a but-for cause of the decision to promote employee A. Employee A would have won out even if age had not been considered and employee B had not lost five points, since A's score of 90 was higher than B's initial, legitimate score of 85. But under the language of &#x00A7; 633a(a), this does not preclude liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Government has no answer to this parsing of the statutory text. It makes two correct points: first, that "'discrimination based on age'" "requires but-for causation," and, second, that "'discrimination'" means "'"differential treatment."'" Brief for Respondent 16-17. But based on these two points, the Government draws the unwarranted conclusion that "[i]t is thus not enough for a federal employer merely to consider age...if that consideration does not actually cause the employer to make a less favorable personnel action than it would have made for a similarly situated person who is younger." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 17. That conclusion does not follow from the two correct points on which it claims to be based. What follows instead is that, under &#x00A7; 633a(a), age must be the but-for cause of differential treatment, not that age must be a but-for cause of the ultimate decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis remains relevant from a liability perspective. According to the <span class="Italic">Babb</span> Court, the "but-for" or determinative factor test must be employed to determine available remedial relief:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Babb can establish that the VA violated &#x00A7; 633a(a) without proving that age was a but-for cause of the VA's personnel actions, she acknowledges--and we agree--that but-for causation is important in determining the appropriate remedy. It is bedrock law that "requested relief" must "redress the alleged injury." <span class="Italic">Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment</span>, 523 U.S. 83, 103 (1998). Thus, &#x00A7; 633a(a) plaintiffs who demonstrate only that they were subjected to unequal consideration cannot obtain reinstatement, backpay, compensatory damages, or other forms of relief related to the end result of an employment decision. To obtain such remedies, these plaintiffs must show that age discrimination was a but-for cause of the employment outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have long employed these basic principles. In <span class="Italic">Texas v. Lesage</span>, 528 U.S. 18, 21-22 (1999) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), we applied this rule to a plaintiff who sought recovery under Rev. Stat. &#x00A7; 1979, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1983, for an alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause. We explained: "[W]here a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting [damages] relief." 528 U.S., at 21. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 285 (1977) (rejecting rule that "would require reinstatement...even if the same decision would have been reached had the incident not occurred").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion is also supported by traditional principles of tort and remedies law. "Remedies generally seek to place the victim of a legal wrong...in the position that person would have occupied if the wrong had not occurred." R. Weaver, E. Shoben, &#x0026; M. Kelly, <span class="small">PRINCIPLES OF REMEDIES</span> (3d ed. 2017). Thus, "[a]n actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious." Restatement (Third) of Torts &#x00A7; 29, p. 493 (2005). Remedies should not put a plaintiff in a more favorable position than he or she would have enjoyed absent discrimination. But this is precisely what would happen if individuals who cannot show that discrimination was a but for cause of the end result of a personnel action could receive relief that alters or compensates for the end result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although unable to obtain such relief, plaintiffs are not without a remedy if they show that age was a but-for cause of differential treatment in an employment decision but not a but-for cause of the decision itself. In that situation, plaintiffs can seek injunctive or other forward-looking relief. Determining what relief, if any, is appropriate in the present case is a matter for the District Court to decide in the first instance if Babb succeeds in showing that &#x00A7; 633a(a) was violated.</p>
<p class="noindent">As part of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the complainant must establish that the agency official taking or not taking the employment action had knowledge of the complainant's age. However, there is no requirement that the agency official know the precise age of the complainant. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120140428 (2014), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]lthough the Director stated that he did not know Complainant's age at the time of his non-selection, the record reflects that the resume that the Director reviewed revealed that Complainant entered the U.S. Army in January 1972, approximately 40 years before the non-selection at issue. Thus, we conclude that the Director was aware that Complainant was older than 40 years old. Moreover, we find that the Agency's selection of a considerably younger applicant for the position created an inference of age discrimination in this case. <span class="Italic">See O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers, Inc</span>., 517 U.S. 308, 313 (1996). Consequently, we find that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination for this position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Age cases frequently present scenarios where it can be difficult to differentiate between evidence of age discrimination and the consideration of factors that <span id="Page_1450"></span>may be age-related but are distinct. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120110679 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that even though ADOLES stated "I guess you came here to ride into the sunset," we Find that Complainant has not established that in this case these retirement related comments were intended to be a proxy for age based animus. <span class="Italic">See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins</span>, 507 U.S. 604, 613 (1993). Similarly, we do not find persuasive evidence that ADOLES' questions regarding how Complainant would fit in to an environment where his supervisor might be younger and many of the attendees at training would be younger were necessarily a proxy for age based animus. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that ADOLES comments, while poorly phrased, were analytically distinct from age. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 611. In the absence of evidence of unlawful discrimination, the Commission will not second guess the Agency's assessment of the candidates' qualifications. <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 259. We find that Complainant failed to demonstrate that the Agency's proffered reasons for its selection decisions were a pretext for age discrimination. Accordingly, we find that Complainant failed to demonstrate that he was discriminated against as alleged.</p>
