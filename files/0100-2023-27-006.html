<h3 class="h3" id="sec18-7"><span class="space">B.</span> CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE</h3>
<p class="noindent">A constructive discharge can occur where discrimination makes the work environment so hostile that the employee is forced to resign. A constructive discharge does not occur in every case where an employee voluntarily resigns because he feels he has been the victim of discrimination. A constructive discharge occurs only "if the employer deliberately makes an employee's working conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced into an involuntary resignation." <span class="Italic">Carrier v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01830257 (1984). When such a discharge occurs, the agency is liable to the same degree as if it formally terminated the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Employees are not required to formally plead a "constructive discharge" in their complaints. As in other areas, the Commission does not hold complainants to formal pleading requirements. Where the complainant does not file a formal complaint specifically alleging constructive discharge, the Commission will look to whether the circumstances surrounding the resignation should have put the agency on notice that the action was involuntary.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are three elements to a constructive discharge claim. The complainant must show: 1) that a reasonable person in the complainant's position would have found the working condition intolerable; 2) that conduct constituting discrimination created the intolerable working conditions; and 3) that the involuntary resignation was the result of the intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01A00981 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission succinctly stated the parameters of a constructive discharge claim in <span class="Italic">Hoang v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130454 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A constructive discharge occurs when an employee resigns from his employment because he is being subjected to unlawful employment practices. If the resignation is directly related to the agency's unlawful employment practices, it is a foreseeable consequence of those practices and constitutes a constructive discharge. <span class="Italic">See Pernell v. National Archives &#x0026; Records Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120051935 (October 31, 2006). The agency is responsible for a constructive discharge in the same manner that it is responsible for the outright discriminatory discharge of a charging party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has established three elements which a complainant must prove to substantiate a claim of constructive discharge: (1) a reasonable person in the complainant's position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) the complainant's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Walch v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940688 (Apr. 13, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee makes factual allegations to the effect that he is being harassed to secure his resignation or retirement, that is sufficient to put the agency on notice of a constructive discharge claim. The proper course for the agency is to refer the complainant to an EEO counselor on the allegation of constructive discharge. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Yancey v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05940301 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence of record reveals that, on January 3, 1992, appellant filed an extensive brief in support of his appeal in <span class="Italic">Samuel E. Yancey v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01920747 (March 11, 1992). In his appeal statement, appellant asserted that the agency's decision to reassign him to another office in November 1991 was merely continued harassment intended to force him from the office. Appellant further asserted that the November 1991 reassignment was "yet another way for management to cause [him] stress and to try to get [him] to the breaking point so that [he would] either resign, or be forced to go out on disability." In addition, the record reflects that, in a memorandum to the District Manager dated November 13, 1991, appellant specifically referred to the November 1991 incident as "...continued harassment and for taking unfair advantage of an employee who, upon the advice of doctors, has already filed for disability retirement." The record reflects that appellant retired from the agency's employ on October 5, 1992. Based on the foregoing, we find that the assertions raised in the appellant's appeal statement, as well as the memorandum forwarded to the District manager in November 1991, clearly indicated that appellant was asserting that the agency's discriminatory actions precipitated his decision to retire in October 1992. We further find that appellant's statements should have placed the agency on notice that he was raising an issue of constructive discharge, prior to the latest appeal (EEOC Appeal No. 01933958) filed on June 9, 1993<span class="Italic">. See Solomon J. Carey v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901075 (November 27, 1990; <span class="Italic">Austin Simon v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890464 (September 27, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, the Commission finds that the agency, upon being placed on notice of appellant's allegation that his retirement was forced upon him by the agency's discriminatory actions, should have afforded appellant an opportunity to obtain EEO counseling regarding his allegation of constructive discharge....</p>
<p class="noindent">If the employee alleges harassment in the complaint in close proximity to a resignation, this is sufficient to raise the inference that the resignation was a result of the harassment. <span class="Italic">See Furtado v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05900668 (1990); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Simon v. Postmaster General</span>, 05890464 (1990) (holding that the complainant had raised the issue of a constructive discharge where he resigned during informal counseling, but requested reinstatement as a remedy in his formal complaint). "Clearly, if appellant voluntarily retired, he would not be entitled to placement in the position as a remedy even if discrimination were found." <span class="Italic">Simon, supra</span>. A complainant, who states that he is aggrieved because of working conditions, and because of the conditions he felt it necessary to take an early retirement, stated a claim of constructive discharge<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Stazio v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01912345 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">Not every EEO complaint followed by a resignation will be construed as a constructive discharge case. In <span class="Italic">Boyle v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 05920678 (1992), the Commission explained in depth the factors it would consider in determining whether an agency has notice of a constructive discharge claim when a resignation follows an EEO complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission agrees with the agency that the previous decision misapplied prior Commission decisions to the facts of this case. The previous decision cited to <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01911853 (July 16, 1991), and <span class="Italic">Garbers v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880710 (November 30, 1988) as support for the finding that the agency should have been on notice of appellant's constructive discharge claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts of this case differ substantially from those in the cited cases, and from those in other Commission decisions directing the investigation of a constructive discharge claim. Here, appellant retired almost a year after seeking counseling and four months after he filed his formal complaint. There was not the "temporal proximity" of <span class="Italic">Banks</span> (EEO counseling one month after resignation) or <span class="Italic">Garbers</span> (resignation 26 days after EEO <span id="Page_1555"></span>complaint). When appellant submitted investigative affidavits shortly after his retirement, he made no mention of any acts occurring after the detail; thus there were no allegations suggesting a tie between the detail and the retirement a year later. In <span class="Italic">Garbers</span>, the appellant expressed such a tie by stating in his resignation letter that his resignation was based on continual harassment and reprisal. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record of the instant complaint to suggest that appellant alleged any tie to the subject of his EEO complaint at the time he retired. Appellant's appeal statement includes no such assertions, and the agency represents that the allegation was newly raised in his appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has also considered whether any other indicia existed that should have put the agency on notice of a possible constructive discharge claim. In his complaint, appellant alleged that the detail was done to set him up for removal. In his investigative affidavit, he alleged that he was told that officials were going to attempt to get him out of the agency. These statements, however, were consistently tied only to the detail which, the record establishes, ended after 27 days, on August 13, 1988. The Commission finds that the gap in time between the subject of the statements, the detail, and appellant's retirement was too lengthy to put the agency on notice of a constructive discharge claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another indicator that has been relied on by the Commission is the nature of the relief requested by an appellant. In <span class="Italic">Austin Simon v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890464 (September 27, 1990), the Commission found that the agency was on notice of the claim because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the requested relief included placement in a position. The relief was requested in the complaint filed after the appellant retired. The Commission reasoned that if appellant had voluntarily retired, he would not be entitled to placement in the position as a remedy. In this case, appellant also requested relief after he retired, in his investigative affidavit. He did not ask for reinstatement or for placement in his pre-detail position. Rather, he asked for a pay differential, which as back pay can be an appropriate remedy whether or not a resignation or retirement ensues. Thus, appellant's request for relief also was not sufficient to suggest that appellant was claiming constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the gap in time between the detail that was the subject of appellant's complaint and his subsequent retirement, and the absence of any allegations or other indicia tying the two events together, the Commission finds that the agency had received no notice of a constructive discharge allegation during its processing of appellant's complaint. Therefore, the agency did not have a duty to amend the complaint to include appellant's retirement as an issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found a constructive discharge where the agency's CEO "pursued a vendetta" against the complainant in <span class="Italic">Jacquetta C. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2019002196 (2020). The Commission noted that after the CEO learned that the complainant engaged in the EEO process, the CEO threatened the complainant with disciplinary action, tried to demote her and denied her a retention incentive. The Commission detailed the "intolerable conditions" leading to the complainant's resignation in <span class="Italic">Jacquetta C</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant attempts to establish pretext by challenging the validity of the reasons cited by the CEO. The CEO stated that he based his denial decision on Complainant's performance and conduct. S1 stated in her affidavit that an employee may receive a retention incentive if they are in a hard-to-fill critical position, with specialized skills or competencies and/or they are likely to leave if they do not receive a retention incentive. In terms of whether Complainant's prior EEO activity was a factor in the denial of her retention incentive, S1 stated that she could not say for certain, however, she suspected given the timing and other retention incentive approvals that it was a factor. S1 asserted that she recommended a retention incentive for Complainant as she was in a hard to fill position, had several other job offers and was performing beyond expectations. S1 noted that Complainant had previously received two retention incentives during her time as a Clinical Pharmacist at the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The DHSA stated in his affidavit that he agreed with S1 that Complainant deserved the retention incentive. The DHSA asserted that the denial of the retention incentive was strictly the CEO's decision. The DHSA observed that the Pharmacy and Health Center Joint Commission Review returned results higher than any other time in the history of the institution, and that in his opinion Complainant contributed greatly to this while she was Chief Pharmacist. The DHSA attached to his affidavit an extensive list of Pharmacy accomplishments during Complainant's tenure as Chief Pharmacist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Fraud/Waste/Abuse complaint referenced by the CEO, S1 stated that she never saw the allegations that Employee 2 purportedly submitted after Complainant gave her a sub-par mid-year evaluation. S1 stated that Complainant was on a one-year supervisory probation and did not receive Supervisory 101 training until 10 months into her supervisory tenure. S1 asserted that Complainant made great efforts to improve as a supervisor. According to S1, in one of the Pharmacy Reviews conducted during Complainant's tenure, the reviewer stated on September 27, 2017, that the current staff does appear to work well together. As for the issue of Complainant participating unprofessionally on Skype messaging with subordinates, S1 stated that she issued a Letter of Expectation to Complainant and all Pharmacy staff, and the matter was reflected in Complainant's PMAP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that Complainant's prior EEO activity was clearly a factor in the CEO's decision to deny Complainant a retention incentive. The CEO became vindictive toward Complainant beginning with his reaction to her proposed termination of Employee 1. Subsequent to nullifying the proposed termination, the CEO subjected Complainant to measures that included pursuing a Fraud/Waste/Abuse report for which he lacked documentation, having three pharmacy reviews performed even though usually only one was conducted each year and seeking Complainant's demotion despite a clear consensus as to Complainant being an excellent Chief Pharmacist. The CEO became aware of Complainant's prior EEO activity at some point between November 25, 2017-December 21, 2017, and he ordered the denial of Complainant's retention incentive approximately four months later. The record supports that the CEO may have been displeased with Complainant's proposed termination of Employee 1, a proposed termination that was prompted by Employee 1's fundamental mistake that could have endangered patients. We note that not only did the CEO reverse the proposed termination, he also ensured that Employee 1 received a perfect rating for her PMAP closeout by forcing the DHSA to sign the document. In fact, the DHSA stated that he feared retaliation from the CEO if he did not comply. We observe that no other Pharmacist during the relevant time period was denied a retention incentive. Additionally, neither of the two Pharmacists who received retention incentives during the relevant time period had prior EEO activity. We find that the CEO's explanation for denying Complainant a retention incentive is unworthy of credence. We find that the denial of Complainant's retention incentive was attributable to reprisal based on Complainant's prior EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the merits of this claim, Complainant engaged in prior EEO activity when she filed an informal EEO complaint on November 25, 2017, and subsequently filed a formal complaint on December 21, 2017. Complainant maintains that the CEO issued threats of ER/LR disciplinary action against her on seven occasions from November 2017 to April 2018. We find that the identified incidents, considered cumulatively, were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment and that the incidents were attributable to retaliatory harassment based on Complainant's prior EEO activity. Furthermore, the conduct was sufficiently material to deter Complainant or others from engaging in protected activity in the given context. Accordingly, the Commission finds that Complainant has established that she was subjected to a retaliatory hostile work environment as to claim (1)(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that her resignation from the Agency amounted to a constructive discharge. The Commission has established three elements which a complainant must prove to substantiate a claim of constructive discharge: (1) a reasonable person in the complainant's position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) the conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) the complainant's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">Clemente M. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120160661 (March 11, 2016); <span class="Italic">citing Walch v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940688 (April 13, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant references the CEO's various actions and statements against her as the basis for her claim of construction discharge. Specifically, Complainant cites the denial of her retention incentive, the ongoing threats of ER/LR disciplinary action and the threat of demotion despite her impressive accomplishments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also cites events that occurred before her prior EEO activity such as the excessive and unwarranted number of pharmacy reviews, the questioning of her concerning her housing arrangements and the marginalization of her supervisory authority by the reversal of a proposed termination of Employee 1. We find that it is clear the CEO pursued a vendetta against Complainant in part based on her prior EEO activity. The conditions that he created for Complainant were such that a reasonable person would find them intolerable. The DHSA stated that it was in Complainant's best interest to resign because in his opinion, the CEO would have made life very hard for her and possibly ruin her career. S1 stated that she was surprised Complainant stayed as long as she did. Complainant was willing to work for significantly less financial compensation than she could have received elsewhere because she was motivated to offer quality care for an underserved community. She declined employment offers based on her hope that her treatment would improve with the CEO on detail. However, his influence in the facility remained strong while he was on detail and the adverse treatment toward Complainant continued. Complainant's resignation was in response to these intolerable conditions. Therefore, we find that Complainant was constructively discharged in reprisal for her EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1556"></span>Advising an employee that his conduct may be criminal and that discipline may ensue is not sufficient to establish a subsequent resignation is involuntary. In <span class="Italic">Avila v. Postmaster General</span>, 012020435 (2013), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central question in a constructive discharge case is whether the employer, through its unlawful discriminatory behavior, made the employee's working conditions so difficult that any reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">Carmon Coleman v. Dep't of Def.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00003 (Apr. 17, 2002). The Commission has adopted a three-pronged test for establishing a constructive discharge. Complainant must show that: (1) a reasonable person in Complainant's position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct which constituted prohibited discriminatory treatment created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) Complainant's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">Walch v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940688 (Apr. 13, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission concurs with the AJ and finds that substantial evidence supports that Complainant has not shown that the Agency engaged in discriminatory actions which became so intolerable that he had no choice but to resign in lieu of termination. As discussed above, the Agency established legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. Specifically, S1 informed the OWCP that the Agency would be contesting Complainant's claim after learning that Complainant had informed another supervisor that he was moving. The Agency's Office of Inspector General was contacted, and SA1 began an investigation. SA1 observed Complainant moving large furniture at his home in violation of the restrictions listed on his CA-1 form. After being interviewed by SA1 and SA2, Complainant ultimately rescinded his claim and submitted his resignation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claims that he was badgered and forced to immediately resign under threat of jail and termination for filing a false workers' compensation claim. SA1 testified that he only informed Complainant that filing a false workers' compensation claim was a crime and that he had no control over what discipline management would impose. The Commission finds that substantial evidence supports that Complainant failed to show that more likely than not, the Agency's articulated reasons for its actions were a pretext for discrimination. As the Agency's conduct did not amount to discrimination, Complainant cannot establish that his voluntary resignation amounted to a constructive discharge based on discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120133059 (2015) (resignation because shift assignment made daycare difficult was not a constructive discharge).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who, during informal counseling, alleges that agency harassment had reached such a level that she was compelled to resign, stated a claim for constructive discharge when she subsequently resigned. Although her allegation was premature, the EEO counselor should have advised her of this fact and further advised her to return if and when she left the agency. <span class="Italic">See Nix v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05910505 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee submits a letter of resignation after filing an EEO complaint and, in that letter, makes an allegation of constructive discharge, the agency is obliged to direct the employee to amend his complaint. However, if a final agency decision has already issued on the first complaint, the allegation of constructive discharge should be pursued through a new complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01912382 (1991). The mere fact that the employee subsequently resigned after filing an EEO complaint does not mean the original complaint should be construed as alleging a constructive discharge. If two years pass between the filing of the original complaint and the complainant's resignation, that is too long of a period for the Commission to infer that the complainant resigned because of the alleged intolerable conditions that were the subject of the original complaint. <span class="Italic">See Drayton v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 01912310 (1991). Likewise, resignation after filing a complaint over nonselection for promotion does not necessarily implicate a constructive discharge. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Social Security Administration</span>, 04960025 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner argues that but for the discriminatory denial of promotional opportunities on numerous different occasions, he would have remained a career civil servant until his ultimate retirement. Accordingly, petitioner asserts that the prior Commission decision and equity require that the agency retroactively place him in a position, and not merely grant him backpay. In response, the agency notes that petitioner resigned only nine months after filing his EEO complaint challenging his nonselections, but did not seek counseling or file an EEO complaint alleging constructive discharge. Therefore, the agency argues that petitioner's right to backpay ceased as of the date of his resignation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held that a claim of constructive discharge is separate and severable from a claim for relief regarding a finding of discrimination with respect to the denial of a promotion. <span class="Italic">See Fitzgerald v. National Security Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01931739 (November 24, 1993). Even if petitioner's decision to resign had its genesis in the agency's failure to promote him, petitioner did not file an EEO complaint alleging constructive discharge, nor did he ever raise the issue with an EEO counselor, thus precluding the Commission from addressing the issue in the context of his instant complaint. <span class="Italic">See Farnham v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943647 (June 29, 1995). Absent a finding of constructive discharge, petitioner is not entitled to reinstatement as part of his make-whole relief with respect to his instant EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, the agency's offer of backpay until the date of petitioner's resignation constitutes compliance with the Commission's prior decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC has set forth a three-pronged test for determining if resignations amount to constructive discharges. The test was articulated in <span class="Italic">Fritsch v. USPS</span>, 01840292 (1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;a reasonable person in the charging party's position would have found the working conditions intolerable;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;conduct that constituted a Title VII violation against the charging party created the intolerable working conditions; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;the charging party's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent">All of these elements must be present to establish a constructive discharge. <span class="Italic">See Tipton v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01841337 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether the working conditions are intolerable is assessed by an objective reasonable person standard, and not whether an employee is unreasonably sensitive to the work environment. <span class="Italic">See Young-Horvath v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01841498 (1986). "Less than ideal" conditions, such as shortage of space and lack of supplies, are not intolerable. The failure to identify a similarly situated employee of a different protected group who is treated more favorably may prevent an employee from demonstrating a constructive discharge. <span class="Italic">See Burkhart v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01842830 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">"Courts have held that to establish a case of constructive discharge, the employee must prove a purposeful effort on the employer's part to force her resignation, or she must prove that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign under similar circumstances." <span class="Italic">Trammel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01871154 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Young v. Southwestern Savings and Loan Association</span>, 509 F.2d 140 (5th Cir. 1975)); <span class="Italic">Goss v. Exxon Office Systems Co.</span>, 747 F.2d 885 (3d Cir. 1984). No purposeful effort exists when the employee resigns to avoid removal for legitimate reasons. Similarly, a complainant cannot prevail on a constructive discharge claim where he resigns to preserve an entitlement to retirement benefits which he believes would be lost if he was subjected to discipline. <span class="Italic">Polk v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120063036 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the requirement in <span class="Italic">Trammel</span> is stated in the alternative. The complainant can either prove an intentional effort to secure her resignation or the existence of circumstances under which a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. It is not dispositive that such circumstances were not created with the specific intent of securing the resignation of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">The threat of an unsatisfactory performance appraisal does not constitute intolerable work conditions, particularly when the evaluation is not irreversible. <span class="Italic">See Cameron v. Department of Treasury</span>, 01842721 (1986). The Commission also found it was not significant that the employee interpreted the statements of her supervisor to mean that he "would see to it that [her] life would be miserable" if she remained at the agency instead of resigning. The Commission ruled that her subjective perception was not relevant on the issue of whether a reasonable person would have perceived the comments as a threat. But when an agency makes conditions intolerable, those conditions contribute to the complainant's poor performance, and the employee resigns in the face of a proposed removal, the Commission will find a constructive discharge has occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01863242 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a retirement is "facially voluntary" as part of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the employee must show the retirement was in fact involuntary. <span class="Italic">Lasley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01870615 (1987). The appropriate test is whether a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign under the circumstances. If the appellant makes that showing, the analysis then proceeds under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> to the issue of whether the agency can produce a legitimate reason for its actions and whether the employee can demonstrate pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who resigns as the result of sexual harassment may state a claim for constructive discharge within the parameters of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Flinn v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01850979 (1986). Sexual harassment extends to unwelcome sexual advances that have "the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An employee who notifies her supervisor of the unwelcome advances and is forced to resign three months later because the advances persist has stated a claim of constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did not find the complaint met the threshold of demonstrating a constructive discharge where the employee did not report the discriminatory treatment until after her retirement. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120121920 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Complainant's employment situation was extremely difficult and upsetting, we find that the reasonable person under such circumstances would have remained on the job. The record shows <span id="Page_1557"></span>that while Complainant was treated in a disparate manner over a period of several months, then reassigned to a dead-end detail with no supervisory responsibilities, the reassignment was for a limited duration with no reduction in grade or pay. Moreover, the record shows that Complainant retired prior to reporting the disparate treatment or otherwise attempting to mitigate her difficult work conditions. We find that the reasonable person under these conditions would not have retired. Therefore, we find that Complainant has not satisfied the criteria for establishing a constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Department of Navy</span>, 01863210 (1987), the Commission found the work atmosphere was "charged with antagonism" and would have prompted a reasonable person to resign under the circumstances where the agency clearly exceeded its authority in ordering psychiatric examinations for the complainant under the guise of determining his fitness-for-duty. The complainant was also required to submit all of his psychiatric records in support of sick leave requests. This evidence was linked with direct statements labeling the complainant as a "troublemaker."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0520140092 (2015), the Commission found that the complainant was constructively discharged when she was subjected to a pattern of harassment during and after her pregnancy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that S1's dubious reasons for Complainant's termination are clearly not supported by the evidence in the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pregnancy Guidance, at I.B.1 (noting that evidence indicating disparate treatment based on pregnancy can include evidence casting doubt on the credibility of the employer's explanation for the challenged action). We note that the AJ found that S1 testified credibly based on his demeanor and consistency of statements. Normally, the Commission defers to the AJ on questions of credibility where it is based on a witness's demeanor and conduct. However, we do not defer to the AJ's credibility determination here because the objective evidence in the record described above so contradicts the testimony of S1. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO MD-110 at Ch. 9, &#x00A7; VI.B.; <span class="Italic">see also Gathers v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05890894 (Nov. 9, 1989) (noting that "deference is not automatic, and when there is sufficient evidence on record which suggests the credibility determination to be erroneous, deference will not be given."). Therefore, based on the above, we that Complainant has established that the Agency's reasons were pretext for discrimination based on sex. We find that the Agency's reasons are unsupported by the record and unworthy of belief. As such, we find that Complainant has established that she was subjected to disparate treatment based on her sex when she was terminated from her position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that S1's actions towards Complainant were based on her sex/pregnancy. The record reflects that S1 denied Complainant's leave requests related to prenatal sickness and care, and stated that he was unhappy with management's approval of her requests. S1 also cited to Complainant's leave use in his initial draft of Complainant's Termination letter. The record shows that Complainant was threatened with termination, which ultimately was carried out during her pregnancy. It is evident that management, after fearing that S1's termination was based on Complainant's sex/pregnancy, decided to rescind the termination. Further, the Budget Technician testified that S1 did not treat women as well as men, and a former female employee also opined that S1 had issues working with women.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that Complainant has established the first three prongs of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the Agency's conduct was sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the conditions of Complainant's employment and create an abusive working environment. We find that a reasonable person would find that the cumulative effect of S1' s actions created a hostile work environment. We note that S1's actions against Complainant included denying Complainant leave, threatening her with termination even on her first day, falsely accusing her of misconduct, coercing a coworker to write a statement against her, deactivating her e-mail account, and terminating her. Also, we note that, after believing that S1 wrongly terminated Complainant, management decided to reinstate Complainant, but did not assign her a new supervisor away from S1. The record reflects that after Complainant was reinstated and returned during the later stages of her pregnancy, the hostile environment continued under S1. We note that the Budget Technician averred:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The few days Complainant was in before her maternity leave tension was high. Sometimes when I came in, Complainant told me I should have been in earlier to hear the fireworks. It seemed to happen almost every day that [Complainant and S1] would get into it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One week after Complainant returned, she went on maternity leave and was scheduled to return to the office in January 2007. While out on maternity leave, Complainant requested that management assign her a new supervisor or that she be allowed to telework. However, management denied both requests and began to charge Complainant with AWOL instead of requested LWOP when she failed to return to the office as scheduled from maternity leave. Rather than return to the work environment with S1, Complainant resigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, S1, by his actions, which included terminating Complainant's employment, clearly expressed his hostility toward Complainant due to her sex/pregnancy. The Agency denied Complainant's request to be assigned a different supervisor, thereby knowingly placing her back into a hostile work environment. We find that a reasonable person in Complainant's position would have found the working conditions intolerable, and therefore conclude that Complainant has established that she was constructively discharged.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee is not required to state that she is resigning due to harassment in order to prevail on a claim of constructive discharge. In <span class="Italic">Vega v. Postmaster General</span>, 01881592 (1988), the complainant merely put on her retirement form that her "feet hurt" and did not cite deteriorating health due to harassment until two months after her retirement. At the EEO hearing, the employee explained that she was afraid to put her real reasons for resigning on the application because she was afraid her supervisor would delay her receipt of retirement funds and she needed the money to support her family. The Commission noted the explanation was reasonable, particularly in light of the fact that she had made reference to deteriorating health caused by the agency's discrimination in two complaints filed before her retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Carmon-Coleman v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 07A00003 (2002), the Commission found the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment based on her disability that was premised, at least in part, on securing the resignation of the complainant. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Carmon-Coleman</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the AJ determined that complainant failed to prevail in her constructive discharge claim finding that the agency accommodated her back disability when its [<span class="Italic">sic</span>] transferred her from the candy department to the men's department, and that "with persistence" complainant could have obtained help with lifting that exceeded her limitations. However, we find that this analysis fails to take into consideration the severity of complainant's hostile work environment, where Supervisor B continuously and publically [<span class="Italic">sic</span>] humiliated complainant, and not only refused to provide complainant with a reasonable accommodation, via either lighter lifting assignments or assistance with heavy lifting assignments, but threatened to transfer complainant to a department where she would not be able to continue to work due to the routine heavy lifting required. Moreover, our review of the record conveys that complainant did, in fact, "persistently" remind Supervisor B of her lifting restriction, and ask for assistance, but Supervisor B declined to do either, instead responding with criticism of complainant's work or threatening to transfer her to the candy department. Moreover, we note that complainant's assistant provided affidavit testimony that he overheard Supervisor B remark in a conversation concerning poor leader performance of an identified co-worker of complainant: "Just apply enough pressure and she'll eventually quit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, review of the record reflects that when complainant became distraught on November 3, 1993, informed Supervisor B of her decision to resign because of his treatment, and presented him with the completed personnel forms, Supervisor B told her she used the wrong form, and asked her if she was resigning effective today. According to complainant, based on Supervisor B's demeanor, she felt it was useless to say anything other than her resignation was effective that same day. Complainant testifies that Supervisor B then sent her to the personnel office to complete the correct form, and that a completed form was awaiting her signature when she arrived, apparently because Supervisor B had called while complainant was in transit to the personnel office. According to the affidavit testimony of the personnel officer, when complainant arrived, she was very upset, and that she attempted to calm complainant and encourage her to reconsider her decision. Complainant was receptive to this suggestion, so the personnel officer went to speak to Supervisor B to see if the situation could be resolved. However, the personnel officer indicates that Supervisor B responded that complainant "quit and that's it" and instructed her to process the resignation effective that same day, and not to allow complainant to give the customary two weeks notice, fearing she might sabotage the operation due to her knowledge of security. We note that Supervisor B provided no reason regarding his purported belief that complainant might engage in "sabotage."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration, viewing all of the circumstances presented here, we find that the same discriminatory hostile work environment created by Supervisor B was sufficiently severe as to result in objectively intolerable working conditions, and that complainant reasonably felt compelled to resign because of these conditions. We find further evidence that Supervisor B created a hostile work environment with the purpose of forcing complainant to quit based on his efforts to have complainant's resignation processed on-the-spot, giving her no recourse to change her mind.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1558"></span>The Commission also has noted that a constructive discharge theory may be applied where a complainant refuses to report for duty to a reassigned position even though the agency could have provided reasonable accommodation in the complainant's current position. However, in <span class="Italic">Greer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976756 (2000), the Commission found there was no constructive discharge because the position to which the complainant was reassigned was within her medical restrictions. The Commission found a reasonable person in the complainant's position would have reported for duty while pursuing an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, the Commission did find a constructive discharge in <span class="Italic">Jambora v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40128 (2006), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant's diabetes by allowing her to remain the day shift forced her to take disability retirement instead of changing to a shift that would have had severe implications for the complainant's health. In support of its finding, the Commission also noted that the agency had not explored any possible reassignment of the complainant to another position on the day shift as an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an administrative judge's finding of constructive discharge in <span class="Italic">Solomon v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0720070071 (2008), based on harassment due to the complainant's disability and EEO activity. The complainant, a social worker, was subjected to increased work scrutiny, a performance improvement plan, and a higher caseload after being absent for arm surgeries and filing an EEO complaint. After her last arm surgery, the complainant, on the advice of her psychiatrist did not return to work. The Commission found that a reasonable person in the complainant's circumstances would have felt compelled to resign.</p>
<p class="noindent">Generally speaking, "it takes more than one or two incidents to create the intolerable working conditions necessary to support of finding of constructive discharge. Nevertheless, there have been exceptions to this principle, primarily in cases where the conduct in question is particularly egregious." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A51391 (2005). The Commission found that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> had not presented a case for an exception where he claimed that he was denied leave while work coworkers were granted leave and that he was assigned duties outside of his normal duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without specific reference to the elements of a constructive discharge claim, the Commission upheld the finding of its administrative judge that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Grayson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080044 (2009), had been subjected to a constructive discharge. The complainant in that case filed an OWCP claim alleging that a contaminated mop had "poisoned" him. The agency subjected the complainant to a fitness-for-duty examination that cleared the complainant for a return to duty. Despite that clearance, the agency refused to allow the complainant to return to work and insisted on further medical information. The agency then issued progressive discipline against the complainant and proposed his removal. The complainant maintained that he retired in order to maintain his benefits. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Grayson</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's conclusion that complainant decided to retired solely because the agency kept complainant out of work, issued progressive discipline and contemplated a termination action toward complainant. Complainant initiated his retirement after the agency began to contemplate a removal action against him. Complainant testified at the hearing that if the agency removed him he would have lost all his benefits, so the agency agreed to hold off on any termination action and let him retire on August 1, 2006, without further discipline. Accordingly, we find substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's conclusion that, but for the agency's improper medical requirements, complainant would not have retired in August 2006. Accordingly, we affirm the AJ's award of remedies pertaining to reinstatement and back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ordering the reinstatement of an employee to the same office and same supervisor who forced her resignation during her probationary period was deemed not a constructive discharge in <span class="Italic">Oakes v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A55806 (2006). After finding discrimination, the administrative judge ordered complainant's reinstatement. The agency appealed and offered the complainant interim relief in the form of a job in the same office with the same supervisor. The Commission was not persuaded that a reasonable person in the complainant's position would have viewed the environment as so intolerable that her subsequent refusal to report to work constituted a constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where the agency's failure to stop sexual harassment is a factor in the employee's decision to resign, it is not a constructive removal where other factors also played a role in that decision. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120093073 (2011), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Constructive discharge occurs when an employee resigns from his employment because he is being subjected to unlawful employment practices. If the resignation is directly related to the Agency's unlawful employment practices, it is a foreseeable consequence of those practices and constitutes a constructive discharge. The Agency is responsible for a constructive discharge in the same manner that it is responsible for the outright discriminatory discharge of a charging party. In order to establish that he was constructively discharged from his position, Complainant must show: (1) that his resignation resulted from the agency's actions; (2) that the agency's actions were discriminatory; and (3) that a reasonable person in his situation would have found the agency's actions intolerable. <span class="Italic">See Malpass v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920527 (July 20, 1992). Therefore, in order to establish that he was constructively discharged, a complainant must show that the agency's actions were discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that he was forced to resign on January 3, 2008, because the Agency failed to adequately address EF's harassment and protected the harasser. He further contends that he also resigned because he feared for his safety after he learned that EF carried pepper spray and mentioned that she had a gun. However, Complainant did not assert that EF threatened to use the pepper spray or gun against him or made any violent threats against him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that Complainant was in a serious accident on or about December 28, 2007. Complainant did not report to work again after the accident. In an e-mail dated January 2, 2008, Complainant informed the Agency that he would remain on leave and that he was in great discomfort because of the accident. We note that, although Complainant lodged in or near White River Junction on weekdays, he commuted to his home and family in Maine on weekends. We further note that in his formal complaint, Complainant requested that he be reinstated to a position at the Agency's Togus or Manchester, New Hampshire locations, which are significantly closer to Complainant's Maine home than White River Junction. Additionally, we note that in e-mail correspondence to a union official dated November 9, 2007, Complainant stated that he had a job interview in Manchester, and if he was offered that position, he would not pursue his sexual harassment claim any further because the matter would then be moot. Clearly, Complainant's long commute between his home and the facility was made even more challenging by his late December 2007 accident. Thus, while the harassment may have been a factor in Complainant's resignation, we are persuaded that Complainant's accident and extraordinary commute were the predominant reasons why he resigned from the Agency. Consequently, we find that Complainant failed to prove that the Agency constructively discharged him.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of constructive discharge often arises in complaints under the ADEA where the employee alleges that he or she was forced to retire. The basic analysis for those cases is as outlined above. The issue of constructive discharge as it relates to involuntary retirements is also addressed in Chapter 16 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-25-056.html#sec16-55">Forced Retirement</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The courts have split on whether a plaintiff alleging constructive discharge must affirmatively demonstrate intent on the part of the employer, or may, in the alternative, establish that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign under the circumstances. However, those courts that have held that a plaintiff must demonstrate intent have further found that intent can be inferred, and that an employer can be found to intend the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its actions. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has held "[t]o recover under a theory of constructive discharge, a plaintiff must show that his or her '<span class="Italic">employer deliberately</span> ma[de] an employee's working conditions intolerable and thereby force[d] him to quit his job.'" <span class="Italic">Martin v. Cavalier Hotel Corp.</span>, 48 F.3d 1343, 1350 (4th Cir. 1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Bristow v. Daily Press, Inc.</span>, 770 F.2d 1251, 1255 (4th Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1082, 106 S. Ct. 1461, 89 L. Ed.2d 718 (1986) (emphasis added) (quoting <span class="Italic">Holsey v. Armour &#x0026; Co.</span>, 743 F.2d 199, 209 (4th Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 470 U.S. 1028, 105 S. Ct. 1395, 84 L. Ed.2d 784 (1985))). The <span class="Italic">Martin</span> decision gives an excellent account of the two views on constructive discharge held by the courts.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, the employer contended there was no constructive discharge where the supervisor forced a subordinate to engage in several sexual acts under threat of losing her job. The <span class="Italic">Martin</span> court, 48 F.3d at 1153-57, rejected the employer's notion that the supervisor did not intend to make the employee resign, holding instead that the intent requirement extended to those actions that were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the employer's actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, it is well established that an employee is entitled to relief under Title VII, even absent a formal discharge, if an employer "deliberately" makes the "working conditions" of the employee "intolerable" in an effort to induce the employee to quit. <span class="Italic">Bristow</span>, 770 F.2d at 1255; <span class="Italic">see also Ugalde v. W.A. McKenzie Asphalt Co.</span>, 990 F.2d 239, 242-43 (5th Cir. 1993) ("The general rule is that if the employer deliberately makes an employee's working conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced into involuntary resignation, then the employer has committed a construction discharge...."). Thus, in order to demonstrate constructive discharge, a plaintiff must allege and prove two elements: (1) "deliberateness of the employer's actions" and (2) "intolerability of the working conditions." <span class="Italic">Paroline v. Unisys Corp.</span>, 879 F.2d 100, 114 (4th Cir. 1989) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting), <span class="Italic">vacated in part</span>, 900 F.2d 27 (1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (adopting panel dissenting opinion); <span class="Italic">see also Johnson v. Shalala</span>, 991 F.2d 126, 131 (4th Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 115 S. Ct. 52, 130 L. Ed.2d 12 (1994); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Clay Printing Co.</span>, 955 F.2d 936, 941-46 (4th Cir. 1992). Cavalier does not claim that Martin failed to demonstrate intolerable working conditions; such an argument would be baseless. <span id="Page_1559"></span>Instead, Cavalier focuses solely on the first element, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the adequacy of Martin's proof as to her employer's "deliberateness."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The circuits are divided as to what a plaintiff must show in order to prove this element. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Barbara Lindemann and David D. Kadue, <span class="Italic">Sexual Harassment in Employment Law</span> 259 (1992). The majority of the circuits focus almost exclusively on the effect an employer's actions have on an employee and rely on an objective standard of whether a "reasonable person" in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stetson v. NYNEX Service Co.</span>, 995 F.2d 355, 360-61 (2d Cir. 1993) (ADEA claim); <span class="Italic">Watson v. Nationwide Ins. Co.</span>, 823 F.2d 360, 361 (9th Cir. 1987) (Title VII racial discrimination claim); <span class="Italic">Garner v. Wal-Mart Stores</span>, Inc., 807 F.2d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp.</span>, 798 F.2d 559, 561 (1st Cir. 1986) (ADEA claim); <span class="Italic">Derr v. Gulf Oil Corp.</span>, 796 F.2d 340, 344 (10th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Goss v. Exxon Office Systems Co.</span>, 747 F.2d 885, 887-88 (3d Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Bourque v. Powell Electrical Manufacturing Co.</span>, 617 F.2d 61, 65 (5th Cir. 1980). The minority view, to which we subscribe, is that a plaintiff must also prove that "the actions complained of were intended by the employer as an effort to force the employee to quit." <span class="Italic">Paroline</span>, 879 F.2d at 114 (Wilkinson, J., dissenting) (internal quotations omitted); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Bunny Bread Co.</span>, 646 F.2d 1250, 1256 (8th Cir. 1981) (Title VII racial discrimination claim).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Cavalier seeks to capitalize on the fact that evidence of the employer's intent is required in this Circuit. The hotel suggests that under that standard a plaintiff must introduce specific, direct evidence that the employer "wanted her gone, wanted her off the job, and deliberately set about trying to make her life so intolerable that she had no reasonable alternative but to quit." However, this argument ignores the fact that neither we nor any other court that has required evidence of "deliberateness" have ever "insisted on 'smoking gun' evidence of employer intent." Sheila Finnegan, Comment, <span class="Italic">Constructive Discharge Under Title VII and the ADEA</span>, 53 U.Chi.L. Rev. 561, 568 (1986). Nor could we. <span class="Italic">See United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 714 n.3, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 1481 n.3, 75 L. Ed.2d 403 (1983) (In a Title VII action, "[a]s in any lawsuit, the plaintiff may prove his case by direct or circumstantial evidence.... [T]he District Court should not have required [the Title VII plaintiff] to submit direct evidence of discriminatory intent."). Rather, as Judge Wilkinson explained in <span class="Italic">Paroline</span>, an employer's intent can be proved by "inference." 879 F.2d at 114. For example, evidence that the employer failed "to act in the face of known intolerable conditions" and did not treat all employees "identically" may create an "inference that the employer was attempting to force the plaintiff to resign...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Carter v. Ball</span>, 33 F.3d 450, 459 (4th Cir. 1994) ("Deliberateness can be proven by actual or circumstantial evidence, including evidence of actions that single out a plaintiff for differential treatment." (citation and internal quotations omitted)); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Shalala</span>, 991 F.2d at 131 (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in assessing the deliberateness of an employer's conduct, "an employer 'must necessarily be held to intend the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its actions.'" <span class="Italic">Troutt v. Charcoal Steak House, Inc.</span>, 835 F. Supp. 899, 902 n.4 (W.D. Va. 1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hukkanen v. International Union of Operating Engineers</span>, 3 F.3d 281, 284 (8th Cir. 1993)), <span class="Italic">aff'd mem.</span>, 37 F.3d 1495 (4th Cir. 1994). In a case with similar though less egregious facts than the one at hand, the Eighth Circuit recently held that an employee's decision to quit was a "reasonably foreseeable consequence" of her supervisor's abuse, and so evidenced the requisite intent to force the employee to quit. <span class="Italic">See Hukkanen</span>, 3 F.3d at 285. There, as here, a managing officer of the defendant sexually harassed a woman who worked for him; rather than actually raping the plaintiff, however, the officer in <span class="Italic">Hukkanen</span> only threatened to rape her. There, again as here, the employee quit her job and brought an action under Title VII for constructive discharge. After a finding in the plaintiff's favor, the employer appealed, arguing that its officer's "harassment was intended to extract some sort of sexual favor from [the plaintiff] or to provide a perverse sort of amusement rather than to force her to resign" and so did not constitute an adequate basis for a constructive discharge claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 284. Cavalier's virtually identical argument here is that Martin has failed to prove constructive discharge because "Batchelor would have preferred [Martin] to remain at the hotel so he could continue to perpetrate and execute his lascivious acts" on her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Eighth Circuit categorically rejected this argument, characterizing it as "bizarre." <span class="Italic">Citing</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Bunny Bread Co.</span>, 646 F.2d at 1256, the <span class="Italic">Hukkanen</span> Court reaffirmed that the Eighth Circuit's constructive discharge standard, like that of the Fourth Circuit, requires a showing of employer intent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, the <span class="Italic">Hukkanen</span> Court properly recognized that proof of an employer's intent "does not mean constructive discharge plaintiffs must prove their employers consciously meant to force them to quit. When an employer denies a conscious effort to force an employee to resign...the employer must necessarily be held to intend the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its actions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citations omitted). Thus, if "[the plaintiff's] resignation was a reasonably foreseeable consequence" of the harassment of the defendant's officer, those "actions were necessarily taken with the intention of forcing [the plaintiff] to quit." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 285. Applying this standard, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the plaintiff in Hukkanen had produced sufficient evidence that her resignation was a "reasonably foreseeable consequence of [the defendant's] conduct." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Precisely the same conclusion is compelled here. A hotel employee's resignation is surely a "reasonably foreseeable consequence" of repeated assaults by the hotel's general manager. Cavalier does not argue to the contrary. What Cavalier does claim, heavily relying on <span class="Italic">Paroline</span>, is that to permit a plaintiff to demonstrate constructive discharge by evidence that her resignation was the "reasonably foreseeable consequence" of her employer's conduct is contrary to this Circuit's "deliberateness" requirement. That argument ignores the very underpinning of the intent requirement and constitutes a severe misreading of <span class="Italic">Paroline</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In formulating the requirement that in a Title VII constructive discharge case an employee must demonstrate the employer's intent to force the employee to quit, we have looked to constructive discharge cases decided under Sec. 8(a)(3) the National Labor Relations Act, 29 USC Sec. 158(a)(3). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., English v. Powell</span>, 592 F.2d 727, 731 n.4 (4th Cir. 1979) (doctrine of constructive discharge "had its genesis in the labor relations area but has been extended and held applicable to civil rights claims" (citations omitted)). Only where an "employer <span class="Italic">deliberately</span> makes an employee's working conditions intolerable and thereby forces him to quit his job because of union activities" has an employer "constructively discharged the employee in violation of Sec. 8(a)(3) of the Act." <span class="Italic">J.P. Stevens &#x0026; Co., Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 461 F.2d 490, 494 (4th Cir. 1972) (emphasis added). Because we have concluded that the elements of a constructive discharge formulated under the National Labor Relations Act are equally applicable in the Title VII context, we require a Title VII plaintiff asserting constructive discharge similarly to prove the employer's intent to force the plaintiff to quit. <span class="Italic">Holsey</span>, 743 F.2d at 209; <span class="Italic">see also Bristow</span>, 770 F.2d at 1255. The Supreme Court, however, has long held that "<span class="Italic">specific</span> evidence of intent...is not an indispensable element of proof of violation of Sec. 8(a)(3)" of the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">Radio Officers' Union of Commercial Telegraphers Union v. NLRB</span>, 347 U.S. 17, 44, 74 S. Ct. 323, 338, 98 L. Ed. 455 (1954) (emphasis added). Indeed, it has explicitly held that an employer's intent can be proved by evidence that an employee's resignation was "the foreseeable consequence[ ] of [the employer's] conduct." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 45, 74 S. Ct. at 338. As the Court observed in <span class="Italic">Radio Officers' Union</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">This recognition that specific proof of intent is unnecessary</span> where employer conduct inherently encourages or discourages union membership <span class="Italic">is but an application of the common-law rule that a man is held to intend the foreseeable consequences of his conduct.</span> Thus an employer's protestation that he did not intend to encourage or discourage must be unavailing where a natural consequence of his action was such encouragement or discouragement. Concluding that encouragement or discouragement will result, it is presumed that he intended such consequence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 45, 74 S. Ct. at 338. (citations omitted) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp.</span>, 373 U.S. 221, 227, 83 S. Ct. 1139, 1144-45, 10 L. Ed.2d 308 (1963); <span class="Italic">International Broth. of Elec. Workers, Local 211 v. NLRB</span>, 821 F.2d 206, 210-11 (3d Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Olin Mathieson Chem. Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 232 F.2d 158, 161 (4th Cir. 1956), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 352 U.S. 1020, 77 S. Ct. 587, 1 L. Ed.2d 562 (1957). Thus, contrary to Cavalier's argument, permitting a plaintiff to prove her employer's intent by demonstrating that her resignation was the "reasonable foreseeable consequence" of the employer's conduct is in accordance with, indeed mandated by, the approach adopted by this Circuit in Title VII cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor, despite Cavalier's claims, is <span class="Italic">Paroline</span> to the contrary. In <span class="Italic">Paroline</span>, Judge Wilkinson did not employ the words "reasonably foreseeable consequences," but there was no reason to do so; there is certainly nothing in <span class="Italic">Paroline</span> that even suggests such an approach would be improper. Rather, the <span class="Italic">Paroline</span> analysis is entirely consistent with holding an employer responsible for the "reasonably foreseeable consequences" of his conduct. In <span class="Italic">Paroline</span>, a fellow employee allegedly made "improper sexual advances" to the plaintiff "both on and off the job." 879 F.2d at 102. However, unlike in <span class="Italic">Hukkanen</span> or the present case, there was no evidence in <span class="Italic">Paroline</span> that the plaintiff's resignation was "reasonably foreseeable." Instead, when the plaintiff complained to management, the employer ordered the offending employee to seek counseling, placed a memorandum setting forth the conditions of his continued employment in his personnel file, delayed his planned promotion and salary increase, limited his contact with female employees, and told him that if there were any more incidents he would be fired. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 114 (Wilkinson, J., dissenting). Furthermore, the defendant employer specifically asked the plaintiff not to quit, gave her two weeks off in which to recuperate, and offered to pay for her counseling. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In sum, there was no evidence in <span class="Italic">Paroline</span> that the plaintiff's resignation was the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, even if we were to conclude that evidence that an employee's resignation was a "reasonably foreseeable consequence" of a defendant's harassment does not demonstrate the requisite employer intent to <span id="Page_1560"></span>force the employee to quit, we would nevertheless conclude that there was sufficient evidence of such intent here. Of course, there was some evidence, notably Batchelor's testimony, that Batchelor did not want Martin to quit and would have rehired her. But, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to Martin, and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, as we must, there was also legally sufficient evidence from which a jury could have found that Batchelor, and thus Cavalier, acted with the intent to force Martin to quit. For example, Martin testified that she followed Batchelor's orders because "[w]hen he tells you to do something, you do it or else," and that "if I would have told anybody, I would have got fired [sic]." Martin also testified that during another incident, Batchelor told her "that if I didn't obey him, that I could pack my stuff and leave." Martin further testified that when she informed Batchelor that she was resigning, "[h]e just looked and snickered. He didn't say anything," and that when she tried to explain why she was leaving, "[Batchelor] just snickered again and turned his head." There was no evidence that the employer here took any remedial measures, let alone the extensive measures taken by the employer in <span class="Italic">Paroline</span>, when confronted with the plaintiff's complaints; rather, when Martin cried, Batchelor told her to succumb or be fired, and when she resigned, he snickered. Moreover, there is no evidence that Batchelor treated other employees in a similar fashion. Thus, in contrast to <span class="Italic">Paroline</span>, this is not a situation where "[t]he fact that all employees were treated identically rebut[ted] any inference that the treatment of the plaintiff was done 'with the intention of forcing [the plaintiff] to resign....'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Bunny Bread Co.</span>, 646 F.2d at 1256).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, there was sufficient evidence to hold Cavalier responsible for Batchelor's acts and to find that those acts demonstrated the employer's intention to force Martin to quit. The district court did not err in denying Cavalier's motion for judgment n.o.v.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant cannot seek prospective relief on an allegation of constructive discharge. In <span class="Italic">Murray v. Postmaster General</span>, 01964303 (1996), the Commission found that the complainant failed to state a claim where he alleged constructive discharge but had a removal action pending before the MSPB:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows, and appellant admits, that he was removed by the agency by the Letter of Decision. Appellant argues that if he is reinstated by a decision of the MSPB, then he could not return to work because of the constructive discharge. Appellant's allegation concerning his constructive discharge is speculative. There is no indication in the record that the MSPB has found that the agency improperly terminated appellant. There is no indication in the record that the agency has rescinded the Letter of Decision removing appellant or that the removal has been reversed by any authority. The Commission finds that appellant could not yet have been constructively discharged. Therefore, we find that appellant is not aggrieved under &#x00A7; 1614.103 because it is impossible for him to have been constructively discharged while the Letter of Decision removing him is still in effect. If the Letter of Decision removing appellant is rescinded or reversed by any authority, then appellant may contact an EEO Counselor in order to file a complaint regarding his constructive discharge. Until the Letter of Decision removing appellant is rescinded or reversed by any authority, appellant's claim of constructive discharge is too speculative to investigate or decide on the merits.</p>
