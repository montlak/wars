<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-145"><span class="space">n.</span> $80,001-$90,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $85,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Bahaudin v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01993594 (2000), where the agency denied the complainant a promotion and issued a lowered performance appraisal in retaliation for EEO activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After considering the evidence submitted by complainant and Commission precedent regarding this issue, we find that the AJ's award of $85,000 in non-pecuniary damages is justified. Specifically, complainant submitted credible evidence indicating that the agency's discriminatory actions caused him to, among other things, become very irritable; distant; wake up at night and make sudden jerking movements; not want to go to work; just lay in bed when he was not working; neglect his home duties (i.e., investing, fixing things around the house); not want to celebrate his anniversary; not eat; develop insomnia; only talk about how he was mistreated at work; and become forgetful. Complainant's psychiatrist diagnosed complainant's condition as major depression, single episode mild to moderate with anxiety. The psychiatrist prescribed an anti-depressant medication and sleeping pill for complainant, who stopped taking them after a time because he perceived that they were causing him to have difficulty breathing. Although complainant did not report this side effect to his psychiatrist as requested, the psychiatrist testified that that doesn't mean that complainant's difficulties were insincere. In fact, he testified that complainant did not exhibit an element of symptom amplification regarding his illness. We note that the record includes information provided by other doctors who treated complainant. That information indicates that complainant indeed suffered from depression. In cases with similar effects, we have awarded similar amounts. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) we awarded complainant $80,000 in non-pecuniary damages where affidavits provided by complainant, friends, and co-workers described the emotional distress that resulted from the agency's discriminatory actions. In <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971851, we found that complainant's testimony and several reports from medical professionals were sufficient to support a finding that the agency's discrimination reawakened complainant's post traumatic stress disorder. As such, she was awarded $75,000. Thus, given the record as a whole, the Commission finds no reason to change the AJ's award of $85,000 in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The longer the period of harassment, the bigger the award. The Commission reminded the complainant of that rule in <span class="Italic">Jenna P. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019001896 (2020), where the complainant appealed an award of $85,000, requesting $300,000. Noting that the harassment lasted only nine months, the Commission differentiated cases involving higher awards based on the length of time the harassment lasted and the long-term effects of same:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requested nonpecuniary compensatory damages in the range of $200,000.00 to $300,000.00 for the harm caused by her first-level supervisor's (S1) sexual harassment. The Agency determined that $85,000.00 was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that Complainant held an MBA (Master of Business Administration) in Operation Management and bachelor's degree in Human Resources Management. She began working as a GS-11 employee at the Agency in August 2012, and she was subjected to the sexual harassment from S1 from September 2012 to May 28, 2013. In May 2013 Complainant's fianc&#x00E9;e (who also worked at the Agency) found out about a sexual video that S1 sent to Complainant and discovered sexually-explicit messages from S1 on Complainant's phone. On May 28, 2013, Complainant's fianc&#x00E9;e notified his supervisor of S1's conduct. Thereafter, Complainant met with her second-level supervisor (S2) and officials in Human Resources and submitted a Report of Contact detailing S1's harassment. Complainant indicated that S2 then immediately sent S1 home and allowed her to telework. S1 resigned within a week. Complainant had no contact with S1 since May 28, 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant married her fianc&#x00E9;e in July 2013; she continued to work in her GS-11, Management Analyst position; she was promoted to a GS-12 grade level on December 15, 2013; and she left the Agency in May 2016. Complainant's husband indicated that they were separated since June 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support her nonpecuniary damages claim, Complainant cited <span class="Italic">Glockner v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30105 (Sept. 23, 2004) ($200,000.00 for damage to complainant's career, i.e., demotions, negative performance comments, denial of leave, work assignments, scheduling and reprimand, and causing her to bite her cheeks which ultimately required surgery). In that case, the complainant was continually harassed and degraded for almost five years and provided sufficient medical documentation of her physical and mental conditions, including her MRI scan, the treatment of her kidney stones, and the removal of an irritational fibroma.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also cited <span class="Italic">Alene S. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720150038 (Apr. 6, 2016) ($200,000.00 for the agency's discriminatory conduct, i.e., harassment, disciplinary action, failure to accommodate complainant's disability, aggravation of a preexisting traumatic situation that prevented her from "ever returning to work"). In that case, the complainant provided medical documentation from her psychologist and psychiatrist to support her permanent post-traumatic stress disorder; she experienced severe additional psychological harm that would not have occurred but for the discrimination; and she was unable to ever work again.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further cited <span class="Italic">Looney v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A40124, 01A53252 (May 19, 2005) ($195,000.00 for discrimination, lasting for almost two years, causing permanent and substantially long-term effects, including depression which was confirmed by complainant's psychologist, humiliation, weight problems, crying, difficulty coping with life, rashes, anxiety, nightmares, difficulty sleeping, considering herself to be unsafe operating a motor vehicle, disinterested in sexual intercourse with her husband, and marital problems).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In that case, the agency's discriminatory conduct involved complainant receiving two suspensions, a transfer, and a detail to a location far from her home for an extended period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant cited <span class="Italic">Akiko L. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC No. 0720120027 (Apr. 2, 2014) ($210,000.00 for mental and physical harm for at least two years and beyond due to the agency's particularly egregious harassment). In that case, the complainant provided testimony from her husband and psychologist indicating that she was deeply troubled, anxious, depressed, lonely, suspicious, mentally unfocused, and highly emotional. She experienced weight loss, hair loss, difficulty sleeping, suicidal thought, and chest pain. In that case it was well known that complainant's supervisor was harassing and assaulting her, i.e., touching her buttocks, laughing at her after kicking her, and making references to her as "pretty girl," "my girl," and "bad girl," but the agency took no action to stop the harassment. Further, during the relevant time period, complainant had a miscarriage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further cited <span class="Italic">Valencia L. v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720130039 (Aug. 7, 2014) ($200,000.00 for the agency's discrimination for two-year period concerning termination and working conditions). In that case, complainant provided statements from witnesses and her doctor describing the deterioration of her physical appearance and decline of her day-to-day happiness into a state of anxiety and depression. The complainant stated she was humiliated, angry, helpless, and hopeless; she experienced sleeplessness, weight loss, and damage to her skin and hair; she was the chief income earning parent and had difficulty locating work after her termination; she was put in jail three times; and her marriage ended.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also cited <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720100040 (Nov. 23, 2011) ($200,000.00 for the agency's egregious discriminatory and retaliatory conduct when it failed to provide the requested ergonomic accommodations until a year later). In that case, complainant provided substantial evidence in the testimony of her doctors, family, friends, and herself about the physical and mental harm she endured; she suffered severe physical damage and pain to her neck and shoulders, as well as permanent spasms that further damaged the discs in her back; and she continued to suffer migraines, lack of sleep, severe and chronic pain, a loss of enjoyment of life, changes in her physical and mental conditions that imperiled her marriage, hindered her ability to properly care of her young child, created a serious and potentially permanent rift with a child in college, and withdrew socially from friendships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant also cites <span class="Italic">Lauralee C. v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720150002 ($200,000.00 for complainant's physical and mental harm caused by the agency's harassment which was substantiated by her doctor's reports). In that case, the complainant was diagnosed with several new medical conditions, as well as "reactivation of a previously diagnosed condition" since the agency began subjecting her to discriminatory harassment. She was also diagnosed with depression, pancreatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and temporomandibular joint disorder; she suffered emotional pain and fear of leaving her house; she <span id="Page_1897"></span>felt hollow, exhausted, hopeless, and helpless; she cried all the time; and she experienced a loss of interest in interacting with others and sustaining personal relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that although Complainant cited <span class="Italic">Gould v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A30114 (May 5, 2004), the Commission, in that case, did not address complainant's compensatory damages rather procedurally dismissed the Agency's appeal from an EEOC Administrative Judge's (AJ) decision, in part, awarding nonpecuniary compensatory damages to complainant. Thus, we find Gould not supportive in determining compensatory damages at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the cases Complainant cited, as described above, we find that the facts in those cases are distinguishable from the instant case. Those cases involved the agency's discriminatory conduct lasting for more than a year. Further, the discriminatory conduct in those cases caused complainants a financial hardship, a job loss, disciplinary actions, physical and mental harms diagnosed by doctors which was supported by medical documentation, including surgeries, and/or not ever being able to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant experienced sexual harassment for nine months and when the behavior was reported to management on May 28, 2013, S2 immediately removed S1 away from her; she and her fianc&#x00E9;e continued to stay together and married in July 2013; she was not subjected to any disciplinary action; she did not lose her job or experience other financial hardship; she was promoted on December 15, 2013; and she provided no medical documentation to support her physical or mental harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After considering all the facts of the case and the evidence provided by Complainant, we find the Agency's award of $85,000.00 appropriate and consistent with similar awards. <span class="Italic">See Cher C. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120140445 (Jan. 9, 2017) (awarded $95,000.00 as a result of the agency's retaliatory harassment lasted for approximately 18 months and complainant experienced stress, loss of professional standing, a panic attack, and exacerbation of her lupus symptoms which were substantiated by medical documentation); <span class="Italic">Emmett W. v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120143098 (May 3, 2016) ($80,000.00 as a result of the agency's discriminatory termination; complainant, an Iraqi war veteran, experienced a bankruptcy, cancelation of medical insurance, placing his children on state-funded Medicaid, working in a low paying job (almost 80% reduction of his salary at the agency), exacerbated his pre-existing post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, suicidality, and sleeplessness, which were substantiated by the statements from himself, his wife and family members); <span class="Italic">Ricardo K. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720170030 (Oct. 12, 2017) ($75,000.00 for the agency's harassment for his disability; complainant continued to struggle with the trauma and the effects of the harassment, including emotional distress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and humiliation; he was forced to take personal sick days to alleviate his stress; he stopped going out to dinner or to social event; his fianc&#x00E9;e left him; and his damages were not substantiated by medical evidence but an EEOC AJ found him to be a credible witness during his hearing testimony on his entitlement to damages).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that an award of nonpecuniary compensatory damages to Complainant in the amount of $85,000.00 is entirely appropriate under the circumstances presented in this case. This award takes into account the severity of the harm that Complainant suffered and is consistent with prior Commission precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">See also</span> <span class="italic">Jacki A. v. Attorney General</span>, 2020002100 (2021) (increasing a $45,000 award to $85,000 where the complainant suffers two years of emotional pain and physical harm as a result of the discrimination--failure to accommodate case where the agency terminated the associate for missing a fitness-for-duty examination).</p>
<p class="noindent">Demonstrating the axiom that a tortfeasor takes his victims as he finds them, in <span class="Italic">Bruce-Carroll v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20018 (2003), the Commission upheld an award of $85,000 in damages that occurred as the result of a letter of warning. Rejecting the agency's argument that the award was out of proportion to its conduct, the Commission noted that the complainant left work after receiving the letter and never returned. She became depressed and reclusive and was unable to leave her home for lengthy periods of time. She also developed a fear of her own letter carrier.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $85,000 in compensatory damages by the administrative judge was appropriate where the complainant's treatment for depression significantly increased during the period of harassment. In <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070051 (2008), the Commission noted that after the complainant was ordered to a fitness-for-duty examination that was part of the harassment, she required long-term treatment and began taking three different medications. The Commission also noted that the complainant testified that she felt devastated and demoralized, had feelings of hopelessness and could not sleep, and that her marriage was adversely affected.</p>
<p class="noindent">With virtually no specific analysis, the Commission upheld an award of $85,000 in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720070015 (2008). The Commission simply noted that the complainant "requested damages for loss of reputation, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of health, emotional distress, loss of sleep, anxiety, stress, depression, loss of self-esteem and excessive fatigue." Without comment, the Commission reaffirmed the award in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0520080667 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency award of $17,000 to $85,000 in <span class="Italic">Leung v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120080685 (2009), where the agency's discriminatory termination of the complainant exacerbated preexisting medical conditions. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Leung</span>, found that the termination resulted in more than two years of severe emotional distress:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of his claim for non-pecuniary damages, complainant contends that the wrongful termination was a life-altering event, that resulted in extreme and long-lasting emotional distress. He states that he suffered extreme embarrassment that resulted in on-going loss of self esteem; depression; grief; anguish; anger; stress; weight loss; headaches; nausea; sleeplessness; suicidal idealization; withdrawal from friends, co-workers and family; and a general loss of enjoyment of life during the two years since his wrongful termination. His wife describes the "loss of face" that he endured, as a Chinese man, who was unemployed. His son states, among other things: "Then, he was fired and I think that the whole sky must have fallen on him because he was no longer my father after that." In a letter dated August 3, 2007, complainant's psychiatrist suggests that complainant's psychiatric problems resulted (at least partially) from the discriminatory termination, stating: "This letter is to confirm that Mr. Ken Leung has been under my care since August 3, 2004 due to his stress related with the mistreatment and being terminated by his former employer, the post office then [sic]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously noted, complainant has requested $175,000.00 in compensatory damages, and the agency found that only $17,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages are warranted. After a thorough review of the record, we find that an award of $85,000.00 is appropriate to compensate complainant for his physical and emotional pain and suffering resulting from his discriminatory termination. We point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions. <span class="Italic">See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura</span>, 477 U.S. 299, 311-12 (1986) (stating that compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case). The Commission notes that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Lucas v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070051 (January 3, 2008) ($85,000.00 awarded where complainant showed that the agency's discrimination caused feelings of devastation; hopelessness; fear; demoralization; and she suffered from sleeplessness and adverse effects on her marriage); <span class="Italic">Bahaudin v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01993594 (September 13, 2000) ($85,000.00 awarded where complainant produced evidence indicating that the agency's discriminatory actions caused him to be very irritable; distant; wake up at night and make sudden jerking movements; not want to go to work; just lay in bed when he was not working; neglect his home duties; and not eat); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) ($80,000.00 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where affidavits provided by complainant, friends, and co-workers described the emotional distress that resulted from the agency's discriminatory actions).</p>
<p class="noindent">The damages award in <span class="italic">Lydia W. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021004453 (2022), also considered the extent to which the agency's discriminatory conduct exacerbated the complainant's preexisting depression. Upholding the AJ's $85,000 award, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that notwithstanding his ruling on liability, the AJ's findings with respect to Complainant's nonpecuniary damages constituted an abuse of discretion, and that the award should therefore be drastically reduced to be in line with past precedent and the actual hearing testimony. Complainant sought damages in the amount of $85,000, and as noted above, the AJ awarded that amount. The AJ noted that Complainant testified to the nature, extent, and duration of the distress caused by the discrimination. She explained that she was diagnosed with depression in 1994, and that it was generally manageable, but following the Emergency Placement and NOR, it became severely worse. She could not function for months because of anxiety attacks. She had difficulty eating because her anxiety constricted her throat. She could not go to the market and was worried she would pass out. Prior to her complaint, she took 10mg of Wellbutrin; thereafter, she was prescribed 20 mg of Trintellix and 0.5 mg of Xanax as needed for sleep and anxiety. Her doctor visits also became more regular. Prior to November 2018, she saw a doctor every three to four months, but this increased to every four weeks, before decreasing to every two months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ noted Complainant's admission that she also saw medical professionals during this period regarding her relationship with her boyfriend. Her provider noted for a June 2, 2019, appointment that <span id="Page_1898"></span>Complainant was feeling better, her medication had been helpful, she needed her medication, her appetite was good, her sleep pattern was improved, her anxiety was down, her depression was down, her lassitude was down, and her prognosis was favorable and stable. Complainant also raised concerns about not having her job at the Agency and indicated that she was planning to move in with her mother. In April 2019, Complainant had indicated she was not feeling better, her sleep pattern was not improved, her anxiety, depression, and lassitude were up, and she was experiencing thought racing. The notes for November 17, 2018, noted her suspension, depressed mood, poor sleep, anxiety, panic attacks, poor appetite, low energy, difficulty concentrating, loss of interest in activities, and loss of sexual desire.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant, the AJ noted, testified to being unable to socialize, having some good days and bad days. The AJ also noted that because of the Emergency Placement, and the NOR she was cut off from contacting anyone from work, and therefore was unable to go through her normal routines. Complainant noted that, after the matters at issue, she was crying constantly, and that this continued until her return to work in January 2020. She was constantly worried and is still sometimes worried. She noted that some of her stress and worry was because of the EEO process and not knowing the outcome, which the AJ noted was not recoverable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the AJ found that: Complainant was worried these matters would follow her even though she was at a different station; would wake up from nightmares; was taking a sleeping aid four times a week until January 2020; had stomachaches and headaches; had diminished family relationships; and she had to rely on her boyfriend to pay for housing. Although her condition improved after her return in January 2020, her financial position was still difficult because she had not received her back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the nature and duration of the harm experienced by Complainant was most acute from November 2018 to January 2020, a period of 14 months, though the effects continued thereafter even until the date of the hearing in March 2021. The AJ focused on three of the Commission's prior decisions, i.e., <span class="italic">Complainant v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070015 (May 22, 2008) (the Commission affirmed an administrative judge's award of $85,000 where complainant requested damages for loss of reputation, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of health, emotional distress, loss of sleep, anxiety, stress, depression, loss of self-esteem and excessive fatigue, following termination of a temporary promotion and being subjected to a hostile work environment), <span class="italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080667 (Sept. 10, 2008); <span class="italic">Leung v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080685 (Oct. 8, 2009) (the Commission increased an agency award from $17,000 to $85,000 where complainant was terminated and stated that he experienced extreme and long-lasting emotional distress, and embarrassment that resulted in on-going loss of self-esteem; depression; grief; anguish; anger; stress; weight loss; headaches; nausea; sleeplessness; suicidal idealization; withdrawal from friends, coworkers and family; and a general loss of enjoyment of life during the two years since his wrongful termination); and <span class="italic">Complainant v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01993594 (Sept. 13, 2000) (the Commission awarded $85,000 where complainant was not selected for a position and received a lower report than deserved and submitted credible evidence indicating that the agency's discriminatory actions caused him to, in part, become very irritable; distant; wake up at night and make sudden jerking movements; not want to go to work; just lay in bed when he was not working; and neglect his home duties. Complainant was later diagnosed with major depression, single episode mild to moderate with anxiety).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the AJ, like the complainant in EEOC Appeal No. 0720070015, Complainant experienced each of the reputational effects and emotional and physical distress. Moreover, Complainant experienced the more significant and more degrading adverse action of removal compared to a termination of a temporary promotion and hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also found that Complainant also experienced emotional and physical distress like the complainant in EEOC Appeal No. 0120080685. Finally, the AJ found that similar to EEOC Appeal No. 01993594, Complainant received medical attention at a greater degree following the incidents in her complaint, including increased medication. According to the AJ, he carefully considered the relevant facts, including the nature and duration of the distress experienced by Complainant, and the amounts awarded in other comparable cases, including in what years those amounts were granted. The AJ also stated that he discounted Complainant's frustration with the EEO process, her pre-existing conditions, and her familial and social difficulties that were not attributable to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that the AJ's compensatory damages award was grossly excessive and inconsistent with awards in similar cases. Arguing that the AJ abused his discretion, the Agency requests that the Commission drastically reduce the AJ's award. Specifically, the Agency argues that none of the cases cited by the AJ are:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[f]actually similar to the instant case because all of them considered damages that were demonstrably more significant than what Complainant herself testified to, especially given the fact that she herself admitted that while she was off work from the Postal Service she applied for 20 jobs per month, was able to work successfully, took vacation, and was offered her oriGINAl position back, which she rejected. For example, Complainant testified at hearing that while off work from the Postal Service after November 7, 2018, Complainant applied for and, in some cases, obtained and successfully performed multiple other forms of work. According to her, despite her other testimony, she 'wasn't at home sitting waiting to get [her] job back from the post office.'</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency, citing several cases, one awarding as little as $1,500, argues for an amount that was less than $25,000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's award of $85,000 in this case. As noted above, the AJ found the testimony of Complainant to be credible. An AJ's credibility determination based on the demeanor of a witness or on the tone of voice of a witness will be accepted unless documents or other objective evidence so contradicts the testimony, or the testimony so lacks in credibility that a reasonable fact finder would not credit it. <span class="italic">See</span> EEOC Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (MD-110), Chap. 9, at &#x00A7; VI.B. (Aug. 5, 2015). Other than the Agency's disagreement with the AJ's determinations, we find that it has not shown that the AJ erred or that the record does not support the AJ's findings. We also find that the AJ took into consideration the matters raised by the Agency, i.e., her preexisting medical condition, when arriving at an appropriate amount. Finally, we find that the cases cited by the AJ are consistent with Complainant's damages as found by the AJ, including duration and severity of her harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a retaliatory termination resulted in the complainant's children having to obtain employment to help pay bills and the complainant also required food stamps and housing assistance to get by the Commission found an award of $85,000 was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">McFadden v. Attorney General</span>, 0720070074 (2012), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her July 9, 2007 Decision, the AJ awarded Complainant $85,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. In support of this decision, the AJ found, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Complainant testified that [h]er termination and inability to get rehired with the Postal Service was financially and emotionally devastating. She broke down continually when recounting how before her termination she was proud to be able to provide for her family as a single parent.... She tearfully explained that she is constantly worried about how to meet her financial obligations. [D]to her termination, she had to move to subsidized housing and apply for food stamps.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">HT at 81. Additionally, the AJ found that Complainant testified that her children had to obtain employment in order to help pay the bills and one child moved back in with her to help. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 82. The AJ also found that "[C]omplainant has been taking Prozac since her termination to cope with the depression that resulted from the [A]gency's discrimination and retaliation. Complainant testified that she was never on any anti-depressant prior to her termination from the Postal Service in April 2005." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The AJ also found that Complainant testified "that she felt very hurt and betrayed by the [A]gency's unlawful discrimination since she put in a lot of years with the Postal Service and worked very hard for them. No contrary evidence was presented." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When discrimination is found, the respondent Agency must provide the employee with a remedy that constitutes full, make-whole relief to restore the employee as nearly as possible to the position he or she would have occupied absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co.</span>, 424 U.S. 747, 764 (1976); <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975). The Commission is authorized to award compensatory damages as part of the "make whole" relief for intentional discrimination. Compensatory damages, however, are limited to the amount necessary to compensate an injured party for actual harm caused by the Agency's discriminatory action, even if the harm is intangible. <span class="Italic">Damiano v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980311 (Feb. 26, 1999). Compensatory damages should consider the extent, nature and severity of the harm and the length of time the injured party endured the harm. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 14, 1992), at 11-12, 14. The Commission notes that a proper award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages, the amount of the award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, the product of passion or prejudice, and consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (Mar. 4, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that Complainant required subsidized housing <span id="Page_1899"></span>assistance and food stamps after being wrongfully terminated. HT at 70. Complainant was also prescribed Prozac for the depression she experienced after her termination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 71. Complainant testified that the financial strain has affected her mental outlook since she constantly worries about how to meet her financial obligations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 72. Complainant further testified that the depression has affected her social interactions with her family. She further testified that the depression causes her to "sleep a lot" and she does not want to go anywhere but would rather stay at home in her room. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 73.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the AJ's award of $85,000 award is supported by the record and is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Leung v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080685 (Oct. 08, 2009) ($85,000 awarded where complainant showed that Agency's action caused him to suffer extreme embarrassment that resulted in on-going loss of self esteem: depression; grief; anguish; anger; stress; weight loss; headaches; nausea; sleeplessness; suicidal idealization; withdrawal from friends, co-workers and family; and a general loss of enjoyment of life during the two years since his wrongful termination); <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070051 (Jan. 3, 2008) ($85,000 awarded where complainant showed that the Agency's discrimination caused feelings of devastation; hopelessness; fear; demoralization; and she suffered from sleeplessness and adverse effects on her marriage); <span class="Italic">Bahaudin v. Dep't of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01993594 (Sept. 13, 2000) ($85,000 awarded where complainant produced evidence indicating that the agency's discriminatory actions caused him to be very irritable; distant; wake up at night and make sudden jerking movements; not want to go to work; just lay in bed when he was not working; neglect his home duties; and not eat); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Dept of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) ($80,000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where affidavits provided by complainant, friends, and co-workers described the emotional distress that resulted from the agency's discriminatory actions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we affirm the AJ's award of $85,000.00 in compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In awarding $85,000 in damages to two complainants in <span class="Italic">Smith, et al. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120081917 (2012), the Commission also demonstrated, in awarding $50,000 to a third complainant, how compensatory damages are directly tied to the harm suffered by the individual complainant and not the conduct of the offending agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant 1</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note Complainant 1 is not requesting pecuniary damages and we see no evidence in the record of any pecuniary damages. Thus, we only address Complainant 1's entitlement to non-pecuniary, compensatory damages and not pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, the Commission finds that the award of $10,000 in non-pecuniary damages is insufficient to remedy the harm that the Agency's actions caused Complainant 1. In the present case, Complainant 1 testified that as a result of the Agency's actions he suffered from insomnia, felt depressed, was fearful, felt intimidated, had anxiety, suffered from nausea, and experienced "immense headaches." Complainant 1 stated that because Person A would not provide him assistance while working on the dock, despite the fact that assistance was provided to White workers, he experienced back pain and shoulder pain. Complainant 1 stated that he felt that his professional career growth was diminished and he also stated that he alienated himself from his family. Additionally, Complainant 1's nephew testified that during this time frame Complainant 1 became very moody, short, distant, and did not communicate as much with the family.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to his retaliation claim, Complainant 1 testified that Person A made a comment in November 1999, shortly after the class complaint was initiated, that he was going to get the "Big Six," in reference to the six individuals who filed the class complaint. Complainant 1 also noted that on one occasion Person A asked the EEO Counselor in Complainant 1's presence if any more EEOs have been filed on him because he "eat[s] them for breakfast." Complainant 1 testified that these two comments made him fear that Person A could not be stopped at all and that Person A was going to do everything he could in his power to fire Complainant 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find Complainant 1 is entitled to an award of $85,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lucas v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070051 (January 3, 2008) ($85,000 awarded in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where complainant suffered discriminatory harassment for over six years and as a result felt devastated, hopeless, and fearful, could not sleep, was treated by a psychiatrist, and stated that her marriage was adversely affected); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070015 (May 22, 2008), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied,</span> 0520080667 (September 10, 2008) ($85,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded as a result of discriminatory hostile work environment and non-selection where Complainant experienced loss of reputation, injury to professional standing, emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, health problems, anxiety, stress, depression, loss of self esteem and excessive fatigue). This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. The Commission further notes that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant 2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency was ordered to reimburse Complainant 2 for medical bills (as supported by medical invoices) incurred during the period in question for stress headaches. As neither party challenges the order of pecuniary compensatory damages, our decision is limited to a review of the amount of non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, the Commission finds that the award of $10,000 in non-pecuniary damages is insufficient to remedy the harm that the Agency's actions caused Complainant 2. Complainant 2 testified that he suffered from stress, humiliation, and nausea, as a result of the discrimination from Person A. Complainant 2 noted that he previously suffered from mild headaches; however, he stated as a result of the aggressive confrontations with Person A he suffered "massive headaches." Complainant 2 testified that he sought medical treatment for his headaches and provided medical documentation of his visits to a physician for headaches. Complainant 2 stated that he also experienced back pain as a result of Person A isolating Black employees and making them do heavy lifting, pulling or pushing equipment by themselves while White employees were afforded assistance with such tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, Complainant 2 testified that he argued with his wife about the difficulties he was having at work and that the work issues "tore into the marriage." Complainant 2 stated that as a result of the discrimination he pulled back from his wife, did not go to as many events with his kids and became more argumentative with his family. He also stated that as a result of the treatment by Person A he began drinking alcohol four or five times a week. He stated that he went to the Employee Assistance Program through the Agency six or seven times regarding the stress he was experiencing at work. Complainant 2 also testified that the treatment by Person A was so bad that he left Westgate in August or September 1999 and he worked at AMC until March 2001. Complainant 2's sister stated that prior to the discrimination at issue, Complainant was outgoing and socialized regularly with the family. She stated that in the late 1990's and early 2000, Complainant was more depressed, angry, was less outgoing and kept to himself more. Complainant 2's sister also testified that during this time Complainant had a lot of frequent headaches and started drinking more.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find Complainant 2 is entitled to an award of $50,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Hem v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060012 (March 10, 2008) (awarding $50,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where due to harassment complainant suffered emotional distress, depression, anxiety); <span class="Italic">Holliday v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03047 (June 12, 2002) (awarding $50,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where as a result of being subjected to harassment for 14 months, complainant lost enjoyment in life, isolated herself from loved ones, began to question her own abilities, gained weight, experienced stress, suffered depression, experienced humiliation, suffered from headaches, had higher blood pressure, cried constantly, and suffered sleeplessness). This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. Moreover, this award takes into account the fact that Complainant worked under Person A from September 15, 1997, the start of the discrimination at issue, through August-September 1999, when he left Westgate to work in another facility. The Commission further notes that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant 4</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant 4 worked as a Mail Handler on Tour 2 until September 2002 when he left the Agency on disability retirement. Complainant 4 died on October 31, 2006. His wife testified at the hearing on damages. Based on the record, the Commission finds that the award of $10,000 in non-pecuniary damages is insufficient to remedy the harm that the Agency's actions caused Complainant 4. Complainant's wife testified that during the relevant time, Complainant 4 came home upset and agitated because <span id="Page_1900"></span>of the discrimination he experienced by Person A. She stated that as a result of the discrimination Complainant 4 was worried about losing his job, was easily provoked into an argument, and would withdraw from interactions with friends and family. She noted that Complainant would withdraw to the extent that he would come home from work sometimes and would go into a room by himself and sit for hours. Complainant's wife testified that as a result of the treatment by Person A, Complainant 4 experienced heart palpitations, headaches, loss of appetite and trouble sleeping. Complainant's wife stated that Complainant 4 was depressed and lost weight as a result of the discrimination. She also stated that the discrimination had a negative impact on their sexual relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find Complainant 4 is entitled to an award of $85,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lucas v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070051 (January 3, 2008) ($85,000 awarded in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where complainant suffered discriminatory harassment for over six years and as a result felt devastated, hopeless, and fearful, could not sleep, was treated by a psychiatrist, and stated that her marriage was adversely affected); <span class="Italic">Robinson v.

This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent.

<p class="noindent">In a case where the agency's failure to reasonably accommodate the complainant's disability led to a further deterioration of her condition to the point where she could no longer work, the Commission awarded $87,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Michener v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10031 (2002), the complainant had a left-hand birth defect and then injured her right hand at work. The agency directed her to report to work during recuperation from surgery and her right hand sustained another injury. In a case where the damage award seems grossly inadequate, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Michener</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that the AJ properly determined that complainant established a nexus between the alleged harm and discrimination. Therefore, we must review whether or not the amount of AJ's non-pecuniary award was appropriate. The AJ determined that the agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation changed complainant's life permanently, for example she could no longer work, drive, or care for her home. Complainant also indicated that she has had to change how she cares for herself. Finally, the AJ noted that the agency's action also caused complainant great pain as well as loss of her emotional well being. We conclude that the AJ's award of $87,000.00 is consistent with prior Commission precedent and takes into account the severity and duration of the harm suffered<span class="Italic">. See Durrant v. Department of Veteran's Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971885 (September 20, 2000) (awarding $70,000 where agency's discrimination and failure to provide reasonable accommodation caused aggravation to complainant's condition resulting in her pain and suffering noting that she was not rendered totally incapacitated); <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (awarding $75,000 for emotional distress resulting in complainant's disability retirement); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997) (providing $100,000 for emotional injury resulting in indefinite total disability). Therefore, we find that the AJ properly concluded that complainant is entitled to $87,000 in compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award by the agency of $82,000 in damages to $87,000 in <span class="Italic">Webman and Huff v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120071859, 0120071896 (2008), where the complainant, Dorothy Webman suffered a five-year period of sexual harassment and advances by her supervisor. The complainant suffered both physical and emotional harm that included insomnia, vomiting, depression, headaches, depression and crying bouts. In the initial award, the agency had attributed 25% of the harm to preexisting auto-immune problem an orthopedic problems associated with running, something the Commission did not dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gamez v. Social Security Administration</span>, 07A20129 (2003), the Commission upheld an award of $90,000 in damages by the administrative judge where the complainant's exposure to a toxic work environment resulted in over four years of health problems and related emotional distress. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gamez</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of her claim for non-pecuniary damages, complainant, her husband, her co-worker and close friend, and another close friend, provided testimony. The witnesses testified that due to the agency's failure to accommodate complainant, which caused her to have to work in an environment that was toxic to her, complainant was harmed as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Complainant's relationship with her husband deteriorated;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Complainant's husband retired from work in order to care for her;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Complainant had very visible outbreaks, including splotchy skin, white hair, swollen and puffy lips, redness in the face;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Complainant had other physical symptoms, including burning eyes, headaches, and blistered lips;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;Complainant was no longer able to wear makeup or cologne, and could only wear certain fabrics or clothing;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(6)&#x2003;Complainant and her husband had to get out of a contract on their house because it was full of mold, and complainant and her husband were living out of their car, or with their brother or sister whenever they would allow them to stay;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(7)&#x2003;Complainant used to be very outgoing, vocal, optimistic, bubbly and athletic, however, she became withdrawn and less active, did not participate in social activities, and was diagnosed with depression for which anti-depressants were prescribed; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(8)&#x2003;Complainant often heard people in the regional office talking about the "Betty Disease," and consequently, she had lowered self-esteem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several doctors who had treated complainant testified that her symptoms were related to her work environment. Complainant's primary care physician asserted that although complainant did have urticaria before coming to the agency facility in question in August 1997, her symptoms were mild at that time. He stated that prior to complainant's arrival at this facility she never had a pattern of outbreaks. The physician further noted that complainant's symptoms would flare up during the week and would often improve on the days when she did not go into the building. He further noted that he had been frustrated because if the agency had complied with his recommendations, complainant's symptoms would have improved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find based on the evidence in the record, that it is not mere speculation that had the agency made adequate efforts to seek a work environment that was not toxic for complainant, then her physical symptoms would have improved significantly. Neither is it speculative that if complainant's physical symptoms had been alleviated, her emotional distress would also have subsided significantly. As to the duration of her symptoms, complainant's primary care physician characterized the illness as being "ongoing and indefinite," and he asserted that complainant's symptoms were most severe between 1997 and 1998, however, her problems continued into 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the agency's contention, we find that complainant has established a causal connection between her physical and emotional symptoms and the agency's failure to accommodate her; specifically, there is substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that complainant's work environment was the cause of her physical symptoms, which in turn caused her emotional distress. Additionally, substantial evidence in the record indicates that when complainant was away from her work site her symptoms improved. Further, we find that the agency's use of a preexisting condition analysis is misguided. The evidence of record indicates that complainant began experiencing severe physical symptoms as soon as she arrived at the facility, which caused her emotional distress. The agency argues that it has not caused complainant harm, because there is no evidence that her condition was exacerbated after June 12, 1998. Even assuming that complainant's condition did not worsen as of June 12, 1998, the agency must still compensate complainant for her continuing symptoms, because in these circumstances, accommodating her would have alleviated those symptoms. Thus, we measure the nature, severity and duration of the harm suffered between June 12, 1998 and March 2001, without comparing it to the harm that complainant endured at any time prior to June 12, 1998.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has requested $300,000 in non-pecuniary damages, and the agency argues that no non-pecuniary damages are warranted. After a thorough review of the record, we agree that an award of $90,000.00 is appropriate to compensate complainant for her pain and suffering between June 12, 1998 and March 2001. We point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions<span class="Italic">. See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura</span>, 477 U.S. 299, 311-12 (1986) (stating that compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case). The Commission notes that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Michener v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. <span id="Page_1901"></span>07A10031 (May 3, 2002) ($87,000.00 awarded where the agency's failure to reasonably accommodate permanently changed complainant's life and she had to change how she dressed and maintained her personal hygiene). The agency is ordered to take remedial actions in accordance with this decision and order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Foti v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30091.txt">07A30091</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $90,000 in damages where the complainant was placed on emergency suspension and later removed for allegedly attempting to steal cash. Reviewing the factual findings of the administrative judge on the damage issue under the substantial evidence standard, the Commission summarized the findings in <span class="Italic">Foti</span> as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also determined that complainant was entitled to $90,000 in non-pecuniary damages. The AJ awarded this amount based on statements by complainant indicating her shock and state of disbelief after being told that she was removed. Complainant testified that she felt depressed and demoralized. She also began experiencing stomach problems. Complainant spent a lot of the time sleeping because she found it easier to be asleep than to be awake. She lacked the mental or physical energy to take on another job. She exhausted her savings and tried to earn money walking other people's dogs and working at a pool where most of her co-workers were teenagers. Further, because the facility was in a small community, she could not avoid meeting her old customers from the facility who would ask what happened. Complainant found it humiliating to have to explain that she was fired for dishonesty even though she had not stolen any money. The AJ noted that complainant continues to be depressed over the loss of her job and the humiliation involved in accepting food, money and other items from members of her community due to the reduction in income.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychologist provided testimony regarding complainant's mental and emotional state. He first saw complainant in November 1999, and diagnosed her with Adjustment Disorder with anxious and depressive symptoms in response to a psychosocial stressor. The Psychologist indicated that after complainant became aware of the termination, her symptoms became more severe such as persistent sadness, crying, inability to enjoy life, and constant worry and obsession with her situation. The Psychologist then changed his diagnosis to Major Depression. He also stated that there were no factors other than complainant's loss of employment at the agency that caused or contributed to complainant's depressed mental state. Complainant also suffered insomnia, poor concentration, lack of motivation, social withdrawal, and period of heightened anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ noted that the agency did not present any evidence to mitigate the damages established by complainant or her Psychiatrist. Based upon the evidence as to the emotional harm suffered by complainant due to the agency's discrimination, the AJ found that complainant was entitled to $90,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $90,000 in damages where the complainant was subjected to a hostile work environment for over a year and the psychological trauma she suffered continued well after the time she resigned employment with the agency. In <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50003.txt">07A50003</a> (2006), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his bench decision, the AJ noted that complainant's psychiatrist (PI) testified at the hearing that she began treating complainant in November of 2001. PI stated that when treatment began, complainant had symptoms of anxiety and depression, had trouble eating and sleeping as well as suffering from headaches and gastrointestinal distress. PI further stated that it was difficult for complainant to leave her house and that she was not functioning well enough to work. PI initially diagnosed complainant with adjustment disorder but later changed her diagnosis to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), exacerbated by the litigation of her claim. PI further stated that the workplace harassment complainant experienced could cause PTSD, and the AJ found her to be a credible witness. AJ's Corrective Action at 3. The AJ found that complainant had no prior history of the symptoms she exhibited since the harassment began, nor did she have a prior history of receiving mental health treatment. Based on the uncontroverted testimony of PI and complainant's testimony of the effect of the harassment, and taking into consideration the awards of compensatory damages in cases somewhat similar to the instant case, the AJ determined that an award of $90,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages was reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, we find that the AJ's conclusion that complainant began suffering the aforementioned symptoms after the harassment by Wl began to be supported by substantial evidence. Further, we find that the record supports a finding that the harassment continued for over one year, and complainant's psychological trauma resulting from the harassment continued well past the date complainant resigned from the agency. As such, we agree with the AJ that an award of $90,000.00 is appropriate to compensate complainant for her pain and suffering during the relevant time period.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $90,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A34968.txt">01A34968</a> (2006), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant led to anxiety and stress over a prolonged period, sleeplessness, and the complainant further testified that he was devastated when he was given the option of resigning, retiring or being removed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Villanueva</span> further found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Psychotherapist testified that complainant expressed low self esteem and was having a difficult time. Psychotherapist stated that complainant had a diminished quality of life, difficulty concentrating, and problems with his memory. The Psychotherapist diagnosed complainant with adjustment disorder because of "motor tension and restlessness" and a "high period of anxiety." HT at 34. The Psychotherapist also noted that complainant was also experiencing loss of sleep. The Psychotherapist indicated that complainant's anxiety and depression were related to complainant's perception that his job was in jeopardy and related employment concerns. The Psychotherapist stated that complainant was experiencing difficulties at home due to the anxiety. Because of the problems complainant was facing, he was on edge with his wife. HT at 37. When the Psychotherapist mentioned the agency's attempt to have complainant removed, he noticed that complainant's facial features were fidgety, he was depressed and angry. The Psychotherapist averred that a couple of times, complainant clenched his fists and teeth. He noted a definite body change in complainant when he talked about his job. As of the date of the hearing, the Psychotherapist noted that complainant still had concerns about his job and troubles sleeping and was stressed about his job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife also testified before the AJ. She noted that after his accommodation request was denied, complainant was disappointed and her relationship with him changed. She indicated that he became irritable. Complainant's wife averred that her husband lost weight because he lost his appetite while before he was a heavy eater. She also testified that by the time of the hearing that complainant was better but he was not fully to the point he used to be.</p>
