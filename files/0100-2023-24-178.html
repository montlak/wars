<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-153"><span class="space">d.</span> Duties That Can Only Be Performed at the Workplace</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bodenheimer v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01A52776 (2006), the Commission found that the agency did not deny the complainant reasonable accommodation by refusing to permit her to telecommute because the core duties of her position required that she be present in the office, the other program analyst was promoted to a position outside the office, and her temporary telework project was not a priority for the office. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bodenheimer</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that complainant is an individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, we note that the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation does not require the removal of essential functions of the employee's position. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (revised October 17, 2002). In this case, complainant has requested that, as an accommodation, she be allowed to work at home full-time in order to receive treatments related to her disability. However, complainant's position description indicates that her job largely involves receiving telephone calls and visitors in the office, reviewing mail, participating in mortgage conferences, and preparing reports, actions that involve a high level of personal contact and physical presence in the office. Agency managers attested that the demands of complainant's position meant that it was impractical for her to perform the core duties of her position outside the office. Moreover, as the only Program Assistant in the office, the agency needed complainant to be in the office to perform clerical duties that no one else could perform. Complainant contends that she could continue to work on the docket project at home because that project has not been completed. However, performing docket work was a temporary project, and it was reasonable for the agency to conclude that complainant was needed to perform the essential functions of her position more than those of an ancillary docket project. We conclude that complainant has not established that she could successfully perform the essential functions of her position working full-time at home. Therefore, we determine that the accommodation requested by complainant--full-time telework--would have required the removal of essential functions of complainant's position. Finally, we find that the agency's provision of a flexible work schedule and liberal leave was a reasonable accommodation in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kiera H. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120170813 (2019) (complainant could not perform the essential functions of her position where she was unable to work in the office; "The essential functions of the representative's position included answering phones twice per week and meeting with customers face-to-face three times per week. Full-time telework would have prevented her from performing these essential functions."); <span class="Italic">Duckwiley v. General Services Administration</span>, 0120103514 (2011) (position required serving as receptionist, screening visitors and taking phone calls).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Amaro v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120102056 (2010), the Commission found that teleworking was not a reasonable accommodation for the complainant as a supervisory social worker where the essential functions of the position required "providing patient care and her supervisory or lead work activities."</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the fact that the position requires some face-to-face contact as an essential function does not mean that teleworking <span class="Italic">per se</span> is not a reasonable accommodation. One option is to provide telework on a part-time basis. For example, in <span class="Italic">Blocher v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120111937 (2013), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate an employee who was a service chief with hip dysplasia that required surgery and recuperation when it determined that she was not qualified. The agency argued that the service chief position required personal supervision of employees and, because the complainant could not come to work on a regular basis she could not perform an essential function of the position. In finding a failure to accommodation, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Blocher</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A reasonable accommodation must be effective. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Airways v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391, 400 (2002). "The word 'accommodation'...conveys the need for effectiveness." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "An ineffective 'modification' or 'adjustment' will not accommodate a disabled individual's limitations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the context of job performance, this means that a reasonable accommodation enables the individual to perform the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance. Although protected individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, they are not necessarily entitled to their accommodation of choice. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance, Question 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency concedes that Complainant was an individual with a disability while she was recovering from hip replacement surgery. The Agency stated, however, that Complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability, and accordingly, fails the second prong. We are not persuaded by the Agency's argument. As Complainant correctly argues, an agency should not base its decision regarding a request for reasonable accommodation solely on whether the employee's essential job "involves some contact and coordination with other employees." Citing Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Work at Home/Telework as a Reasonable Accommodation, Question 4, available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html</a> (last modified October 27, 2005) (Fact Sheet). The Fact Sheet further notes that it is an appropriate reasonable accommodation to institute a part-time telework schedule if the situation permits. Fact Sheet, Question 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency couches its decision in S2's explanation that he does not believe that any service chief should work from home under any circumstances. In his affidavit, S2 insisted his reason was proper because he applies it equally to all service chiefs regardless of the presence of a disability. However, in its decision, the Agency overlooks Commission guidance. Specifically, we have said that it is a reasonable accommodation to modify a workplace policy when necessitated by an individual's disability-related limitations." Guidance, Question 24 &#x0026; n.71. Thus, it is not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to reject out-of-hand a request for telework as a reasonable accommodation because telework is generally determined by the Agency to not be ordinarily available to a disabled employee's non-disabled counterparts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record affirmatively reflects that the RAC and S2 abandoned their obligation to engage in an interactive process to determine whether Complainant's reasonable accommodation request was, in fact, reasonable. Neither the RAC nor S2 brought Complainant into the decision-making process. The purpose of the interactive process becomes clear in the instant case, when it was not used.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Agency has failed to meet its burden of proving that providing Complainant with at least some telework on a temporary basis as an accommodation during her recuperation from surgery would have posed an undue hardship. S2's opinion on the matter, without more, is not sufficient to establish undue burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find the Agency discriminated against Complainant when it denied her request for telework as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Knowing the amount of time a complainant must interact with the public or engage in duties that can only be completed at the office and the amount of time the complainant is requesting to work from home will help determine whether the work is essential to the position and whether telework would impose an undue burden on the agency. For example, 1.5 to 5 hours a week of face-to-face interactions with the public did not support a finding that those duties were an essential function of the position in <span class="Italic">Hae T. v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 2019003385 (2020). In that case, the complainant requested to work from home six to eight hours a month, as symptoms required, and maintained that the majority of her duties involved paper and computer work. The Commission wrote in <span class="Italic">Hae T</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e note that Complainant has consistently maintained that she only performs 1.5 to 5 hours of "front line face-to-face visitor interactions" per week. Our review of the record shows that the Agency has not disputed this contention. We agree with Complainant that this infrequent amount of public contact tends to suggest that public contact is not an essential function of the position. In addition, we note that Complainant's request for situational telework was not a request to remove the duty of working the visitor center. Because the record establishes that Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability during the relevant period, we find that the Agency had an obligation to provide reasonable accommodation absent a showing of undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further rejected the agency's contention that telework would pose an undue burden in <span class="Italic">Hae T</span>., noting that the request to telework six to eight hours a month was "<span class="Italic">de minimus</span>, and well within the numbers of hours of her non-public facing work":</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1420"></span>Our review of the record shows that on November 21, 2017, Complainant submitted her initial request for reasonable accommodation due to her recent diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder, namely Sjogren's Syndrome. <span class="Italic">See</span> Agency's Denial of Reasonable Accommodation Request Letter (Denial Letter), dated August 6, 2018. Her accommodation request encompassed ten distinct topics (and numerous subparts), including her request to telework. In relevant part, she requested permission to "telework from home using [her] government phone and laptop" and "work hours at home when [she] can do suitable work, and take leave for hours [when she] cannot work." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Agency immediately approved some of her requested accommodations. However, a decision on her request to telework was delayed pending further review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 4, 2017, the Agency requested medical documentation from Complainant, which she provided on January 4, 2018. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the same month, the Agency requested clarification from Complainant's physician regarding the current nature of Complainant's condition. Complainant timely provided the requested clarification on January 26, 2018. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant subsequently modified her initial reasonable accommodation request on January 30, 2018. In relevant part, she modified her telework request to expressly state that she could "work between 1-8 hours at home when [she] can do suitable work, and take the balance of 8 hours in leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The following month, Complainant provided additional medical documentation clarifying her restrictions on driving. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 2, 2018, Complainant and the Agency entered into final reasonable accommodation agreement, which granted all of Complainant's reasonable accommodation requests, except her request to telework. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following day, Complainant filed an informal EEO complaint alleging that she was subjected to discrimination when the Agency denied her request for situational telework. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In June 2018, the Agency sought guidance from its Field Solicitor's Office regarding Complainant's request. An attorney there advised management to not grant Complainant's request because "[i]t would be hard to argue in the future that another GS-9 ranger is not eligible [for telework]." ROI at 170.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 6, 2018, the Agency issued a denial letter formally denying Complainant's request for situational telework. In its denial letter, the Agency noted that "the park determined that GS-00257/9 Park Ranger (Interpretation) positions at the Natchez Trace Parkway were not suitable for telework" because the "[c]ritical duties of the position include the visitor centers and the ability to provide formal and interpretative programming and services to a variety of audiences in a variety of settings." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Agency also noted that "[t]he position is performed in the field and therefore is not suitable for telework under the DOI Telework Handbook (370 DM 226), section 2.2.3). However, the Agency informed Complainant that she had the option of taking "unscheduled leave as needed to accommodate [her] medical needs" and also "take leave under FMLA."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the FAD found that the Agency had properly denied Complainant's request. In this regard, while the FAD found that Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability, the FAD concluded that management could not grant her request for situational telework "because interacting with visitors and the public is an essential function of Complainant's position." <span class="Italic">See</span> FAD at 23. The FAD further concluded that "[w]hile Complainant's position may include duties that could be performed remotely, a significant amount of her essential duties, as described in her PD, require her to be on-site, and thus the Agency was not required to allow her to telework as requested." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis begins with the Agency's finding that while Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability, management was not required to grant her request for situational telework because a significant amount of her essential duties included face-to-face interaction with the public. As noted above, the Agency expressly found that Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability during the relevant period. Further, Complainant was able to perform the duties including face-to-face interaction with the public. The Agency should have considered and addressed whether the requested reasonable accommodation constituted an undue hardship. We note that the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to provide reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability absent a showing of undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(o) and (p). We are unable to find any clear analysis in the FAD as to how granting Complainant's request for situational telework would cause undue hardship to the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the record, we find that the Agency has not persuasively shown that providing Complainant her requested accommodation would be an undue hardship. In so finding, we recognize that Complainant's requested accommodation would require her to be away from the park for approximately six to eight hours per month, at which time, she would be unable to engage with the public. However, we note that Complainant has consistently maintained that the bulk of her work during the relevant period was performed "at the computer writing and doing other types of paperwork" in an office area. ROI at 105. Having reviewed the record, we find no evidence that any management official disputed Complainant's characterization of her work duties. As the preponderant evidence demonstrates that Complainant's request for six to eight hours of situational telework a month was so <span class="Italic">de minimus</span>, and well within the numbers of hours of her non-public facing work, we find that it would not be an undue hardship for the Agency to allow her to telework on a situational basis. We further find that telework would be an effective accommodation, as Complainant's physician opined that Complainant "could telework from home for partial days when she has minor flares and is in physical discomfort." ROI at 113.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching these conclusions, we acknowledge that the Superintendent expressed concern that granting Complainant's request would set a precedent that the agency could not handle, as "on some days, Complainant is the only employee scheduled to work at the Visitor Center." While we acknowledge this concern, we find it to be speculative as the record clearly shows that Complainant's request for telework was intended to be situational. In other words, Complainant only needed to telework when the severity of her flare ups increased to such an extent to prevent her from driving to work 6 to 8 hours per month. Given that Complainant worked approximately 1.5 to 5 hours per week in public facing roles, we are unpersuaded that Complainant's need for six to eight hours of situational telework a month would regularly fall on days when she would be scheduled to work at the visitor centers or engaged in other interpretative programs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, to the extent that providing accommodations to disabled employees would implicate the Agency's need to maintain consistency, we find that contention to be meritless, as our guidance clearly states that an employer must modify its policy concerning where work is performed if such a change is needed as a reasonable accommodation, as long as this accommodation would be effective and would not cause an undue hardship. Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (Reasonable Accommodation Guidance), EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (as revised, Oct. 17, 2002). In light of our guidance, we find the Superintendent's concern about other employees requesting telework to be unpersuasive and insufficient to constitute an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with Complainant that the Agency's decision to allow her to liberally take unscheduled leave as needed undercuts the Chief's argument that Complainant's request for situational telework would be an undue hardship. We find no cogent rationale as to how allowing Complainant to telework would pose a greater hardship to the Agency than allowing Complainant to take liberal unscheduled leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we note that Complainant would still be working while on telework, rather than completely off-work while on unscheduled leave. We emphasize that forcing an employee to take leave when another accommodation would permit an employee to continue working is not an effective accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Denese v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016). Because the Agency failed to provide Complainant an effective accommodation or demonstrate undue hardship, we conclude that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding in favor of Complainant, we reject the Agency's attempt to rely on our decision in <span class="Italic">Sanchez-Baca v. Dep't of Educ</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01996465 (Dec. 28, 2001). According to the Agency, the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Sanchez-Baca</span> that "it would be an undue hardship for [the] agency to permit the complainant to telework when her essential duties included team gatherings and onsite inspections." Having reviewed <span class="Italic">Sanchez-Baca</span>, we find that the Agency misinterpreted our case law. In that case, we found that complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability because she could not perform the essential functions of her position. We did not, however, expressly make any finding on undue hardship (i.e., whether the requested accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense to the Agency). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sanchez-Baca</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> ("Assuming for the purposes of analysis that complainant is an individual with a disability, we agree with the AJ's [Administrative Judge] determination that she is not qualified as to her Education Program Specialist position."). As such, we find the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Sanchez-Baca</span> to be unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a discriminatory practice involves the provision of a reasonable accommodation, compensatory damages may be awarded if the Agency fails to demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide the individual with a reasonable accommodation for his or her disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Gunn v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120053293 (June 15, 2007). While we have concerns regarding the Agency's rigid and inflexible approach to handling requests for telework, we are disinclined to find that the Agency failed to act in good faith, as the record clearly shows that Agency worked with Complainant to quickly grant all of her requests, with the exception of telework. Consequently, we find that Complainant is not entitled to compensatory damages.</p>
