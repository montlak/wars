<h2 class="h2" id="sec21-203"><span class="space">VI.</span> DISCIPLINARY AND CORRECTIVE ACTION</h2>
<p class="noindent">The focus of relief in discrimination cases is on making the victim whole, not on punishing the person responsible for engaging in discrimination. The Commission does not have the authority to order disciplinary action against a discriminating official as part of its remedy, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Secretary of Army</span>, 07A10065 (2002), though there have been several legislative proposals to give the Commission that authority. The No Fear Act did not provide the EEOC with any authority to impose disciplinary relief. <span class="Italic">Jambora v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40128 (2006). Other mechanisms for discipline do exist, such as the prosecution of prohibited personnel practices by the Office of the Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 USC 2302. The Commission does require that an agency take action to prevent a recurrence of discrimination and that action can include discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(a)(2). The Commission, over the years, has shown signs of becoming more active in this regard. For example, in its rulemaking notice of October 1987, 52 Fed. Reg. 41,921 (1987), the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requirement of corrective, curative or preventative action will permit the Commission to recommend that discipline be considered by the agency. The Commission will not discipline, or order discipline of, employees directly, but will work closely with the Office of Special Counsel of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which is the established mechanism for taking disciplinary action against employees who engage in a prohibited personnel practice. When an agency does not adequately explain its reasons for not taking discipline the Commission will refer the matter to the Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission may recommend corrective relief even in the absence of a finding of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Keating v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A11186 (2002) (training where a supervisor routinely used racial and ethnic slurs). In another example, in <span class="Italic">Carraway v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01873066 (1987), the Commission found that denial of a merit award was not based on discriminatory motives. However, the Commission also noted that it had "grave concern" over the attitude of the RMO, who was argumentative during the investigative interview, stated he did not have to answer the investigator's questions and referred to the investigator as the "enemy." It strongly recommended the agency provide the RMO with "extensive training and counseling in the EEO process...." <span class="Italic">Id; see also</span> <span class="Italic">Wenrich v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 04980031 (2000); <span class="Italic">Naglich v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01955405 (1997) ("We strongly suggest that the agency reprimand the SO and afford him proper training in issues involving gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace."); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 03900084 (1990). When the Commission does order training as part of the corrective relief, the agency may not satisfy its obligation by relying on training provided prior to the Commission's order. Moreover, when the Commission orders specific training, the requirement may not be fulfilled by generic, non-EEO training. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Teal v. Postmaster General</span>, 04990026 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's treatment of RMOs in this area is somewhat inconsistent. Many decisions make some reference to disciplinary action. In one case, <span class="Italic">In re USPS</span>, 05850282 (1987), the Commission rescinded the three-day suspension of an RMO that it previously ordered. It did so on the basis that the facts "as presented" did not warrant suspension. The Commission refused to address the agency's argument that to order such a suspension was a due process violation of the RMO's rights. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">In re USPS</span>, 05850333 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the particular complainant no longer works at the agency does not make any corrective action to avoid future violations moot. In <span class="Italic">Barton-Hernandez v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01882749 (1989), the Commission observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's Remedies policy clearly sets out the considerations behind relief for findings of discrimination. Title VII remedies are designed to be corrective, not punitive. In addition to making victims whole, such remedies should be "tailored to cure or correct the particular source of the identified discrimination and to minimize the chance of its recurrence." 52 Fed. Reg. 41933 (October 30, 1987). The agency's argument that the current matter is moot because the appellant [no] longer works at the agency clearly misses an important consideration in formulating remedies for violations of Title VII. Sexual harassment in the workplace is a serious infraction of civil service rules and Title VII. Agencies are clearly obligated to take steps to prevent sexual harassment in the first instance and resolutely remedy it when it occurs. The remedies required ofttimes extend beyond the individual circumstances of the individual victims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission maintains an interest in determining whether the relief ordered effectively addresses the <span class="Italic">violation</span> regardless of whether the individual complainants have received some individual relief or severed the employment relationship. Therefore, the Commission finds that the instant appeal is not moot because it maintains an ongoing interest to determine whether the agency has taken steps to insure that the complained of conduct does not recur.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency correctly points out that the Commission will not discipline or order discipline of employees directly. 52 Fed. Reg. 41921 (October 30, 1987). The Commission therefore reads the Administrative Judge's recommendation as suggesting the agency consider disciplining the supervisors identified as having engaged in the sexually harassing conduct. The agency reported its consideration of disciplinary action against these officials. Since the Commission will not, as a matter of policy, order discipline against officials, it will also not comment on the adequacy of the discipline taken, if any.... Secondly, appellants have no basis for demanding disclosure of the nature of any discipline taken.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found that it was not adequate corrective action to merely republish a statement of an agency-wide policy against sexual harassment, but that the agency must post notices of violation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wenrich</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission found the agency had not complied with its order to issue assurances to the complainant that it would not engage in further discrimination where the agency merely issued a notice that it would not engage in discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Wenrich</span>, the Commission observed this was no mere linguistic quibble:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Item 3, the written assurances, the July 10, 1994, letter to petitioner from the Chief Geologist of the agency's Geological Survey does in fact omit the word "further." While this might seem a mere quibble, intra-agency correspondence among the agency's EEO personnel notes that the difference between assurances against "further unlawful acts of discrimination" and mere "unlawful acts of discrimination" is the difference between the agency admitting that it had discriminated against petitioner or not. The Commission therefore will order the agency to reissue the letter with the addition of the word "further," as was oriGINAlly provided.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Velez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902746 (1990), the Commission departed from the <span class="Italic">Barton-Hernandez</span> case and examined the agency's failure to give "due consideration" of the recommendation of the administrative judge to terminate the employment of the offending employee, or at least to impose some form of discipline. The Commission specifically held that the agency must fairly consider the recommendation of the administrative judge to terminate the employment of the offending official and advise both the Commission and the complainant of any action taken and the reasons for such action.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the offending management official was disciplined at the time the oriGINAl incident was reported does not insulate him from further discipline <span id="Page_1968"></span>after a formal finding of discrimination has been entered. In <span class="Italic">Lacanienta v. Postmaster General</span>, 01911733 (1991), the complainant lodged a complaint against her supervisor for assault when he physically shook her during a work discussion. She also filed an EEO complaint alleging harassment on the basis of sex. Upon learning of the incident, the agency issued a letter of warning to the supervisor. The complainant subsequently prevailed on her discrimination complaint. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lacanienta</span>, specifically rejected the agency's argument that it was not required to consider further discipline based on the finding of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, it is established Commission policy that disciplinary action against an offending official should be considered by the agency where such action is necessary as a corrective remedy under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That is, after a finding of discrimination has been made, the agency should determine whether offending official should be disciplined. EEOC Policy Statement on Remedies and Relief for Individual Cases of Unlawful Discrimination, 29 CFR Part 1613, Appendix A; 29 CFR 1613.221(c)(3); <span class="Italic">Cassida v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900794 (September 14, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Commission cannot order the agency to take disciplinary action against a particular official, our regulations requires that the agency consider instituting disciplinary action where it is deemed appropriate. <span class="Italic">Cassida</span>, <span class="Italic">op cit</span>. We find the agency's argument on appeal, that further discipline of the General Supervisor would amount to "double jeopardy," to be without merit. The agency is therefore encouraged to reconsider whether the General Supervisor should receive more than a Letter of Warning as discipline for his discriminatory conduct....</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge's order went too far, however, in <span class="Italic">Damion L. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720170015 (2017), by requiring the agency to "issue a Memorandum informing all managers and supervisors working for the Agency in Facilities Management at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, or in the department encompassing the duties of the Facilities Management if that department no longer exists, that they can be subject to discipline, including but not limited to suspension, demotion, or termination, for subjecting an employee to a hostile work environment based on religion by failing to take immediate and appropriate corrective action to stop any such harassment by one of more co-workers of an employee." In that case, the administrative judge found that the agency subjected the complainant to harassment based on his religion when a coworker made derogatory religious comments to the complainant and proselytized to him. The agency adopted the administrative judge's finding of discrimination but rejected the above remedy. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Damion L</span>. upheld the agency's final decision and explained that the remedy was too broad:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(a)(2), to remedy a finding of discrimination, the Commission may order the Agency to provide full relief, to include corrective, curative or preventive actions to ensure that violations of the law similar to those found will not recur. Here, we concur with the Agency that the AJ's order enjoining the Agency from engaging in harassment is unnecessary as this is activity already prohibited under the law. Likewise, we further find the AJ's order to issue a Memorandum to all Managers and Supervisors regarding the potential for discipline due to acts of discrimination unnecessary. There is no evidence in this case of a facility-wide culture of discrimination, which could potentially benefit from such a posting. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, Appeal No. 0720090041 (May 5, 2010) (finding overly broad an order that the Agency make a facility wide promise of future discipline when there was no showing of facility-wide discrimination), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520100362 (July 20, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01910481 (1991), the Commission required specific training for the offending supervisor as the result of a racial harassment complaint. The Commission further found that full relief would include assurances that the complainant would not be subject to the control or supervision of the offending official.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the administrative judge cannot order that the offending official be required to accept training as a condition of his continued employment. In <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A00016 (2001), the Commission found the judge exceeded his authority not only in ordering a reprimand, but in making the training a condition of employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with and reject so much of the [AJ's] decision as provides for the issuance of a letter of reprimand to [the subordinate] and that individual's attendance in sensitivity training as a condition of his continued employment with the agency on the grounds that it exceeds the authorized elements of relief that can be granted by the Commission pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.501(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commission regulations state that each agency shall take appropriate disciplinary action against employees who engage in discriminatory practices. 29 CFR 1614.102(a)(6). In promulgating this policy, the Commission clearly stated that it could not discipline or order the discipline of employees directly. 52 Fed. Reg. 41920, 41921 (October 30, 1987). Rather, the Commission stated that the requirement of corrective, curative, or preventative action permits the Commission to recommend that disciplinary action be considered by the agency<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The Commission reaffirmed this policy in <span class="Italic">Cassida v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900794 (September 14, 1990), in which it stated that it could not order an agency to take disciplinary action against a particular individual, but could order the agency to consider taking disciplinary action under appropriate circumstances. The implementation of 29 CFR Part 1614 in 1992, and the implementation of the amendments to Part 1614 in 1999 have not altered the Commission's policy in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that element (2) of the AJ's order for relief orders the agency to take a particular disciplinary action against an individual employee, that order is inconsistent with 29 CFR 1614.102(a)(6). A letter of reprimand is clearly a disciplinary action. The Commission declines to order the agency to make attendance in the "sensitivity training" a condition of continued employment with the agency. It is the agency's responsibility to determine what discipline, if any, should be imposed if the subordinate employee does not obey its directive. However, the agency must consider the Commission's recommendation of discipline and report its decision on whether to discipline to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record in its entirety, including consideration of all statements submitted on appeal, it is the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to AFFIRM the agency's final order. Regarding element (2), we will modify that portion of the AJ's order so that the agency will be directed to consider taking disciplinary action against the subordinate employee responsible for the unlawful harassment. Similarly, we will order the agency to require the subordinate to attend sensitivity training, but we will not require the agency to condition the subordinate's continued employment upon attendance at that training....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission can order an agency to investigate and consider appropriate discipline, it previously held that the agency is not required to disclose to the Commission the details of its investigation or the actual discipline taken. Instead, it must provide the Commission with sufficient information to determine whether the imposition of appropriate discipline was considered. In <span class="Italic">Surles v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A23310 (2003), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the investigations and possible discipline of the cited agency personnel, we observe that the agency states that it completed all of the investigations and that it has issued appropriate discipline. With regard to the agency's position that it need not disclose the results of its investigations and the form(s) of discipline that were imposed, we agree that such information need not be disclosed. However, the agency has not submitted anything other than argument to support its position that the investigations occurred and discipline was considered. Therefore, we shall remand the matter so that the agency may supply some evidence showing compliance with Provision B. At a minimum, such evidence of compliance should include a sworn affidavit from at least one agency official who has knowledge of the investigations and the process by which the imposition of appropriate discipline was considered.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520070778 (2007), the Commission specifically rejected an agency argument that the Commission lacked authority to order the agency to disclose the type of any discipline taken. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, in rejecting a petition for reconsideration, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that the prior decision erred when it was ordered to consider taking disciplinary action against the responsible management officials, and to disclose the type of discipline taken. EEOC Regulations state that each agency shall maintain a continuing affirmative program to promote equal opportunity and to identify and eliminate discriminatory practices and polices. In support of this, the agency is required to, among other things, take disciplinary action against employees who engage in discriminatory policies. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(5). Furthermore, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.503(c) states that the Office of Federal Operations shall take all necessary action to ascertain whether the agency is implementing the decision of the Commission. To that end, we find that the disclosure of the disciplinary action taken is an effective means to ensure compliance with our decision, and the agency's argument that the Commission lacks authority in this regard is accordingly, misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent">An apology from the offending supervisor can be part of the permissible relief where public embarrassment and humiliation are a significant part of the injury claimed. <span class="Italic">See Knox v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912400 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Knox v. Postmaster General</span>, 05919874 (1992). In that case, after sustaining an on-the-job injury to his right hand, the complainant alleged that he was required to paint foul-smelling garbage cans with his left hand in full view of coworkers as part of a light duty assignment. Although apologies are not routine, the Commission found that under the circumstances alleged, an apology would be part of the appropriate relief.</p>
