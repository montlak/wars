<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-176"><span class="space">1.</span> Derogatory Remarks</h4>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, derogatory remarks, standing alone, do not sufficiently harm a person for the purposes of standing. The Commission requires that a remark or comment be accompanied by a concrete action in order for a complainant to suffer sufficient injury to be aggrieved. Likewise, the failure of an agency official to respond, when greeted, is not a sufficient injury to aggrieve an employee. In <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01941599 (1994), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that a remark or comment, unaccompanied by concrete action, is not a direct and personal deprivation sufficient to render an individual aggrieved. <span class="Italic">See Simon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900866 (October 3, 1990). The Commission holds here that the absence of a remark or comment, also unaccompanied by concrete action, similarly does not cause a direct and personal deprivation sufficient to render an individual aggrieved.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Snyder v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02992 (2000), the Commission found the complainant stated a claim where derogatory comments were accompanied by an inspection of his route.</p>
<p class="noindent">The focus in this section is on whether a claim involving derogatory remarks rises to the level of stating a hostile environment claim or should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. However, the reader also is referred to <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a> for a complete discussion of hostile environment claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has repeatedly held that verbal remarks, without some showing of injury, do not sufficiently aggrieve an employee for the purposes of filing an EEO complaint. Of course, such a holding must also be viewed in light of the large body of law surrounding hostile environment claims. The distinction being that an isolated remark may not cause sufficient injury to aggrieve an employee, but when the remarks become severe or pervasive they can create a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955417 (1996), the Commission held that, even where the complainant was hospitalized, the remarks did not cause injury sufficient to aggrieve the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In FAD #1, the agency dismissed one of appellant's allegations for failure to state a claim. On appeal, appellant indicates that for about 15 minutes the SDO screamed and yelled at her and that the MDO did not attempt to stop the SDO. Appellant states that the SDO's actions caused her to have to leave the meeting, that she felt ill, had chest pains and difficulty breathing. Appellant submits documentation indicating that she was hospitalized for two days as the result of chest pains induced by a stressful confrontation with a supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the applicable legal standards, we find that appellant has not established that she has been aggrieved by the actions taken by the agency. In finding that appellant has not shown that she was aggrieved, we note that the Commission has held that a remark or comment, unaccompanied by concrete action, is not a direct and personal deprivation sufficient to render an individual aggrieved<span class="Italic">. Gens v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910837 (Jan. 31, 1992). The Commission has also held that a "mere verbal exchange between [a complainant] and his supervisor...does not, without some showing of injury in fact, indicate that [the complainant] is aggrieved...." <span class="Italic">Fuller v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910324 (May 2, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although appellant requests compensatory damages, we find that her failure to state a claim cannot be converted into a claim under &#x00A7; 1614.103 merely because she has requested compensatory damages<span class="Italic">. See Larotonda v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933846 (Mar. 11, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">At first glance, the <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> decision is hard to reconcile with the decision of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993), holding that a plaintiff in a sexual harassment hostile <span id="Page_244"></span>environment claim need not show severe psychological injury to state a claim for relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, what the Commission does in cases like <span class="Italic">Lewis, often without specifically saying so,</span> is to impose the reasonable person test of <span class="Italic">Harris</span> on the claimed injury. The Commission looks not only at the injury actually claimed by the complainant, but also examines that injury to determine whether a reasonable person in the complainant's position, subject to the same verbal abuse, would suffer a similar injury. Under the test the Supreme Court adopted in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> to assess hostile environment claims, the employee must demonstrate that: (1) he or she actually viewed the environment as hostile, offensive, or abusive; and (2) a reasonable person, with the employee's characteristics, would view the environment as hostile, offensive, or abusive. Nothing in Title VII suggests that Congress intended to protect the unusually sensitive individual, who is greatly offended by any derogatory comment. Imposing a reasonable person test protects employers from claims by such individuals while, at the same time, adequately protecting the rights of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">When evaluating whether alleged actions that do not invoke personnel actions, terms or conditions of employment rise to the level of stating a hostile environment claim, the allegations must be assumed to be true. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A15299 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">LoRusso v. Secretary of Defense, DLA</span>, 01953224 (1996), the Commission readily acknowledged that determining whether someone is aggrieved in a complaint involving an alleged injury to reputation is not a science. Rather, in <span class="Italic">LoRusso</span>, the Commission noted its case-by-case approach:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, appellant has also alleged that his reputation was harmed within the agency as a result of the report. The Commission has previously held that damage to an appellant's reputation may be sufficient to invoke the protections of the EEO process<span class="Italic">. See Gamboa v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890633 (August 31, 1989). In its submission on appeal, the agency properly notes that claims of damaged reputation can be so amorphous as to defy remedy. However, the Commission has noted that the viability of these claims must be decided on a case-by-case basis: "whether an employee is aggrieved in cases involving intangible harm depends on the facts and circumstances of each particular case." <span class="Italic">Simmons v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01940750 (October 4, 1994), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950072 (June 22, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant has alleged that a report containing statistics and information that should have remained private was publicized throughout his agency. Appellant alleged that this report contained statements disparaging his work and productivity, and suggesting that he should be transferred to another team. This report was allegedly disseminated and posted throughout the worksite. Based on the particular facts of this case, the Commission finds that appellant has sufficiently alleged that he was aggrieved based on harm to his reputation<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> (appellant's allegation that his reputation was harmed when he was loudly berated and threatened in front of a coworker stated a claim); <span class="Italic">Duhamel v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945168 (January 25, 1995) (appellant's allegation that he was humiliated when a schedule incorrectly listing him as AWOL was posted on the employee bulletin board stated a claim); <span class="Italic">Festa v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932315 (July 13, 1993) (appellant's allegation that his reputation was damaged when an agency official made derogatory comments about appellant to future supervisors, associates and subordinates stated a claim).</p>
<p class="noindent">There remains no real rule that can be extracted from the Commission's decisions involving derogatory remarks that provides clear guidance on the difference between isolated comments that the Commission regards as not injuring an employee, and comments sufficient to aggrieve a complainant. One factor the Commission will look at in such cases is background evidence that relates to the overall environment. In <span class="Italic">Aurore C. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120160934 (2016), the Commission seemed to hold that whether comments are sufficiently severe or pervasive to aggrieve a complainant will turn on the effect of the remarks on the complainant. In that case, the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal for failure to state a claim where, on one occasion, a coworker commented on the complainant's teamwork and asked why she came to work because she looked ill and, on another occasion, another coworker said "I know your FMLA is legitimate, but this is not a FMLA position and you need to realize it." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Aurore C</span>., held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record shows that Complainant has alleged that since using approved FMLA hours to take disability-related leave, her coworkers have questioned her about why she was using FMLA leave, and insinuated that she was not a team player as a result of taking the disability-related leave. Complainant reported the alleged discriminatory comments to her supervisor, but asserts no corrective action was taken. Where, as here, the alleged harassment is perpetrated by coworkers, liability is imputed to the Agency if management knew or should have known of the misconduct and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Owens v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940824 (Sept 5, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We previously determined whether alleged discriminatory comments are sufficient to state a claim of hostile work environment by considering the nature of the comments, coupled with the (lack of) management response. <span class="Italic">See Bryon F. v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120133382 (Feb. 11, 2015). In the instant case, Complainant has alleged that her coworkers accused Complainant of failing to meet the requirements of her position and negatively impacting her coworkers by continuing to take disability-related leave. By their nature, these comments placed pressure on Complainant to work in contravention of her medical condition. Such comments, when coupled with the Agency's failure to take corrective action, these actions could be interpreted as a threat to Complainant's continued employment. We find these allegations are sufficient to state a viable claim of disability-based harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the absence of any clear standard to apply to cases involving intangible alleged injuries, the Commission does issue decisions that cannot be reconciled with each other. For example, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Attorney General, FBI</span>, 01961678 (1996), the Commission held that a supervisor's unprofessional demeanor failed to aggrieve an employee. The complainant alleged that her supervisor inappropriately ordered her to sit down, made unfair accusations against her and "ranted and raved" that he did not have similar problems with other unit chiefs. The complainant alleged that the instances of unprofessional demeanor occurred more than once. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleges that the appellant, the only female African American Agent Unit Chief in the Section, was subjected to a pattern of unprofessional conduct by her supervisor because of her race, sex, and in reprisal for filing earlier EEO complaints. The appellant alleges that the most recent incident occurred in February 1995, in connection with an awards ceremony. She alleges that the supervisor inappropriately ordered her to sit down, made unfair accusations against her, and ranted and raved that he did not have this problem with the other Unit Chiefs and was not going to tolerate it with her. The appellant also alleges that the supervisor's demeanor toward her was unprofessional on some other recent occasions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant complaint merely alleges that the supervisor's demeanor toward the appellant was unprofessional. It fails to disclose any direct harm suffered by the appellant as a result. In fact, it is undisputed that the appellant received the highest performance appraisals during the time-period in question from the same supervisor whom she charges with unprofessional demeanor toward her.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Moore v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962838 (1996) (a supervisor's intemperate remarks did not aggrieve an employee). But, in <span class="Italic">Riden v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01963141 (1996), the Commission found the employee stated a claim for relief where she alleged that critical, humiliating and disparaging remarks were made by management staff during a meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complaint that an agency has not publicized receipt of an award by the complainant in the same way that it publicized awards to others states a claim. <span class="Italic">See Currin v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05960188 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gillman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993802 (2000), the Commission found the complainant stated a claim for relief where:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to her, co-workers, armed with information allegedly provided to them by management, referred to her as crazy. Also, if the agency was keeping a file on complainant as alleged, it is our view that a reasonable person would find that to be hostile or abusive. Those things, combined with complainant's contention that the agency refused to provide her with copies various documents concerning her employment information, do state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's own confusion regarding its case law was delightfully demonstrated in a lengthy opinion where it tried to reconcile, without admitting any lack of clarity or error on its part, two previous decisions--<span class="Italic">Osborne v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05960111 (1996) and <span class="Italic">Lee v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930220 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05970077 (1997), the Commission reversed its earlier decision that the employee had stated a claim for relief involving a series of derogatory comments allegedly made during a meeting. Apparently misreading its own previous case law, the Commission held that virtually any allegation of harassment states a claim for relief. The Commission clarified its position, or at least attempted to, on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Cobb</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision based its reversal of the dismissal of the appellant's complaint on what it deemed to be the holding of a recent Commission decision, <span class="Italic">Osborne v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960111 (July 19, 1996), <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that a complainant states a claim where he or she has alleged "harassment" because of a protected basis (race, sex, national origin, color, religion, age, or disability). As discussed further below, the previous decision may have drawn its interpretation of the holding of the <span class="Italic">Osborne</span> decision from two statements contained in that decision. However, the actual holding of the <span class="Italic">Osborne</span> case is discerned by examining the specific complaint allegations which the Commission found to be sufficient to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ms. Osborne alleged that the agency discriminated against her based on her sex (female) when, on October 19, 1994, at the conclusion of a <span id="Page_245"></span>meeting, her supervisor placed his hands on her shoulders, turned her around, and stated that she could not leave without shaking hands with him. Ms. Osborne also alleged that her supervisor's actions were directed at her because of her sex and that his "physical aggression, intimidation and unequal treatment constituted harassment based on sex...." The Commission found that a fair reading of Ms. Osborne's allegations was that she alleged discrimination based on her sex when, on October 19, 1994, "her supervisor harassed her and created a hostile and abusive work environment through unwelcome physical contact." Thus, the holding in the <span class="Italic">Osborne</span> case was that a complaint which alleges a single incident of unwelcome physical contact, which was perceived by the complainant as physical aggression, intimidation and unequal treatment based on sex, was sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Osborne</span> holding was consistent with the Commission's prior decision in <span class="Italic">Lee v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930220 (August 12, 1993), upon which the <span class="Italic">Osborne</span> decision relied as setting forth the appropriate standard for determining whether a complaint states a claim. Ms. Lee alleged in her complaint that an agency official harassed her on the basis of her sex (female) when he entered her [mail] case, which was not big enough for two people, and started to rub his chest against her arm and shoulder, causing her to leave. In her statement to an EEO counselor, Ms. Lee also alleged that the agency official started to talk in her left ear while pressing his chest against her. Shortly after the incident, Ms. Lee wrote a letter to the agency's Postmaster wherein she alleged that the same agency official was continually harassing her, yelling at her, and creating an intimidating, hostile and offensive work environment for her. Ms. Lee filed a second allegation months later that the agency official had made an obscene gesture towards her. The Commission found that a fair reading of Ms. Lee's allegations was that she was alleging discrimination based on her sex (female) when the agency official harassed her and created a hostile and abusive work environment through unwelcome physical contact, gestures, and speech.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, both the <span class="Italic">Osborne</span> and the <span class="Italic">Lee</span> decisions held, in effect, that a complaint of sex-based harassment which included an allegation of an unwelcome physical touching stated a hostile or abusive work environment claim under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in determining whether a harassment complaint states a claim in other cases where a complainant had not alleged disparate treatment regarding a specific term, condition, or privilege of employment, the Commission has repeatedly examined whether a complainant's harassment allegations, when considered together and assumed to be true, were sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Miller v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05941016 (June 2, 1995) (an oral admonishment was not sufficient to state a hostile work environment claim); <span class="Italic">James v. Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940327 (September 20, 1994) (insufficient facts alleged to state a discriminatory working environment claim under the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court); <span class="Italic">Fagone v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930026 (June 4, 1993) (allegations sufficient to state a hostile work environment claim based on reprisal); and <span class="Italic">Angeli v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920342 (May 21, 1992) (allegations sufficient to state a claim of sexual harassment or sex-based harassment under the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no indication in either the <span class="Italic">Osborne</span> or the <span class="Italic">Lee</span> decisions that the Commission intended to overrule, without discussion, this longstanding policy and practice of determining whether a complainant's harassment allegations were sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim. Indeed, the <span class="Italic">Lee</span> case specifically indicated, when addressing the appropriate standard for failure to state a claim dismissals, that a working environment heavily charged with discrimination may, in and of itself, constitute an unlawful employment practice. Consistent with the Commission's policy and practice of determining whether a complainant's harassment allegations are sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim, the Commission has repeatedly found that allegations of a few isolated incidents of alleged harassment usually are not sufficient to state a harassment claim. For example, the Commission held that allegations that supervisor had "verbally attacked" the complainant on one occasion, attempted to charge him with AWOL, and disagreed with the time the complainant entered into a sign-in log, were insufficient to state a harassment claim<span class="Italic">. Phillips v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960030 (July 12, 1996). Similarly, the Commission has held that allegations that on one occasion a supervisor threw a file on the complainant's desk and berated her in a loud voice in the presence of other employees, causing her embarrassment and humiliation, were insufficient to state a harassment claim<span class="Italic">. Banks v. Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940481 (February 16, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also consistent with the policy and practice of determining whether a complainant's harassment allegations were sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim, the Commission has repeatedly found that remarks or comments unaccompanied by a concrete agency action usually are not a direct and personal deprivation sufficient to render an individual aggrieved for purposes of Title VII. For example, the Commission has held that a supervisor's remarks on several occasions, unaccompanied by any concrete action, were not sufficient to state a claim<span class="Italic">. Backo v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960227 (June 10, 1996). In another case, the Commission held that an allegation, that on one occasion a supervisor questioned the complainant about his requested schedule revisions, did not state a claim<span class="Italic">. Henry v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940695 (February 9, 1995). Moreover, in the unusual case where the Commission has found that alleged remarks were sufficient to render an individual aggrieved for Title VII purposes, the Commission has based its holding on a description of the employee's work environment as a whole and not just on the alleged comments<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Brooks v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the Commission's long-standing policy and practice of considering the legal sufficiency of complainants' allegations of harassment, the Commission finds that the previous decision erred when it held that the appellant's complaint stated a harassment claim without addressing whether the appellant's allegations were sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision may have drawn its interpretation of the holding of the <span class="Italic">Osborne</span> decision from two statements in that decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency's conclusion as to whether appellant's complaint meets the Commission's definition of sex-based harassment goes to the merits of her allegation rather than whether she has stated a claim. As long as she has alleged that she was harassed because of her sex, she states a claim under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These statements indicate some confusion regarding the Commission's policy as to what agencies may consider when determining whether a complaint fails to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has repeatedly reversed agencies' dismissals for failure to state a claim where the agency based the dismissal on its view of the ultimate merit of the complaint allegations. The reason why an agency may not base a dismissal of an EEO complaint for failure to state a claim on its view of the ultimate merit of the complaint allegations is that, like motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint under 29 CFR Part 1614 must be construed in the light most favorable to the complainant and its allegations must be taken as true<span class="Italic">. See</span> Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d &#x00A7; 1357. Thus, all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the complaint allegations must be made in favor of the complainant, although legal conclusions set forth in a complaint should not be given a presumption of truthfulness<span class="Italic">. See</span> 2A James Wm. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice, 2d Ed., &#x00A7; 12.07 at 12-84-85; <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Silverstein</span>, 939 F.2d 463, 467-68 (7th Cir. 1991) (conclusory allegation that the plaintiff was the victim of sexual harassment not sufficient to state a claim). A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the complainant can prove no set of facts in support of the claim which would entitle the complainant to relief<span class="Italic">. Conley v. Gibson</span>, 355 U.S. 40, 45-46 (1957).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proper focus for dismissals of individual EEO complaints under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a) is on whether the complainant is allegedly aggrieved due to an unlawful employment practice in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, 29 USC 621 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>; the Equal Pay Act, 29 USC 206(d); or the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, 29 USC 791 <span class="Italic">et seq. See Hishon v. King &#x0026; Spalding</span>, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984) (complaint states a claim because Title VII's prohibition of discrimination with respect to an employee's "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" includes benefits that are part of an employment contract and benefits which an employer chooses, but is not required, to provide its employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question as to whether a complainant is allegedly aggrieved due to an unlawful employment practice for which there is a remedy under the Federal equal employment statutes, of necessity, requires a consideration of whether the complainant has alleged unlawful discrimination regarding hiring, termination, compensation, or other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Terms, conditions, or privileges of employment include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, promotion, demotion, discipline, reasonable accommodation, appraisals, awards, training, benefits, assignments, overtime, leave, tours of duty, etc. A complaint which alleges unlawful disparate treatment regarding a specific term, condition, or privilege of employment should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Miller v. Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950577 (April 4, 1996) (intense scrutiny of work products); and <span class="Italic">Brown v. Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950415 (December 14, 1995) (type of assignments). However, even where a complaint does not challenge an agency action or inaction regarding hiring, termination, compensation <span id="Page_246"></span>or any other specific term, condition, or privilege of employment, the complaint may still state a claim if the complaint allegations are sufficient to state a hostile or abusive environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 21; 114 S. Ct. 367, 370 (1993), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the holding of <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986), that harassment is actionable if it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the complainant's employment. EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 8, 1994), Enforcement Guidance on <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span> at 3. The Court explained that an "objectively hostile or abusive work environment" is created when "a reasonable person would find [it] hostile or abusive" and the complainant subjectively perceives it as such. <span class="Italic">Harris, supra</span> at 21-22; 114 S. Ct. at 370; EEOC Enforcement Guidance at 3. Thus, not all claims of harassment are actionable. Where a complaint does not challenge an agency action or inaction regarding a specific term, condition, or privilege of employment, a claim of harassment is actionable only if, allegedly, the harassment to which the complainant has been subjected was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the complainant's employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Rideout v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933866 (November 22, 1995), the Commission provided further guidance on determining whether alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the complainant's employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In determining whether an objectively hostile or abusive work environment existed, the trier of fact should consider whether a reasonable person in the complainant's circumstances would have found the alleged behavior to be hostile or abusive. [EEOC Enforcement Guidance at 6]. Even if the harassing conduct produces no tangible effects, such as psychological injury, a complainant may assert a Title VII cause of action if the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, religion, or national origin. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, [510 U.S. at 22; 114 S. Ct.] at 371, EEOC Enforcement Guidance at 3, 6. When a workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, [510 U.S. at 21; 114 S. Ct.] at 370; EEOC Enforcement Guidance at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To determine whether a work environment is objectively hostile or abusive, the trier of fact must consider all of the circumstances, including the following: the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, [510 U.S. at 23; 114 S. Ct.] at 371; EEOC Enforcement Guidance at 4, 5. While the trier of fact should consider all relevant factors, no single factor is required to establish a hostile or abusive work environment claim. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, [510 U.S. at 23; 114 S. Ct. at 371]; EEOC Enforcement Guidance at 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has indicated its belief that the <span class="Italic">Harris</span> decision applies to cases involving hostile or abusive environment harassment claims on the basis of age or disability as well as to hostile or abusive environment harassment on the basis of race, gender, religion, or national origin. EEOC Enforcement Guidance at 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the complainant can prove no set of facts in support of the claim which would entitle the complainant to relief. Thus, a claim of harassment based on the complainant's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability, should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim where the complainant has made factual allegations which, when construed in the light most favorable to the complainant, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, when considered together and treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim: either (1) a claim of disparate treatment regarding hiring, termination, compensation or any other specific term, condition, or privilege of employment; or (2) a hostile or abusive work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, as indicated above, when addressing the merits of a hostile or abuse work environment claim, the trier of fact must consider all relevant factors since no single factor is required to prove a hostile or abusive work environment claim. Similarly, when considering whether a harassment complaint states a hostile or abusive work environment claim, the decision maker must consider all of the alleged harassing incidents and remarks. Moreover, a complainant is not required to use any specific words or phrases to state a hostile or abuse work environment claim. Instead, in order to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim, a complainant must allege facts which, if proven true, would indicate that the complainant may have been subjected to harassment that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his or her employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant's complaint alleged that, based on his race, physical disability, and reprisal, at a meeting between agency officials and union leaders, an agency official referred to him as a trouble maker, stated that he was a bad union president, and indicated that he would not be allowed to return to the Police Unit because of his medical problems. Thus, notwithstanding the appellant's request contentions, in this instance the appellant's complaint merely challenged comments allegedly made at one labor-management meeting on July 6, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As indicated above, the Commission has repeatedly found that remarks or comments unaccompanied by a concrete agency action are not sufficient to state a claim. Consistent with these decisions, the Commission finds that the appellant's complaint allegations regarding allegedly derogatory remarks, made at a July 6, 1995 meeting between agency officials and union leaders, are insufficient, without more, to state a claim under federal equal employment opportunity laws.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the appellant represented that further investigation would reveal that the falsehoods were the merest tip of the iceberg of slander and libel that has been leveled against him since the time he began to participate in the equal employment arena. However, the Commission has held that an action for defamation <span class="Italic">per se</span>, which does not affect the employment relationship, is not a claim of employment discrimination and, therefore, does not state a claim under 29 CFR Part 1614. <span class="Italic">Henry v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940897 (May 18, 1995); <span class="Italic">accord Stoughton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920894 (May 6, 1993) (an action for slander is outside the jurisdiction of the EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision found that the appellant had alleged that he was, and continues to be, subjected to "harassment" because of his race, physical disability, and in reprisal for his prior EEO activity. The Commission observes that the alleged statements at issue were not made directly to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Compare Fagone v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930026 (June 4, 1993) (allegedly an agency official on one occasion publicly stated that the complainant was not qualified to be a 204-B supervisor and accused him of stealing; on a second occasion publicly belittled him for incorrectly inserting a plug; was loud and abusive to him on a third occasion; and on a fourth occasion accused him of trying to demean the agency official in front of his superiors; and a second agency official allegedly threatened that the complainant's career would never advance if he filed an EEO complaint). Moreover, the alleged statements in the instant complaint did not involve remarks which could be characterized as indicative of intimidation because of use of the EEO process, ridicule, or insult. <span class="Italic">Compare Brooks v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996) (strikingly demeaning racial comments and use of a highly-charged racial epithet when referring to the complainant). The Commission finds that, accepting the appellant's complaint allegations as true, the allegations are not sufficient to indicate that the appellant may have been subjected to harassment that was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of his employment. Accordingly, it is the decision of the Commission to reverse the previous decision and to affirm the agency's dismissal of the appellant's complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making the above finding, the Commission is mindful of the fact that the EEO Counselor's Report describes several prior complaints filed by the appellant, including at least four other instances of allegedly disparaging remarks. The Commission's records indicate that the Commission has upheld the dismissal of three of the appellant's EEO complaints for failure to state a claim. <span class="Italic">Samuel T. Cobb, III v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01962340 (November 6, 1996) (agency no. 96-2098) (a remark regarding the appellant's employment status allegedly made in his presence at a November 15, 1995 labor-management meeting), request for reconsideration pending; <span class="Italic">Samuel T. Cobb, III v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961049 (October 30, 1996) (agency no. 96-2000) (allegation that on August 17, 1995, the appellant was initially directed to leave the agency facility which he was entering to meet with an EEO Counselor, but before he had left he was told that he did not have to leave); <span class="Italic">Samuel T. Cobb, III v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01960155 (September 6, 1996) (agency no. 96-2317) (allegation regarding a June 23, 1995 statement by a supervisor about the appellant's employment status which allegedly a co-worker overheard and thought was indicative of an agency conspiracy).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has considered the allegations contained in the three previously-decided cases (which involved allegations during the time period immediately preceding and following the instant case), to determine whether the allegations in the instant case, when viewed in light of the allegations raised in the other complaints, may be part of a pattern of allegedly derogatory remarks and treatment sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim. <span class="Italic">See Brooks v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996) (Team Leader's prior history of making racially derogatory slurs and comments, and the workplace context, considered in the determination as to whether the specific complaint allegations were sufficient to state a hostile work environment claim); <span class="Italic">see also Reda v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950934 (March 7, 1996) (remand for new agency determination where the Commission could not determine whether <span id="Page_247"></span>two allegations of harassment--which standing alone did not state a harassment claim--were sufficiently related to the appellant's 21 prior complaints to state a harassment claim). The Commission finds that even when considered in light of the appellant's other complaint allegations, the appellant's instant complaint allegations are not sufficient to state a hostile or abusive work environment claim. As indicated above, harassment is actionable as a discrete claim of employment discrimination only if, allegedly, the harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of a complainant's employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission observes that the agency properly was placed on notice by the EEO Counselor's Report that the appellant recently had filed several complaints regarding allegedly derogatory statements and actions within a period of several months. Apparently disregarding the EEO Counselor's Report, the agency chose to issue at least four separate final agency decisions dismissing the appellant's complaints for failure to state a claim. However, the character of the appellant's harassment allegations were such that the agency should have treated the multiple allegations of harassment in the appellant's separate complaints as one hostile work environment claim, and considered the alleged incidents as examples of the on-going hostile work environment to which the appellant allegedly was being subjected. Then, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.606, the agency should have consolidated the four complaints and any other of the appellant's complaints that included allegations of harassing incidents/remarks, and issued one final agency decision on the appellant's allegedly on-going hostile work environment claim. The agency's decision not to consolidate the multiple allegations of harassment into a single hostile work environment complaint has resulted in duplicative case processing work by the agency, the complainant's attorney, and the Commission which could have been prevented.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission reminds the agency that it is required to ensure that its EEO Program, including its complaint processing operations, are operated efficiently. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(1). The Commission also advises the agency that it should consolidate complaints of discrimination filed by an individual complainant which raise allegations of harassing incidents or allegedly derogatory statements or remarks. Such consolidation will facilitate the agency's proper consideration of hostile or abusive work environment claims and, thereby, the conservation of limited administrative resources. The acceptance of hostile or abusive work environment claims for investigation, where allegedly the harassment to which a complainant may have been subjected could be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the complainant's employment, will also help the agency to identify and eliminate discriminatory practices as required by 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the Commission's defense, there is a fine line not readily definable between isolated derogatory remarks that are not actionable under Title VII and remarks that rise to the level of creating a hostile environment. But the question is less one of whether the complainant has alleged an injury-in-fact and more whether the complainant has alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that there has been any effect on a term or condition of employment. The basic rule to bear in mind is whether a reasonable person, using the alleged victim's perspective, would view the environment as hostile, offensive or abusive. Complaints involving derogatory comments that do not rise to that level do not state claims for relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rael v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01961192 (1996), the Commission held that the complainant's allegation that he was counseled for swearing in Spanish, but females who swore in English were not counseled, failed to state a claim. The Commission found that the counseling session did not aggrieve the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary that comments be specifically directed toward the complainant for her to be aggrieved. In <span class="Italic">Haley v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01931955 (1993), the agency dismissed an allegation that the complainant was aggrieved by another person shouting at her supervisor. The incident involved an employee asking the complainant if she had reported his name to the EEO office in connection with her complaint of sexual harassment. When the complainant responded in the affirmative, the employee "immediately turned to appellant's supervisor and began ranting and raving with such statements as: (1) Who does she think she is?; (2) What gives her the right to come in here and cause trouble, and; (3) She's nothing but a troublemaker." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission found the complainant was aggrieved due to her presence during the tirade.</p>

It should also be noted that derogatory remarks, if persistent, can rise to the level of creating a hostile environment and, thus, aggrieve an employee.
