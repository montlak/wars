<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-7"><span class="space">1.</span> Oral Agreements</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are three exceptions to the Commission's policy on written settlement agreements signed by the parties. First, oral agreements will be accepted as binding when the parties enter into the agreement in front of an administrative judge and enter the terms of the agreement into the hearing record. There is then no requirement that the agreement be placed in writing and signed by the parties. Second, on rare occasions, the Commission has held that an otherwise invalid oral agreement may be enforced where the complainant demonstrates detrimental reliance on the agency's oral assurances. Third, an agency can subsequently ratify an oral agreement by proceeding to implement its terms. The second and third bases for enforcing an oral agreement are related, yet distinct. In the former instance, the focus is on the complainant; namely, what actions did the complainant take, to his or her detriment, in reliance upon the agency's representation that an agreement was reached. In the latter instance, the focus is on the agency--namely, what actions did the agency take to actually implement terms of the oral agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">This section focuses on oral agreements reached in the presence of an administrative judge. Detrimental reliance and ratification are discussed below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-14-097.html#sec5-97">Detrimental Reliance and Ratification</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">When settlement is reached before an EEOC administrative judge, the Commission has held that there is no technical requirement that the agreement be signed. The only requirement is that it be in writing. The writing requirement is satisfied if the terms of the agreement are placed on the hearing transcript in the presence of the administrative judge. In <span class="Italic">Bers v. Environmental Protection Administrator</span>, 01912719 (1991), the Commission elaborated on this requirement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Acree v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900784 (Oct. 4, 1990), the parties reached an informal resolution of the complaint at a hearing before an Administrative Judge, and the court reporter at the hearing transcribing the agreement. The agency reduced the settlement agreement to writing and forwarded it to appellant's attorney to obtain appellant's signature. Appellant refused to sign the agreement, however, stating that it did not reflect what she had agreed to at the hearing. On request for reopening, the Commission ordered the agency to implement the agreement. The Commission found that as transcribed, the agreement contained all of the essential terms of a settlement agreement between the agency and the complainant. The Commission also noted that the hearing transcript reflected that appellant's attorney asked her if she understood and agreed to the terms of the settlement agreement, and applied [sic] in the affirmative. Thus, the agency and appellant entered into a legally binding settlement agreement. The Commission stated that its regulations do not require that settlement agreements be executed by both parties, but only that the "terms of adjustment...be reduced to writing and made a part of the complaint file." 29 CFR 1613.217(a). The Commission noted that it has previously enforced settlement agreements reached before its Administrative Judges and transcribed by a court reporter....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Rouse v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01912573 (1991). The Commission continues to adhere to the view that oral settlement agreements are binding only if reached before an EEOC administrative judge and entered onto the hearing transcript. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Newman v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05930458 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although oral agreements reached in the presence of the administrative judge and entered into the hearing transcript are binding, it must be clear that the parties have, in fact, reached agreement and that there is nothing tentative about the agreement or its terms. Moreover, if the parties do enter a binding agreement, there is no requirement that they subsequently enter a formal written agreement to make the promises of the oral agreement enforceable. Both of these positions were explained in <span class="Italic">McGriff v. General Services Administration</span>, 01940104 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Settlement agreements are contracts between the appellant and the agency to which ordinary rules of contract construction apply. As such, it is the intent of the parties as expressed in the contract, and not some unexpressed intention, that controls the contract's construction. <span class="Italic">Eggleston v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900795 (August 23, 1990); <span class="Italic">In re Chicago &#x0026; E.I. Ry. Co.</span>, F. 2d 296 (7th Cir. 1938). In addition, the Commission generally follows the plain meaning rule, which states that if the writing appears to be plain and unambiguous on its face, its meaning must be determined from the four corners of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence of any nature<span class="Italic">. See Montgomery Elevator Co. v. Building Eng'g Servs. Co.</span>, 730 F.2d 377 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that on March 15, 1993, prior to the scheduled hearing on appellant's complaints, the parties orally entered into a settlement agreement before an EEOC Administrative Judge. The agreement was read into the record and transcribed by a court reporter. Thereafter, when appellant's attorney reduced the agreement to writing, the agency refused to sign the agreement. On appeal, appellant contends that, to date, the agency has not complied with the terms of the agreement which were read into the record and transcribed by the court reporter on March 15, 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously upheld oral settlement agreements reached before its AJs and transcribed by court reporters. <span class="Italic">See Acree v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900784 (October 4, 1990) (upholding a settlement agreement reached before an AJ and transcribed by the court reporter); <span class="Italic">Rouse v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912573 (September 6, 1991) (applying <span class="Italic">Acree</span> to uphold an oral agreement because it was formed in the presence of an AJ and transcribed by a court reporter). <span class="Italic">But see Garth v. United States Postal <span id="Page_337"></span>Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923911 (March 12, 1993) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Acree</span> where there was no transcript of the pre-hearing conference and the record was unclear as to whether the agency's representative was authorized to enter the agreement); <span class="Italic">Gelin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924271 (November 10, 1992) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Acree</span> where hearing transcript showed that the AJ had indicated that the parties in the case had reached a "tentative" settlement agreement and had drafted a "proposed" agreement, and the parties understood that the terms of the agreement as read were not the final terms of the agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the <span class="Italic">Acree</span> decision to be applicable to the instant case. In <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, the Commission held that the parties had entered into a legally binding settlement agreement where the agreement was read into the record by the AJ and the court reporter transcribed the agreement. The Commission noted that the hearing transcript reflected that appellant's attorney asked her if she understood and agreed to the terms of the settlement agreement, and appellant replied in the affirmative. Accordingly, the Commission found that, as transcribed, the agreement contained all of the essential terms of a settlement agreement between the agency and the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the transcript reflects that the AJ indicated that the parties had reached a settlement agreement. In addition, the transcript reflects that after appellant's attorney read the terms of the agreement into the record, and additional terms were agreed upon, the AJ asked the agency representative, appellant and his attorney whether they each agreed to the terms as read into the record. The transcript reflects that neither the agency representative, appellant, nor his attorney registered any objections to the terms of the agreement. Therefore, the AJ concluded that the matter was resolved and closed the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that here, as in <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, the hearing transcript indicates a clear expression of the parties' intention to be mutually bound. Nowhere in the transcript is there any indication that either the AJ or the parties considered the agreement that was read into the record to be a "tentative" or "proposed" agreement. The agreement as transcribed by the court reporter on March 15, 1993 is a written reflection of the parties' final agreement. Accordingly, we find that the transcribed agreement was a valid, binding agreement because it was knowingly and voluntarily formed in the presence of an AJ and transcribed by a court reporter.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Opfer v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A11610 (2002) (there was nothing tentative about an agreement where both parties acknowledged their agreement on the record and the terms were clear and specific).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though such "boilerplate" terms were undefined, the Commission found that a binding oral agreement existed in <span class="Italic">Ullmayer v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A31406 (2003). In that case, the parties agreed to settle two EEO complaints in exchange for $50,000 with the check to be cut within 90 days and no taxes to be withheld. On the hearing transcript, the administrative judge also noted that the parties intended to put the agreement in writing and further "'agree that the basic boilerplate language is not problematic, and it will have the information about the standard confidentiality or waivers and releases, the Agency's nonadmission of discrimination, and the usual language.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Even though the settlement agreement was not reduced to writing, the Commission found the oral agreement was binding because the writing was "a mere formality since the terms of the agreement were clearly ascertainable and agreed to by the parties before the AJ." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Greeley v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05910331 (1991), the parties reached an agreement in principle on the morning of the hearing. The parties then prepared a handwritten document entitled "Summary of Points in Settlement Agreement." The agency, subsequent to cancelation of the hearing, prepared a typewritten settlement agreement that contained several additional provisions. The appellant and his attorney refused to sign it. Ultimately, the Commission remanded the case for further processing because the parties never actually reached agreement consistent with the requirements of <span class="Italic">Acree</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that <span class="Italic">Greeley</span> does not stand for the proposition that settlement agreements must be typewritten. There is nothing wrong with a handwritten agreement, but it must include all of the terms and conditions of settlement and be signed by all of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once an oral agreement is reached before an administrative judge, it is binding and new terms may not be added to the agreement without the consent of both parties. One of the problems with oral agreements is that the parties often then want to put the agreement in writing. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05A60417 (2006), the parties entered an oral agreement that provided that the agency would pay the complainant $5,000 and there would be no attorney fees, compensatory damages or other monies paid. The agreement did not specify to whom the check would be payable. The agency submitted a written agreement providing the $5,000 would be paid to the complainant's attorney. The complainant objected and refused to sign the agreement. The administrative judge then suggested the check be made payable to both the complainant and her attorney and, when the complainant made no objection, ordered the agency to so revise the agreement. However, in the revised agreement, the agency then added several terms that were not in the oral agreement or the earlier written version. The Commission found that the oral agreement was valid and that the judge's order was invalid. It ordered the agency to pay the complainant $5,000 as provided in the original oral agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agreement on the record in an MSPB proceeding dealing with issues of discrimination is binding to the same extent as if it was entered into during an EEOC proceeding. In <span class="Italic">Lebron v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990358 (2000), the Commission found that the complainant entered into a binding settlement agreement before an MSPB administrative judge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the record contains a certified transcription of the audio cassette recording of complainant's hearing. The transcription indicates that a settlement agreement was reached, requiring complainant to "withdraw any and all EEO complaints or appeals he presently has pending...." The transcription also reflects that after the terms of the agreement were read into the record; that complainant was asked by the MSPB's administrative judge (AJ) whether the terms were acceptable; that complainant responded that they were and that he had discussed them with his attorney. Thus, the Commission determines that the record supports a finding that the agency and complainant entered into a legally binding settlement agreement. We note that 64 Fed. Reg. 37,644, 37,661 (1999) (to be codified at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.603) provides that "Any settlement reached shall be in writing and signed by both parties and shall identify the claims resolved." However, the Commission has previously upheld an oral settlement agreement in the situation where an agreement was formed during a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge and transcribed by a court reporter<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Acree v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900784 (October 4, 1990). In <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, the Commission noted that the hearing transcript evidenced the agreement between the parties and that the subsequent written version of the agreement reflected the terms of the oral agreement that was evidenced in the hearing transcript. We find the present circumstances to be sufficiently analogous. Although there is not a hearing transcript in the record, the certified transcription of the tape recording is an equivalent on which to bind the parties. Further, a subsequent written version of the agreement reflects the terms described in the transcription. Therefore, we find that the parties entered into a valid settlement agreement as described in <span class="Italic">Acree</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Newton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960154 (1996), the Commission held that even when an agreement is reached in front of an administrative judge, the agreement is not binding unless it either is reduced to writing or placed on the written transcript of the proceeding. The Commission reached this conclusion even where the administrative judge submitted a statement indicating she understood that the parties had agreed on terms and that there was no court reporter present at the prehearing conference to record the agreement. The Commission did remand <span class="Italic">Newton</span> for the agency to address the arguments of detrimental reliance and subsequent ratification of the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By letter dated July 21, 1995 appellant informed the agency that it had breached a settlement agreement concerning the July 30, 1994 complaint. Appellant claimed that the agency and appellant had entered an oral settlement agreement during a prehearing conference with an EEOC administrative judge. Appellant claimed that the administrative judge had proclaimed that a settlement agreement had been reached during the prehearing conference. Appellant contended that the agency did not comply with the oral settlement agreement. Appellant argued that she "returned to her previous office detrimentally relying upon the terms of the agreement; specifically, a directive to management on sexual harassment and retaliation and reasonable accommodations for communicating with [appellant]." Appellant also argued that the agency's representative made discriminatory comments about appellant and that those comments, in combination with the agency's repudiation of the agreement, constituted bad faith and discrimination. Appellant argued that the agency should be estopped from repudiating the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 31, 1995, the agency found that the parties had never entered into a settlement agreement. The agency found that there were settlement discussions and that the administrative judge had directed the agency "to draft a settlement after discussion and agreement on the amount of attorney's fees." The agency found, however, that "a settlement was not drafted and signed as the oral agreement was never finalized." On September 26, 1995 the agency found again that there could be no breach of a settlement agreement, because no settlement agreement was ever entered. The agency found that there is no hearing transcript or equivalent document that reflects the terms of any agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The administrative judge provided a statement dated October 26, 1995. The administrative judge stated that she was under the impression that an agreement was reached during negotiations and that the only terms remaining "were clerical, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, documenting the agreement in writing, inserting the amount in attorney fees, signing the agreement, and distributing copies." The administrative judge stated that no court reporter was present at the prehearing conferences and that the administrative judge purged the file of all notes regarding the settlement negotiations. <span id="Page_338"></span>The administrative judge stated that when she was informed that the agency would not comply with the purported agreement, she advised the parties that she would schedule a hearing. The administrative judge stated that when she subsequently received notice that appellant had opted to enforce the agreement (rather than proceed with a hearing), she remanded the files to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.603 provides: "Any settlement reached shall be in writing and signed by both parties and shall identify the allegations resolved." The Commission has considered the validity of oral settlement agreements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Commission has upheld the validity of a settlement agreement entered into orally in one type of situation--during a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge, where the appellant later refused to execute a written reduction of the agreement<span class="Italic">. Acree v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900784 (October 4, 1990). In upholding the validity of the oral agreement in <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, we relied on the fact that the hearing transcript evidenced the agreement between the parties. We also noted that the subsequent written version of the agreement reflected the terms of the oral agreement that was evidenced in the hearing transcript. <span class="Italic">Newman v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930458 (July 1, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter we do not have a hearing transcript or its equivalent on which to bind the parties. Appellant does not claim that the terms of the agreement were ever reduced to writing. Therefore, we find that there is no written settlement agreement as provided for in &#x00A7; 1614.603 and that there is no valid oral settlement agreement as described in <span class="Italic">Acree</span>. It appears that no meeting of the minds between the parties was ever reached on the issue of attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that the agency should be estopped from denying the existence of an agreement because appellant has detrimentally relied on the agreement, the agency's representative made discriminatory remarks, and the agency acted in bad faith by not complying with the agreement. If appellant believes the remarks of the agency's representative were discriminatory, then she may contact an EEO Counselor to file a complaint. Such alleged discriminatory remarks by the agency's representative can not serve to estop the agency from asserting that the settlement agreement is not binding. The agency's decision to assert that the purported oral agreement was not valid was not an act of bad faith. Appellant argues that she detrimentally relied on the agreement by returning to her "previous office." The Commission has previously held that the doctrine of ratification and detrimental reliance may be applied to support enforcement of an agreement that might otherwise be unenforceable<span class="Italic">. Jacobsohn v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930689 (June 2, 1994). The agency has not addressed whether the doctrine of ratification and detrimental reliance as set forth in <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn</span> is applicable in this case. In addition, the Commission cannot determine from the record the significance of appellant's statement that she returned to her "previous office." Therefore, we shall remand the matter so that the agency can address whether the purported agreement at issue in this case should be enforced under the doctrine of ratification and detrimental reliance as set forth in <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn</span> or whether appellant is entitled to other relief.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Whelan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24584 (2003) (no enforceable agreement where the administrative judge was the only one who signed the agreement and no agreement was entered on the transcript).</p>
<p class="noindent">An oral provision of an agreement reached before an administrative judge at an untranscribed hearing is not enforceable when the parties later enter a written agreement. In <span class="Italic">Foster v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A04576 (2000), the parties entered into a written settlement agreement. However, the complainant alleged breach based on a provision that had supposedly been agreed upon before an administrative judge, but was not reduced to writing. The Commission distinguished <span class="Italic">Foster</span> from cases in which a settlement agreement reached in front of an administrative judge could be transcribed, and further noted that the written settlement agreement contained a zipper clause:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues that a verbal agreement was reached before an AJ, wherein complainant would be able to carry his increased life insurance when he retired in November 2000. This term, however, is not reflected in the text of the settlement agreement. We note that EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.603 provides that "Any settlement reached shall be in writing and signed by both parties and shall identify the claims resolved." The Commission has upheld an oral settlement agreement where an agreement was formed during a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge and transcribed by a court reporter<span class="Italic">. See Acree v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900784 (October 4, 1990). In <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, the Commission noted that the hearing transcript evidenced the agreement between the parties and that the subsequent written version of the agreement reflected the terms of the oral agreement that was evidenced in the hearing transcript. We find that the present circumstances are not sufficiently analogous, as the record does not reflect that the purported settlement provision addressed by complainant was transcribed during a hearing. Moreover, the settlement agreement clearly provides that the document "constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and there are no other terms than those specified within" (emphasis added). Therefore, we find that the agency correctly concluded that the settlement agreement entered on March 27, 2000, had not been breached.</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge can order remedies for discrimination but cannot order the parties to enter a settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">Ivy v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A60021 (2006), the administrative judge entered findings of discrimination against the agency, held "open" his findings on remedies, and ordered the parties to take part in a settlement conference in hopes they could agree on the remedies. Thereafter, the judge issued an order setting forth the remedies and further finding that the parties had entered an oral agreement on remedies. He enclosed a written settlement agreement for the parties to sign and directed the agency to implement the agreement. On appeal, the Commission found that no settlement agreement existed because it was not in writing and signed by the parties. Instead, the Commission found that the judge had, in effect, set forth the required remedies in the case. Because the agency had not appealed the discrimination findings, the Commission ordered the agency to implement the remedies after modifying the order to delete a provision to the effect that the agency did not admit discrimination and adding a provision to require training for the responsible management officials, as well as consideration of discipline for those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the Commission will not enforce oral settlement agreements does not necessarily mean that there must be a specific agreement designated as a settlement agreement in order for an agreement to exist. In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961066 (1997), the Commission found that a settlement agreement existed where the appellant relied on written communications with the agency and withdrew his discrimination complaint. The appellant in that case wrote to the agency EEO director and indicated that he would not pursue his complaints if disciplinary records were expunged from his files. In response, the EEO director indicated acceptance of the proposal. In rejecting the agency's later argument that there could be no breach because there never was an agreement, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Walker</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant alleges that the agency has failed to comply with the provisions of the June 20, 1998 settlement agreement. The record shows that in response to appellant's contentions the agency states that because the June 20, 1988 letter was not an EEO settlement agreement the breach allegation is "nonexistent." We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's June 14, 1988 letters to the Director of Field Operations and to the Acting Director of EEO Complaints Processing, show that appellant agreed to withdraw "all pending appeals, the 23 Feb 88 Letter of Warning, and will not pursue the appeals process for the 6 June 1988 Notice of Proposed Removal" provided that his personal file was "purged of all disciplinary actions, including the 23 Feb 1988 Letter of Warning, 6 June 1988 Notice of Proposed Removal, and the 3 June 1988 PS Form 2452-B Performance Evaluation be reviewed and reported favorable." The June 20, 1988 letter issued by the Director of Field Operations shows that "in response to [appellant's] letter of June 14, 1988,...this will confirm my agreement with your proposal. Based on your resignation from the Postal Service effective close of business July 15, 1988, and your agreement to withdraw all pending appeals regarding the February 23, 1988 Letter of Warning, and your agreement not to pursue the June 6, 1988 Notice of Proposed Removal through any appeals process, your record will be purged of the February 23, 1988 Letter of Warning, and the June 6, 1988 Notice of Proposed Removal. The June 6, 1988 Performance Evaluation will be changed to satisfactory."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that the agency erred in finding that appellant's breach allegation was nonexistent. The agency contends that the June 20, 1998 letter was not a settlement agreement. However, the record shows that appellant claims that he relied on the terms of said letter to inform the Acting Director of EEO Complaints Processing that he wished to withdraw from the EEO process. Moreover, the record does not show that in reaching its determination the agency first addressed the issue of whether by appellant's June 14, 1998 letter and the agency's June 20, 1988 letter the parties reached a settlement agreement under EEOC Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the <span class="Italic">Walker</span> case must be contrasted with the situation in <span class="Italic">Beaudoin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01964161 (1997), where the Commission held that there was no agreement established by the documents:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant alleged that the agency failed to comply with certain provisions of a settlement between himself and the agency purportedly reached on May 4, 1995 at a meeting between himself, the Counselor and Specialist 1. After a careful review of the record, we find that the agency properly dismissed appellant's complaint. Appellant apparently relied on his withdrawal statement of April 28, 1995, in conjunction with the meeting on May 4, 1995 among himself, the Counselor, and Specialist 1 in alleging that the agency breached a settlement agreement. However, there is no document in the record manifesting an intent on the part of <span id="Page_339"></span>the agency to enter into a binding settlement agreement with specific, enforceable provisions. While the Counselor, on April 28, 1995, may have promised an upcoming meeting between appellant and the Specialist, which encouraged appellant to withdraw his complaint and which indeed occurred, this is not the same thing as a binding, bargained for exchange of promises between the parties. Nor does the record show circumstances in which the enforcement of any oral agreements between the parties reached after the April 28, 1995 withdrawal would be appropriate. In sum, we find, based on our review of the record before us, that the agency never entered into a binding, enforceable settlement agreement with appellant. Therefore, we also find that the agency's decision not to reopen appellant's complaint was correct.</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction between the two cases is that in <span class="Italic">Beaudoin</span>, there was no response document from the agency indicating any acceptance of a settlement proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission adheres to contract principles in determining whether a settlement agreement exists and in interpreting any existing agreement. Under those principles, a contract consists of an "offer" and "acceptance." Although most agreements are reflected in a formal settlement agreement, contract law does not require such a document. If a party makes an offer and the other party unconditionally accepts, a contract exists. If the other party accepts but places conditions on the acceptance, this constitutes a counter-offer. In that case, no contract exists because acceptance must be unconditional. In <span class="Italic">Walker</span> there was acceptance of the complainant's offer; in <span class="Italic">Beaudoin</span> that acceptance never occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although oral settlement agreements are not enforceable, the parties can orally amend an existing settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">Shores v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01996875 (2001), the written settlement agreement provided for a tracking system for the complainant's work with formal suspense dates. However, subsequent to entering the agreement, the complainant and his supervisor orally agreed to implement an informal tracking system without suspense dates. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Shores</span> declined to enforce the original provision of the settlement agreement finding "that the parties, in essence, orally agreed to rescind" the provision of the written settlement agreement and substitute the alternative provision.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because voluntary resolution of complaints is encouraged, the Commission's administrative judges will generally make some attempt to facilitate settlement negotiations. The administrative judges often can be helpful to the parties in negotiations. The judges see a wide range of cases and, as a result of that experience, often may be able to provide settlement options that would not otherwise occur to the parties. Also, the judge may be able to provide the parties with some preliminary assessments of the particular case and its relative strength or weakness. This can be of assistance to the parties in assessing their respective settlement demands.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most administrative judges will set aside some time in the prehearing process and on the day of the scheduled hearing to discuss the possibility of settlement. Although the practice of conducting settlement conferences immediately prior to the hearing results in enough successes to warrant its continuance, it does have some drawbacks. For example, when the parties have a lengthy hearing before them, an unsuccessful settlement conference cuts into hearing time.</p>
