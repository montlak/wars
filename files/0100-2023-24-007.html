<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-8"><span class="space">1.</span> Constructive Knowledge</h4>
<p class="noindent">In certain situations, the Commission will apply what amounts to a constructive notice theory in finding that an agency had knowledge of the complainant's disability. In <span class="Italic">Randel v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03960070 (1996), the Commission, in reviewing a decision of the MSPB, found that agency officials had sufficient notice of the complainant's disability where a medical certificate submitted in support of a leave request stated that the complainant suffered from depression, was under medication and was receiving treatment. Instead of denying the complainant's leave request and removing him for being AWOL, the Commission in Randel found the agency should have reasonably accommodated the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although agency officials concluded that petitioner's medical documentation was inadequate to support his leave requests, the Commission finds that the documentation was sufficient to put them on notice that petitioner had a mental disability. Petitioner presented the agency with <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> medical documentation from a physician indicating a diagnosis of major depression for which he was taking medication and receiving psychotherapy. Record evidence makes clear, however, that agency officials rejected the physician's diagnosis of major depression and substituted their own "diagnosis" instead, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, petitioner had a personality conflict with his supervisor; he absented himself from work for that reason; and, he attempted to justify his absence by asserting that he had a medical condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency officials may not have liked the reasons that gave rise to petitioner's mental condition, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, conflicts in the workplace, but those reasons do not negate its legitimacy. If agency officials questioned the validity of the physician's diagnosis, they then had an affirmative obligation to obtain additional information either by speaking directly to petitioner's physician and/or referring petitioner for a fitness-for-duty examination. Record evidence showed that agency officials did neither.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a reasonable accommodation, petitioner asked for leave to cover his absence from work and for a reassignment to another position. Record evidence showed that the agency denied petitioner's request for leave. Record evidence also showed that petitioner requested reassignment through his physician and through his attorney before the agency issued the notice of proposed removal. Although agency officials considered transferring petitioner to another position, they did so only because of the conflict between him and his supervisor with no consideration given to accommodating his medical condition. That is, there appeared to be no systematic search for vacant positions based on petitioner's <span id="Page_1268"></span>qualifications and his medical restrictions. In this regard, the Commission notes the fourth-line supervisor's testimony that he never believed that petitioner had a disability and that if they had believed that petitioner had a disability, they would have done everything they could have to accommodate it. Based on these facts, the Commission finds that the agency failed to meet its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act and that his removal therefore constituted disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere suspicion of a disabling condition, however, is not enough to trigger a duty to consider a reasonable accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Lester v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01944102 (1996), the Commission declined to infer knowledge of the complainant's disabling condition to the selecting officials based on the surrounding circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, however, that appellant proved that he is disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, we find that the evidence does not establish that the three Panelists were aware of his disabilities at the time they rated appellant's application and/or perceived him as disabled. All three of the panel members testified consistently and unequivocally that they had no knowledge of appellant's alleged disabilities when they reviewed and rated his application for the Position. Appellant, on the other hand, argued that the selecting officials must have known that he is disabled since he checked the box on the Form marked "Compensably Disabled." Appellant also argued on appeal that P-1 and P-2 had personal contact with him (appellant) prior to reviewing his application and, because he wears a hearing aid, must therefore have known that he is hearing impaired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, while appellant did check the box "Compensably Disabled" at the bottom of the first page of his application form, we find that this fact does not necessarily disprove the testimony of the Panelists that they had no knowledge that appellant was disabled, nor perceived him as such<span class="Italic">. See Bryant M. Lewis v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Review No. 05910902 (March 12, 1992), which, in the context of a reasonable accommodation claim found that appellant's having marked the "handicap code" on his SF-171 did not necessarily prove that the selecting officials were aware of appellant's alleged disability. As well, we find the fact that two of the panelists apparently had personal contact with appellant prior to reviewing the applications does not disprove the Panelists' credible testimony regarding their lack of knowledge of appellant's alleged hearing impairment. This is especially true in light of the scant evidence contained in the record regarding the extent of appellant's hearing condition.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Scheidt v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130757 (2013) (supervisor knew the complainant had a back condition that placed standing, sitting, walking and lifting limitations on the complainant, but the Commission found that the agency did not have notice of the complainant's need for a schedule change as an accommodation where the complainant had not specifically requested such an accommodation); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05921024 (1993) ("although the SO was aware of appellant's assertion that she had a history of depression brought on by traumatic events in her personal life, this does not equate to knowledge on the part of the SO that appellant's depression was substantially limiting such that it would constitute a major impairment and render appellant an individual with a disability. The Commission concludes that the information relayed to the SO was insufficient to convey knowledge....").</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether the agency should have known of a disabling condition is fact determinative. Sometimes an employee's behavior alone is enough to place the agency in the "has reason to know" category. In <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05940755 (1996), for example, the Commission found the agency had ample evidence, through the complainant's bizarre behavior, that he suffered from a mental disability. No specific test is articulated by the Commission in distinguishing between cases where the agency is charged with constructive notice of a disability and those where it is not. Clearly, however, the Commission considers the nature of bizarre behavior, the frequency of any incidents, and whether there were any signs the agency should have noticed. In <span class="Italic">Rodgers</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that agency officials knew that appellant had a mental disability. The record is replete with descriptions of the dramatic change in appellant's job performance and behavior. That is, appellant suddenly became unable to perform a job that she previously had performed at an acceptable level and her behavior became increasingly bizarre. Record evidence showed that appellant's second-line supervisor was aware that appellant was a disabled veteran and also knew that the Squadron Commander had recommended denying appellant's security clearance because of an "emotional problem." Record evidence further showed that appellant's father was in contact with the second-line supervisor and had advised her that appellant had a "problem" for which she took medication. The overwhelming evidence of record showed that agency officials knew that appellant had a problem and, although they were not aware of the exact nature of her problem, they believed that it might be a mental illness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also finds that agency officials were aware of facts showing that there was a need for accommodation. As already noted, appellant's job performance had deteriorated to the point that she was unable to perform the duties of her position. At the same time, her behavior was irrational and disruptive. The issue, then, is whether the agency met its obligation to reasonably accommodate appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Rodgers</span> noted that the</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[f]ile contains 11 affidavits from various agency employees (both co-workers and supervisors). Therein, these individuals note a decline in appellant's work performance and also describe the change in appellants behavior, attributing the change to everything from personal problems at home to a mental condition to the use of medication. The following are examples of appellant's behavior that appear in the affidavits: appellant would ask to be escorted from the work floor and then wonder why she no longer was on the work floor; appellant was temperamental and argumentative; appellant would stare into space; during a supervisor's explanation of security procedures, appellant stared into space with a vacant look and then interrupted and asked if he wanted to play cards; three times in quick succession, appellant asked to be escorted from the work floor to get a drink and then changed her mind when she reached the vending machine; appellant became upset on several occasions while cleaning the tape drives and began slamming the drive doors.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a few episodes of unusual behavior will not normally be sufficient to put the agency on notice of a disabling condition. <span class="Italic">Means v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 03940050 (1994) ("that petitioner's supervisor indicated that petitioner did not request leave very often, nor did he ever ask petitioner why he was seeing a doctor. Moreover, we find that petitioner's other behavior, e.g., such as giving the twelve page-letter, the religious inscriptions, and the t-shirt to his supervisor--even considered in the aggregate--simply was not enough to alert agency officials to the fact that he has a mental disorder. That is, absent unusual behavior by an employee, an employer rightfully will attribute an employee's behavior to external factors--as when the supervisor concluded that petitioner's letter was in response to his performance appraisal--rather than to the existence of a mental or physical disorder unless the employee informs them otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reasonable accommodation of a disabling condition is not guaranteed simply by virtue of the fact that the complainant has been completing work tasks in a certain manner for some time and believes his supervisors are aware of that fact and, therefore, acquiesced to the "accommodation." Nor is it unreasonable for an agency to require the provision of medical documentation when an accommodation is sought. <span class="Italic">Myers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01913261 (1991).</p>
