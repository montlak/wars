<section>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec13-63"><span class="space">III.</span> NATIONAL ORIGIN</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is not required that discrimination on the basis of national origin be based on an allegation that a person was born in a certain country. With the exception of perhaps American Indians, nearly everyone born in this country can trace his or her ancestry to a foreign country. The Commission's basic guidance on discrimination based on national origin is set forth at 29 CFR Part 1606. On November 18, 2016, the Commission issued new <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination</span> intended to replace EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Section 13: National Origin Discrimination. 29 CFR 1606.1 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission defines national origin discrimination broadly as including, but not limited to, the denial of equal employment opportunity because of an individual's, or his or her ancestor's, place of origin; or because an individual has the physical, cultural or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group. The Commission will examine with particular concern charges alleging that individuals within the jurisdiction of the Commission have been denied equal employment opportunity for reasons which are grounded in national origin considerations, such as (a) marriage to or association with persons of a national origin group; (b) membership in, or association with an organization identified with or seeking to promote the interests of national origin groups; (c) attendance <span id="Page_1027"></span>or participation in schools, churches, temples or mosques, generally used by persons of a national origin group; and (d) because an individual's name or spouse's name is associated with a national origin group. In examining these charges for unlawful national origin discrimination, the Commission will apply general Title VII principles, such as disparate treatment and adverse impact.</p>
<p class="noindent">Section III of the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination</span> notes that, as with all protected bases of discrimination, employment decisions made on the bases of national origin are subject to both disparate treatment and disparate impact analysis. The <span class="Italic">Guidance</span> further notes those employment decisions include recruitment, hiring, promotions, work assignments, segregation and classification, transfer, wages and benefits, leave, training and apprenticeship programs, discipline, layoff and termination, and other terms and conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Hostile environment claims based national origin, the Commission explains, "can take different forms, including ethnic slurs, ridicule, intimidation, workplace graffiti, physical violence, or other offensive conduct directed toward an individual because of his birthplace, ethnicity, culture, language, dress, or foreign accent." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Sec. IV.</p>
<p class="noindent">The definition of what constitutes discrimination on the basis of national origin is broad, as is the Commission's interpretation of what constitutes national origin. Even regions of a country can form the basis of a "national origin." In <span class="Italic">Kiselev v. Department of Army</span>, 01842635 (1986), the employee stated that he considered his national origin to be Estonian. The Commission noted that although Estonia was a part of the Soviet Union at that time, prior to World War II it was a separate political and ethnic entity and could be considered a separate national origin. It is of no consequence that a complainant designates his national origin as a race in filing a complaint. It is not required that the employee be correct from an anthropological standpoint, only that the complaint make clear the alleged basis of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perkins v. USPS</span>, 01860343 (1987) (Hispanic is national origin and not race).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a bit of a fun decision, in <span class="Italic">Riley G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120152053 (2017), the Commission found that the term "Newyorkican" could form the basis of a national origin discrimination claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a preliminary matter, we address Complainant's concerns regarding the AJ's framing of his national origin. On appeal, Complainant vehemently disputes the AJ's dismissal of his stated national origin, which he identifies as "Newyorican," meaning a person of Puerto Rican descent born in New York. The AJ determined that New York and Puerto Rico are indistinguishable as a national origin because EEOC guidance and Title VII provide that both are part of the United States. The AJ concluded that Complainant's national origin was the United States, where he was born, but clarified that Complainant could also claim his National Origin as Puerto Rican, based on his ethnicity and ancestry, because he is the descendant of Puerto Rican parents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII prohibits employer actions that have the purpose or effect of discriminating against persons because of their real or perceived national origin. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.2. This Commission has broadly defined national origin employment discrimination to include adverse actions based on the "physical, cultural or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.1. National origin discrimination also includes discrimination against a person because he or she does not belong to a particular ethnic group. For purposes of Title VII, the scope of "national origin" includes ancestry or ethnicity, and may be based on a country or region of origin or des<span class="Italic">cent. See St. Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji</span>, 481 U.S. 604, 614 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("[T]he line between discrimination based on `ancestry or ethnic characteristics,...and discrimination based on 'place or nation of...origin,'...is not a bright one" because "[o]ften...the two are identical as a factual matter"; thus, "national origin claims have been treated as ancestry or ethnicity claims in some circumstances"); <span class="Italic">Cortezano v. Salin Bank &#x0026; Trust Co</span>., 680 F.3d 936, 940 (7th Cir. 2012) (interpreting national origin discrimination under Title VII to "encompass discrimination based on one's ancestry"); <span class="Italic">see also Kanaji v. Children's Hosp. of Phila</span>., 276 F. Supp.2d 399, 401-02 (E.D. Pa. 2003) ("national origin...is better understood by reference to certain traits or characteristics that can be linked to one's place of origin, as opposed to a specific country or nation"); <span class="Italic">Salas v. Wis. Dep't of Corr</span>., 493 F.3d 913, 923 (7th Cir. 2007) (Hispanics qualify as a national origin group).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the EEOC affords a broad view of national origin, including regional or cultural traits. Given the history of the United States and Puerto Rico, along with the cultural differences between Puerto Ricans and individuals of Puerto Rican descent born in New York, "Newyorican" could feasibly be a basis for national origin discrimination in certain, very specific, scenarios. Such scenarios do not include the instant complaint, because DM's alleged discriminatory actions were based only on his alleged perception that Complainant was of Puerto Rican descent. Here, Complainant has established that in this instance, Puerto Rican is a separate ethnicity from "Hispanic." Specifically, he alleges that DM, a Hispanic, non-Puerto Rican from the United States acts more favorably toward individuals from the continental United States, who he perceives as non-Puerto Ricans, by promoting them to higher level positions.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, characterizing someone as a "Yankee" does not state a claim of discrimination based on national origin. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schumann v. National Guard Bureau</span>, 01921863 (1992). The Commission found the term, by itself, did not refer to the complainant's, or her ancestors' place of origin. The Commission contrasted the case with <span class="Italic">Roach v. Dresser Industrial Valve and Instrument Division</span>, 494 F. Supp. 215 (W.D. La. 1980), where the court found that an employee who claimed discrimination as a "Cajun" had stated a claim for relief. The court noted that "Cajun" refers to someone whose ancestors once lived in Acadia and, thus, indicated ancestral origin. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Curtsinger v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A05360 (2001) (being from the southern United States is not a national origin), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">Curtsinger v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05A10328 (2001); <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01965201 (1998) (being from Kentucky does not confer protected status under the national origin provision of Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent">A selecting official responding "viscerally" to the complainant's comment about how certain processes were completed in "her country" (referencing Slovakia) may have evidenced his view that she was not loyal to the United States, but was not discrimination based on her national origin in <span class="Italic">Princess B. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2020001227 (2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note in this regard that Complainant argues that a member of the interview panel (IP: "American") "reacted viscerally" to comments Complainant made during the interview concerning Complainant's country of birth, and that IP's reaction constitutes evidence of discrimination based on national origin. Specifically, Complainant averred that she inadvertently said "my country" when discussing her work experience in Slovakia, and she also indicated that the banking system in Slovakia was more advanced than in the US because in Slovakia people did not use paper checks, but instead "processed exclusively electronic fund transfers to vendors and employees for many years."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant maintains that she made such comments in response to being asked during the interview if she had any experience with electronic fund transfers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following a review of the record, and construing any inferences in favor of Complainant, we find that the facts as alleged by Complainant do not establish that IP harbored discriminatory animus towards Complainant's national origin, or that her non-selection was based on her national origin. Instead, the record established that any negative feelings IP may have had towards Complainant stemmed from her understanding of Complainant's comments, comments IP viewed as displaying insufficient loyalty towards the United States. Had Complainant not made the specific statements, there is no basis to believe IP would have "reacted viscerally," despite having, according to Complainant, full knowledge of Complainant's national origin. In sum, the evidence indicates that IP "reacted viscerally" to Complainant's comments, and not to Complainant's national origin. While Complainant may understandably feel that IP completely misunderstood her comments, we note that IP's misunderstanding of the comments does not establish that she harbored any animus towards Complainant's protected bases.</p>
<p class="noindent">A birth certificate is not dispositive of the issue of the complainant's national origin. In <span class="Italic">Ferdnand v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01914020 (1992), the complainant's birth certificate stated that he was Caucasian. However, the Commission found that the complainant's testimony that his grandfather was Spanish and emigrated to the United States from Mexico was sufficient evidence to demonstrate he was Hispanic.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are instances where the agency's knowledge of national origin can be an issue. The Commission has found that a name could give a selecting official constructive knowledge that a person is not of North American origin. <span class="Italic">Jafri v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 01930231 (1993). This is particularly true where the complainant's SF-171 indicated his education was obtained in India and Pakistan. However, the Commission has reached a contrary conclusion in cases involving discrimination on the basis of religion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">infra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Particularly in these politically correct times it can be difficult to determine whether a protected category relates to a claim of race, color, or national origin. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Secretary of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 01933704 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recognizes that the EEO classification "Hispanic" generally references a national origin category. In the context of this case, however, the term has been treated as a non-Black racial category. The Commission continues that treatment for consistency while recognizing that Hispanics can be designated Black, White or any other racial designation. Therefore, in the strict sense, appellant does not state facts sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination unless the referenced "Hispanics" are non-Black. The actual race of the Hispanic employees is inconclusive. The Commission will assume for the sake of this analysis that the Hispanic employees are all non-Black.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission applies the traditional intentional discrimination, disparate impact, and hostile environment analysis in considering allegations of discrimination based on national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent">Particularly in the wake of September 11th, the Commission has attempted to sensitize employers to some of the more subtle forms of national origin <span id="Page_1028"></span>discrimination. In a Fact Sheet entitled, "Employment Discrimination Based on Religion, Ethnicity or Country of Origin," <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "National Origin Discrimination," at pp. 47-48, the Commission explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Anger at those responsible for the tragic events of September 11, 2001 should not be misdirected against innocent individuals because of their religion, ethnicity, or country of origin. Employers and labor unions have a special role in guarding against unlawful workplace discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination based on religion, national origin, race, color, or sex. At this time, employers and unions should be particularly sensitive to potential discrimination or harassment against individuals who are--or are perceived to be--Muslim, Arab, Afghani, Middle Eastern or South Asian (Pakistani, Indian, etc.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The law's prohibitions include harassment or any other employment action based on any of the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Affiliation</span>: Harassing or otherwise discriminating because an individual is affiliated with a particular religious or ethnic group. For example, harassing an individual because she is Arab or practices Islam, or paying an employee less because she is Middle Eastern.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Physical&#x2003;or cultural traits and clothing</span>: Harassing or otherwise discriminating because of physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics, such as accent or dress associated with a particular religion, ethnicity, or country of origin. For example, harassing a woman wearing a hijab (a body covering and/or head-scarf worn by some Muslims), or not hiring a man with a dark complexion and an accent believed to be Arab.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">National Origin</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Perception</span>: Harassing or otherwise discriminating because of the perception or belief that a person is a member of a particular racial, national origin, or religious group whether or not that perception is correct. For example, failing to hire an Hispanic person because the hiring official believed that he was from Pakistan, or harassing a Sikh man wearing a turban because the harasser thought he was Muslim.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Association</span>: Harassing or otherwise discriminating because of an individual's association with a person or organization of a particular religion or ethnicity. For example, harassing an employee whose husband is from Afghanistan, or refusing to promote an employee because he attends a Mosque.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harassment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers must provide a workplace that is free of harassment based on national origin, ethnicity, or religion. They may be liable not only for harassment by supervisors, but also by coworkers or by non-employees under their control. Employers should clearly communicate to all employees--through a written policy or other appropriate mechanism--that harassment such as ethnic slurs or other verbal or physical conduct directed toward any racial, ethnic, or religious group is prohibited and that employees must respect the rights of their coworkers. An employer also should have effective and clearly communicated policies and procedures for addressing complaints of harassment and should train managers on how to identify and respond effectively to harassment even in the absence of a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Religious Accommodation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII requires an employer to reasonably accommodate the religious practices of an employee or prospective employee, unless doing so would create an undue hardship for the employer. Some reasonable religious accommodations that employers may be required to provide workers include leave for religious observances, time and/or place to pray, and ability to wear religious garb.</p>
<p class="noindent">Religious discrimination is included because of the frequency with which it is associated with one's national origin. Despite the close link that can exist between national origin and religious discrimination, there is a significant difference as the Commission explains in the <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, 13-II:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A significant difference between Title VIIs coverage of national origin and religion relates to accommodation. Title VII only requires accommodation of <span class="Italic">religious</span> practices. Pursuant to this requirement, an employer must modify workplace policies that conflict with religious practices unless doing so would result in an undue hardship to the operation of the employer's business. For example, an employer would be required to provide an exception to a dress code to accommodate an employee's religious attire unless doing so would result in undue hardship. If the modification imposed only a minor financial or administrative burden on the employer, it would not impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While accommodation requirements do not apply to national origin, Title VII prohibits employers from imposing more restrictive workplace policies on some national origin (or religious) groups than on others. For example, an employer may not require that Hispanic workers wear business attire while permitting non-Hispanic workers in similar positions to wear more casual attire. However, an employer could impose the same dress code on all workers in similar jobs, regardless of their national origin, as long as the policy was not adopted for discriminatory reasons and is enforced evenhandedly.</p>
