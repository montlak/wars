<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-100"><span class="space">m.</span> Separating the Harasser and the Victim: Moving the Victim</h5>
<p class="noindent">Prompt remedial action may include actions taken during the investigation to verify the allegations. If appropriate, an agency may need to transfer or reassign an alleged perpetrator of sexual harassment pending investigation. It is improper to transfer or reassign the alleged victim, unless the transfer <span id="Page_883"></span>or reassignment is voluntary on the part of the alleged victim. Absent that consent, the agency may not transfer both the alleged perpetrator and alleged victim. In <span class="Italic">Abrigo v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120064230 (2008), the Commission found that the agency had engaged in retaliation against the complainant where it transferred both her and the alleged perpetrator pending investigation of the claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, to the extent that the agency may assert that it articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for changing complainant's schedule, we disagree. While the record reflects that both complainant and H1 had their schedules changed pending the investigation of complainant's sexual harassment complaint in order "to protect the rights of both the accuser and the alleged harasser," this fails to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationale. While the Commission has stated that an employer may need to take intermediate action pending the investigation of a claim, such as transferring the alleged harasser, to ensure further harassment does not occur, the Commission has also stated that the complainant should not be involuntarily transferred or otherwise burdened, because such measures could constitute unlawful retaliation.<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> at 21-22 (June 18, 1999). <span class="Italic">See also Negron-Oliver v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A35351 (September 30, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, given the fact that the undisputed record herein establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal and the failure of the agency to articulate any legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct, we conclude that a finding of reprisal is appropriate. Therefore, the Commission AFFIRMS the agency's final order implementing the AJ's finding of no discrimination on the basis of sex and MODIFIES the AJ's decision by finding that the undisputed record herein supports a finding of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although in <span class="Italic">Velez</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission seemed to suggest that reassignment of the victim may be an appropriate action for the agency to take while investigating a charge of sexual harassment, in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05920194 (1992), the Commission rejected such a move. Under <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, reassigning the alleged victim will not result in an avoidance of liability for the agency, unless the reassignment is with the consent of the victim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the agency took prompt action to remedy the harassment situation. Supervisor 1's meeting with his crew took place when he heard of the first incident. He issued his memorandum within ten days of the last incident, and it was at that time that management decided to relocate problem personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While relocating "problem personnel" would be appropriate remedial action and was reasonably calculated to end the harassment, treating the victim as one of the problem personnel was not. In <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 641 F.2d 934, 947 (D.C. Cir. 1981), the Court included "...appropriate discipline directed at the offending party" as a necessary corrective step. This does not translate to taking action directed at the victim. Here, appellant's reassignment was not voluntary. As the AJ stated in her decision, appellant testified that no one spoke to her about being moved to a different work area before she was moved, and that when she was told, she was upset about it because she did not want to move. The testimony of the agency officials bears out the involuntary nature of the move.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has ruled that the victim of harassment should not be required to take an involuntary transfer or reassignment, but rather, the individual found to have committed the prohibited harassment must bear any derogatory effects of providing the victim with full relief. <span class="Italic">Evelyn J. Monroe v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910382 (June 27, 1991). <span class="Italic">Accord</span>, <span class="Italic">Diana Lacanienta v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01911733 (September 18, 1991) (the agency should not have placed the burden of seeking respite upon appellant's shoulders; instead, the agency should have reassigned the (harasser), or offered appellant another, similar position. (footnote omitted). Although the Commission has upheld the reassignment of an appellant, we have done so where the appellant requested the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Donna Diane Hodge v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Petition for Enforcement No. 04910007 (January 21, 1992). The latter two decisions therefore do not support the notion that involuntary reassignment is appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both appellant and the agency have turned to the EEOC Compliance Manual to support their respective arguments, citing to Section 615, Harassment. Appellant cites to 615.7, for the proposition that an employer's duty to maintain a harassment-free workplace encompasses a duty to take positive action where necessary to eliminate such practices or remedy their effects. The agency in its opposition brief argues that its actions satisfied Commission guidelines, and cites to 615.4(a)(9)(iii). That section provides the factors to be considered in a harassment case in making a determination whether the employer took immediate and appropriate corrective action. In subsection (iii), the factor is: "whether (the employer) fully remedied the conduct without adversely affecting the terms or conditions of the charging party's employment in some manner (for example, by requiring the charging party to work less desirable hours or in a less desirable location)." While the EEOC Compliance Manual is geared to the processing of private sector charges, it is to be noted that the above-cited Commission decisions on federal sector complaints are entirely consonant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Commission's view, the reassignment, because it was unwanted and involuntary, adversely affected appellant's employment. The Commission concludes that the agency's action, while prompt enough, was not an appropriate remedy of the situation. We find therefore that the agency is liable for the harassment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cynthia Quinn v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900546 (August 23, 1990)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that not only is the reassignment of the alleged victim improper, but it will serve to bar any efforts by the agency, even prompt efforts, to remedy the harassment and avoid liability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission came to a similar conclusion in <span class="Italic">Dennis-Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01930016 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[T]he appropriate remedy in such circumstance is to have the sexual harasser transferred." <span class="Italic">See Cassida v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01893293 (April 30, 1990). In this case the agency's initial response was to offer appellant the transfer to another floor, rather than requiring the admitted perpetrator to be placed elsewhere. The agency's initial action was therefore to punish the victim, appellant herein, by requiring her to transfer if she wanted to be away from the offending perpetrator. The agency's initial action in this case was therefore not appropriate....</p>
<p class="noindent">Offering to reassign the complainant and the complainant declining said move also does not absolve the agency from its obligations. <span class="Italic">See Thomasina B. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120141298 (2021).</p>
<p class="noindent">The involuntary transfer of a victim of sexual harassment is impermissible even where the agency took other preventative actions, such as counseling the offender. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01945280 (1995). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120055036 (2007), where the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency's determination to offer complainant a change to his schedule, which he claims put him in a less desirable position is inadequate. The agency action forces complainant (an innocent victim of sexual harassment) to bear the burden of his supervisor's illegal action. The agency asserts that the action was voluntary because complainant did not complain when he was informed of his schedule change. However, complainant was never offered any other option in order to escape from being in the supervision of the alleged harasser. Moreover, he claims he was led to believe the schedule change was only temporary until an investigation into his allegations could be conducted. Based on the totality of the evidence presented before us, we conclude that the agency, once made aware of the conduct at issue, failed to take prompt and effective remedial action in the present case. The change of schedule, because it was unwanted and involuntary, adversely affected complainant's employment. The Commission concludes that the agency's action, while prompt enough, was not an appropriate remedy of the situation. We therefore find that the agency is liable for harassment.</p>

Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120151790 (2018) ("So far as the record reflects, the only 'corrective' action the Agency took was to remove Complainant from the workplace by placing her on administrative leave. The Commission has held that reassigning the person targeted for harassment is not appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. ('While relocating 'problem personnel' would be appropriate remedial action...treating the victim as one of the problem personnel was not.')")</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Boyer v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A24440 (2004), the Commission found the agency failed to take prompt remedial action to remedy hostile environment harassment where the agency conducted an investigation into who wrote a demeaning letter that was inconclusive and then reassigned the complainant to protect her. The Commission found that even though the investigation was inconclusive, the agency failed to take other actions to stop the harassment. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Boyer</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to (2), complainant and her husband returned to work in January 2001 after an absence of about a month. Upon their return, complainant found tampons scattered in her locker. Her husband found tampons taped to his headset and inserted into his microphone. Complainant and her husband did not report the incidents to management until after a considerable amount of time had passed. An investigation was conducted, but was inconclusive as to who perpetrated the tampon incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to (3), complainant received a letter on January 23, 2001. The letter stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">BITCH BITCH BITCH</p>
<p class="noindent-2">YOU EVIL F*CKING BITCH</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Watch your ass bitch YOU DONT decide how this sector runs DONT MESS WITH ONE OF US THEY CANT TOUCH US YOU CANT HELP THEM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">WONT PUT OUT THEN GET OUT GO HOME TAKE YOUR WEAKASS HUSBAND WITH YOU</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_884"></span>YOUR ASS IS MINE!!! NO SUP TO PROTECT YOU NOW</p>
<p class="noindent-2">back off. We like our sector the way it is</p>
<p class="noindent-2">write your letters have your meetings tell your stories pay the price</p>
<p class="noindent-2">TELL NOBODY. REMEMBER WHAT A HEAVY JET LOOKS LIKE UP CLOSE</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ROI at A2, Attachment M. Management was immediately notified. Another investigation was conducted but was inconclusive as to who sent the letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to (4), complainant was reassigned from the Newark sector to the Kennedy sector at the New York TRANCON soon after receiving the note described in (3). Management stated that based on the nature of the allegations and lack of supporting evidence, management decided to err on the side of safety and reassigned complainant in order to protect her. Additionally, management noted that in her formal complaint, one of the requested remedies was to be reassigned from the Newark Area and placed away from the work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harassment of an employee that would not occur but for the employee's race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, or religion is unlawful, if it is sufficiently patterned or pervasive. <span class="Italic">Wibstad v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972699 (August 14, 1998) <span class="Italic">(citing McKinney v. Dole,</span> 765 F.2d 1129, 1138-39 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). It is also well-settled that harassment based on an individual's prior EEO activity is actionable.<span class="Italic"> Roberts v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970727 (September 15, 2000). A single incident or group of isolated incidents will not be regarded as discriminatory harassment unless the conduct is severe. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co.</span>, 684 F.2d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir. 1982). Whether the harassment is sufficiently severe to trigger a violation of Title VII must be determined by looking at all of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993); <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 8, 1994) at 3, 6. Harassment is actionable only if the harassment to which the complainant has been subjected was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the complainant's employment. <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970077 (March 13, 1997). The harassers' conduct should be evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc.,</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 8, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that harassment based on an individual's sex is actionable. <span class="Italic">See Meritor Savings Bank FSB v. Vinson,</span> 477 U.S. 57 (1986). In order to establish a claim of harassment under this basis, the complainant must show that: (a) she belongs to the statutorily protected class; (b) she was subjected to unwelcome conduct related to her membership in that class; (c) the harassment complained of was based on sex; (d) the harassment had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with her work performance and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (e) there is a basis for imputing liability to the employer.<span class="Italic"> See Henson v. City of Dundee,</span> 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant established that she was subjected to sex-based harassment. Complainant has established elements (a), (b) and (c) of her sexual harassment claim. Turning to the question of whether the alleged harassing incidents were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment, we find that the note mailed to complainant in issue (3) was sufficiently severe to render complainant's work environment hostile. In so finding, we note that the contents of the letter were derogatory and specifically related to complainant's sex. Additionally, the note was threatening and made reference to the incident in issue (1), which complainant viewed as a threat to her life. With regard to the remaining issues, including her claim of retaliatory harassment, we decline to address whether complainant was subjected to harassment because even if proven, complainant would not be entitled to further relief given our finding that she was subjected to sex harassment in issue (3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now consider whether the agency is liable for the sex-based harassment suffered by complainant. Regardless of whether a supervisor or co-worker harassed complainant, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that at a minimum it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. In the instant case, complainant received the letter at issue on January 23, 2001. On that same day, the Air Traffic Manager requested an investigation into the threatening letter. A Federal Aviation Administration Special Agent commenced the investigation on January 26, 2001. The Special Agent interviewed complainant and her husband, as well as her co-workers suspected by complainant to be the author(s) of the letter. The United States Secret Service agreed to take handwriting samples for analysis. Ultimately, the investigation was inconclusive as to who was the author of the threatening letter. Soon thereafter, the agency reassigned complainant from the Newark sector to the Kennedy sector at the New York TRANCON. We find that the agency failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it took appropriate corrective action. In so finding, we note that the agency failed to proffer evidence that it took any corrective steps beyond conducting the inconclusive investigation and reassigning complainant, given the severity of the harassment. Generally, sufficient corrective action includes discipline, posting notices, providing relevant training, taking proactive measures to prevent future incidents of harassment, and reminding employees of their obligations under the laws regarding discrimination. Further, we note that even though the agency conducted an investigation regarding the jet plane incident, two years later, complainant received the threatening note referencing the incident. This indicates that the agency's attempts to ameliorate the situation at the facility were not sufficient. Additionally, we remind the agency that generally, it is error to reassign the victim of harassment rather than the perpetrators of the harassment. However, here, we find that complainant requested a reassignment as a possible remedy to the harassment in her formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Negron-Oliver v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a35351.txt">01A35351</a> (2005), the Commission found that the temporary removal from a work team of an employee who complained of harassment was a form a retaliation. In <span class="Italic">Negron-Oliver</span>, the agency argued that it had temporarily removed both the complainant and the alleged protagonist from the team pending the outcome of an investigation into the allegations. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Negron-Oliver</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency further asserts that it articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for complainant's temporary removal from the SORT team. We disagree. The record reflects that complainant and Cl were removed from the SORT team pending the investigation of complainant's sexual harassment claim. The record contains an affidavit from the captain at the medium level security facility (Ml). Ml states that the SORT team was under his control. While Ml states that "complainant was not removed because of her reporting [the alleged sexual harassment]," Ml further asserts that "[n] either one of the individuals were allowed to participate [in the SORT team]. Even if one wasn't going to be there, the other one wasn't. We couldn't say, 'Well this person made an allegation so they get to come to training and the other one doesn't.' There was no finding at that point...we didn't know. So it was prudent to remove both of them during the time of the investigation and that's exactly what happened."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also contains an affidavit from a lieutenant who served as the SORT Team Leader (LI). In his affidavit, he states that he approached Ml about how to handle SORT team training, because both complainant and Cl were on the team. LI further states that "[Ml] said they would both be on administrative absence from the SORT team until the investigation was completed."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for temporarily removing complainant from the SORT team. The Commission has stated that an employer may need to take intermediate action pending the investigation of a claim, such as transferring the alleged harasser, to ensure further harassment does not occur; however, the Commission has further stated that the complainant should not be involuntarily transferred or otherwise burdened, because such measures could constitute unlawful retaliation.<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> at 21-22. (June 18, 1999). Based on these circumstances, we reverse the agency's final order finding no retaliation pertaining to claim (3) and find that the agency engaged in unlawful retaliation when it temporarily removed complainant from the SORT team.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Montoya v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120062795 (2008), the Commission relied upon the fact that the agency had no power to prevent the reassignment of an Army officer who had allegedly sexually harassed the complainant in the past. The Commission found that the Defense Threat Reduction Agency had no authority over the reassignment, even though it had made efforts to prevent or delay the reassignment. Of course, one distinction between <span class="Italic">Pierson</span> and <span class="Italic">Montoya</span> is that <span class="Italic">Pierson</span> did not require the cooperation of another agency, but simply the approval of a high-level official at the employing agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the victim so requests, the Commission can order her transfer as part of the remedy for sexual harassment. But the complainant may not seek an out-of-state transfer. In <span class="Italic">Hilsman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01975763 (1999), the Commission noted the proper parameters of a transfer order. The same parameters also apply to an agency granting a transfer at the employee's request. In <span class="Italic">Hilsman</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission concludes that the agency's interpretation of the AJ's reassignment order to mean a reassignment to a facility within the Capital District is consistent with prior Commission precedent and with the principles of make-whole relief under Title VII. We note that while the Commission has previously ruled that the victim of harassment should not be required to take an involuntary transfer or reassignment, <span class="Italic">see Taylor v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992), the Commission has upheld the reassignment of a victim of harassment where the victim agreed to the reassignment<span class="Italic">. See Hodge v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04910007 (January 21, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_885"></span>However, an agency is not required to grant a victim of harassment reassignment to another state, in order to constitute full relief, so long as the reassignment is voluntary, that it is to a "substantially equivalent" position, and that it is to a location and position which minimizes the chance the alleged discrimination or harassment would reoccur<span class="Italic">. See Kelly v. Veterans Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922085 (September 2, 1992) (a request to transfer to a facility out of state by a victim of harassment need not be honored to constitute full relief); <span class="Italic">see also Hodge v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04910007 (January 21, 1992) (agency is not obligated to transfer complainant to facility of her choice, i.e., to be with her spouse, when the agency satisfied the make-whole requirements of Title VII by placing complainant in a facility different from where the harasser was stationed).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that one of the remedies appellant sought in his formal complaints was a reassignment to Orlando, Florida. The Commission also notes, however, that the agency is not required to reassign appellant to another state so long as the offer of reassignment meets the three (3) requirements set forth in <span class="Italic">Kelley</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore agree with the agency's position that a reassignment in this context requires only that the agency offer appellant a reassignment to a facility within the Capital District. Because of the obvious confusion resulting from the language set forth in item (3) of the FAD, we will order on remand that the agency provide appellant a new thirty day time period for appellant to renew his request for a reassignment to a facility within the area identified by the agency as the Capital District. The agency shall bear the costs, if any, associated with reassigning appellant to another facility within the Capital District. The Commission also reminds the agency that future orders which include reassignments or transfers should specify relevant details such as limitations on the potential geographic scope of a reassignment, and which party may bear the cost of the reassignment, so as to avoid any confusion or misinterpretation of the kind experienced here.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Redman v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120092733 (2011) (noting that all actions taken by the agency, including moving the complainant's work station and detailing the complainant, were at her request).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the alleged victim of harassment does request reassignment, the agency is not necessarily bound to meet all the conditions of that request. In <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01922085 (1992), the complainant requested a transfer out of state. The Commission noted that "[a]n offer to reassign need not provide such a transfer to constitute full relief, so long as the reassignment is a voluntary one, is to a 'substantially equivalent' position, and is to a location or position that minimizes any chance of recurrence of the alleged discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
