<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-57"><span class="space">2.</span> Bad Faith Execution</h4>
<p class="noindent">Bad faith in the execution of an agreement once it has been signed can be a basis for rescinding the agreement and reinstating the complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Trayham v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120131878 (2013), the complainant negotiated an agreement that required her to be placed in a position with promotion potential. The agency did place her in such a position, but a manager involved in the complaint "told her 'let me make this clear, I have no intention of promoting you' and when reminded about the Agreement, said 'that's out the window.'" The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Trayham</span>, found that the agency breached the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, while the Agency placed Complainant in a position that appeared to have promotion potential on paper, the record shows that MO chose to arbitrarily negate that promotion potential in practice. We note that the Agency has not denied that MO acted as Complainant describes. Nor does the record show that MO was questioned by the Agency and explained that the reason he denied a promotion was because he felt Complainant was not qualified for a promotion, her work product did not justify a promotion, there were no promotional vacancies available, or any other explanation showing that he was acting in good faith. Instead, MO sought to knowingly negate the Agreement, saying "that's out the window" in reference to the Agreement. Complainant has submitted evidence showing that on or about August 2. 2012 she was given a cash award, along with others, in recognition of "the individual dedication and group effort of each employee...[whose] accomplishments clearly meet and exceed the criteria for the above award amounts," indicating that Complainant's performance was not a reason for the denial of promotion. We note that Complainant has specifically stated on appeal that she recognizes that the Agreement made no guarantee she would be promoted, but that the nature of her breach allegation is that MO negated the promotion potential she had bargained for. By negating the promotion potential Complainant bargained for when she entered into the Agreement, we find the Agency breached said Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission did note that the complainant would have the option of having her complaint reinstated as she requested by returning the benefits of the settlement or having the agreement enforced by directing the management official to provide her with good faith consideration for promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding bad faith in the execution of agreement in <span class="Italic">Thomasina K. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120143051 (2015), the Commission ordered enforcement of the agreement and warned the agency that its actions could be construed as reprisal. In <span class="Italic">Thomasina K</span>., the agency attempted to repudiate the agreement after it was signed, then rescinded the promotion promised in the agreement while the matter was pending at OFO. It then issued a debt letter to the complainant seeking reimbursement for the time she was promoted. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Thomasina K</span>., found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In turning to the allegation of breach, we shall first examine the timing of events surrounding the settlement agreement. On June 22, 2012, the parties executed the settlement agreement, though the Agency soon disputed the validity of the agreement. As noted above, Complainant agreed to withdraw her EEO complaint in exchange for an increase to GS-11, Step 8. Less than one month later, on July 13, 2012, Complainant was notified that she failed to satisfactorily complete the supervisory probationary period. Consequently, she was demoted from her Supervisory Program Specialist position to that of Financial Management Specialist, GS-9, Step 8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even after the settlement agreement was found to be valid, and the Agency ordered to specifically perform, Complainant had to seek the assistance of an EEOC Compliance Officer in to obtain compliance. Commission records indicate that in September 2013, Complainant asserted that the Agency had not taken the actions ordered. In correspondence dated December 5, 2013, the Agency acknowledged that it was late in submitting a compliance report, but proffered a notification of personnel action, effective July 15, 2012, confirming that Complainant was given an increase to GS-11, 8. However, in the same letter, the Agency's General Counsel also noted that Complainant "claims that she 'is still working in the position of Financial Specialist, GS-9.' However, she does not explain this claim and the Agency does not understand why she makes this claim."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the instant record reflects bad faith on the part of the Agency. The Agency entered into a settlement agreement with Complainant on June 22, 2012, but immediately after, tried to argue that no agreement was reached. Only three weeks after the agreement was signed raising Complainant to a GS-11, step 8, the Agency demoted Complainant to a GS-9. This action was implemented even while the validity of the agreement was pending before the Commission. Following the Commission's determination that the agreement was valid and order to the Agency to specifically perform, the Agency continued to delay. Soon after providing the Commission with evidence of the promotion to GS-11, Step 8, and closure of the compliance file, the Agency then attempted to undo its action by seeking to have Complainant return the funds paid out to her under the promotion. It appears that the Agency is trying to undo an agreement that the Commission has previously found to be valid, and skirt around our previous order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find several of the Agency's actions disconcerting. We note in particular, the Agency's decision to demote Complainant less than one month after executing the settlement agreement and its issuance of the debt letter following its late compliance with the Commission's previous order. The Agency is reminded that EEOC regulations prohibit reprisal for prior protected EEO activity. Further, adverse actions brought under the basis of reprisal need not qualify as "ultimate employment actions" or materially affect the terms and conditions of employment to constitute retaliation. <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05980410 (Nov. 4, 1999) <span class="Italic">citing</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998)). Instead, the statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based upon a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the Agency is in breach of provision (2)(b). The Agency erred in finding that Complainant's pay at the GS-11, Step 8 rate was an administrative error for which Complainant was required to repay. Such payment was in compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement and not an overpayment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found bad faith both in the execution as well as the negotiation of a settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0520140248 (2015). The case has a complicated history because it involves two complaints, two separate settlement agreements, two EEOC decisions finding no breach and a decision by the Commission to reopen and rescind its previous decisions. But the salient facts are that the complainant suffered from Turner Syndrome, a chromosomal condition that affects females. The complainant was four feet, four inches tall, had one arm that was not straight, and experienced joint pain and fatigue. She could not reach higher than five feet and had difficulty with routine tasks, such as grocery shopping and getting mail from her mailbox.</p>
<p class="noindent">She entered into an agreement with the agency that required it to provide her with a clerk job as the commissary at Miramar Marine Corp Air Station in San Diego. The complainant alleged that the agency breached the agreement <span id="Page_382"></span>by assigning her duties outside of her restrictions. After initially finding no breach, in reopening the case, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Settlement agreements in the EEO process are binding contracts; as such, ordinary contract principles are to be applied when deciding issues of breach. <span class="Italic">See Herrington v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Request No. 05960032 (Dec. 9, 1996). Every contract imposes on the signatories an implicit duty of "good faith and fair dealing in performance and enforcement." <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 205. This tenet is premised on the "assumption" that parties to a contract will deal fairly with each other "without breaking their word, using shifty means to avoid obligations, or denying what the other party obviously understood."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is clear that, early on in Complainant's Imperial Beach employment, she was placed in a Store Associate position and given assignments such as filing, signage printing, and the like, while awaiting placement in a Clerk position. According to Complainant, she was able to satisfactorily perform these assignments without any concerns, because they were essentially "clerical" in nature. After about three months, however, her circumstances at Imperial Beach changed materially when the Agency began assigning her "price tagging" duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Price-tagging duties entail walking throughout the Commissary building, identifying and scanning each item of shelved merchandise requiring a price tag (or price change); then, walking to a separate location to print the price tag(s); and walking back to the shelved merchandise to affix it. The duties require extensive bending, stretching, twisting and reaching; all movements that presented a major challenge for someone of Complainant's physical dimensions and related limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was willing to perform price-tagging temporarily; however, in or around November 2010, she made it clear to her superiors that, given her stature and other limitations, it would be "impossible" to perform those duties permanently. It was only after being advised of Complainant's price-tagging difficulties that the Agency began to take steps to implement the First Settlement Agreement's requirement to place Complainant in a Clerk position. Because no Clerk position had ever existed at Imperial Beach (a fact obviously known to the Agency when the Agreement was negotiated), the Agency undertook to design one, purportedly with Complainant's unique circumstances in mind. The record is notably devoid of any suggestion that the Agency sought Complainant's input in designing her Clerk position, although it was obvious that she likely would need a reasonable accommodation to perform any job with physical demands.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In or around March 2011, almost seven months after the "placement" deadline, the Agency presented Complainant a Clerk position description (PD) that prominently listed price-tagging as a required duty. The PD also described aspects of the position deemed "significant," such as 'lifting, pushing, carrying, handling of store products" and "<span class="Italic">prolonged</span> standing, stooping, kneeling, bending and climbing." Clerk Position Description, ROI, p. 33 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the physically-demanding nature of the newly created position, it is no wonder that "sedentary" duties eventually became a topic of discussion between Complainant and her superiors. Obviously, from Complainant's perspective, it was relevant to her need for a reasonable accommodation. However, the Agency found the topic useful for purposes of undermining Complainant's First Appeal. It accomplished this by successfully arguing that Complainant's breach allegations must be dismissed because they involved matters nowhere mentioned in the First Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record is replete with evidence indicating the Agency's bad faith in carrying out its promise to place Complainant in a Clerk position; arguably, none more disturbing to this Commission than the sworn statement of one Agency official who attested to his understanding that price-tagging became an "essential function" of the specially-created Clerk position precisely because of Complainant's medical limitations. Affidavit of Assistant Grocery Store Manager, Second Appeal, ROI, p. 279.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The finding of no breach in the First Appeal was clearly erroneous as a matter of law. The Agency unquestionably violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing and the Commission now so finds.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Crystal T. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2021000314 (2021), found bad faith where the agency agreed to reinstate the complainant only to terminate her two weeks later. In dismissing the complainant's enforcement claim, the agency reasoned as follows:</p> 
<p class="noindent-1">In its FAD, the Agency acknowledged that the Agreement contained three provisions obligating the Agency to perform: 1) to reinstate Complainant, 2) to correct the proficiency report and 3) to rescind the termination notice dated February 13, 2020. The Agency conceded that "[a]fter the Agreement was signed, neither party took any action with respect to their obligations under the Agreement." The Agency reasoned that the record shows Complainant was still an Agency employee at the time the settlement agreement was executed. The Agency determined "because Complainant had not been terminated prior to the execution of the Agreement, the Agency's promise to reinstate Complainant is void for lack of consideration." The Agency also stated there is no evidence that Complainant's proficiency report was corrected and no evidence the termination decision, dated February 13, 2020, was rescinded. The Agency stated, "notwithstanding the Agency's failure to provide evidence of compliance, the Agency noted Complainant "never withdrew her EEO complaint as required by provision 1a." The Agency reasoned that Complainant's consideration was the withdrawal of all pending informal and formal complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding the agreement valid and binding, the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the contract was void for lack of consideration in <span class="Italic">Crystal T</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency attempts to argue that there was a lack of consideration because Complainant was still technically employed at the time the agreement was made due to the OSC stay order, there is no doubt that the Agency was fully aware of Complainant's employment status at the time it executed the Agreement and agreed to rescind the termination notice and maintain Complainant's employment as a registered nurse. Clearly, Complainant viewed the Agreement as providing her with a substantial benefit, including the rescission of the termination notice. In sum, we find the terms of the Agreement provided adequate consideration to both parties and should be considered as valid and binding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agreement required the Agency to rescind the February 13, 2020 termination notice, "reinstate" Complainant, and correct the proficiency report to reflect a satisfactory rating. The record shows that Complainant did not receive the benefit of any of these provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency acknowledges that it did not rescind the termination notice. However, the fact that Complainant remained an employee at the time of the signing of the Agreement did not change the Agency's obligation to rescind the February 2020 termination notice. Significantly, the Agency used that very termination notice as the basis for actually terminating Complainant in July 2020, approximately two weeks after entering into the settlement agreement with her. Clearly, the Agreement was premised on Complainant's continuing employment. The decision to terminate Complainant indicates bad faith on the part of the Agency. In addition, it is undisputed that the Agency did not meet its obligation to correct the Proficiency Report, consistent with the intent of the Agreement. We therefore conclude that the Agency breached it obligations under the Agreement. Moreover, based on the Agency's failure to rescind the notice of termination, we conclude that Complainant's subsequent actual termination that was based on this notice must also be rescinded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it was not obligated to comply with the Agreement because Complainant did not withdraw her underlying EEO complaint. However, we agree with Complainant's argument that the Agreement did not require Complainant to take any additional steps to withdraw her complaint. Rather the Agreement states that "Complainant hereby voluntarily withdraws any and all pending informal and formal EEO complaints...any complaints before the Office of Special Counsel..." [emphasis added]. We conclude that Complainant's signature on the Agreement was sufficient to constitute a withdrawal of her EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within sixty (60) calendar days of the date this decision is issued:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The Agency shall fully comply with the terms of the July 17, 2020 settlement agreement, including rescinding the February 2020 notice of removal and correcting the proficiency report as required by the Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Complainant shall be retroactively reinstated to Agency employment to the position she occupied when she was terminated in July/August 2020 as a direct result of the Agency's failure to comply with the terms of the Agreement, or to a substantially equivalent position, with back pay from the date of her termination until the date of her reinstatement or her decision to decline an offer of reinstatement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is further directed to submit a report of compliance in digital format as provided in the statement entitled "Implementation of the Commission's Decision." The report shall be submitted via the Federal Sector EEO Portal (FedSEP). <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.403(g). Further, the report must include supporting documentation of the Agency's calculation of back pay, if any, and other benefits due Complainant, including evidence that the corrective action has been implemented.</p>
