<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-29"><span class="space">B.</span> UNWELCOME ADVANCES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The seminal case on the nature of the advances that sustain a claim of hostile environment harassment under Title VII is <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986). In <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, the Court explained a distinction between whether conduct was voluntary on the part of the employee and whether it was unwelcome:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he District Court's conclusion that no actionable harassment occurred might have rested on its earlier "finding" that "[i]f [respondent] and Taylor did engage in an intimate or sexual relationship..., that relationship was a voluntary one." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 14,692, 23 FEP Cases, at 42. But the fact that sex-related conduct was "voluntary," in the sense that the complainant was not forced to participate against her will, is not a defense to a sexual harassment suit brought against Title VII. The gravamen of any sexual harassment claim is that the alleged sexual advances were "unwelcome." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a) (1985). While the question whether particular conduct was indeed unwelcome presents difficult problems of proof and runs largely on credibility determinations committed to the trier of fact, the District Court in this case erroneously focused on the "voluntariness" of respondent's participation in the claimed sexual episodes. The correct inquiry is whether respondent by her conduct indicated that the alleged sexual advances were unwelcome, not whether her actual participation in sexual intercourse was voluntary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner contends that even if this case must be remanded to the District Court, the Court of Appeals erred in one of the terms of its remand. Specifically, the Court of Appeals stated that testimony about respondent's "dress and personal fantasies," 243 U.S. App. D.C., at 328, n.36, 753 F.2d, at 146, n.36, which the District Court apparently admitted into evidence, "had no place in this litigation." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. The apparent ground for this conclusion was that respondent's voluntariness <span class="Italic">vel non</span> in submitting to Taylor's advances was immaterial to her sexual harassment claim. While "voluntariness" in the sense of consent is not a defense to such a claim, it does not follow that a complainant's sexually provocative speech or dress is irrelevant as a matter of law in determining whether <span id="Page_826"></span>he or she found particular sexual advances unwelcome. To the contrary, such evidence is obviously relevant. The EEOC Guidelines emphasize that the trier of fact must determine the existence of sexual harassment in light of "the record as a whole" and "the totality of circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b) (1985). Respondent's claim that any marGINAl relevance of the evidence in question was outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice is the sort of argument properly addressed to the District Court. In this case the District Court concluded that the evidence should be admitted, and the Court of Appeals' contrary conclusion was based upon the erroneous, categorical view that testimony about provocative dress and publicly expressed sexual fantasies "had no place in this litigation." 243 U.S. App. D.C., at 328, n.36, 753 F.2d, at 146, n.36. While the District Court must carefully weigh the applicable considerations in deciding whether to admit evidence of this kind, there is no <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> rule against its admissibility.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also adheres to the view that the conduct of which the employee complains must be unwelcome. Mere submission to the advances does not mean the conduct is welcome. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Crane v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924585 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ppellant must show that the conduct complained of was unwelcome. Sexual conduct is unwelcome when it is not solicited or incited by the person to whom it is directed, and when that person regards the conduct as undesirable or offensive. <span class="Italic">Henson</span>, 682 F.2d at 903. The Commission finds that appellant considered the advances of Supervisor 1 unwelcome. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Supervisor 1's conduct was solicited or incited by appellant. Appellant's testimony in this regard is supported by the fact that she was observed crying in his presence by a fellow employee, and that she complained to the SPO in March of 1989. Although the SPO attempted to assert that appellant did not characterize her complaints about the actions of Supervisor 1 as sexual, Supervisor 1 contradicted this testimony when he stated that he was told by the SPO that appellant had charged him with sexual harassment. The Commission finds that the record as a whole supports appellant's assertion that the actions of Supervisor 1 were unwelcome.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has ruled that when initial sexual advances are not discouraged, continuing sexual advances are not necessarily welcome. <span class="Italic">See Lichtenberger v. Department of Treasury</span>, 01832072 (1986). In that case, the employee and her supervisor spent an evening at several bars and were observed kissing at one of the bars. The pair subsequently returned to the office where the supervisor made further sexual advances. The supervisor stopped his advances when so requested. In making its ruling, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lichtenberger</span> also noted that sexual banter was commonplace in the office and that appellant frequently engaged in such banter:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the Commission's position that active participation in sexual conduct in the workplace indicates that the activity is not unwelcome and that, having participated, simply ceasing to participate is insufficient to show that the continuing activity is unwelcome. Where an appellant at one time participated in activity of a sexual nature, the Commission will find that the activity was not unwelcome thereafter unless the appellant clearly indicated to the alleged harasser that the sexual conduct was unwelcome....</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hadley v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120113029.txt">0120113029</a> (2011), the Commission rejected the agency's arguments that the supervisor's conduct in asking a subordinate out on dates was not unwelcome explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant is female and therefore meets prong (1) of the above-mentioned test. Complainant maintains that in March 2009, S1 asked her out on a date and on several occasions thereafter repeatedly inquired why she would not see him. Complainant also presented a copy of an email from S1 dated November 19, 2009 wherein he states "Let me take you out for your birthday today at 11 am." The Agency contends that Complainant fails to show that the alleged behavior was unwelcome. Specifically in reference to a log Complainant provided detailing the conversations between herself and S1, the Agency found that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The information submitted by the Complainant is void of any statements which indicated the verbal comments were unwelcome. At no time, even when [S1] asked if he overstepped, did she tell [S1] she was not comfortable with his comments, nor did she tell [S1] that she did not want to continue the conversation. Complainant also stated "she didn't feel as if she couldn't say no to him," Furthermore, when [S1] asked Complainant not to mention his request to [S2], she agreed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency's arguments in this regard to be unpersuasive. The challenged conduct must be unwelcome in the sense that the employee did not solicit or incite it, and in the sense that the employee regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, No. N-915-050, at Guidance, &#x00A7; A. (Mar. 19, 1990) (Policy Guidance). As Complainant states in her Formal Complaint, "I did not want to hurt his feelings because he was my boss," but we note that, according to her log, after S1 first asked if she would take him out, Complainant at first declined to provide a definitive answer, only doing so a few days later after being pressed by S1. On that occasion, she told him that she:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">had thought about it and decided that I did not want to take him out. I told him that I had run into a specific co-worker on more than one occasion outside of work and I would hate for that to happen if I was out with him. He asked if I had run into the specific co-worker around the areas where I usually go out. I said "no" but I would not want to run into anyone outside of work and be in [Sl's] presence. I told him that I do not want my character called into question regarding work or anything else...., [A] few minutes later, he asked "but it's not that you didn't want to go out with me? You would have been okay to go out with me?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's log shows that in the following days, S1 continued to probe her responses, including asking how being seen out with him would impugn her character, asking whether or not she would have dated him if they did not work together, and trying to poke holes in or find ways to get around the reasons she gave for not wanting to go out with him. In addition, the log shows that S1 asked Complainant not to tell S2 about their conversation. Furthermore, in her Formal Complaint, Complainant states "About week after the initial conversation, I informed [S2] of the conversations, as I was feeling very uneasy." Finally, we note that S1 admits that "I later thought about what I said and realized it could be misunderstood so I went back to [Complainant] and explained. I apologized to her and said I should have not made the comment." Such evidence shows not only that S1's repeated actions were unwelcome, but that S1 knew that they were unwelcome.</p>
<p class="noindent">In evaluating whether sexual advances are unwelcome, it is relevant whether the complainant has engaged in sexually provocative conduct, or has dressed in a sexually provocative manner. <span class="Italic">See Tedeschi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01871031 (1988). However, in <span class="Italic">Tedeschi</span>, the Commission did reprimand the investigator for the accusatory manner in which the complainant was questioned regarding her dress and conduct. The Commission noted that "common decency dictates that complainants alleging sexual harassment are to be questioned during investigation of the charge in a manner which takes into account his or her unsettled emotional state." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Whether the complainant has made a contemporaneous complaint about the conduct is another factor the Commission considers in determining if conduct is unwelcome. For example, in <span class="Italic">Claudio v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120100687 (2012), the Commission determined that a coworker's practice of sending the complainant personal emails was not unwelcome explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the challenged conduct must be unwelcome in the sense that the employee did not solicit or incite it, and in the sense that the employee regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, No. N-915-050, at Guidance, &#x00A7; A. (Mar. 19, 1990) (Policy Guidance). When there is some indication of welcomeness or when the credibility of the parties is at issue, the charging party's claim will be considerably strengthened if he made a contemporaneous complaint or protest. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> There is no evidence in the record indicating that Complainant ever requested that CW1 stop sending him personal emails nor is there any indication that Complainant complained to anyone about CW1's emails.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant engages in some banter with coworkers of a sexual nature does not mean that she invites all types of comments of a sexual nature. Sexual remarks can still be unwelcome when the nature of the remarks is at a level far more personal than the general banter of the workplace. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McGinnis v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01902760 (1990) (offending management official specifically inquired about complainant's sex life with her husband, about whether their dog watched while complainant and her husband had sex, and made repeated comments about complainant's manner of dress). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Skinner v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01985850 (1999), the complainant engaged in sexual joking and giving the supervisor a cake with a topless figure. However, this did not mean she welcomed supervisor's conduct of "tongue gestures simulating oral sex, graphic sexual discussions of his sex life, sexual positions, jokes, repeated telephone calls with heavy breathing, and the snapping of appellant's bra on one occasion." <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kusen v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01955999 (1998) ("appellant was a willing participant in, and frequently initiated, off-color banter and sexual jokes" and, thus, the conduct was not unwelcome).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. General Services Administration</span>, 01A10206 (2002), the Commission found that the complainant's behavior in contributing to the sexually-charged environment demonstrated the conduct of her supervisor and coworkers was not unwelcome. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD found that complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment creating a hostile environment. The Commission agrees and references the Manager's Memorandum of Suspension; that S1 admitted that he asked complainant, in front of co-workers, to have sex with him; that he pretended to unzip his pants in the office; that he told sexually explicit jokes in the office, and sends them to others through the e-mail; and that he regularly engaged in sexual banter with co-workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_827"></span>However, S1 was not alone in creating a sexual environment. The affidavits filed by members of the staff showed that sexual jokes were told in the office by others; that some jokes referred to private parts; staff used curse words; staff talked in the office a lot about sex; that breasts were talked about; and that comments such as "the best thing for depression is a good f-k," was "casual conversation" in the office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the record shows that complainant brought pornographic films to the office, described the films graphically, described a particular star, and allowed others in the office to borrow the tapes; that she brought a photograph taken at a party at her house which showed a man with an exposed penis, and a female co-worker posed near the man; complainant would use several curse words in a row; she would regularly use words like c--k s----r, s--t, "tough t-tt-s," and f--k; complainant referred to S1 as "Daddy"; that complainant talked about sexual things more so than others; complainant would put an object described as a pacifier and shaped like a penis in her mouth; and that complainant joined in sexual joking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sexual activity will not constitute harassment unless it is unwelcome. Thus, where a complainant actively participated in the activities about which she later complained, hostile work environment will not properly be found<span class="Italic">. See Mannweiler v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933266 (July 15, 1994); <span class="Italic">Aidelman v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01932532 (May 26, 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Weinheimer v. Rockwell Int'l Corp.,</span> 54 FEP Cases 828 (M.D. Fla. 1990)). Evidence of the general work atmosphere, involving employees other than the complainant, is also relevant to the issue of whether there existed a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII<span class="Italic">. Delgado v. Lehman,</span> 665 F. Supp. 460, 468 (E.D. Va. 1987). Complainant actively participated in and encouraged the hostile environment. One co-worker was surprised to hear that complainant was offended by anything sexual. Another co-worker felt emphatically that complainant was not offended by any behavior in the office. We find that complainant participated in creating a hostile work environment, and that sexual conduct in the office was not unwelcomed to complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that the complainant socializes with the alleged harasser does not mean that sexual conduct is welcome. But if it is clear that the relationship is more than merely casual in nature, this weighs into the Commission's determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 01991021 (2000). The <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> case involved a male employee and his third-level supervisor, also a male. The complainant alleged the supervisor called him into his office, verbally abused him, told him he looked sexy and touched his buttock. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> found that the conduct was not unwelcome where, among other things, the complainant accepted a loan of large sums of money from the alleged harasser and had him over to his house for massages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the evidence of record, the Commission finds that complainant has failed to meet his burden of proving that S3's alleged conduct was unwelcome. The record indicates that complainant and S3 were friends at the agency and that S3 helped complainant obtain his position at the RTC. Complainant stated that S3 had lent him large sums of money so that he could pay off personal debts and that on several occasions, he willingly went to S3's home for dinner and massage and socialized with S3 and other friends. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the issue of whether conduct was welcome or unwelcome "presents difficult problems of proof and fact." <span class="Italic">See Meritor Savings Bank FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 68 (1986). In determining whether sexual conduct is unwelcome, the Commission considers whether the complaining party participated in or condoned the conduct; participation in the conduct or failure to object to it may suggest that the conduct was not unwelcome<span class="Italic">. See EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment</span>, Notice N-915-050 (March 19, 1990). Although complainant contends that since 1991, S3 made sexual advances to him both in the workplace and at complainant's home, the record indicates that complainant was a willing participant. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant's claim of sexual harassment in violation of Title VII fails<span class="Italic">. See Kusen v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal 01955999 (January 5, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> did not specify the nature of the alleged sexual advances other than the one incident in the supervisor's office, described above. If the scenario in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> involved sexual advances that were particularly egregious and the complainant was a female, it would be questionable whether the complainant's friendship with the supervisor, however close, "invited" such advances.</p>
<p class="noindent">The evidence did not support a finding of unwelcome conduct in <span class="Italic">Sheryl S. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span> 2021000167 (2021), where the complainant and alleged harasser engaged in years of "mutual exchanges" involving sexual content. Also weighing into the Commission's decision was that the complainant never reported to the alleged harasser:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that the West Team Agent Supervisor engaged in sexual behavior involving Complainant, a female. However, in the discussion which follows, we determine that the record does not support a determination that the conduct in question was unwelcome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Over multiple years, the WRO had gathered employees together for infrequent off-site meetings as well as for yearly meetings. It was at these meetings, that Complainant and the West Team Agent Supervisor began an unprofessional personal relationship that included sexual intercourse. The record showed Complainant sometimes welcomed this attention from the West Team Agent Supervisor. Although one witness's observations suggested Complainant sometimes declined the West Team Agent Supervisor's advances, their overall mutual exchanges of emails and text messages demonstrated that Complainant expressed desire to maintain a personal off-duty relationship. For example, in at least one instance, Complainant sent the West Team Agent Supervisor topless and smiling "selfies." In turn, Complainant received both nude and clothed selfies from the West Team Agent Supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, Complainant's email messages encouraged the West Team Agent Supervisor to spend more time with her. In a string of emails that cover both work and personal matters, Complainant and the West Team Agent Supervisor discussed spending time together. For example, in her email dated March 14, 2013, Complainant complained to the West Team Agent Supervisor:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Blah blah blah. Who chooses to go on vacation numerous times of the year with him and not with me?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I am so sticking my tongue out at you right now.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Then in May 9, 2013, Complainant asked the West Team Agent Supervisor:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">What stuff do you need to get done before you can meet me?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Later in August 2015, Complainant and the West Team Agent Supervisor arranged to rendezvous during her work-related travel through Denver. After agreeing that the West Team Agent Supervisor would pick her up at the airport to take her to her hotel, Complainant described how she would keep their encounter secret:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I'll say I caught the shuttle from the hotel if I am questioned.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">See you in a few hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we cannot find that Complainant's interactions with West Team Agent Supervisor unreasonably interfered with her work. He was not her supervisor of record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the record shows that he sometimes served as the acting Regional Director, he was not regularly in Complainant's chain-of-command. The record confirms that the West Team Agent Supervisor served as Regional Director only in a sporadic acting capacity throughout approximately a decade. Nothing in the record indicates that the West Team Agent Supervisor took any adverse personnel action against Complainant and she did not allege so in her complaint. In fact, the West Team Agent Supervisor generally worked at the WRO in Colorado while Complainant worked of her home in Texas as Resident Agent for that state.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, Complainant and the West Team Agent Supervisor exchanged personal messages and sexual images throughout the same time period that Complainant has now accused the West Team Agent Supervisor of sexually harassing her. Accordingly, we find the Agency appropriately determined that, taken together, the evidence was at best, conflicting, and therefore insufficient to prove the Agency liable for subjecting Complainant to sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">Roy F. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120150415 (Apr. 27, 2017) (affirming an AJ's finding no sexual harassment where evidence showed that a complainant had voluntarily continued a consensual sexual relationship with his supervisor).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bobbett v. Attorney General</span>, 07A00013 (2002) (finding the conduct was not unwelcome where the complainant engaged in sexual banter in the workplace and also delayed for seven months in reporting the conduct she allegedly found offensive).</p>
<p class="noindent">Among the factors that the Commission looks at in evaluating whether conduct is unwelcome is the complainant's reaction to the conduct at the time it occurs. This includes the observations of others as to the complainant's reaction. For example, in <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24022 (2003), the Commission found the complainant had not established that the conduct was unwelcome:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleges that the postmaster hugged her in an offensive manner. The postmaster testified that he often hugged complainant and co-workers in a non-romantic way, but never hugged complainant in a sexually suggestive manner. Co-workers testified that physical, nonsexual affection was commonplace in the office, and stated that complainant and the supervisor sometimes hugged in a non-romantic way. Further, male as well as female co-workers stated that they often expressed platonic physical and verbal affection toward the postmaster. We note that none of the co-workers that testified recalled complainant making any type of objection about the postmaster's behavior before initiating the instant EEO complaint. Instead, co-workers testified that complainant often partook in copious joking with the supervisor and other employees. We also note that the evidence establishes that well after the alleged harassing events began, complainant visited the <span id="Page_828"></span>postmaster's home and sent him a personal birthday greeting. As such, we find that there is a paucity of evidence in the record establishing that complainant communicated any displeasure or even discomfort with the postmaster and co-workers' conduct before initiating EEO counseling. We note that complainant asserted that she expressed her disgust with the jokes, romantic affair, and hugging to other employees, but these witnesses did not testify on complainant's behalf and therefore cannot be considered as corroborating evidence that complainant or others found the alleged conduct unwelcome. Consequently, we find that complainant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the postmaster's conduct was unwelcome.</p>
<p class="noindent">Tolerating some physical contact by one coworker is not an invitation for another coworker to engage in offensive personal touching. Nor does engaging in some sexual joking with the offender invite unwanted contact of a sexual nature. The Commission rejected such an argument in <span class="Italic">Dennis-Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01930016 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he agency through the supervisor's testimony tried to show that the conduct complained of was not "unwelcomed" by alleging incidents about himself and appellant, and another employee and appellant, when appellant's chest area was touched or bumped and she did not complain. However, that appellant may have tolerated certain conduct from certain individuals does not constitute consent as to other persons, in this case the co-worker, to engage in similar type behavior with appellant<span class="Italic">. Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d 251, 254 n.3 (4th Cir. 1983). Also, any jokes or sexual innuendo she may have engaged in with the co-worker did not constitute consent for the co-worker to engage in conduct of a personal nature which appellant clearly communicated to him was "unwelcomed" as of the November incident<span class="Italic">. See Swentek v. U.S. Air</span>, 830 F.2d 552, 557 (4th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">The incidents involved an offensive touching of the complainant and another episode where the offender told the complainant to assume a certain position and he would "please" her.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, the fact that an appellant may have participated in sexual jokes does not prevent her from bringing a claim of sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">Guerra v. Postmaster General,</span> 01965639 (1997). In that case, there was substantial evidence that all persons, including the employee, engaged in a certain amount of sexual banter in the workplace. However, the Commission found that the level and tenor of the conduct to which the employee was subjected was beyond the normal workplace level. Further, the employee took the offending supervisor aside and privately complained about his conduct. In rejecting an argument that the conduct was not unwelcome, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Guerra</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the record indicates, as noted by the AJ herein, that a pervasive atmosphere of overt sexual innuendo existed in appellant's workplace. Although there is some evidence that appellant initially participated in such conduct with her coworkers, the record indicates that appellant clearly and repeatedly indicated that both the level and tenor of the innuendo she received from supervisor 1 was inappropriate and unwelcome to her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the conduct at issue rises to the level of a hostile environment, the harasser's conduct should be evaluated from the objective standpoint of a reasonable person. <span class="Italic">EEOC Policy Guidance</span> at 102. The Commission's Policy Guidance indicates that the following factors are pertinent to the inquiry: (1) whether the conduct was verbal or physical, or both; (2) how frequently the conduct was repeated; (3) whether the conduct was hostile and patently offensive; (4) whether the alleged harasser was a coworker or a supervisor; (5) whether others joined in perpetrating the harassment; and (6) whether the harassment was directed at more than one individual. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for harassment to be considered conduct in violation of Title VII, the conduct need not seriously affect an employee's psychological well-being or lead the employee to suffer psychological injury. Rather, as stated in <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), the applicable standard provides that Title VII is violated when the work place is permeated with discriminatory behavior that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a discriminatorily hostile or abusive working environment. This standard requires an objectively hostile or abusive environment, one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc</span>., 114 S. Ct. 367, 371 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Utilizing the criteria described above, we find that the record clearly indicates that the harassment was sufficiently severe and pervasive to rise to the level of a hostile work environment. The work environment was clearly permeated with a continuous barrage of patently offensive sexual comments and jokes and appellant was continuously made the target of such commentary by supervisor 1 who openly followed her in the workplace glaring, sticking his tongue out at her in a sexual manner, and laughing at her on numerous occasions even after she reported his conduct. We find that a reasonable person would clearly find such a work environment as the one encountered herein to be hostile and abusive.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the alleged perpetrator leaves notes apologizing for his behavior, this is a good indicator the conduct was unwelcome. <span class="Italic">McCleod v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01963810 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">Suggesting to others that the perpetrator and the complainant have a romantic relationship, even if untrue, can contribute to a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Tyner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070032 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee is subjected to hostile environment harassment, she has a limited number of choices. She can silently endure the harassment in hope that it will end; she can protest the harassment and, in the process, risk further harassment and possibly retaliation for complaining in the first place. Or, she can take the offensive, literally, and engage in similar conduct in hope that being accepted as "one of the boys" will lead to an end of the harassment. It was in just such a case that the Seventh Circuit found that the fact that the plaintiff engages in similar behavior does not necessarily mean she welcomed or incited the harassing conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Carr v. Allison Gas Turbine Div., GMC,</span> 32 F.2d 1007 (7th Cir. 1994), the plaintiff was the only female tinsmith in the General Motors gas turbine division. The court, 32 F.3d at 1009-10, described the conduct Carr's presence in the workplace engendered:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Carr was a drill operator in GM's gas turbine division when, in August 1984, she entered the skilled trades in the division as a tinsmith apprentice. She was the first woman to work in the tinsmith shop, and her male coworkers were unhappy about working with a woman. They made derogatory comments of a sexual character to her on a daily basis (such as, "I won't work with any cunt"), continually referred to her in her presence by such terms as "whore," "cunt," and "split tail," painted "cunt" on her toolbox, and played various sex- or gender-related pranks on her, such as painting her toolbox pink and (without her knowledge) cutting out the seat of her overalls. They festooned her tool box and work area with signs, pictures, and graffiti of an offensive sexual character, hid and stole her tools, hid her toolbox, hung nude pin-ups around the shop, and would strip to their underwear in front of her when changing into and out of their work clothes. One of them placed an obscene Valentine Day's card, addressed to "Cunt," on her toolbox. The card shows a man carrying a naked woman upside down, and the text explains that the man has finally discovered why a woman has two holes--so that she can be carried like a six-pack. A worker named Beckham twice exhibited his penis. The first time, during an argument in which Carr told him the exit door "swings both ways," meaning that he could leave just as easily as she could, he replied that he had something that "swings," and he demonstrated. The second time, another male worker bet Beckham $5 that he would not expose himself. He lost the bet, although it is unclear whether Carr was in front of Beckham or behind him. And it was Beckham who told Carr on another occasion that if he fell from a dangerous height in the shop she would have to give him "mouth to dick" resuscitation. Carr's male coworkers urinated from the roof of the shop in her presence, and, in her hearing, one of them accused a black employee who was only intermittently hostile to Carr of being "after that white pussy, that is why you want a woman here, you want some of that." A number of racist remarks and practical jokes of a racial nature were directed against this, the only black employee among the tinsmiths. A frequent remark heard around the shop was, "I'll never retire from this tinsmith position because it would make an opening for a nigger or a woman." Another of Carr's male coworkers threw a burning cigarette at her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At first she disregarded the harassment but beginning in 1985 and continuing until 1989, when she quit--constructively discharged, she contends, the situation having become unbearable--she complained about the harassment repeatedly to her immediate supervisor, Jim Routh. To no avail. He testified that even though some of the offensive statements were made in his presence, not being a woman himself he was not sure that the statements would be considered offensive by a woman. His perplexity was such that when he heard the statements he would just chuckle and bite down harder on his pipe.</p>
<p class="noindent">Against this backdrop, General Motors argued that the conduct was not unwelcome because Carr herself used terms like "'fuck head' and 'dick head' and told dirty jokes." The district court found in favor of the defendant because the men's conduct "had been 'invited.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1010.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Seventh Circuit reversed, finding that while it is appropriate to consider the words and deeds of a plaintiff, the ultimate question is whether the words and conduct of the male offenders were welcome. The court further found it was appropriate to compare, in frequency and severity, the conduct and words of the male offenders with those of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court first noted that "[w]elcome sexual harassment" is an oxymoron; if, as it concluded in <span class="Italic">Reed v. Shepard</span>, 939 F.2d 484, 486-87 (7th Cir. 1991), the employee demonstrates by word or deed that the "harassment" is welcome (the plaintiff in that case had instigated sexual pranks--for example, she had given one of her male coworkers a softball warmer designed to resemble a scrotum), it is not harassment. The court in <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 32 F.3d at 1010-11, then went on to find:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district judge rejected the company's argument that the words and conduct that we have described were mere vulgar pleasantries, what is euphemistically known as "shop talk." Workers, like other people, often are foul-mouthed (Beckham was clocked using the word "fuck" between <span id="Page_829"></span>50 and 60 times in a period of ten minutes), and while there are still people in this country, male as well as female, who are deeply offended by dirty words, employers are not under a legal duty enforceable by suits under Title VII to purify the language of the workplace. <span class="Italic">Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co.</span>, 805 F.2d 611, 620-21 (6th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Ebert v. Lamar Truck Plaza</span>, 878 F.2d 338, 339 (10th Cir. 1989). Yet there are gradations even here, and the district judge was surely correct that the words and deeds of Mary Carr's male coworkers crossed the line that separates the merely vulgar and mildly offensive from the deeply offensive and sexually harassing. For one thing, the words and acts of which she complains were, unlike what may have been the situation in <span class="Italic">Sauers v. Salt Lake County</span>, 1 F.3d 1122, 1127 (10th Cir. 1993), targeted on her, and it is a lot more uncomfortable to be the target of offensive words and conduct than to be merely an observer of them. Patricia J. Williams, <span class="Italic">The Alchemy of Race and Rights: Diary of a Law Professor</span> 129 (1991). For another thing, defacing a person's property (even if it is hers just to use while at work) and mutilating her clothing (even if it is hers just to wear while at work) are more ominous, more aggressive affronts than mere words.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">So the behavior of Carr's coworkers was harassing, yet the district judge concluded that it was not actionable, because it had been "invited." "[S]he was not merely the recipient of crude behavior and crude language--she also dished it out." A female welder, who worked in proximity to the tinsmiths, considered Carr vulgar and unladylike, a "tramp," because she used the "F word" and told dirty jokes. This woman further testified that she herself had no trouble with the men in the shop--though occasionally she did have to zap them with her welding arc to fend them off. Carr indeed used such terms as "fuck head" and "dick head," once placed her hand on the thigh of a young male worker, and, when shown a pornographic picture and asked to point out the clitoris, obliged. Once when her tool bench was moved (apparently not with hostile intent), she got into a shouting match with her coworkers. General Motors' brief describes her as "vulgar, confrontational, profane, lazy and vindictive." The district judge said that "she contributed just as much abusive language and crude behavior as did the male tinners, and therefore was just as responsible for any hostile sexual environment that consequently arose." "[T]he tinners' conduct, to the extent it may have constituted sexual harassment, was not unwelcome."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course it was unwelcome. A plaintiff's words, deeds, and deportment can cast light on whether her coworkers' treatment of her was unwelcome and should have been perceived as such by them and their supervisors, <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, supra</span>, 477 U.S. at 69, 106 S. Ct. at 2406-07, but we do not understand General Motors to be suggesting that Carr enjoyed or appeared to enjoy the campaign of harassment against her. In this regard the case is different from <span class="Italic">Reed v. Shepard, supra</span>, on which General Motors relies, where the plaintiff had manifested "enthusiastic receptiveness to sexually suggestive jokes and activities." 939 F.2d at 491. Reed, a corrections officer, never complained about sexual harassment, and rather than resigning because the conditions of her employment became intolerable was fired for encouraging two inmates to beat a third. The district judge made no finding of "enthusiastic receptiveness" in the present case, and could not have done so, since Carr's violent resentment of the conduct of her male coworkers toward her is plain. What the judge found, rather, was that Carr had provoked the misconduct of her coworkers. Had she been ladylike, he thought, like the welder, they would have left her alone--maybe; for remember that the welder had to use her welding arc to protect herself, and Carr was not so equipped.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we ignore the question why "unladylike" behavior should provoke not a vulgar response but a hostile, harassing response, and even if Carr's testimony that she talked and acted as she did in an effort to be "one of the boys" is (despite its plausibility) discounted, her words and conduct cannot be compared to those of the men and used to justify their conduct and exonerate their employer. <span class="Italic">Karibian v. Columbia University</span>, 14 F.3d 773, 778 (2d Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Burns v. McGregor Electronic Industries, Inc.</span>, 989 F.2d 959, 962 (8th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Swentek v. USAIR, Inc.</span>, 830 F.2d 552, 557 (4th Cir. 1987). The asymmetry of positions must be considered. She was one woman; they were many men. Her use of terms like "fuck head" could not be deeply threatening, or her placing a hand on the thigh of one of her macho coworkers intimidating; and it was not she who brought the pornographic picture to the "anatomy lesson." We have trouble imagining a situation in which male factory workers sexually harass a lone woman in self-defense as it were; yet that at root is General Motors' characterization of what happened here. It is incredible on the admitted facts.</p>
<p class="noindent">Judge Coffey dissented, primarily relying on a specific finding by the district court that the male offenders harassed the plaintiff because of her personality and not her sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the employee does not promptly report the sexual advances is not dispositive of the issue of whether they are unwelcome. <span class="Italic">Trammel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01871154 (1988). In a footnote in <span class="Italic">Trammel</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n defining "unwelcome," the Courts have indicated that it refers to any conduct which the employee does not <span class="Italic">solicit</span> or <span class="Italic">incite</span> or which she regards as <span class="Italic">undesirable</span> or <span class="Italic">offensive</span>.... One can be offended by certain conduct while still being reticent to report it for fear of losing one's job, creating controversy, not being believed, not being supported, or generally making matters worse.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the complainant offered a reasonable explanation for her delay in reporting the conduct, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it involved an employee who she viewed as a top-level management official and she was afraid of losing her job. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">McGinnis</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, (complainant and a coworker testified they did not report offensive comments previously because they believed nothing would be done to a high level official making the comments).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although whether the complainant reported the conduct to management is a factor in determining if the conduct was unwelcome that failure, standing alone, does not necessarily indicate the conduct was welcome. In <span class="Italic">Greene v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120090106 (2011), the Commission disagreed with the agency that the supervisor's conduct of asking the complainant for a date was not unwelcome even though she failed to report the conduct to management until after her termination. The complainant had contemporaneously reported the conduct to a union representative, but explained she did not report it to management or the EEO office because she was a probationary employee who feared being terminated. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Greene</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency stated in its final decision that S1's conduct was not unwelcome, we disagree. The challenged conduct must be unwelcome in the sense that the employee did not solicit or incite it, and in the sense that the employee regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive. Policy Guidance, at Guidance, &#x00A7; A. When there is some indication of welcomeness or when the credibility of the parties is at issue, the charging party's claim will be considerably strengthened if they made a contemporaneous complaint or protest. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the record reflects that Complainant made a contemporaneous complaint to UR about S1's conduct. As mentioned above, UR stated that, prior to preparing the April 30, 2007 memorandum that requested the ADR meeting, Complainant told her about rejecting S1's requests to go on a date. Although the Agency focused on Complainant's failure to complain to a management official, the record reflects that Complainant feared repercussions from complaining about the harassment. Specifically, UR stated that Complainant told her that she did not want to tell the EEO Officer about S1's conduct because she was in the probationary first year of employment and S1 had made it clear to her that he could do whatever he wanted regarding her employment during this period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, Complainant attested that she did not tell S2 or CL because S2 was never there and CL was allegedly S1's girlfriend.</p>
<p class="noindent">The requirement that the advances must be unwelcome to constitute sexual harassment must be viewed in combination with the requirement under <span class="Italic">Harris</span> that complainant must subjectively view the environment as hostile, abusive or offensive. It is possible that a complainant can meet the unwelcome advance requirement, but not the subjective prong of <span class="Italic">Harris.</span> For example, in <span class="Italic">Henry v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01943195 (1996), the Commission found the supervisor's advances were unwanted, but the complainant did not subjectively view the environment as hostile:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In September 1992 the Assistant Chief of the Operations and Readiness Division, in investigating Comparison 1's claim, asked appellant if the Chief had ever done anything to offend appellant. Appellant responded that while the Chief made a sexual advance toward her, she was not offended. Further, the day before, without being requested to do so, appellant wrote a letter in support of the Chief with regard to Comparison 1's allegations. Appellant did not take sides on who was telling the truth, but lamented that any affection could be misconstrued. Further, at the first hearing appellant testified that the conduct by the Chief did not interfere with her work performance, but the subsequent alleged actions did. At the second hearing appellant testified that she was shocked by the Chief's conduct on the trips.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant telling management officials that she does not want them to intervene and wants to handle the situation herself is not sufficient to put the agency on notice that the conduct is unwelcome. In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A60949 (2006), the Commission found that the agency was not liable for an allegedly hostile environment even though it knew of the conduct. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, while complainant reported FCW's conduct to management, we find that she nonetheless failed to put the agency on notice that FCW's conduct was unwelcome, and consequently did not trigger management's obligation to address the harassment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment</span>. Specifically, we find that each of these managers provide consistent, unrebutted, statements that she asked that no action be taken against FCW, rejecting specific offers to intervene, instead expressing her intention to handle the situation herself, with the goal of helping FCW find an appropriate way to cope with her personal problems. Additionally, we find that the above referenced 'special project' complainant created to help FCW, which brought them into frequent <span id="Page_830"></span>close contact, would effectively create the perception that complainant did not view FCW's conduct as harassing. Therefore, we find that despite her report of FCW's conduct to management, complainant nonetheless failed to communicate that this conduct was unwelcome. We determine that this finding is further supported by record evidence showing that management took swift action shortly after complainant initiated the EEO process in this matter, by terminating FCW, when it was clear, for the first time, that she desired decisive management intervention.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found that because the complainant was herself a management employee that she failed to otherwise avoid harm by not clearly communicating to her subordinate to stop the behavior.</p>
