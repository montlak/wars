<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-21"><span class="space">3.</span> History of Commission Cases on Transgender Status and Sexual Orientation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Even before <span class="Italic">Bostock</span>, by 2015, the Commission had virtually obliterated any distinction between discrimination based on sex and discrimination based on sexual orientation or transgender status. Still clinging to the gender stereotyping analysis, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Veretto v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110873 (2011), found a complaint that the employee was being harassed for failure to comply with a traditional male stereotype when he alleged the harassment was because he had announced his marriage to another man stated a claim. The Commission held that the claim was based, at least in part, on the complainant's failure to adhere to a traditional male stereotype--i.e., that men should marry women--and as such came within the ambit of Title VII. Shortly after, the Commission issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Castello v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520110649 (2011), reaching a similar result in a case involving a female complainant who alleged she was harassed for being attracted the females. Again, the Commission found that the claim alleged gender stereotyping--i.e., that the complainant failed to conform to the traditional stereotype that females should be attracted to males.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Macy v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt?utm_source=News+and+Case+Alert!+4-4+(Dewey+Publications+Inc.+-+deweypub.com)&utm_campaign=NaCA+Email+04-03&utm_medium=email">0120120821</a> (2012), dispensed with the stereotyping analysis simply holding that transgender status is protected under Title VII's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120133080.txt">0120133080</a> (2015), the Commission similarly held that discrimination the basis of sexual orientation falls within the meaning of sex discrimination as defined by Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of their significance, each case is detailed below along with other important Commission decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2011, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Veretto v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110873 (2011), used a gender stereotyping analysis to find that an allegation that an employee was being harassed after announcing his marriage to another man stated a claim for relief. The complainant alleged that he was subjected to verbal and physical harassment after announcing his marriage to another male in the <span class="Italic">Hartford Courant</span>. During a physical altercation, the complainant alleged that a coworker said, "I will beat you, you fucking queer." The agency found the claim was one of sexual orientation discrimination and dismissed it for failure to state a claim. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Veretto</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also dismissed the entire complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that Complainant is really alleging discrimination because of his sexual orientation, which is not covered by Title VII. Complainant disputes this characterization of claim, asserting instead that he is claiming sex (male) discrimination because CW1's actions were motivated by his anger over the fact that Complainant was a man marrying a man, rather than a woman marrying a man.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is correct that the Title VII's prohibition of discrimination does not include sexual preference or orientation as a basis. <span class="Italic">See Morrison v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEO Request No. 05930964 (June 16, 1994); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910858 (December 19, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII does, however, prohibit sex stereotyping discrimination. <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 250 (1989); <span class="Italic">Schroer v. Billington</span>, 577 F. Supp.2d 293 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding that an employer's decision to withdraw a job offer from a transsexual applicant constituted sex stereotyping discrimination in violation of Title VII); <span class="Italic">see also, Morin v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120092626 (August 26, 2010). In <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970077 (March 13, 1997), the Commission made clear that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the complainant can prove no set of facts in support of the claim which would entitle the complainant to relief. In this case, we find that Complainant has alleged a plausible sex stereotyping case which would entitle him to relief under Title VII if he were to prevail. He alleges that he was subjected to a hostile work environment because CW1 learned that he was marrying a man. He has essentially argued that CW1 was motivated by the sexual stereotype that marrying a woman is an essential part of being a man, and became enraged when Complainant did not adhere to this stereotype by announcing his marriage to a man in the society pages of the local newspaper. In other words, Complainant alleges that CW1's actions were motivated by his attitudes about stereotypical gender roles in marriage. Complainant further alleges that the Agency should be held liable for CW1's actions because it failed to take appropriate corrective action once the harassment was reported to management. These allegations are sufficient to state a viable hostile work environment claim under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying in part on <span class="Italic">Veretto</span>, in <span class="Italic">Castello v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520110649 (2011), the Commission reversed the agency dismissal of a complaint on the basis that it alleged sexual orientation discrimination where the complainant, a female, alleged that she was harassed because she liked females. She alleged that a supervisor said that she "gets more pussy than the men in this building." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Castello</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Title VII's prohibition of discrimination does not explicitly include sexual orientation as a basis, Title VII does, however, prohibit sex stereotyping discrimination. <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 250 (1989); <span class="Italic">see Hitchcock v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120051461 (May 3, 2007) (affirming an AJ's decision to dismiss a claim of sexual orientation discrimination but remanding Complainant's sex stereotyping discrimination claim); <span class="Italic">see also Schroer v. Billington</span>, 577 F. Supp.2d 293 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding that an employer's decision to withdraw a job offer from a transsexual applicant constituted sex stereotyping discrimination in violation of Title VII).

Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970077 (Mar. 13, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, based upon a fair reading of the record, we find that Complainant has alleged a plausible sex stereotyping case which would entitle her to relief under Title VII if she were to prevail. Complainant alleged that she was subjected to a hostile work environment when MDO made an offensive and derogatory comment about her having relationships with women.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has essentially argued that MDO was motivated by the sexual stereotype that having relationships with men is an essential part of being a woman, and made a negative comment based on Complainant's failure to adhere to this stereotype. In other words, Complainant alleged that MDO's comment was motivated by his attitudes about stereotypical gender roles in relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Veretto v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110873 (July 1, 2011), which found that the Agency erred in dismissing a claim of sex stereotyping discrimination under Title VII (where a gay man alleged he was harassed because he intended to marry a man rather than a woman), we find that Complainant's allegation is sufficient to state a viable hostile work environment claim under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Veretto</span> and <span class="Italic">Castello</span> set the stage for <span class="Italic">Macy v. Attorney General</span>, 0120120821 (2012), where the Commission held unequivocally that discrimination against an individual because of her transgender status was a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Macy</span> was a transgender police detective who was still presenting as male. Because she wished to relocate to San Francisco for family reasons, her supervisor told her of an opening at the Walnut Creek lab of the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol and Firearms for which she was qualified. Still presenting as a man, the complainant alleged that she was told by the lab director that she had the job provided she cleared a background check. The job offer was rescinded after disclosing her plan to fully transition to female.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of the significance of the <span class="Italic">Macy</span> decision, the Commission's analysis is reproduced in its totality:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The narrative accompanying Complainant's complaint makes clear that she believes she was not hired for the position as a result of making her transgender status known. As already noted, Complainant stated that she was discriminated against on the basis of "my sex, gender identity (transgender woman) and on the basis of sex stereotyping." In response to her complaint, the Agency stated that claims of gender identity discrimination "cannot be adjudicated before the [EEOC]." <span class="Italic">See</span> Agency Letters of October 26, 2011 and November 18, 2011. Although it is possible that the Agency would have fully addressed her claims under that portion of her complaint accepted under the 1614 process, the Agency's communications prompted in Complainant a reasonable belief that the Agency viewed the gender identity discrimination she alleged as outside the scope of Title VII's sex discrimination prohibitions. Based on these communications, Complainant believed that her complaint would not be investigated effectively by the Agency, and she filed the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(b) provides that where an agency decides that some, but not all, of the claims in a complaint should be dismissed, it must notify the complainant of its determination. However, this determination is not appealable until final action is taken on the remainder of the complaint. In apparent recognition of the operation of &#x00A7; 1614.107(b), Complainant withdrew the accepted portion of her complaint from the 1614 process so that the constructive dismissal of her gender identity discrimination claim would be a final decision and the matter ripe for appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the interest of resolving the confusion regarding a recurring legal issue that is demonstrated by this complaint's procedural history, as well as to ensure efficient use of resources, we accept this appeal for adjudication. Moreover, EEOC's responsibilities under Executive Order 12067 for enforcing all Federal EEO laws and leading the Federal government's efforts to eradicate workplace discrimination, require, among other things, that EEOC ensure that uniform standards be implemented <span id="Page_986"></span>defining the nature of employment discrimination under the statutes we enforce. Executive Order 12067, 43 F.R. 28967, &#x00A7; 1-301(a) (June 30, 1978). To that end, the Commission hereby clarifies that claims of discrimination based on transgender status, also referred to as claims of discrimination based on gender identity, are cognizable under Title VII's sex discrimination prohibition, and may therefore be processed under Part 1614 of EEOC's federal sector EEO complaints process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency mistakenly separated Complainant's complaint into separate claims: one described as discrimination based on "sex" (which the Agency accepted for processing under Title VII) and others that were alternatively described by Complainant as "sex stereotyping," "gender transition/change of sex," and "gender identity" (Complainant Letter of Nov. 8, 2011); by the Agency as "gender identity stereotyping" (Agency Letter Nov. 18, 2011); and finally by Complainant as "gender identity, change of sex and/or transgender status" (Complainant Letter Feb. 8, 2012). While Complainant could have chosen to avail herself of the Agency's administrative procedures for discrimination based on gender identity, she clearly expressed her desire to have her claims investigated through the 1614 process, and this desire should have been honored. Each of the formulations of Complainant's claims are simply different ways of stating the same claim of discrimination "based on...sex," a claim cognizable under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII states that, except as otherwise specifically provided, "[a]ll personnel actions affecting [federal] employees or applicants for employment...shall be made free from any discrimination <span class="Italic">based on...sex</span>...." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1), (2) (it is unlawful for a covered employer to "fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," or to "limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, <span class="Italic">because of such individual's...sex</span>") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As used in Title VII, the term "sex" "encompasses both sex--that is, the biological differences between men and women--and gender." <span class="Italic">See Schwenk v. Hartford</span>, 204 F.3d 1187, 1202 (9th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see also Smith v. City of Salem</span>, 378 F.3d 566, 572 (6th Cir. 2004) ("The Supreme Court made clear that in the context of Title VII, discrimination because of 'sex' includes gender discrimination."). As the Eleventh Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Brumby</span>, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2011), six members of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> agreed that Title VII barred "not just discrimination because of biological sex, but also gender stereotyping--failing to act and appear according to expectations defined by gender." As such, the terms "gender" and "sex" are often used interchangeably to describe the discrimination prohibited by Title VII. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 239 (1989) ("Congress' intent to forbid employers to take gender into account in making employment decisions appears on the face of the statute.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That Title VII's prohibition on sex discrimination proscribes gender discrimination, and not just discrimination on the basis of biological sex, is important. If Title VII proscribed only discrimination on the basis of biological sex, the only prohibited gender-based disparate treatment would be when an employer prefers a man over a woman, or vice versa. But the statute's protections sweep far broader than that, in part because the term "gender" encompasses not only a person's biological sex but also the cultural and social aspects associated with masculinity and femininity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, the employer refused to make a female senior manager, Hopkins, a partner at least in part because she did not act as some of the partners thought a woman should act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 230-31, 235. She was informed, for example, that to improve her chances for partnership she should "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 235. The Court concluded that discrimination for failing to conform with gender-based expectations violates Title VII, holding that "[i]n the specific context of sex stereotyping, an employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must not be, has acted on the basis of gender." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 250.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the partners at Price Waterhouse discriminated against Ms. Hopkins for failing to conform to stereotypical gender norms, gender discrimination occurs any time an employer treats an employee differently for failing to conform to any gender-based expectations or norms. "What matters, for purposes of...the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> analysis, is that in the mind of the perpetrator the discrimination is related to the sex of the victim." <span class="Italic">Schwenk</span>, 204 F.3d at 1201-02; <span class="Italic">see also Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 254-55 (noting the illegitimacy of allowing "sex-linked evaluations to play a part in the [employer's] decision-making process").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Title VII does identify one circumstance in which an employer may take gender into account in making an employment decision, namely, when gender is a '<span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification [(BFOQ)] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of th[e] particular business or enterprise." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 242 (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(e)). Even then, "the [BFOQ] exception was in fact meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex." <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp</span>., 400 U.S. 542, 544 (1971) (Marshall, J., concurring). "The only plausible inference to draw from this provision is that, in all other circumstances, a person's gender may not be considered in making decisions that affect her." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 242.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;There are other, limited instances in which gender may be taken into account, such as is in the context of a valid affirmative action plan, <span class="Italic">see Johnson v. Santa Clara County Transportation Agency</span>, 480 U.S. 616 (1987), or relatedly, as part of a settlement of a pattern or practice claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employer discriminates against someone because the person is transgender, the employer has engaged in disparate treatment "related to the sex of the victim." <span class="Italic">See Schwenk</span>, 204 F.3d at 1202. This is true regardless of whether an employer discriminates against an employee because the individual has expressed his or her gender in a non-stereotypical fashion, because the employer is uncomfortable with the fact that the person has transitioned or is in the process of transitioning from one gender to another, or because the employer simply does not like that the person is identifying as a transgender person. In each of these circumstances, the employer is making a gender-based evaluation, thus violating the Supreme Court's admonition that "an employer may not take gender into account in making an employment decision." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 244.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, courts have widely recognized the availability of the sex stereotyping theory as a valid method of establishing discrimination "on the basis of sex" in many scenarios involving individuals who act or appear in gender-nonconforming ways.[7] And since <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, courts also have widely recognized the availability of the sex stereotyping theory as a valid method of establishing discrimination "on the basis of sex" in scenarios involving transgender individuals.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Schwenk v. Hartford</span>, a prison guard had sexually assaulted a pre-operative male-to-female transgender prisoner, and the prisoner sued, alleging that the guard had violated the Gender Motivated Violence Act (GMVA), 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 13981. 204 F.3d at 1201-02. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the guard had known that the prisoner "considered herself a transsexual and that she planned to seek sex reassignment surgery in the future." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1202. According to the court, the guard had targeted the transgender prisoner "only after he discovered that she considered herself female[,]" and the guard was "motivated, at least in part, by [her] gender"--that is, "by her assumption <span id="Page_987"></span>of a feminine rather than a typically masculine appearance or demeanor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On these facts, the Ninth Circuit readily concluded that the guard's attack constituted discrimination because of gender within the meaning of both the GMVA and Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court relied on <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, reasoning that it stood for the proposition that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on a failure "to conform to socially-constructed gender expectations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1201-02. Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit concluded, discrimination against transgender females--i.e., "as anatomical males whose outward behavior and inward identity [do] not meet social definitions of masculinity"--is actionable discrimination "because of sex." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">cf. Rosa v. Park W. Bank &#x0026; Trust Co</span>., 214 F.3d 213, 215-16 (1st Cir. 2000) (finding that under <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, a bank's refusal to give a loan application to a biologically-male plaintiff dressed in "traditionally feminine attire" because his "attire did not accord with his male gender" stated a claim of illegal sex discrimination in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1691-1691f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. City of Salem</span>, the plaintiff was "biologically and by birth male." 378 F.3d at 568. However, Smith was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder (GID), and began to present at work as a female (in accordance with medical protocols for treatment of GID). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Smith's co-workers began commenting that her appearance and mannerisms were "not masculine enough." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Smith's employer later subjected her to numerous psychological evaluations, and ultimately suspended her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 569-70. Smith filed suit under Title VII alleging that her employer had discriminated against her because of sex, "both because of [her] <span class="Italic">gender non-conforming conduct</span> and, more generally, because of [her] <span class="Italic">identification</span> as a transsexual." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 571 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court rejected Smith's efforts to prove her case using a sex-stereotyping theory, concluding that it was really an attempt to challenge discrimination based on "transsexuality." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, stating that the district court's conclusion:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">cannot be reconciled with <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, which does not make Title VII protection against sex stereotyping conditional or provide any reason to exclude Title VII coverage for non-sex-stereotypical behavior simply because the person is a transsexual. As such, discrimination against a plaintiff who is a transsexual--and therefore fails to act and/or identify with his or her gender--is no different from the discrimination directed against [the plaintiff] in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> who, in sex-stereotypical terms, did not act like a woman. Sex stereotyping based on a person's gender non-conforming behavior is impermissible discrimination, irrespective of the cause of that behavior; a label, such as "transsexual" is not fatal to a sex discrimination claim where the victim has suffered discrimination because of his or her gender non-conformity. Accordingly, we hold that Smith has stated a claim for relief pursuant to Title VII's prohibition of sex discrimination.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Barnes v. City of Cincinnati</span>, 401 F.3d 729, 741 (6th Cir. 2005) (affirming a jury award in favor of a pre-operative transgender female, ruling that "a claim for sex discrimination under Title VII...can properly lie where the claim is based on 'sexual stereotypes'" and that the "district court therefore did not err when it instructed the jury that it could find discrimination based on 'sexual stereotypes'").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as the Eleventh Circuit suggested in <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Brumby</span>, 663 F.3d 1312 (11th Cir. 2011), consideration of gender stereotypes will inherently be part of what drives discrimination against a transgendered individual. In that case, the employer testified at his deposition that it had fired Vandiver Elizabeth Glenn, a transgender woman, because he considered it "inappropriate" for her to appear at work dressed as a woman and that he found it "unsettling" and "unnatural" that she would appear wearing women's clothing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1320. The firing supervisor further testified that his decision to dismiss Glenn was based on his perception of Glenn as "a man dressed as a woman and made up as a woman," and admitted that his decision to fire her was based on "the sheer fact of the transition." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1320-21. According to the Eleventh Circuit, this testimony "provides ample direct evidence" to support the conclusion that the employer acted on the basis of the plaintiff's gender non-conformity and therefore granted summary judgment to her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1321.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In setting forth its legal reasoning, the Eleventh Circuit explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A person is defined as transgender precisely because of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes. "[T]he very acts that define transgender people as transgender are those that contradict stereotypes of gender-appropriate appearance and behavior." Ilona M. Turner, Sex Stereotyping <span class="Italic">Per Se</span>: Transgender Employees and Title VII, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 561, 563 (2007); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Taylor Flynn, Transforming the Debate: Why We Need to Include Transgender Rights in the Struggles for Sex and Sexual Orientation Equality, 101 Colum. L.Rev. 392, 392 (2001) (defining transgender persons as those whose "appearance, behavior, or other personal characteristics differ from traditional gender norms"). There is thus a congruence between discriminating against transgender and transsexual individuals and discrimination on the basis of gender-based behavioral norms.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Accordingly, discrimination against a transgender individual because of her gender-nonconformity is sex discrimination, whether it's described as being on the basis of sex or gender.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">There has likewise been a steady stream of district court decisions recognizing that discrimination against transgender individuals on the basis of sex stereotyping constitutes discrimination because of sex. Most notably, in <span class="Italic">Schroer v. Billington</span>, the Library of Congress rescinded an offer of employment it had extended to a transgender job applicant after the applicant informed the Library's hiring officials that she intended to undergo a gender transition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 577 F. Supp.2d 293 (D.D.C. 2008). The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on her Title VII sex discrimination claim. According to the district court, it did not matter "for purposes of Title VII liability whether the Library withdrew its offer of employment because it perceived Schroer to be an insufficiently masculine man, an insufficiently feminine woman, or an inherently gender-nonconforming transsexual." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 305.

<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;The district court in <span class="Italic">Schroer</span> also concluded that discrimination against a transgender individual on the basis of an intended, ongoing, or completed gender transition is "literally discrimination 'because of...sex." <span class="Italic">Schroer</span>, 577 F. Supp.2d at 308; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 306-07 (analogizing to cases involving discrimination based on an employee's religious conversion, which undeniably constitutes discrimination "because of...religion" under Title VII).

<p class="noindent-2">[S]tatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil [they were passed to combat] to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.

<p class="noindent-1">Although most courts have found protection for transgender people under Title VII under a theory of gender stereotyping, evidence of gender stereotyping is simply one means of proving sex discrimination. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sex whether motivated by hostility,[11] by a desire to protect people of a certain gender,[12] by assumptions that disadvantage men,[13] by gender stereotypes,[14] or by the desire to accommodate other people's prejudices or discomfort.[15] While evidence that an employer has acted based on stereotypes about how men or women should act is certainly one means of demonstrating disparate treatment based on sex, "sex stereotyping" is not itself an independent cause of action. As the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> Court noted, while "stereotyped remarks can certainly be <span class="Italic">evidence</span> that gender played a part" in an adverse employment action, the central question is always whether the "employer actually relied on [the employee's] gender in making its decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 251 (emphasis in original).</p>

Plainfield Healthcare Ctr</span>., 612 F.3d 908, 912 (7th Cir. 2010) (concluding that "assignment sheet that unambiguously, and daily, reminded [the plaintiff, a black nurse,] and her co-workers that certain residents preferred no black" nurses created a hostile work environment); <span class="Italic">Fernandez v.

<p class="noindent-1">Thus, a transgender person who has experienced discrimination based on his or her gender identity may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination through any number of different formulations. These different formulations are not, however, different claims of discrimination that can be separated out and investigated within different systems. Rather, they are simply different ways of describing sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, Complainant could establish a case of sex discrimination under a theory of gender stereotyping by showing that she did not get the job as an NIBIN ballistics technician at Walnut Creek because the employer believed that biological men should consistently present as men and wear male clothing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Alternatively, if Complainant can prove that the reason that she did not get the job at Walnut Creek is that the Director was willing to hire her when he thought she was a man, but was not willing to hire her once he found out that she was now a woman--she will have proven that the Director discriminated on the basis of sex. Under this theory, there would actually be no need, for purposes of establishing coverage under Title VII, for Complainant to compile any evidence that the Director was engaging in gender stereotyping.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this respect, gender is no different from religion. Assume that an employee considers herself Christian and identifies as such. But assume that an employer finds out that the employee's parents are Muslim, believes that the employee should therefore be Muslim, and terminates the employee on that basis. No one would doubt that such an employer discriminated on the basis of religion. There would be no need for the employee who experienced the adverse employment action to demonstrate that the employer acted on the basis of some religious stereotype--although, clearly, discomfort with the choice made by the employee with regard to religion would presumably be at the root of the employer's actions. But for purposes of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that Title VII has been violated, the employee simply must demonstrate that the employer impermissibly used religion in making its employment decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The District Court in <span class="Italic">Schroer</span> provided reasoning along similar lines:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Imagine that an employee is fired because she converts from Christianity to Judaism. Imagine too that her employer testifies that he harbors no bias toward either Christians or Jews but only 'converts.' That would be a clear case of discrimination 'because of religion.' No court would take seriously the notion that 'converts' are not covered by the statute. Discrimination "because of religion" easily encompasses discrimination because of a change of religion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">577 F. Supp.2d at 306.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying Title VII in this manner does not create a new "class" of people covered under Title VII--for example, the "class" of people who have converted from Islam to Christianity or from Christianity to Judaism. Rather, it would simply be the result of applying the plain language of a statute prohibiting discrimination on the basis of religion to practical situations in which such characteristics are unlawfully taken into account. <span class="Italic">See Brumby</span>, 663 F.3d at 1318-19 (noting that "all persons, whether transgender or not" are protected from discrimination and "[a]n individual cannot be punished because of his or her perceived gender non-conformity").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we conclude that intentional discrimination against a transgender individual because that person is transgender is, by definition, discrimination "based on...sex," and such discrimination therefore violates Title VII.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;The Commission previously took this position in an <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief docketed with the district court in the Western District of Texas on Oct. 17, 2011, where it explained that "[i]t is the position of the EEOC that disparate treatment of an employee because he or she is transgender is discrimination "because of...sex" under Title VII." EEOC <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> Brief in <span class="Italic">Pacheco v. Freedom Buick GMC Truck</span>, No. 07-116 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 17, 2011), Dkt. No. 30, at page 1, 2011 WL 5410751. With this decision, we expressly overturn, in light of the recent developments in the caselaw described above, any contrary earlier decisions from the Commission. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jennifer Casoni v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC DOC 01840104 (Sept. 28, 1984); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01931703 (July 21, 1994); <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942053 (March 14, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the <span class="Italic">Macy</span> decision did not specifically address discrimination based on sexual orientation, there was no reason to draw any distinction between the two types of discrimination particularly given the Commission's decisions in <span class="Italic">Veretto</span> and <span class="Italic">Castello</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission followed up its decision in <span class="Italic">Macy</span> with <span class="Italic">Day v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120122376 (2013). In that case, the complainant alleged transgender discrimination when she was dismissed from a new-hire orientation and the agency subsequently withdrew its job offer. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Day</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Macy v. Dept. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821 (April 20, 2012), the Commission held that discrimination against an individual because that person is transgender is discrimination because of sex. Thus, complaints of discrimination based on transgender status should be processed under Title VII and through the federal sector EEO process as claims of sex discrimination. Accordingly, Complainant's claim that she was discriminated against because of her transgender status states a claim under Title VII. As Complainant claims that she was removed from new employee orientation and lost her job offer, she has alleged an injury or harm to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Diaz v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (April 21, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120133080 (2015), the complainant, a supervisory air traffic controller, alleged that he was not selected for a permanent position because of his sexual orientation. The complainant alleged that his supervisor, who was in the selection process, had made negative comments about his sexual orientation, such as, "[w]e don't need to hear about that gay stuff," and that he was "a distraction" in the control tower when he walked about his male partner.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency dismissed the complaint for failure to timely contact a counselor and also informed the complainant that he could pursue his claim under the agency's policy on sexual orientation, essentially also dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim, though the agency did not use that language.</p>
<p class="noindent">For reasons not relevant to this discussion, the Commission found that counselor contact was timely. It then turned its attention to the sexual orientation claim. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, without any specific acknowledgment that it was overruling most of its previous case law, held that sexual orientation discrimination is a form of sex discrimination covered by Title VII. Because of the significance of the <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span> decision, the entirety of the Commission's decision on the sexual orientation claim is reproduced below:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The narrative accompanying his formal complaint makes clear that Complainant believes that he was denied a permanent position because of his sexual orientation. The Agency, in its final decision, indicated it would process this claim only under its internal procedures concerning sexual orientation discrimination and not through the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process. The Agency erred in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII requires that "[a]ll personnel actions affecting [federal] employees or applicants for employment...shall be made free from any discrimination based on...sex." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). This provision is analogous to the section of Title VII governing employment discrimination in the private sector at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1) (it is unlawful for a covered employer to "fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's...sex").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII's prohibition of sex discrimination means that employers may not "rel[y] upon sex-based considerations" or take gender into account when making employment decisions. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 239, 241-42 (1989); <span class="Italic">Macy v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821, 2012 WL 1435995 (EEOC Apr. 20, 2012) (quoting <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 239).[4] This applies equally in claims brought by lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;As used in Title VII, the term "sex" "encompasses both sex--that is, the biological differences between men and women--and gender." <span class="Italic">See Schwenk v. Hartford</span>, 204 F.3d 1187, 1202 (9th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see also Smith v. City of Salem</span>, 378 F.3d 566, 572 (6th Cir. 2004) ("The Supreme Court made clear that in the context of Title VII, discrimination because of 'sex' includes gender discrimination."). <span id="Page_989"></span>As the Eleventh Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Brumby</span>, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2011), six members of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> agreed that Title VII barred "not just discrimination because of biological sex, but also gender stereotyping--failing to act and appear according to expectations defined by gender." As such, the terms "gender" and "sex" are often used interchangeably to describe the discrimination prohibited by Title VII. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span> at 239 (1989) ("Congress' intent to forbid employers to take gender into account in making employment decisions appears on the face of the statute.") (plurality opinion). We do the same in this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employee raises a claim of sexual orientation discrimination as sex discrimination under Title VII, the question is not whether sexual orientation is explicitly listed in Title VII as a prohibited basis for employment actions. It is not. Rather, the question for purposes of Title VII coverage of a sexual orientation claim is the same as any other Title VII case involving allegations of sex discrimination--whether the agency has "relied on sex-based considerations" or "take[n] gender into account" when taking the challenged employment action.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;As we observed in Macy, 2012 WL 1435995:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"'Title VII...identif[ies] one circumstance in which an employer may take gender into account in making an employment decision, namely, when gender is a '<span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification [(BFOQ)] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of th[e] particular business or enterprise.'" <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 242 (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(e)). Even then, "the [BFOQ] exception was in fact meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex."' [<span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 334 (1977).] <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp</span>., 400 U.S. 542, 544 (1971) (Marshall, J., concurring). "The only plausible inference to draw from this provision is that, in all other circumstances, a person's gender may not be considered in making decisions that affect her." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 242.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, we conclude that Complainant's claim of sexual orientation discrimination alleges that the Agency relied on sex-based considerations and took his sex into account in its employment decision regarding the permanent FLM position. Complainant, therefore, has stated a claim of sex discrimination. Indeed, we conclude that sexual orientation is inherently a "sex-based consideration," and an allegation of discrimination based on sexual orientation is necessarily an allegation of sex discrimination under Title VII. A complainant alleging that an agency took his or her sexual orientation into account in an employment action necessarily alleges that the agency took his or her sex into account.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is premised on sex-based preferences, assumptions, expectations, stereotypes, or norms. "Sexual orientation" as a concept cannot be defined or understood without reference to sex. A man is referred to as "gay" if he is physically and/or emotionally attracted to other men. A woman is referred to as "lesbian" if she is physically and/or emotionally attracted to other women. Someone is referred to as "heterosexual" or "straight" if he or she is physically and/or emotionally attracted to someone of the opposite-sex. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., American Psychological Ass'n, "Definition of Terms: Sex, Gender, Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation" (Feb. 2011), available at <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf</a> ("<span class="Italic">Sexual orientation</span> refers to the sex of those to whom one is sexually and romantically attracted" (second emphasis added). It follows, then, that sexual orientation is inseparable from and inescapably linked to sex and, therefore, that allegations of sexual orientation discrimination involve sex-based considerations. One can describe this inescapable link between allegations of sexual orientation discrimination and sex discrimination in a number of ways. Sexual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination because it necessarily entails treating an employee less favorably because of the employee's sex. For example, assume that an employer suspends a lesbian employee for displaying a photo of her female spouse on her desk, but does not suspend a male employee for displaying a photo of his female spouse on his desk. The lesbian employee in that example can allege that her employer took an adverse action against her that the employer would not have taken had she been male. That is a legitimate claim under Title VII that sex was unlawfully taken into account in the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See Los Angeles Dep't of Water &#x0026; Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 711 (1978) ("Such a practice does not pass the simple test of whether the evidence shows 'treatment of a person in a manner which but for that person's sex would be different.'"). The same result holds true if the person discriminated against is straight. Assume a woman is suspended because she has placed a picture of her husband on her desk but her gay colleague is not suspended after he places a picture of his husband on his desk. The straight female employee could bring a cognizable Title VII claim of disparate treatment because of sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court in <span class="Italic">Hall v. BNSF Ry. Co</span>., No. 13-2160, 2014 WL 4719007 (W.D. Wash., Sept. 22, 2014) adopted this analysis of Title VII. In that case, the court found that the plaintiff, a male who was married to another male, alleged sex discrimination under Title VII when he stated that he "experienced adverse employment action in the denial of the spousal health benefit, due to sex, where similarly situated females [married to males] were treated more favorably by getting the benefit." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court recognized that the sexual orientation discrimination alleged by the plaintiff constituted an allegation that the employer was treating female employees with male partners more favorably than male employees with male partners simply because of the employee's sex. <span class="Italic">See also Heller v. Columbia Edgewater Country Club</span>, 195 F. Supp.2d 1212, 1223 (D. Or. 2002) ("One way (but certainly not the only means) of [alleging a claim under Title VII] is to inquire whether the harasser would have acted the same if the gender of the victim had been different. A jury could find that [Heller's manager] would not have acted as she (allegedly) did if Plaintiff were a man dating a woman, instead of a woman dating a woman.") (internal citations omitted).[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Courts have also adopted this analysis in claims of sex discrimination under Title IX, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause. <span class="Italic">See Videckis v. Pepperdine Univ</span>., _____ F. Supp.3d _____, No. 15-298, 2015 WL 1735191 (C.D.

<p class="noindent-1">Sexual orientation discrimination is also sex discrimination because it is associational discrimination on the basis of sex. That is, an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is alleging that his or her employer took his or her sex into account by treating him or her differently for associating with a person of the same sex. For example, a gay man who alleges that his employer took an adverse employment action against him because he associated with or dated men states a claim of sex discrimination under Title VII; the fact that the employee is a man instead of a woman motivated the employer's discrimination against him. Similarly, a heterosexual man who alleges a gay supervisor denied him a promotion because he dates women instead of men states an actionable Title VII claim of discrimination because of his sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying Title VII's prohibition of race discrimination, courts and the Commission have consistently concluded that the statute prohibits discrimination based on an employee's association with a person of another race, such as an interracial marriage or friendship. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Floyd v. Amite County School Dist</span>., 581 F.3d 244, 249 (5th Cir. 2009) ("This court has recognized that...Title VII prohibit[s] discrimination against an employee on the basis of a personal relationship between the employee and a person of a different race."); <span class="Italic">Holcomb v. Iona Coll</span>., 521 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2008) ("We...hold that an employer may violate Title VII if it takes action against an employee because of the employee's association with a person of another race.").[7] This is because an employment action based on an employee's relationship with a person of another race necessarily involves considerations of the employee's race, and thus constitutes discrimination because of the employee's race.</p>

Elliott Popham Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick &#x0026; GMC Trucks, Inc</span>., 173 F.3d 988, 994 (6th Cir. 1999) ("A white employee who is discharged because his child is biracial is discriminated against on the basis of his race...."); <span class="Italic">Hancock v.

<p class="noindent-1">This analysis is not limited to the context of race discrimination. Title VII "on its face treats each of the enumerated categories"--race, color, religion, sex, and national origin--"exactly the same." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 243 n.9 ("[O]ur specific references to gender throughout <span id="Page_990"></span>this opinion, and the principles we announce, apply with equal force to discrimination based on race, religion, or national origin."); <span class="Italic">see also Whidbee v. Garzarelli Food Specialties, Inc</span>., 223 F.3d 62, 69 n.6 (2d Cir. 2000) ("[T]he same standards apply to both race-based and sex-based hostile environment claims."); <span class="Italic">Williams v.

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, Title VII similarly prohibits employers from treating an employee or applicant differently than other employees or applicants based on the fact that such individuals are in a same-sex marriage or because the employee has a personal association with someone of a particular sex. Adverse action on that basis is, "by definition," discrimination because of the employee or applicant's sex. <span class="Italic">Cf. Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co</span>., 791 F.2d 888, 892 (11th Cir. 1986) ("Where a plaintiff claims discrimination based upon an interracial marriage or association, he alleges, by definition, that he has been discriminated against because of his race [in violation of Title VII]."); <span class="Italic">Schroer v. Billington</span>, 577 F. Supp.2d 293, 307 n.8 (D.D.C. 2008) ("Discrimination because of race has never been limited only to discrimination for being one race or another. Instead, courts have recognized that Title VII's prohibition against race discrimination protects employees from being discriminated against because of an interracial marriage, or...friendships.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sexual orientation discrimination also is sex discrimination because it necessarily involves discrimination based on gender stereotypes. In <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, the Court reaffirmed that Congress intended Title VII to "strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes." 490 U.S. at 251 (quoting <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Dep't of Water &#x0026; Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 707 n.13 (1978)). In the wake of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, courts and the Commission have recognized that lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals can bring claims of gender stereotyping under Title VII if such individuals demonstrate that they were treated adversely because they were viewed--based on their appearance, mannerisms, or conduct--as insufficiently "masculine" or "feminine."[8] But as the Commission[9] and a number of federal courts[10] have concluded in cases dating from 2002 onwards, discrimination against people who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual on the basis of gender stereotypes often involves far more than assumptions about overt masculine or feminine behavior.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the past, courts have often failed to view claims of discrimination by lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees in the straightforward manner described above.[11] Indeed, many courts have gone to great lengths <span id="Page_991"></span>to distinguish adverse employment actions based on "sex" from adverse employment actions based on "sexual orientation." The stated justification for such intricate parsing of language has been the bare conclusion that "Title VII does not prohibit...discrimination because of sexual orientation." <span class="Italic">Dawson v. Bumble &#x0026; Bumble</span>, 398 F.3d 211, 217 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">Simonton v. Runyon</span>, 232 F.3d 33, 35 (2d Cir. 2000)). For that reason, courts have attempted to distinguish discrimination based on sexual orientation from discrimination based on sex, even while noting that the "borders [between the two classes] are...imprecise." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (alteration in original).[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;A review of cases cited for the proposition that sexual orientation is excluded from Title VII reveals that many courts simply cite earlier and dated decisions without any additional analysis. For example, in a brief to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals requesting rehearing based on various broad declaratory statements that Title VII does not cover sexual orientation, the EEOC pointed out that only one previous Seventh Circuit case had analyzed the question of coverage of sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII and that case, decided in 1984, had not been reviewed in light of subsequent decisions such as Price Waterhouse. Instead, a string of Seventh Circuit panel decisions had simply reiterated the holding in the first case without any further discussion. Br. EEOC Supp. Reh'g 8-9, <span class="Italic">Muhammad v. Caterpillar Inc</span>., ECF No. 49, No. 12-1723 (7th Cir. Oct. 7, 2014). The Seventh Circuit denied the request for rehearing but reissued its decision without the statements that sexual orientation discrimination is not covered under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Muhammad v. Caterpillar</span>, 767 F.3d 694 (7th Cir. 2014), 2014 WL 4418649 (7th Cir. Sept. 9, 2014, as Amended on Denial of Rehearing, Oct. 16, 2014).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;We do not view the borders between sex discrimination and sexual orientation as "imprecise." As we note above, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily involves discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some of these decisions reason that Congress in 1964 did not intend Title VII to apply to sexual orientation and, therefore, Title VII could not be interpreted to prohibit such discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DeSantis v. Pacific Telephone &#x0026; Telegraph Co</span>., 608 F.2d 327, 329 (9th Cir. 1979) ("Congress had only the traditional notions of 'sex' in mind" when it passed Title VII and those "traditional notions" did not include sexual orientation or sexual preference.) abrogated by <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant Enterprises, Inc</span>., 256 F.3d 864, 875 (9th Cir. 2001).[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Indeed, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's own understanding of Title VII's application to sexual orientation discrimination has developed over time. <span class="Italic">Compare Johnson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01911827, 1991 WL 1189760 (EEOC Dec. 19, 1991) (holding that Title VII's prohibition of discrimination based on sex does not include sexual preference or sexual orientation), and <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930778, 1994 WL 746296 (EEOC June 16, 1994) (affirming that Title VII's discrimination prohibition does not include sexual preference or orientation as a basis), with <span class="Italic">Morris v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01974524, 2000 WL 226001 (EEOC Feb. 9, 2000) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> and <span class="Italic">Morrison</span> and holding that complainant stated a valid Title VII claim by alleging that her female supervisor and former lover discriminated against her on the basis of her sex). Former Acting Chairman of the EEOC Stuart Ishimaru acknowledged the varying protections extended to LGBT employees and explained that federal decisions have been inconsistent in this area. <span class="Italic">See</span> Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2009: Hearing on H.R. 3017 Before the H. Comm. on Educ. &#x0026; Labor, 111th Cong. (2009) (statement of Stuart J. Ishimaru, Acting Chairman, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress may not have envisioned the application of Title VII to these situations. But as a unanimous Court stated in <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc</span>., "statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil [they were passed to combat] to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed." 523 U.S. 75, 79, 78-80 (1998) (holding that same-sex harassment is actionable under Title VII). Interpreting the sex discrimination prohibition of Title VII to exclude coverage of lesbian, gay or bisexual individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of sex inserts a limitation into the text that Congress has not included.[14] Nothing in the text of Title VII "suggests that Congress intended to confine the benefits of [the] statute to heterosexual employees alone." <span class="Italic">Heller v. Columbia Edgewater Country Club</span>, 195 F. Supp.2d. 1212, 1222 (D. Or. 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of "sex" without further definition or restriction and it is not our province to modify that text by adding limitations to it. As the Supreme Court noted recently in a different context, "[t]he problem with this approach is the one that inheres in most incorrect interpretations of statutes: It asks to add words to the law to produce what is thought to be a desirable result. That is Congress's province." <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch Stores, Inc</span>., 575 U.S. (2015), 135 S. Ct. 2028, 2033, 2015 WL 2464053 (2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some courts have also relied on the fact that Congress has debated but not yet passed legislation explicitly providing protections for sexual orientation. <span class="Italic">See Bibby v. Phila. Coca Cola Bottling Co</span>., 260 F.3d 257, 261 (3d Cir. 2001) ("Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation that would extend Title VII to cover sexual orientation.").[15] But the Supreme Court has ruled that "[c]ongressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction, including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change." <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp</span>., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Medina v. Income Support Div</span>., 413 F.3d 1131, 1135 (10th Cir. 2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Bibby</span> and <span class="Italic">Simonton</span> (<span class="Italic">see infra</span>) with approval); <span class="Italic">Rene v. MGM Grand Hotel, Inc.,</span> 243 F.3d 1206, 1209 (9th Cir. 2001) ("Title VII has not been amended to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation."); <span class="Italic">Simonton v. Runyon</span>, 232 F.3d 33, 35 (2d Cir. 2000) ("Congress's refusal to expand the reach of Title VII is strong evidence of congressional intent.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The idea that congressional action is required (and inaction is therefore instructive in part) rests on the notion that protection against sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII would create a new class of covered persons. But analogous case law confirms this is not true. When courts held that Title VII protected persons who were discriminated against because of their relationships with persons of another race, the courts did not thereby create a new protected class of "people in interracial relationships." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Deffenbaugh-Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc</span>., 156 F.3d 581, 588-89 (5th Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">reinstated in relevant part, Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc</span>., 182 F.3d 333 (5th Cir. 1999) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). And when the Supreme Court decided that Title VII protected persons discriminated against because of gender stereotypes held by an employer, it did not thereby create a new protected class of "masculine women." <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 239-40 (plurality opinion). Similarly, when ruling under Title VII that discrimination against an employee because he lacks religious beliefs is religious discrimination, the courts did not thereby create a new Title VII basis of "non-believers." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., EEOC v. Townley Eng'g &#x0026; Mfg. Co</span>., 859 F. 2d. 610, 621 (9th Cir. 1988). These courts simply applied existing Title VII principles on race, sex, and religious discrimination to these situations. Further, the Supreme Court was not dissuaded by the absence of the word "mothers" in Title VII when it decided that the statute does not permit an employer to have one hiring policy for women with pre-school children and another for men with pre-school children. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Martin-Marietta</span>, 400 U.S. 542, 543-44 (1971) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). The courts have gone where the principles of Title VII have directed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our task is the same. We apply the words of the statute Congress has charged us with enforcing. We therefore conclude that Complainant's allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation state a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex. We further conclude that allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily state a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex. An employee could show that the sexual orientation discrimination he or she experienced was sex discrimination because it involved treatment that would not have occurred but for the individual's sex; because it was based on the sex of the person(s) the individual associates with; and/or because it was premised on the fundamental sex stereotype, norm, or expectation that individuals should be attracted only to those of the opposite sex.[16] Agencies should treat claims of sexual orientation discrimination as complaints of sex discrimination under Title VII and process such complaints through the ordinary Section 1614 process.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;There may be other theories for establishing sexual orientation discrimination as sex discrimination, on which we express no opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that many agencies also have separate complaint processes in place for claims of sexual orientation discrimination. Agencies may maintain, and employees may still utilize, these procedures if they wish. But the 1614 process is the most appropriate method for resolving these claims. Agencies should make applicants and employees aware that claims of sexual orientation discrimination will ordinarily be processed under Section 1614 as claims of sex discrimination unless the employee requests that the alternative complaint process be used.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Larita G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142154 (2015) (applying <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span> to a claim of discrimination by a lesbian). <span class="Italic">Colleen M. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120130552 (2016), also applied the <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span> case to reject the agency's finding that the complainant had "failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on sexual orientation because Complainant did not <span id="Page_992"></span>specify her sexual orientation, [and] only asserted that she was 'perceived homosexual,' and that management officials were unaware of her sexual orientation." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Colleen M</span>. noted that the complainant had clearly included sexual orientation as a discriminatory basis. She further alleged that her supervisor called her "Eric" in three emails and that another management official launched an investigation into whether the complainant had a lesbian relationship with a coworker.</p>
<p class="noindent">Among the forms of prohibited discrimination is the failure to acknowledge a change in gender. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120133123 (2014), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the complainant explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A fair reading of the complaint in this case, in conjunction with the EEO counseling report, reveals that Complainant has explained that he is undergoing treatment for gender identity disorder and, as a [result] of this treatment, legally changed his name from system from "[ ]" to "[ ]." As part of his job duties, Complainant needs access to the Agency's VISTA computer system and has to enter his name in order to use the system. Therefore, in April 2012, he submitted a request to the Shreveport Information Security Officer (male) to change user name to his new legal name. Complainant alleges that his request was ignored even though a management official verified Complainant's identity and name change. In October 2012, Complainant states he made a follow-up contact the Information Security Officer to again request that his name be changed in the VISTA system. Complainant alleges that during this telephone conversation, the Information Security Officer reacted with a lot of hostility, refused to change his name, and threatened to terminate Complainant's access to all Agency computer systems. Complainant also states that he learned that the Information Security Officer improperly accessed Complainant's background investigation, which contained personal information that he had no legitimate reason to know.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant explained that it was important to him to change his name in the VISTA system because many people accessed the system, including veteran clients and other employees, which resulted in many questions about "Cynthia" (his unchanged user name in the system). Complainant said this put him in the position of having to divulge the reason for his name change, which he felt was a breach of his privacy. When he discussed the matter with his immediate supervisor, he was given permission to switch his Shreveport cases with coworkers so he did not have to explain the name change. However, Complainant stated that as time went on without his name being changed in the system, switching cases began to have a negative impact on his workload and created a problem for him to meet his case quota under his performance standards. It is undisputed in the record that Complainant's name was not changed in the Shreveport VISTA system until a year after he first made the request to do so, and only after he had initiated EEO counseling on the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In dismissing this complaint, we first find that the Agency improperly defined the complaint as consisting of two separate claims, rather than a claim of ongoing harassment. <span class="Italic">See Meaney v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940169 (Nov. 3, 1994) (an agency should not ignore the "pattern aspect" of a complainant's claims and define the issues in a piecemeal manner where an analogous theme unites the matter complained of). In doing so, the Agency dismissed each "claim" for separate reasons. When properly viewed as a claim of sex-based harassment, we find Complainant has stated a claim of a violation of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When viewing the cumulative effect of Complainant's allegations proffered in support of his harassment claim in the light most favorable to him, we find that Complainant has stated a claim of sex discrimination actionable under Title VII. Complainant has explained how he was harmed by the ongoing refusal to change his name in the VISTA system, as well as the alleged hostility and threats from the Information Security Officer. Complainant has alleged, in essence, that the Information Security Officer was hostile towards him because he changed his gender identity from female to male. Complainant has not alleged an isolated incident, but a situation that continued for over a year and purportedly impacted his ability to successfully meet the workload demands of his job without having to answer frequent personal questions about his gender identity. It further is asserted that no one in management effectively assisted Complainant in rectifying the situation until he sought EEO counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lusardi v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120133395 (2015), the Commission found that a supervisor's continual use of male pronouns in referring to the female transgender complainant created a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hillier v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120150248 (2016), the complainant, a transgender female, was a member of an "agency employee organization" that met weekly at the agency to conduct Bible study discussions. The president of the Bible study refused to allow the complainant to make a presentation to the group, regardless of whether she presented as a female or a male, explaining that he could not allow the complainant to use the group as a platform to promote a transgender lifestyle. The Commission extended agency liability for the acts of agency sponsored organizations that are based on transgender status and, in <span class="Italic">Hillier</span>, found the conduct sufficiently severe to state a claim of sex-based harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant alleged that she was subjected to harassment when on June 18, 2014, the CFIRE President informed her that she will not allow Complainant to attend meetings or present to the group dressed as a woman. Further, on July 1, 2014, the CFIRE President told Complainant that she could not present to the group at all, even on non-transgender related topics and dressed as a man, because she did not want the CFIRE platform to be used to promote a "transgender lifestyle." We find that not allowing someone to dress as the gender with which they identify is severe enough to constitute a hostile work environment, as a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive. The CFIRE President's actions are analogous to someone not allowing a cisgender female to dress as a woman, or not allowing a cisgender male to dress as a male. Not allowing an employee to dress as the gender with which they identify and forcing them to dress as a gender with which they do not identify can be humiliating and dehumanizing, and it certainly unreasonably interferes with an employee's work environment. Further, not allowing an individual to present on any topic simply because that individual is transgender causes further alienation and reasonably interferes with an employee's work environment. Finally, the CFIRE President's use of the term "transgender lifestyle" can reasonably be perceived as offensive, as it is indicating that transgender people somehow are different from others and have a different lifestyle than others, and as a result, they should be treated differently. Therefore, we find that this complaint states a claim of sex based harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that sexual orientation is covered by Title VII does not mean that the complainant will prevail. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Shela O. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120113826 (2015), noting that the administrative judge erred in finding sexual orientation was not covered, but finding no evidence that the complainant's termination was based on that orientation.</p>
