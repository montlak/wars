<h3 class="h3" id="sec19-65"><span class="space">E.</span> DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC rejected the notion that cases under the Rehabilitation Act are, as a matter of law, "ill suited" for class actions. A class action under the Rehabilitation Act must be evaluated under the same criteria as any other class claim. <span class="Italic">Travis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992222 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A20442 (2003), the Commission found the proposed class might satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements for a class action based on failure to accommodate since the alleged disabilities were similar in nature and the complaint involved what was arguably an agency policy or practice. In remanding the complaint in <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> for further development of the record, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of the commonality and typicality requirements is to ensure that class agents possess the same interests and suffer the same injury as the members of the proposed class<span class="Italic">. See General Telephone Company of the Southwest v. Falcon</span>, 457 U.S. 147 (1982). In application, the commonality and typicality prerequisites tend to merge and are often indistinguishable<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing commonality and typicality, the AJ indicated that she requested that the class agent provide information as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;A description of the proposed class and the names of all known class members, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The alleged disability (physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity) of every known class member.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that the class agent's response to the above inquiry did not provide any additional information beyond that contained in the investigative file. We note that complainant submitted a chart reflecting essentially the same information contained in the above described employee statements. Moreover, the AJ found that descriptions such as "knee/ankle strain" and "bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome" were <span id="Page_1655"></span>insufficient to determine whether the individuals had a "disability" as defined by the Rehabilitation Act. The AJ additionally found that simply because an employee was injured on-the-job did not necessarily establish that the individual had a "protected disability." Additionally, as noted above, the AJ determined that even assuming that each class member had a "protected disability," because the class claim concerned the denial of a reasonable accommodation, it cannot, by its very nature, satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, to satisfy the commonality requirement, we find that complainant submitted evidence identifying 65 employees at the agency's San Francisco postal center claiming to have orthopedic-type disabilities, purported to be job related and requiring reasonable accommodations, who had no accommodation, or an inadequate one. As such, we find that complainant's submission to the AJ's request, reflecting this information, while not determinative, was nonetheless responsive. More significantly, we find that the agency does not dispute that complainant or the class members are covered by the Rehabilitation Act. The record is otherwise devoid of any evidence to address this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we also find that the AJ erred in determining that a claim of denial of reasonable accommodation can never satisfy the class certification criteria because it requires an individualized assessment. Here, although the potential class members have a variety of orthopedic conditions, which will potentially require individualized accommodations, the gravamen of the claim is that these accommodations are being denied out-of-hand, without regard to the nature of the disability or needed accommodation. Stated as such, we find that this claim is class-wide in nature, and can potentially be certified as a class action complaint with respect to commonality and typicality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, our review of the record discloses that during the same time period that the class complaint was filed, and the class members made their statements, the agency was undertaking a formal reassessment process. Pursuant to this process, the agency assessed the physical limitations of employees having long term limited duty jobs and "rehab" employees, as well as the duties they performed, to determine whether they could be reassigned from administrative positions to productive work in "Operations." According to a "Reassessment Summary Report," as of January 10, 2001, long-term limited duty employees numbered 109, and "rehab" employees numbered 448. Of these, 38 "rehab" employees were returned to Operations, and 6 were to be returned to the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs rolls. However, the long-term limited duty employees were still being reviewed, and 336 "rehab" employees' assessments were still pending.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commonality requires that there be questions of fact common to the class. The class agent must, therefore, establish some evidentiary basis from which one could reasonably infer the operation of an overriding policy or practice of discrimination. This can be done through allegations of specific incidents of discrimination, supporting affidavits containing anecdotal testimony from other employees against whom an employer allegedly discriminated in the same manner as the class agents, and evidence of specific adverse actions taken<span class="Italic">. See Mastren v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930253 (October 27, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, given the proximity in the dates of the agency's formal reassessment process, and the February 2001 dates of the statements from the purported class members, we find that this reassessment process, which potentially had the effect of terminating accommodations, may have been the source of the class complaint. We also find that the agency's reassessment process could possibly be viewed as an "overriding policy or practice of discrimination," and as such, could establish commonality and typicality for the class. However, because the evidence of record is insufficient to ascertain whether or not this reassessment process, in fact, generated the employee statements, as well as the class complaint, we cannot draw this conclusion without additional evidence on this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">Rare as they may be, <span class="Italic">Velva B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720160006 (2017), is another good example of a successful class complaint involving disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">Velva B.</span> involved an agency program that, per the agency, was designed to "ensure employees are performing only necessary work." The program, implemented in two phases, was developed principally and jointly by the agency's human resources and workers compensation offices. Phase one involved identifying all "injured-on-duty" (IOD) employees who were either in a limited-duty or rehabilitation status, making sure that the agency's medical information on each IOD was current and, if not, staff was directed to ask the employee to update his or her medical documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In phase two of the program, the agency endeavored to identify "necessary work" which led to many IODs being presented with offers of modified positions and other being placed in a "no work available" (NWA) status. NWA employees were placed on "leave without pay/injured-on-duty status," told to collect their things and escorted from the premises. The class agent alleged that the management officials who devised and directed the implementation of the program created a pattern and practice of disability discrimination by using, among other documentation, standard OWCP forms to identify and gather information on all "injured-on-duty" employees who were either in limited-duty or rehabilitation status, assessing their duties and determining whether they were performing work necessary to the "agencies mail delivery operations." The Commission found the agency's "necessary work" reason for the program was pretext for disability discrimination, noting the "massive evidentiary record" showed that the agency moved "limited-duty and rehabilitation employees off the IOD rolls, regardless of whether they were qualified individuals with disabilities, and without regard for Rehabilitation Act obligations, was the agency's primary motivation"; and that many, if not most, of the class members were qualified individuals who were successfully performing the essential functions of their positions before the agency withdrew their accommodations without a showing of undue hardship. The Commission's decision provides a good step-by-step of the analysis of how a class complaint based on disability discrimination proceeds. <span class="Italic">Velva B.</span> has a little bit of everything--discussion of class complaint eligibility, intentional disability discrimination, withdrawal of reasonable accommodations, impermissible medical inquires and failure to maintain the confidentiality of medical records, among others holdings, which are discussed in this chapter under Hostile Work Environment and Class Action Relief. For that reason, the Commission's decision is substantially reproduced below.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the eligibility of the class complaint for protection under the Rehabilitation Act, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Velva B</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with the Rehabilitation Act, no federal employer may discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). In determining whether there has been a violation of section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, we apply the same standards that are applied under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.). 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The theory of discrimination in a pattern and practice case such as this is that the Agency "regularly and purposefully" treated members of a protected less favorably than individuals not in that group. <span class="Italic">Carey v. Defense Contract Management Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A53389 n.3 (Sept. 1, 2006), <span class="Italic">citing International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 335 (1977). The Class Agent must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that discrimination was the Agency's standard operating procedure; the regular rather than the unusual practice. <span class="Italic">See Teamsters</span>, 431 U.S. at 336; <span class="Italic">Tarrats, et al. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A41422 (Nov. 15, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a class alleges a broad-based policy of employment discrimination, it may pursue its pattern or practice claims in a bifurcated proceeding. In its first stage, the Class Agent must establish that unlawful discrimination has been a regular procedure followed by an employer. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC</span>, 826 F.3d 791, 797 (5th Cir. 2016), <span class="Italic">citing Teamsters, supra</span>, at 336 n.16. Single, insignificant, isolated acts of discrimination are not enough to prove a pattern or practice, nor are sporadic incidents. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Instead, the Class Agent must show that the denial or rights was repeated, routine, or of a generalized nature. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the Class Agent meets her initial burden, a subsequent remedial phase determines the scope of individual relief. <span class="Italic">Id., citing Teamsters</span>, 431 U.S. at 361.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin by determining whether the Class Agent is an individual with a disability. A disability is defined as an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g). Because she was removed from her position in 2006, prior to the enactment date of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA), we must analyze her claim under the pre-ADAAA framework. As a threshold matter, the Class Agent must establish that she is a person who has, has a record of, or is regarded as having a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of his major life activities, i.e., caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. An impairment is substantially limiting when it prevents an individual from performing a major life activity or when it significantly restricts the condition, manner, or duration under which an individual can perform a major life activity. <span class="Italic">Abeijon</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080156 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Class Agent sustained an on-the-job injury on January 2, 1997, while delivering mail during winter weather. She was diagnosed with lumbar stenosis, which eventually became a chronic degenerative condition characterized by loss of soft tissue between the discs in the spinal column, the effects of which were permanent. In September 1997, she had a lumbar laminectomy and follow-up physical therapy for 90 days. Record at 15292, 15327-15329. She remained out of work until January of 1998. Record at 15293. When she returned, she was placed under medical restrictions that included no lifting over ten pounds, no standing for more than one hour, no bending, twisting up to only 15 degrees, and working up to 4 hours per day. The Class Agent underwent a follow-up medical examination in December of 2002. The examining physician noted that she still had significant stenosis as well as neurogenic claudication.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1656"></span>We find that the Class Agent's condition meets the definition of a disability under the. Rehabilitation Act as it existed prior to the enactment of the ADAAA. She had in place a medical restriction that prevented her from lifting more than ten pounds, and according to her medical documentation, that restriction was permanent. Our pre-ADAAA precedent holds that permanent inability to lift more than 10 pounds is a substantial limitation in the major life activity of lifting. <span class="Italic">Gil v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01990675 (Sept. 14, 2001); <span class="Italic">Chau-Phan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01985730 (July 13, 2001); <span class="Italic">Selix v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (Mar. 16, 2000). Therefore, the Class agent is an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We must next determine whether the Class Agent is a qualified individual with a disability. A qualified individual with a disability is an "individual with a disability who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). After remaining out of work for approximately one year, the Class Agent returned to work and was offered several limited-duty assignments within her medical restrictions; most recently as a Carrier Technician on September 25, 1999. She held this position until her departure on May 19, 2006. Her duties included serving as Safety Captain, handling the address management system, carrier casing, answering the telephone, helping carriers with mark-up mail, and other duties as needed. Until the NRP meeting in May 2006 which resulted in her losing her job, she had been meeting the performance expectations of her modified position while having her restrictions accommodated. The Class Agent is therefore a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question is whether the Class Agent's status as a qualified individual with a disability extends to the class. A Class Agent typically establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of pattern or practice discrimination either by a combination of anecdotal and statistical evidence or by gross statistical disparities alone. <span class="Italic">Peterson &#x0026; Trammel v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942838 (Sept. 8, 1988), <span class="Italic">citing Hazelwood School District v. United States</span>, 433 U.S. 299, 307 (1977). The class agent here established that those responsible for developing and implementing the NRP engaged in practices against individuals who were or might be disabled. She identified the class as consisting of IOD employees who were in limited-duty or rehabilitation positions when they were assessed by the NRP and suffered adverse consequences as a result of those assessments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the mere fact that the class members were injured and receiving benefits under the Federal Employee's Compensation Act (FECA) did not make them qualified individuals with disabilities. It correctly points out that, under the Commission's own policy guidance, entitlement to compensation under FECA is not synonymous with Rehabilitation Act coverage. <span class="Italic">See EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Workers Compensation and the ADA</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, Questions 1, 15, and 25 (Sept. 3, 1996); <span class="Italic">Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996211 (June 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is, however, substantial overlap between the two statutory schemes in their applications to real-life situations, a fact ignored by the Agency on appeal but readily understood by the agency officials who were carrying out Phase 1 of the NRP. They had carefully scrutinized the medical records of over 100,000 IOD employees. One of those records is the Form CA-17, a duty-status report form routinely used by the OWCP. It includes information concerning an injured employee's diagnosis, condition, and work restrictions. For example, the CA-17 from one of the Class Agent's anecdotal witnesses indicated that he was diagnosed with tendonitis of the rotator cuff and was restricted from lifting more than 10 pounds, kneeling, bending, stooping, and reaching above the shoulder. Another witness was diagnosed with severe carpal tunnel syndrome and also suffered from the residual effects of a back injury. He had medical restrictions that included sitting, pushing and pulling, and reaching above the shoulder. The CA-17 of a third witness indicated that he was diagnosed with a contusion of the lower back from which he experienced chronic pain, and was restricted in the activities of lifting more than 15 pounds, climbing, kneeling, twisting, and reaching above the shoulder. A fourth witness was diagnosed with repetitive motion injuries to the left shoulder, right arm, and right elbow, carpel tunnel syndrome, and nerve impingement within the rotator cuff. He was under restrictions that included intermittent walking, climbing, pulling, pushing, driving a vehicle, and operating machinery. All of these individuals were performing the functions of their limited duty or rehabilitation positions when they were assessed under the NRP. As can be seen from the foregoing examples, although the Form CA-17 is used for determining an IOD employee's eligibility for compensation under FECA, it can also constitute compelling <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that the employee in question has a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act. The presence of this form in the medical records of all those IOD employees is enough to raise the inference that a substantial number of those who were given new assignments or NWA determinations under the NRP were qualified individuals with disabilities. This is all that is required for a showing that the Class Agent's status as qualified individual with a disability extends to members of the class.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency contends that since eligibility for Rehabilitation Act protection requires an individualized inquiry, proof of one's status as a qualified individual with a disability cannot occur during the liability stage of a <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span>-type proceeding. Expecting every potential class member to undertake the individualized inquiry that the Rehabilitation Act requires during the liability phase of the <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span> process is inherently impractical, unworkable in practice, and would effectively bar the use of class complaints as a means of challenging workplace policies that discriminate against individuals with disabilities. Such a result would clearly be contrary to Congress's intent in enacting the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A far more efficient and effective way to resolve the individualized-inquiry dilemma is to require prospective class members to prove that they are qualified individuals with disabilities during the remedies phase of the <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span> proceeding, as opposed to the liability phase. The remedies stage is where proof of one's status as a qualified individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act naturally aligns with proof of one's membership in a class under <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span>. The Rehabilitation Act's jurisdictional requirement is just one more element of proof necessary to establish class membership and entitlement to relief. Assuming that prospective class members can prove that they were adversely affected by being assessed under the NRP, requiring them to also prove that they are qualified individuals with disabilities is the best way to ensure that only those who meet the Rehabilitation Act's prerequisite will be awarded a remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Velva B.</span> then turned its attention to the question of whether those management officials who spearheaded the program were unlawfully motivated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disparate treatment claims arise from language in the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibiting covered entities from classifying an employee in a way that adversely affects the opportunities or status of such employee. <span class="Italic">Hoffman v. Caterpillar, Inc.,</span> 256 F.3d 568, 572 (7th Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">citing</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.5. To prevail in a class claim of disparate treatment in connection with the NRP, the Class Agent would have to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other officials involved in the development and deployment of the NRP were motivated by unlawful considerations of the class members' disabilities when they subjected IOD employees to NRP assessments and took follow-up actions to those assessments under the auspices of the NRP. <span class="Italic">See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc</span>., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first step in that process would be for the Class Agent to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination. To do so, she must first demonstrate that the class members belong to a protected group. In light of our discussion above, we find that the Class Agent has met her burden by submitting CA-17 forms and other medical records pertaining to the IOD employees in limited duty and rehabilitation positions who were affected by the NRP. Given the extensive documentation of permanent and long-term impairments and limitations contained in those records, the likelihood that a substantial number of IOD employees were also qualified individuals with disabilities under the Rehabilitation Act is high. This is sufficient for the Class Agent to establish that the class members fall under the protection of the Rehabilitation Act, thereby clearing the first hurdle of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to protected-group membership, the Class Agent must show that the class members are similarly situated to employees outside of their protected group, and that they were treated differently than those employees. <span class="Italic">Idell M. v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132276 (Dec. 9, 2015), <span class="Italic">citing Potter v. Goodwill Industries of Cleveland, Inc.,</span> 518 F.2d 864, 865 (6th Cir. 1975). The facts will necessarily vary and the specification of <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> proof is not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802 n.13 (1973). Moreover, comparative evidence is only one way to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; there are other ways of making such a showing. <span class="Italic">Pruneda v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050014 (June 4, 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caters Corp</span>., 517 U.S. 308 (1996)) (reassigning only limited-duty letter carriers to an undesirable pre-dawn shift with extremely short notice).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency's own estimates, approximately 15,000 IOD employees received new assignments as a result of their. NRP assessments. Another 10,000 IOD employees received determinations of total or partial NWA, while another 34,000 IOD employees separated while the NRP was in effect. This means that thousands of IOD employees may have been adversely affected by being assessed under the NRP. This evidence is more than sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of class-wide disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1657"></span>The burden now shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for utilizing the NRP. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120184 (Aug. 6, 2015), <span class="Italic">citing Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). According to the HHR Manager and the WCO Director, the stated purpose of the NRP was to ensure that IOD employees were performing only work that was necessary to the Agency's mail delivery operations. We agree that, on its face, this reason is legitimate and nondiscriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To ultimately prevail, the Class Agent must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation for the NRP is pretextual, i.e., not the real reason but, rather, a cover for disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at 143; <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993). In this case, the Class Agent can demonstrate pretext by presenting documents or sworn testimony from other witnesses tending to show such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the legitimate reason proffered by the NRP's architects to justify that program's existence that a reasonable fact-finder could rationally find that ostensibly legitimate reason to be a sham. <span class="Italic">See Hicks, supra</span>, at 515; <span class="Italic">Burdine, supra; Opare-Addo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120060802 (Nov. 20, 2007), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080211 (May 30, 2008). Indicators of pretext can include discriminatory statements or past personal treatment attributable to the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, or others who supported and assisted in the implementation of the NRP; comparative or statistical data revealing differences in treatment across disability lines; unequal application of Agency policy; deviations from standard procedures without explanation or justification; or inadequately explained inconsistencies in the evidentiary record. <span class="Italic">Mellissa F. v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141697 (Nov. 12, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Pruneda v. United States Postal Service, supra</span>, noted above and explained in more detail here, the Commission found that the Agency had discriminated against the complainant on the basis of disability by reassigning her to a shift that started at 2:30 <span class="small">A.M</span>. The complainant was in a limited-duty position, having previously suffered on-the-job injuries to her shoulder and knee. She and many other limited-duty carriers had been reassigned by the Postmaster to the 2:30 <span class="small">A.M.</span> shift. The complainant alleged that the purpose behind the creation of this shift was to force injured carriers to resign, take disability retirement, or quit. The Commission found that the Postmaster who had created the shift had reviewed the Form CA-17's of the limited-duty and rehabilitation carriers, and had made the decision to reassign those carriers based on what was in those documents. The Postmaster had reassigned only limited-duty carriers, primarily selecting those who were clearly substantially limited in at least one major life activity. She had done this with extremely short notice, disregarding the protocol established by its applicable Employee and Labor Relations Manuals. The AJ found that the manner in which the Postmaster selected the workers for the 2:30 <span class="small">A.M</span>. shift was sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Ultimately, the Commission agreed with the AJ's finding of liability, noting that the Postmaster had accessed the Form CA-17's of limited-duty and rehabilitation carriers. The Commission found that this was enough to infer that the Postmaster had the requisite awareness of their disability status and the intent to act upon that awareness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the massive evidentiary record of statements made by various Agency officials in the instant case extensively documents the real reason for the NRP's existence, which was to move as many IOD employees as possible back to full duty in their pre-injury jobs or onto the OWCP rolls for eventual outplacement. As did the Postmaster in Pruneda, the hundreds of area and district managers who collectively implemented the NRP had reviewed the Form CA-17s and other confidential medical information of thousands of potentially disabled IOD employees, and had decided that they were going to take accommodations away from limited-duty and rehabilitation employees, without regard to whether they were qualified individuals with disabilities, on the basis of that information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the AJ in terms of how she characterized the purpose of the NRP as "morphing" from legitimate to unlawful. This was not a situation in which the purpose of the NRP started out as eliminating make-work and then "devolved" into removing IOD employees. Rather, as noted above, ample evidence establishes that moving limited-duty and rehabilitation employees off the IOD rolls, regardless of whether they were qualified individuals with disabilities, was the primary motivation that drove the HHR Manager and the WCO Director before the NRP was even contemplated. In implementing the NRP, these officials disregarded the Agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act, and had done so in a fashion that could only be described as cavalier. As far back as April 2001, representatives from the OWCP warned the HHR Manager that the Career Guidance and Placement Program for Injured Employees that he was championing at the time (a forerunner to the NRP), the purpose of which was to expand outplacement for partially disabled workers, "[went] far beyond the legal and organizational framework which supports the existing DOL/Agency rehabilitation agreement." The OWCP concluded that it was "unable to endorse this radical revision," explicitly warning the HHR Manager that his plan, if implemented, would result in a violation of the Rehabilitation Act and other statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are extensive email trails in which the HHR Manager and the WCO Director communicated to their superiors, including the Postmaster General, about how the NRP was going to reduce IOD rosters by thousands of likely-disabled employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Every one of these emails, and numerous others, lays bare the intensity with which the NRP teams at the Agency's headquarters, areas, and districts pursued their goal of reducing the IOD rolls. Their statements clearly and unequivocally contradict the stated explanation for the existence of the NRP as a means to eliminate unnecessary work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The intent to move IOD employees out of their limited-duty and rehabilitation jobs was reflected in comments made over the years not just by management, but by the rank and file as well. For instance, in an email exchange that occurred on September 14, 2004, while the pilot versions of the NRP were being implemented, the HHR Manager reported to the Postmaster General that 338 employees had been outplaced and that they had exceeded the goal of outplacing 317 employees, to which the Postmaster General replied, "338 it is and welcome to Walmart." In a slide-show presentation that occurred in February 2005, before the roll-out of the full program, the HHR Manager indicated that it was not just managers obsessing about reducing the ranks of IOD employees who thought the NRP was a good idea. The HHR Manager reported hearing comments that were hostile to IOD employees coming from non-IOD employees, including comments such as, "Way past due," "It's about time," "See you bums at Walmart," "Get rid of them all," and a reference to IOD employees as "dead weight." In an email to senior leadership dated March 14, 2007, the HHR Manager expressed concern that managers were sending employees home without those employees being assessed under the NRP. He warned against this practice, saying that employees would "go home, collect 75% of their salary tax free and believe once again that they have a free lunch."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and the Postmaster General all acknowledged in their depositions that, while the NRP was being undertaken, many employees had expressed fears that they would lose their jobs and would end up working at Walmart, which the HHR Manager characterized as "not the employer of choice." The WCO Director stated that he had encountered those concerns frequently, both from the unions and in employee town halls. According to a number of employees, the fear that people would lose their jobs as a result of the NRP was rampant, pervasive, and at times had been fueled by managers. One witness stated in response to an interrogatory that he was advised to retire early during an NRP meeting because he was "adding hours to the office budget," or words to that effect. Record at 16266. Perhaps one of the more telling incidents occurred in July of 2010. The NRP Team Leader of the Fort Worth District sent a congratulatory email to members of his team, in which he lauded them for reaching the goal of reducing "our current NRP employees on rolls by 25%." The background music used with the message was a song entitled, "Cripple Creek." Even the WCO Director admitted that it was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taken together, these numerous statements contradict the explanation of the NRP's purpose offered by its architects and advocates. These statements also critically undermine their credibility as witnesses. In addition, the record discloses a number of irregularities that cast further doubt upon the NRP as a means to eliminate "make-work." A report by a pair of industrial psychologists stated that the NRP had not been validated, that it lacked a reliable job-analysis component, that it had not been properly monitored or audited, that it was not interactive despite being described as such, and that it was not consistent with professional standards and guidelines pertinent to the development of human resource systems. A DAT member who was trained by the WCO Director testified that, during the training sessions, there was never any discussion of Agency policies other than the written NRP guidelines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The report from the industrial psychologists also stated that no standard was ever articulated for determining what constituted "necessary work." The WCO Director admitted in his deposition that the term "necessary work" was strictly a creature of the NRP. Neither the HHR Manager's successor, who took over towards the end of the NRP, nor the Human Resource Management Specialist, who worked with the HHR Manager and the WCO Director, were able to recall being given a definition of "necessary work." As noted above, several arbitrators had held in grievance proceedings that use of the so-called "necessary work standard" was in violation of the Agency's ELM-546 manual, which referred to "adequate" work, not "necessary" work. The practical effect of the NRP's failure to define "necessary work" is that the district NRP teams were left to decide on their own what work was necessary. This had consequences in that, after employees who were given NWA determinations had left the workroom floor, tasks that were thought to be "make work," such as mark-<span id="Page_1658"></span>ups, casing mail, making express mail deliveries, and other functions turned out to be essential to the timely processing and delivery of mail. None of that work disappeared after the IOD employees who had been doing it had left the premises. Other employees had to step in and take over, which left many facilities short-staffed. In turn, this led to slow-downs and bottlenecks in delivery operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The HHR Manager's successor, when asked whether the NRP was necessary, responded that, while it was still necessary to review job offers to ensure that work was still adequate, available, and consistent with employees' medical restrictions, it was not necessary to create a process and name it. She testified that she thought that the NRP was a return-to-work program that was never designed or intended to be a cost-saving measure. This was the view of the NRP taken by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as well. Her assessment is borne out by the fact that the payments the Agency had to make to the Department of Labor to cover its share of OWCP outlays had gone up over the life of the NRP, forcing the Agency to create a "return to work" initiative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This time frame virtually coincided with the years that the NRP was in existence. Between FY 2007 and FY 2011, the Agency's workers' compensation expenses increased from $880 million to $3.7 billion, an increase of 417%. The sharpest jump, an increase of $1.3 billion dollars, occurred between FY 2009 and FY 2010, not coincidentally the most active period of the NRP. What these figures make obvious is that the NRP did not even live up to its purpose of saving costs. The Agency's financial situation became so precarious that in December of 2012, the Postmaster General directed the Health and Resource Management Group to implement a nation-wide return-to-work initiative, pursuant to which injured employees who had the ability to work would be invited to return and would be given modified assignments. The goal of this initiative was to return 60% of the NWA employees to the Agency's active rolls.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A number of employees who were placed in NWA status had filed grievances challenging the actions that resulted from their NRP assessments, and had prevailed. The Arbitrators hearing those grievances found that in subjecting these employees to actions flowing from the assessments they received under the NRP, the Agency had violated Article 19 of the collective bargaining agreement by failing to adhere to the procedures specified in Agency manuals EL 307, EL 505 and ELM 546.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Class Agent testified that, during the NRP meeting that took place on May 19, 2006, neither she nor her Union Representative were given a chance to ask questions. The Union representative stated in a sworn declaration that there was no interactive discussion with the Class Agent regarding other jobs and tasks that she could perform. At the end of the meeting, the Class Agent was told to clean out her locker and was escorted off the premises. The escort took place in the presence of her colleagues, which she characterized as "about as hostile as you could get." She testified to being emotionally traumatized by the sudden and unexpected dismissal. The Class Agent's account of the incident is corroborated by that of her union representative, who notes that, in addition to the Class Agent, 20 other IOD employees who had received NWA determinations were escorted out in a similar fashion, and that they all had the same reaction. Finally, the Class Agent testified that the "make work" duties that she had been performing were still being done by other employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, while operating under the auspices of the NRP, the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other Agency officials who supported and assisted in implementing that program violated Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates by reference Sections 102(a) and 102(b)(1) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by classifying IOD employees who were qualified individuals with disabilities, including the Class Agent, in a way that adversely affected their opportunities and their status, as defined in Section 102(b)(1) of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We conclude that the Agency does not raise any genuine issue of material fact that would warrant a hearing on this issue. To be eligible for relief at the remedies stage of this proceeding, class members must establish that they are qualified individuals with disabilities. The Class Agent is eligible for immediate relief, having established that she is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Velva B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720160006 (2017), went on to find that modifying some disabled employee's duties and placing others on unpaid leave was effectively a withdrawal of reasonable accommodations without a showing of undue burden on the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Class Agent and her anecdotal witnesses were assessed under the NRP. As previously inferred from the NRP's statistics, tens of thousands of IOD employees were either given new assignments, placed on total or parti0al NWA status and removed from the rolls, had their hours reduced, or were separated during the NRP period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Americans with Disabilities Act provides two avenues of relief for qualified individuals with disabilities who have been denied reasonable accommodation. As used in Section 102(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the term "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability" includes:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;denying employment opportunities to an employee who is an otherwise qualified individual with a disability if such denial is based on the need of such covered entity to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental impairments of the employee or applicant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9. Section 102(b)(1)(A) of the Americans with Disabilities Act makes clear that the Agency is required to reasonably accommodate the known limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, unless it can show that doing so would cause an undue hardship to its operations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(o) and (p); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Enforcement Guidance), EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Oct. 17. 2002); <span class="Italic">Barney G. v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120400 (Dec. 3, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously noted, the Class Agent was a qualified individual with a disability who had been performing the essential functions of her position since she received the modified assignment in September 1999. On May 19, 2006, the Agency took her modified assignment away from her. The Agency's EEO Manager and an attorney-advisor who worked in the EEO Office both confirmed that the Class Agent's modified assignment could properly be characterized as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to justify its action under Subsection (A), the Agency must show that allowing the Class Agent to remain in her position would have caused an undue hardship to its mail delivery operations. "Undue hardship" means an action requiring significant difficulty or expense when considered in light of such factors as the nature and cost of the accommodation, the overall financial resources of the facility and the Agency, the size of the Agency, and the type of operation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(10); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p). As we have seen, the tasks the Class Agent was performing which the Agency characterized as "make work" under the NRP did not disappear when she went off the clock. That work was still being done, and being done by employees who were pulled from other jobs. This led to staff shortages that negatively impacted the flow of mail. The result of the Agency's removal of the Class Agent (and presumably other IOD employees) from the rolls under the NRP is that it clearly demonstrated that the animus directed toward reducing the IOD rolls was not driven by considerations of efficiency, as the Agency contends. We therefore find that the Class Agent established that the Agency unlawfully deprived her of a reasonable accommodation in violation of Section 102(b)(5)(A) of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102(b)(1)(B) prohibits denying employment opportunities to an employee who is an otherwise qualified individual with a disability if such denial is based on the need of such covered entity to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental impairments of the employee. <span class="Italic">Nawrot v. CPC Intern</span>, 259 F. Supp.2d 716, 724 (N.D. Ill. 2003). The regulations clarify that &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5)(B) requires a complainant to show that he or she was denied an employment opportunity because the employer knew the complainant would require a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(b). Not only was the Agency aware that the Class Agent, needed an accommodation, it was most likely aware that the Class Agent already had a reasonable accommodation by having reviewed her medical documentation. Despite the presence of clearly defined reasonable accommodation procedures set forth in EL-307, the Agency unilaterally withdrew the Class Agent's modified position without giving her any say in the matter. We find the WCO Director's response--that reasonable accommodations were available only for injuries that were non-work-related--to be completely lacking in credibility. Accordingly, we find that the Class Agent established that the Agency deprived her of the opportunity for ongoing gainful employment because, as an IOD employee, she was a qualified individual with a disability in need of a reasonable accommodation. The Agency's action was in violation of Section 102(b)(5)(B) of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains medical documents, depositions, interrogatories and other evidentiary records pertaining to approximately twenty witnesses who were members of the class. Like the Class Agent, they claimed that they were successfully performing the essential functions of their modified positions, yet preexisting reasonable accommodations were taken away from them as a result of the assessments they received under the NRP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that these witnesses and the thousands of other class members were qualified individuals with disabilities when they were assessed under the NRP, they were entitled to remain in their limited-<span id="Page_1659"></span>duty or rehabilitation positions unless the Agency could demonstrate that allowing them to do so would impose an undue hardship upon its operations. As can be seen from the statements of these witnesses, taking IOD employees out of their jobs resulted in decreased operational efficiencies and increased costs, which completely undercuts the Agency's undue hardship defense under Section 102(b)(5)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to its liability under Section 102(b)(5)(B), the Agency has no defense. As we found above, the driving force behind the NRP was not to eliminate unnecessary work. As reflected in the emails of the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other senior executives and managers involved, with the NRP, the driving force was to eliminate limited-duty and rehabilitation positions. As a policy, the NRP was an instrument that effectively deprived thousands of people of their livelihoods because of the need to work in modified positions. Based upon a review of the medical documentation of the Class Agent's anecdotal witnesses, we find that in all likelihood that many, if not most, of the class members were qualified individuals with disabilities who were successfully performing the essential functions of those positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Many employees who were given NWA determinations were told that they could not be reassigned to positions beyond a 50-mile radius from their current duty stations. Had the HHR Manager or the WCO Director consulted with the EEO Office at the inception of the NRP, they would have been informed that NWA employees had to be referred to a DRAC before being let go. The fact that the Agency started to do this in the latter years of the program's existence vindicated the concerns raised by the Agency's senior EEO officials. Record, pp. 13963-13964. The HHR Manager and the WCO Director would also have been informed that EL-307 and the Agency's guidance on reasonable accommodation made provisions for reassignments beyond the fifty-mile limit imposed under the NRP. Record at 13963-13964, 13969, 14973, 15199-15202.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that while operating under the auspices of the NRP, the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other Agency officials who supported and assisted in implementing that program violated Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates by reference Sections 102(a) and 102(b)(5) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by withdrawing modified work assignments that it had previously granted to IOD employees who are individuals with disabilities. In so doing, the Agency failed to make reasonable accommodations to the known limitations of otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities, as defined in Section 102(b)(5)(A). The Agency also denied employment opportunities to IOD employees who were qualified individuals with disabilities because of the need for reasonable accommodation, as defined in Section 102(b)(5)(B). We conclude that the Agency has not raised any genuine issue of material fact that would warrant a hearing on this issue. To be eligible for relief at the remedies stage of this proceeding, class members must establish that they are qualified individuals with disabilities. The Class Agent is eligible for immediate relief, having already established that she is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Velva B.</span> also found that agency's gathering and use of the OWCP forms and subsequent requests for updated medical documents during Phase 1 of the program was an impermissible medical inquiry in violation of the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A covered entity shall not make inquiries of an employee as to the nature or severity of the disability unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. 42 U.S.C. 12112(d)(4)(A); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13. The Americans with Disabilities Act, which applies to federal employees pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 prohibits disability-related inquiries, including inquires as to the nature and severity of a disability, unless such inquiries are shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance of Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 27, 2000). Furthermore, the restriction applies to all employees, not just those who can establish that they are qualified individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dept. of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131126 (Dec. 19, 2013); <span class="Italic">Hartless v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120101017 (June 4, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An inquiry is disability-related if it is likely to elicit information about a disability. <span class="Italic">See Torres v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120061190 (Feb. 6, 2008) (supervisor's contact with complainant's physician as to whether complainant could do his physical therapy at a VA medical center not job-related and consistent with business necessity); <span class="Italic">Chambliss v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A21179 (Mar. 19, 2003) (supervisor asking complainant to announce at staff meeting that she required hospitalization for bi-polar disorder not job-related and consistent with business necessity). Disability-related inquiries include asking employees to provide medical documentation regarding their disabilities. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries, supra</span>, at Question 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted extensively above, in Phase 1 of the NRP, teams gathered and scrutinized the medical records of over 100,000 IOD employees. Those records included statements of diagnoses and prognoses, Form CA-17's and other forms required by the Department of Labor for the purpose of obtaining workers' compensation benefits. According to a memorandum template entitled, "National Reassessment Process Phase 1," the goal of the process was to ensure that all limited duty and rehabilitation employees have "a current medical on file," and that teams of management members from operations, medical, labor relations, and injury compensation would be established to complete this process. Record at 12934. Step 5 of Phase 1 required medical staff to review such information from treating physicians as diagnosis and type of injury, and to direct employees to provide medical updates. Record at 12919, 12922-23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The form-letters and scripts mandated by the NRP leadership group at the Agency's headquarters explicitly called for IOD employees to be warned that if they did not submit updated medical information within two weeks of the request, their modified limited-duty and rehabilitation assignments might be withdrawn. Step 6 of Phase 1 required that managers determine appropriate action to be taken for those employees who fail to comply with requests for updated medical information. Record at 12920, 12945-51.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The inquiries carried out in accordance with Phase 1 of the NRP were not merely "likely" to elicit information about IOD employees' disabilities; they were guaranteed to elicit that information. The WCO Director himself confirmed the extensiveness of the NRP's recordkeeping operations and the thoroughness of its records. He described how a comprehensive file was maintained for each IOD employee that included anything related to the injury, including medical updates, from the time the injury was sustained until the present. Record at 13733. He emphasized that the medical documentation was key to everything that was done with the IOD' employees. Record at 13727.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no question that Phase 1 of the NRP meets the statutory definition of a disability-related medical inquiry. Indeed, by the WCO Director's own admission, this medical inquiry was part and parcel of the NRP; in fact, it was the NRP's central element. As such, it must be job-related and consistent with business necessity to be considered lawful. A disability-related medical inquiry is justified if the employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence that: an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries</span>, Question 5. Objective evidence is reliable information, either directly observed or provided by a credible third party that an employee may have or has a medical condition that will interfere with his or her ability to perform essential functions of the job or will result in a direct threat. <span class="Italic">O'Malley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal. No. 01994945 (Sept. 26, 2002) <span class="Italic">citing Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992683 (Nov. 21, 2001). <span class="Italic">See also Estate of Schauf v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A42440 (Jan. 26, 2006), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A60456 (Mar. 17, 2006); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120559 (Mar. 10, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not enough for a management official to merely suspect that an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job or poses a direct threat when ordering a medical inquiry. Such suspicions must be supported by enough documentation to establish that they are reasonable under the circumstances that the situation presents. Those responsible for implementing Phase 1 of the NRP based their inquiries solely on the status of the IOD employees as limited-duty or rehabilitation, without any evidence that those employees were not performing the essential functions of their positions or that they posed a direct threat to themselves or others by remaining in their positions. The Class Agent, the other anecdotal witnesses, and presumably the other class members were performing the essential functions of their positions when they were asked to submit medical documentation pursuant to steps 5 and 6 of Phase 1. Therefore, the Agency has not shown that Phase 1 of the NRP was job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, while operating under the auspices of Phase 1 of the NRP, the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other Agency officials who supported and assisted in implementing that program violated Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates by reference Section 102(d)(4)(A) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by subjecting IOD employees assessed under the NRP to a disability-related medical inquiry that was not job-related and consistent with business necessity. We conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists on this issue that would warrant a hearing. To be eligible for relief at the remedies stage of this proceeding, class members must show that they suffered compensable harm as a result of being subjected to the unlawful disability-related medical inquiry for which damages may be awarded. The Class Agent is eligible for immediate relief, having established that she was subjected to an unlawful disability-related medical inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent">And the agency violations in <span class="Italic">Velva B</span>. did not end there. The Commission <span id="Page_1660"></span>further found that the agency impermissibly disclosed the IOD employees' confidential medical information:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and by extension Section 501(g) the Rehabilitation Act, specifically prohibits the disclosure of medical information except in certain limited situations. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, Question 42 (Oct. 17, 2002). Information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of any employee is subject to the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of Paragraph (3). 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(C). In particular:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of the applicant is collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate files and is treated as a confidential medical record, except that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">i.&#x2003;Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">ii.&#x2003;First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">iii.&#x2003;Government officials investigating compliance with this chapter shall be provided relevant information on request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The results of such examination are used only in accordance with this subchapter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112 (d)(3); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c). To the disclosure exceptions listed in Section 102(d)(3), our policy guidance adds two more:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--The information may in certain circumstances be disclosed to workers' compensation offices or insurance carriers; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Agency officials may be given the information to maintain records and evaluate and report on the Agency's performance in processing reasonable accommodation requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Policy Guidance on Executive Order 13164: Establishing Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation, Question 20 (Oct. 20, 2000). All medical information that an Agency obtains in connection with a request for reasonable accommodation must be kept in files separate from the individual's personnel file. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Those who have access to employees' medical information may not disclose that information except under the five circumstances listed above. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with medical inquiries, the confidentiality requirement is not limited to individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">Pleasant v. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120083195 (July 2, 2012); <span class="Italic">Hampton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00132 (Apr. 13, 2000). Anyone whose confidential medical information has been disclosed in a manner other than pursuant to one of the five disclosure exceptions listed in the statute, the regulations or our policy guidance may bring an action for violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Social Security Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120110008 (Jan. 11, 2013) (the limited exceptions for disclosure apply to confidential medical information concerning any employee).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ based her finding of confidentiality breach on the fact that the NRP did not require the redaction of IOD employees' medical diagnoses prior to providing the NRP activity files to the DATs and other personnel charged with completing NRP objectives. The AJ noted that, in the absence of an explicit mandate to redact, some districts did so while at least one did not. Class Order, pp. 61-66. The Agency responded that the inclusion of a redacting requirement was not necessary, and that NRP teams were warned of Agency policies and procedures requiring redaction and did redact. The Agency contends that there was only one known incident of unauthorized disclosure in a single district office, and that there was no evidence of widespread unauthorized disclosure. For the reasons outlined below, we find that the Agency's breach of confidentiality of medical records extended far beyond mere failure to redact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission regards documentation of the individual's diagnosis or symptoms as confidential medical information. <span class="Italic">Tyson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992086 (Aug. 23, 2002), <span class="Italic">citing ADA Enforcement Guidance: Pre-Employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> n.26 (Oct. 10, 1995). In its response to the first set of interrogatories dated August 22, 2011, the Agency stated, incredibly, that records generated by Health and Resources Management that contain medical restrictions, such as the Form CA-17, are not medical records. A review of the Form CA-17 itself indicates otherwise. On question 5 of the form, the employee is asked to describe how the injury occurred and the parts of the body affected. Question 8 asks the physician whether the history of the injury given by the employee corresponds to the description in question 5. Question 9 asks for a description of clinical findings. Question 10, as we noted earlier, asks for a diagnosis due to the injury; and Question 11 asks about other disabling conditions. Form CA-17's thus contain information about symptoms and diagnoses, and therefore constitute medical records.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When asked in his deposition whether there were any guidelines about safeguarding the information in the medical records with Health and Resources Management, the HHR Manager replied that he did not recall. He also testified that the national medical director and national medical administrator were the two people responsible for safeguarding medical records. The National Medical Administrator testified that medical files were maintained in a double-locked facility and that files were in locked in rooms that were accessible only by occupational health personnel. He admitted, however, that NRP medical records were maintained by Injury Compensation. As the WCO Director himself acknowledged and as we reported above, those NRP files (the workbooks) contained extensive medical documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain language of Section 102(d)(3)(B) and the identically worded regulation in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c) unambiguously specify that medical information must be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files. <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Dept. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720120004 (Oct. 24, 2012). In <span class="Italic">Mayo</span>, we found that the Agency violated the confidentiality provision of the Rehabilitation Act when it placed the complainant's medical information, including information pertaining to his diagnosis, in an "adverse action" file maintained in its Office of Human Resource Management. We found it irrelevant that these adverse action files were restricted personnel files; they did not meet the statutory definition of separate medical files. Likewise, it did not matter that the Agency disclosed nothing in the complainant's files to any unauthorized third party. We held that the Agency's failure to maintain the complainant's medical information in separate medical files constituted a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the confidentiality clause of the Rehabilitation Act, even in the absence of unauthorized disclosure. In this case, it does not matter if no unauthorized persons accessed the NRP files, whether maintained in the Health and Resource Management office or in the NRP workbooks. The mere presence of medical information outside of areas separately designated for the purpose of maintaining confidential medical files is enough to trigger a violation of the confidentiality provision of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There were unauthorized disclosures, however: those that may have been mandated by NRP procedure and those that occurred due to lack of oversight, owing to the NRP's failure to include explicit instructions on maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of medical information. As to the first group of disclosures, Step 6 of Phase 1 required the collaboration of district medical staff, district injury compensation specialists, operations supervisors, and labor relations representatives in updating the NRP workbook corresponding to each IOD employee. Leaving aside the medical staff, who would have to evaluate the information as a matter of course, the only individuals who might have been eligible to access confidential medical information are the injury compensation specialists, who, if the circumstances are appropriate, would fall under the workers' compensation office exception. In this situation, however, they do not because, as we have already found, the NRP was discriminatory and therefore the results of the examinations of those records were not used in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as required by Section 102(d)(3)(C) thereof. The other two groups, the operations specialists and the labor relations specialists, do not fall within any of the five excepted categories. A technician who worked on preparing NRP workbooks confirmed that medical documentation that indicated that an IOD employee had permanent restrictions was included in those files. When asked whether there were any other employees who were involved in creating them, she responded that two postmasters would come in from the field and help with them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of equally great concern are the rampant reports of confidential medical files being left on supervisors' desks, on copy machines, in the trash, and otherwise not properly secured. The Commission has found confidentiality breaches in a wide variety of circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. Social Security Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120110008 (Jan. 11, 2013) (leaving copy of complainant's report of asthma attack on copier raises genuine issue of material fact whether violation occurred); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073097 (Jan. 11, 2011) (release of medical records to state court in response to a subpoena in a civil action); <span class="Italic">Philbert v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720090041 (May 5, 2010) (supervisor twice accessed complainant's medical records without complainant's knowledge or authorization); <span class="Italic">Grazier v. Dept. of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102711 (Sept. 30, 2010) (disclosure of complainant's medical records to union steward where complainant had not asked for union representation and objected to union steward's presence at conference); <span class="Italic">Scott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120103590 (Sept. 19, 2012) and <span class="Italic">Young v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112626 (Oct. 3, 2011) (disclosure of complainant's confidential medical information to others present at investigative interview); and <span class="Italic">Tyson v. U.S. Postal Service, supra</span>, (manager mailed letters to 32 postmasters at other facilities that disclosed medical diagnosis and symptoms, notwithstanding that breach was part of manager's effort to find vacant position for complainant). In each of these situations, with the exception of the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> case, medical <span id="Page_1661"></span>records that were otherwise maintained in secure areas were disclosed due to a mistaken belief that it was appropriate to do so. In other words, the records were under control, but were released due to errors of judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What we have here, by contrast, are reports from all over the country of medical files containing Form CA-17's and other confidential medical information being left in open, freely accessible areas. Witnesses from Florida, Illinois, Washington State, California, and Maryland all reported that they had seen their confidential medical information lying around in publicly accessible areas and unlocked rooms, such as supervisors' desks, copy machines, and the workroom floor, and that this was going on "all the time." A witness from Illinois reported that supervisors in his facility would have employees in modified positions making copies of other employees' medical records, and that he found a copy of his Form CA-17 that was made by another employee in a trash can. Witnesses from Washington State and California testified that their supervisors had not only their files with Form CA-17's in it but those of other people as well strewn all over their desks. The California witness also averred that her supervisor would put the files in the top drawer of his desk, where people looking for a rubber band or a paper clip could go into that drawer and easily access those files. Another witness from California stated that she had observed Form CA17s left sitting out on fax machines for days, and that such occurrences were happening all the time. A witness from Baltimore reported that her medical records had actually disappeared, and that after she had painstakingly reproduced them, they had "miraculously" reappeared. She also reported that she did not think anyone continued to lock up the folders. Contrary to the Agency, we find that these were not isolated occurrences, but rather were commonplace across many districts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that while operating under the auspices of the NRP, the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other Agency officials who supported and assisted in implementing that program violated Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates by reference Sections 102(d)(3)(B) and (d)(3)(C), and Section 102(d)(4)(C) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by failing to maintain the confidentiality of the medical records of IOD employees who were assessed under the NRP. We conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists on this issue that would warrant a hearing. To be eligible for relief at the remedies stage of this proceeding, class members must show that they suffered compensable harm as a result of having the confidentiality of their medical information compromised. The Class Agent is eligible for immediate relief because she has established that the confidentiality of her medical records was compromised as a result of Phase 1 of the NRP.</p>
