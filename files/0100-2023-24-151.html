<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-128b"><span class="space">1.</span> Chemical/Fragrance/"Smell"-Free Environments</h4>
<p class="noindent">Providing employees with a fragrance-free workplace is difficult, at best, and often impossible. In <span class="Italic">Garvich v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a43925.txt">01A43925</a> (2005), the Commission found that the agency did not fail to reasonably accommodate the complainant with a fragrance-free workplace where it took several other measures to reduce the complainant's exposure to fragrances. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Garvich</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency denied complainant's specific request for an entirely fragrance-free workplace, we find that they nevertheless engaged in the interactive process with complainant by offering her alternatives. For instance, the Plant Manager (P1) stated that complainant was allowed to move any time she felt a fragrance was bothering her. Complainant's supervisor (S1) also indicated that complainant was allowed to move freely about the center, in order to accommodate her fragrance sensitivity. S1 additionally stated that safety talks were given in which all employees were educated "to the sensitivities of others, on the need to be very mindful of wearing strong fragrances."<span class="Italic"> </span>S1 further stated that employees wearing a scent that is particularly overbearing are asked to wash it off or go home and change if it is in their clothing.<span class="Italic"> </span>S1 additionally stated that the General Rules of the Chattanooga REC advise employees to avoid strong fragrances.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Additionally, S1 stated that complainant was asked whether she would like to try wearing a mask, however, complainant stated that she did not think it would work and felt it would subject her to more ridicule. Finally, complainant herself stated that she was offered, but declined, the opportunity to move to a different site where there was not a smell. We note that complainant does not dispute that such accommodations were in place, or were offered to her. She simply insists that what she needed was an entirely fragrance-free environment, and that what the agency offered her was insufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, evidence of record indicates that complainant's doctor also wanted complainant to be in a fragrance-free environment due to her medical condition. Yet the record is devoid of medical evidence to indicate that the alternative accommodations offered and/or provided by the agency would be ineffective for complainant. For instance, complainant contends that moving site to site is ineffective because no spot will guarantee she will be away from fragrance. Complainant has failed, however, to submit evidence in support of her claim that the proposed accommodation of moving her to another site would be ineffective for her. We find this case to be similar to <span class="Italic">Lipstein v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A40380 (March 30, 2005), where an employee who had chemical sensitivity requested, as an accommodation, that the agency implement a policy limiting or restricting the use of perfume/cologne. In <span class="Italic">Lipstein,</span> the Commission found that the agency had supplied complainant with a reasonable accommodation when: (1) complainant requested not to work with an individual whenever possible, and the agency allowed complainant or the individual to move to another job; and (2) the agency requested that employees tone down their usage of cologne/perfume.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 2. Similarly here, in the absence of compelling evidence that all of the accommodations offered to complainant were ineffective, we find that the agency supplied complainant with at least one reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120131192 (2015), the Commission found that the agency reasonably accommodated the complainant's chemical sensitivity by providing her with an alternative workspace even though that space also created some inconvenience for her:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we will assume without finding that Complainant is an individual with a disability. Complainant contends that from February through April 2012, the Agency denied her request to keep a normally secured door open for air circulation, and that the employee be asked to stop wearing the perfume. The record establishes that on February 22, 2012, the day of Complainant's allergic reaction, S1 asked the employee to stop wearing the perfume that was making Complainant have an allergic reaction. This is supported by a statement the employee provided which confirmed that S1 asked her to stop wearing the perfume. Additionally, with regard to the secure door, the record shows that Complainant sent an email to S1 asking if the door could be opened for air circulation, and S1 responded that keeping the door open may not be enough. S1 asserts that this was not a denial of her request, and instead was part of an ongoing conversation that perhaps the allergy attack in February was not an isolated incident and required her to go to a doctor to determine what, if anything, was needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that S1 asked Complainant on many occasions what they could do to help her, and Complainant responded that she did not know what could be done. S1 then asked for Complainant to go to a doctor to help her identify things that could be done in the workplace to help prevent any future allergic reactions. Further, Complainant stated in the record that at the time she did not know about her right to request a reasonable accommodation or how to make a request for an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act when it did not specifically respond in the affirmative to Complainant's request to open a door that was normally kept closed for security reasons. We note that at the time Complainant made the request, she had one allergic reaction and it was not clear if this was an isolated incident or a disability that required an accommodation. Further, the record establishes that at the time the Agency engaged in the interactive process by asking Complainant if there was anything that could be done and asking her to go to a doctor to determine if any changes were needed in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, S1 appropriately contacted the DEPM for assistance to determine whether Complainant needed a reasonable accommodation. Since the need for an accommodation was not obvious and Complainant told her that she didn't know if there was anything that could be done to accommodate her in the workplace, we find that S1 and the DEPM appropriately asked Complainant to provide medical documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant did not provide the medical documentation until May 15, 2012. The record shows that once the Agency was provided with the documentation, it processed Complainant's request and provided her with the accommodations in a reasonable time. Complainant was on leave from Memorial Day until June 11, 2012. Complainant was notified on June 5, 2012, that she would receive the accommodations listed in the medical documentation, and she was provided those accommodations upon her return to the office on June 11, 2012.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, Complainant contends that the accommodations provided were not effective. Specifically, Complainant contends that the isolated <span id="Page_1395"></span>office to which she was moved made it inconvenient to do her job as she was far away from the printer and fax machine, and she was isolated from her coworkers. We note that Complainant is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, and an employer may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Guidance), No. 915.002, Question 9 (rev. October 17, 2002). Here, the office the Agency provided Complainant was in conformance with Complainant's medical documentation. While the isolated office may have been an inconvenience to Complainant, it was an effective accommodation because it allowed her to perform the essential functions of her position. Additionally, Complainant stated in the record that since being in the isolated office her allergies were better. As a result, we find that the Agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>

<p class="noindent">Citing to Commission precedence, the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Corazon P. v.

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant requested reasonable accommodations when she asked the Agency to provide her with an alcohol-free work environment and to permit her to telework on a full-time basis. We assume for purpose of analysis only, without so finding, that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the relevant period, the Agency attempted to accommodate Petitioner's medical condition by advising employees to limit use of alcohol products; permitting Petitioner to move her work location to a different cubicle that was more secluded and outside of the normal office traffic to limit her exposure; and permitting Petitioner to post signs in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent Petitioner argues that the Agency failed to accommodate her by providing an alcohol-free work environment, we find that the Agency could not have provided her with the alcohol-free environment that she wanted. <span class="Italic">Roberts v.

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wilson v.

The complainant, a safety occupational health manager, was required to conduct site visits and maintain personal contacts--functions that the Commission agreed were essential to her position. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, found that the agency had taken measures to reduce odors in the workplace and engaged in the interactive process, but the complainant was not qualified because she could not perform the essential job functions even with the requested accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission endorsed a trial period to allow the complainant time to try out a specific type of respirator to reduce inhalation of the chemicals used to wash animals at a USDA facility in <span class="Italic">Tyson A. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2020000972 (2021). There, the Commission found that the agency's refusal to allow such a trial period resulted in a failure to accommodate. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Tyson A.</span> also addressed other reasonable accommodation options for employees with respiratory conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that he first requested a reasonable accommodation for his breathing problems on August 23, 2018, when he submitted his workers' compensation claim and a doctor's note to his manager. While the instant record does not include a copy of the August 23, 2018 note, Complainant attested that it stated that he could not be exposed to the chemicals used to wash animal carcasses because the chemicals caused him respiratory distress. Similarly, the Agency described the note as explaining Complainant could not work on the slaughter floor where certain chemicals were used and sprayed. However, instead of treating the note as a reasonable accommodation request, the Agency considered the note to be a prohibition on working the slaughter floor and sent Complainant home. Based on the limited evidence before us, we find the Agency's failure to view the August 23, 2018 information as a request for an accommodation to be rational.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the immediate weeks that followed, Complainant remained at home and again communicated a need for an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 25, 2018, the Agency confirmed receipt of Complainant's request to use a "mask/respirator while working to inhibit/limit exposure to peracetic acid and lactic acid washes used on animal carcasses" as well as a medical release for Complainant's pulmonologist (hereinafter "Dr. H"). In an October 15, 2018 email, Complainant followed up with the Agency, plainly stating "I am formally requesting, again, a work accommodation." Attached to the email was a note from Dr. H stating: "It is reasonable to try the respirator in the work setting, to see if you would tolerate working in that setting without an exacerbation of your airway disease while working." Complainant's doctor also advised that the respirator should be fit-tested to ensure inhaled air only flowed through the filter. It was not until October 22, 2018, that the Agency issued a response to Complainant's repeated requests for a respirator. In the email from the Human Resources Specialist/Reasonable Accommodation Advisor (hereinafter "RA-Advisor"), Complainant was informed that his request for a respirator was denied because an Agency review concluded "there is no evidence that demonstrates significant inhalation exposure to the employees at the establishment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's attorney then made efforts to obtain an accommodation for him, writing to RA-Advisor on October 25, 2018, clarifying any early confusion over the August 23, 2018 note from Dr. H by stating that Complainant was not prohibited from working on the slaughter floor, but instead needed to mitigate his inhalation exposure. Additionally, the email noted that Complainant was eager to return to work and could provide his own respirator, but asked what other options the Agency was considering.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a brief email, sent on November 2, 2018, Complainant's manager (hereafter "Manager-Y") notified Complainant that the Agency would be able to provide Complainant with a respirator. The record reflects that when Complainant returned to work on November 9, 2018, he was given Respirator-2 which Complainant rejected as ineffective. While the Agency contends that Complainant failed to provide any reason, the record shows otherwise. Quite simply, Respirator-2 only filtered particulate matter, and it did not filter chemical gases and vapors. Respirator-2 would not provide Complainant with the necessary protection against irritant chemicals. Further, the Agency made no effort to ensure the respirator fit properly. In contrast, a "Safety Half Facepiece Disposable Respirator Assembly" was specifically labeled for use with organic vapor and acid gas and endorsed by Complainant's pulmonologist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Correspondence from Complainant's attorney reiterated the failings of Respirator-2 and sought an explanation for the Agency's rejection of Respirator-1. The efforts to obtain a solution that would return Complainant to work were met with a brief November 16, 2018 email, from Manager-Y, stating that he was "in the process of researching a few questions" and would be "in touch."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 27, 2018, Complainant received an email from Manager Y, as well as a "Denial of Reasonable Accommodation Request" form. In the email, Manager reasoned that providing Respirator-1 "would be an undue burden because it is a safety hazard while performing his animal slaughter duties as well as concerns with complying with OSHA's regulatory requirements."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The denial form provided further details for the denial. For example, the Agency cited FOH's finding that Respirator-1 was "problematic" due to Complainant's other heart and lung conditions. Additionally, the use of Respirator-1 "has the potential to interfere with his ability to look down and completely visualize his work area when using his knife." According to the denial, the size and shape of Respirator-1 "has the potential to interfere with Complainant's head movement and mobility" which is a "potential hazard to himself and co-workers" since the workplace included machinery with moving parts, moving vehicles, and slippery surfaces. Finally, the Agency stated that, based on pictures and the description of Respirator-1, it would significantly interfere with Complainant's ability to orally communicate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, once the Agency became aware that Complainant was requesting a reasonable accommodation it was required to engage in the interactive process. This informal, interactive process should be a problem-solving approach that includes: an analysis of the job to determine its essential functions; consultations with the complainant; an assessment of the effectiveness of potential accommodations; and consideration of the complainant's preferences. 29 C.F.R. pt.1630, app. &#x00A7; 1630.9. The exact nature of this dialogue will vary according to the particular circumstances. <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities <span id="Page_1396"></span>Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915-002 (March 1, 1999), pg. 13. In the instant case, the Agency failed to participate in this necessary exchange of information, which resulted in the improper denial of a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's own internal Reasonable Accommodation Procedures, which it has submitted on appeal, state that the interactive process is "extremely important" as is timeliness in processing requests. Yet, the Agency's actions in this case fail to abide by its own policies. More than one month after Complainant's first requests, the Agency simply denied the presence of harmful irritants and the need for any protective equipment. Its determination illustrates the absence of any individualized assessment, and ignored the information repeatedly put forth by Complainant, including medical documentation, regarding the ineffectiveness of Respirator-2 and the benefits of Respirator-1. Moreover, when the Agency finally issued a formal denial of Respirator-1, its reasons were woefully inadequate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to FOH's concerns that the use of Respirator-1 was "problematic" due to Complainant's other medical conditions, we find these reasons are unsubstantiated. Dr. H repeatedly stated that it was "reasonable" and "worthwhile" for Complainant to try Respirator-1 in the work setting, believing that Complainant could tolerate the use without any adverse health effects. Quite plainly, Dr. H's notes reflect that he informed Agency officials that Complainant's "underlying cardiac and pulmonary conditions alone or in combination did not preclude use of a respirator." Using a possible accommodation for a limited trial period is often part of the ongoing interactive process and can be a path towards identifying an effective accommodation. Here, the Agency ignored such recommendations to test Complainant's use of Respirator-1 on the slaughter floor and instead put forward theoretical and speculative concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fears that Respirator-1 would compromise Complainant's field of vision or ability to orally communicate with colleagues, putting himself and others in harm's way, could have easily been addressed by simply testing out the device.3</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's November 27, 2018 denial also indicates that evaluating Respirator-1 during a trial period would require compliance with OSHA standards and thus result in an "undue burden" for the Agency. According to the Agency, in order to permit Complainant even trial use of Respirator-1 it would have to "establish and implement a written respiratory protection program, including the medical evaluation component, training, cleaning/storage/maintenance of the respirator" since it presently did not have such a program. We find troubling the Agency's reasoning that the lack of a current written respiratory policy rises to the level of an undue hardship, thereby excusing the Agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An "undue hardship" is a significant difficulty or expense in light of the agency's circumstances and resources. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p). The agency bears the burden of establishing, through case-specific evidence, that a reasonable accommodation would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. at 402. "Generalized conclusions will not suffice to support a claim of undue hardship." <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (October 17, 2002), "Undue Hardship Issues." The Agency has not shown that use of Respirator-1 would create an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to not establishing that Respirator-1 was ineffective, the Agency failed to properly consider possible alternative reasonable accommodations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, Complainant's preferred accommodation was containment of the irritant chemicals by spraying them within a fume hood or cabinet, rather than in the open where a fan blew the chemicals to Complainant's work area. While the Agency asserts on appeal that it does not control the facilities where Agency employees perform their inspection duties, correspondence between Complainant and the Agency's Occupational Safety and Health Specialist reflects that the Agency is still obligated to provide its employees with safe and healthy working conditions. There is no evidence that the Agency even raised the matter with the plant's management or owner.4</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also suggested he return to a facility he had previously worked, in Arcadia or Barron, Wisconsin, where the irritants were not used or were contained. The Agency counters, on appeal, that it could not detail Complainant to the alternative facilities because doing so would impact his pre-existing accommodations. Instead, the option should have been explored during the interactive process. As noted by Complainant, on appeal, implicit with his suggestion was that it was compatible with his other accommodations.5</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Again, if the Agency had made good faith efforts to engage in the interactive process these options would have been assessed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, by failing to prove that the reasonable accommodations proposed by Complainant and his doctor would be ineffective or create an undue hardship the Agency erred in considering reassignment. Generally, reassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort and should be considered only when (1) there are no effective accommodations that would enable an employee to perform the essential functions of his or her current position or (2) accommodating the employee in the current position would cause an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. Part 1630. App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n); Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation, "Reassignment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our finding that the Agency failed to make good faith efforts to reasonably accommodate Complainant, we will remand the matter for a supplemental investigation into whether Complainant is entitled to compensatory damages. Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, compensatory damages may be awarded for pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life.6</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the instant EEO complaint is limited to consideration of Rehabilitation Act violations, medical documentation within the instant record indicates that workplace exposure to the chemical irritants caused Complainant's impairment.</p>
