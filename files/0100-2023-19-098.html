<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-91"><span class="space">F.</span> REBUTTING MIXED MOTIVE EVIDENCE</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rebutting direct or mixed motive evidence of discrimination is not the same as rebutting a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on circumstantial evidence. The agency must do more than simply proffer a legitimate reason for its action. The burden that must be met by the agency is one of persuasion and not production. An agency cannot rebut direct evidence of discrimination simply by asserting that the complainant was a "limited appointee" and could be terminated at will. <span class="Italic">Maryland v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01882992 (1989). The agency had the burden of showing that it would not have renewed the complainant's appointment even absent prohibited discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Several of the cases discussed below use a preponderance of the evidence standard in discussing the burden that shifts to the agency to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. However, more recent cases use a clear and convincing evidence standard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>. <span class="Italic">Arroyo v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120121771 (2012). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120130238 (2015) ("If an agency is able to show by clear and convincing evidence that an individual would not have been selected for a position even absent discrimination, the complainant is not entitled to personal relief, i.e., damages, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, back pay, but may be entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees or costs.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether an agency demonstrated that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination, the Commission will examine not only the agency's reasons but the factual circumstances surrounding the action. A good example of the specific application of the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> mixed motives analysis involved a case where there was significant evidence of social bias against the complainant because of his physical disability, but the agency contended it proposed his removal for falsification of his employment application. In <span class="Italic">Wrigley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01920476 (1993), the Commission found the agency's threat to remove the complainant or place him on disability retirement constituted a constructive discharge. After determining that social bias was a "substantial motivating factor" in the agency's action, the Commission applied the mixed motive analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the RD that appellant's disability was a substantial motivating factor, rendering applicable the mixed motive analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 109 S. Ct. 1775 (1989). The record reflects that the MCS, who concurred in the decision to terminate appellant's employment, more likely than not stated to appellant and the union steward that if he knew of appellant's CF [cystic fibrosis] and were in a position to hire, he would not have hired appellant and would have invoked another reason to mask his real reason. This statement reflects a strong stereotype that people with CF should not be hired, even when individual circumstances demonstrate that they are capable of working. This stereotype suggests that the MCS decided to terminate appellant because of his <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> We find that this bias influenced the concurrence and probably also affected the decision of the Station Manager. The Station Manager's statement that he did not think appellant could perform his job demonstrates a finding contrary to the record evidence and a disability bias.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the agency officials who conducted the November 1989 investigatory meeting exhibited a discriminatory bias which probably colored their investigation and their presentation of findings to the Station Manager. First, their statements suggest such a bias. The record reflects that while the Director denied saying that appellant was costing the agency too much money because of his absences, the testimony to the contrary by appellant and the union steward leads us to doubt the truth of the denial. We find that this statement suggests a desire to discharge appellant based on his disability. Additionally, the Postmaster's statements suggest a fear that because of the generality that people with CF die in their twenties and appellant was age 26, it was best to terminate his employment then, rather than later when his condition would most likely deteriorate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the record reflects that a decision was made to terminate appellant's employment prior to the completion of the falsification investigation. That appellant was not told that the meeting would address the alleged falsification suggests a lack of interest in deciding the truth of the falsification charge. Additionally, several agency officials testified that the September 1989 handwritten comments, which purportedly preceded the termination decision, suggested that the termination decision had already been made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the issue of whether appellant established constructive discharge (actually, being forced to take disability retirement) causally connected to his disability. The record reflects that appellant was forced to choose between accepting disability retirement and being discharged. Accordingly, appellant was constructively discharged. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Love v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05903553 (March 5, 1991) (forcing an employee to choose between resignation and termination constitutes constructive discharge). Additionally, in light of our discussion above, we find that appellant's disability was causally connected to the forced retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, the burden shifts to the agency to show that, absent the disability factor, it would have taken the actions it took, i.e. terminating appellant's employment and then forcing him to take disability retirement. The agency argued that appellant falsified his medical certificate and that this required termination because it reflected on his lack of integrity. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the agency did not meet its burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that a finding of falsification required intentionally giving false answers. We note preliminarily that while the notice of termination did not cite two of the allegedly falsified answers reported by the Postmaster (regarding impairments which would interfere with work and appellant's assessment of his health), neither of them evidenced intentional falsification. Moreover, there is no evidence of intentional falsification concerning almost all of the remaining answers cited in the notice of termination, suggesting that the falsification determination was not seriously considered. The record does not reflect that appellant ever had a heart murmur. Additionally, while the agency indicated that appellant said he had been seeing a physician for the last several years for his CF, it is not clear that appellant's comment referred to the period prior to his completing the medical form. Additionally, appellant explained that he considered CF a "condition," and the record does not reveal any <span id="Page_766"></span>major "illnesses," associated with CF or otherwise, within the five years prior to completing the form. Nor does the record reflect that he had other illnesses not listed. Appellant reflected his digestive problem by indicating that he was taking medication for it, and he also indicated that he had an x-ray in the past. Furthermore, appellant testified that the digestion medication was commonly associated with CF, giving credence to his contention that he discussed CF with the contract physician when they were discussing the medication. Accordingly, not only does the evidence suggest that appellant did not intentionally answer questions falsely, but that he did not try to hide his CF. In fact, the Postmaster testified that appellant told employees that he had a terminal condition. Additionally, while the agency's secretary did not corroborate appellant's testimony that she advised him not to reveal too much information, her partially contradictory testimony about discussing the medical questions lends some credibility to appellant's testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The one answer that reflects intentional falsification is the answer to the question about seizures. Having telephoned his mother, appellant knew that they occurred. Nonetheless, appellant explained that the seizures happened a long time before and, accordingly, he had reason to believe that they would not recur. Appellant also claimed, albeit without corroboration by the secretary, that the secretary advised him to change his initial answer to the question. As indicated above, the secretary's denial of appellant's claim is not entirely credible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency did not prove that it would have taken the actions it did absent the handicap factor. We make this finding in light of the agency's sketchy account of the reasons appellant provided at a meeting whose purpose was not revealed to him, the agency's citing of falsification findings not supported in the record, the circumstances surrounding the seizure question, and the strong evidence of a desire to remove appellant because of his CF. We also note that the agency did not supply evidence of similarly situated employees who were treated similarly.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that once the complainant sustains his or her burden in a mixed motive case, the Commission then examines the agency's purported reasons for acting on the merits. It no longer suffices for the agency simply to advance a legitimate reason for its actions. It must prove those reasons by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In many ways, the Commission's examination of the agency's defense resembles the factual examination it conducts during the pretext stage of circumstantial evidence cases. The agency's reasons will be examined in light of whether they make sense and whether they are contradicted by other evidence on the record. The difference is that, unlike cases involving pretext, it is the agency that bears the burden of proof. In <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Postmaster General</span>, 01941054 (1994), the Commission demonstrated another application of the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a mixed motive analysis is indicated where there is direct evidence that discrimination was a motivating factor in the relevant employment decision<span class="Italic">. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989). (Footnote omitted.) Direct evidence is "[e]vidence which, if believed, proves the existence of the fact in issue without inference or presumption." Black's Law Dictionary 413-14 (5th ed. 1979); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Randle v. LaSalle Telecom., Inc.</span>, 876 F.2d 563, 569 (7th Cir. 1989). One court found direct evidence of age discrimination where there was evidence that an employer wrote and stated that he was looking for a young man to fill the position at issue, and that the employer made comments involving age-based stereotypes<span class="Italic">. Grant v. Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp.</span>, 880 F.2d 1564 (2d Cir. 1989). The Commission has found direct evidence of discrimination for the purposes of this analysis, where there was testimony by more than one witness that a supervisor made racially derogatory comments about the race of complainant and others, and that this discrimination contributed to the challenged employment decision<span class="Italic">. Winnie v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890969 (June 28, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, discriminatory remarks, unrelated to the challenged employment decision, are not direct evidence of intentional discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J. concurring) (these "stray remarks" in the workplace, while perhaps probative of unlawful discrimination, are not direct evidence); <span class="Italic">Randle</span>, 876 F.2d at 569 (7th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Furr v. AT&#x0026;T Technologies, Inc.</span>, 824 F.2d 1537, 1549 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Montgomery Ward &#x0026; Co.</span>, 823 F.2d 793, 797 (4th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a conclusion is made that an impermissible factor, such as gender, played a motivating part in an employment decision, the burden then shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not considered the impermissible factor<span class="Italic">. Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 249, 258. This shifting of the burden of proof is said to be justified because the employer has been shown to be a wrongdoer, acting out of a motive that is declared illegitimate by Congress, and creating a risk that legal and illegal motives cannot be separated<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 250. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that there is direct evidence of discrimination in this case. Although the Postmaster did not admit telling appellant that she would have to be "a little less pregnant" before he would consider training her for the 204-B position, his affidavit strongly suggests that he made a comment to her relating to her pregnancy that she "took out of context. (Footnote omitted.) He further admits telling her that "it would not be a good time to start training her because she would be off for at least 6 [weeks] and we would have to start all over training her," a comment clearly relating to appellant's pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the burden of proof shifts to the agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not considered appellant's pregnancy, that is, the agency must demonstrate that, in the absence of sex/pregnancy as a motivating factor, it would have denied appellant the opportunity to begin 204-B training. To that end, the agency, through the Postmaster, contended that appellant was not selected because she had an attitude that "was not conducive of a person wanting to be trained as a 204-B." The Postmaster cited appellant's remark that she would "tell the public how sorry the Post Office was" as an example of her bad attitude. The Postmaster further stated, however, that appellant made that remark after he told her that she could not start 204-B training because she was near the end of her pregnancy. The Commission does not find that appellant's comments in this context constitutes evidence of a bad attitude sufficient to justify the agency's decision not to provide her with 204-B training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency offered two other reasons for denying appellant's request for training. First, the Postmaster stated that he did not need another person trained to perform the 204-B position because two female employees and one male employee were trained for the job. Second, he stated that because appellant would be leaving on maternity leave soon after training started, she would have to be retrained after she returned. The Commission finds that the record does not support the agency's position that either of these reasons constitutes a sufficient motivating and legitimate basis for the agency's decision. In this regard, we find that the agency failed to present any evidence supporting the Postmaster's limitation on the number of employees who could be trained to perform the 204-B position. Similarly, the agency did not present any evidence to support its contention that the training an employee receives to perform the 204-B position precluded appellant from being trained before she left the work site on maternity leave or that she would have to be retrained once she returned to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another mixed motive case, the Commission found that the complainant was issued a removal notice because he was intoxicated, and not because of discrimination, and he was thus not entitled to damages. But, in that same case, <span class="Italic">Cody v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950574 (1996), the Commission also found that the agency violated Title VII because of the supervisor's comments that he was "going to get that sorry ass white drunk out of here," and that the complainant was an "old sorry white drunk" or a "sorry ass white boy." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cody</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Cases in which the employer acts on the basis of both lawful and unlawful reasons are known as "mixed motive" cases. In <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 252 (1989), the Supreme Court ruled that when a complainant has shown that an impermissible factor played a role in an adverse employment decision, the burden shifts to the agency to show that it would have made the same decision absent the unlawful factor. The Court also found that if the agency met its burden, it could avoid altogether a finding of liability on the discrimination charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 237.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 107 (1991), effectively overruled that part of the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> which allowed the agency to avoid liability by showing that it would have made the same decision even absent the unlawful discrimination. In these cases, the CRA specifically provides that a complainant may be entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs. The CRA further provides, however, that when the employer demonstrates that it would have made the same decision even absent the unlawful discrimination, the complainant is not entitled to damages, reinstatement, hiring, promotion or backpay. Because the events at issue in this case occurred after the enactment of the CRA, we apply those amendments related to the mixed motive analysis to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, a complainant must present direct evidence to invoke a mixed motive analysis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wilson v. Firestone Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.</span>, 932 F.2d 510, 514 (6th Cir. 1991). Direct evidence may be any written or verbal policy or statement made by an employer that on its face demonstrates a bias against a protected group and is linked to the adverse action complained of. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC "Revised <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance On Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory</span>," No. N-915.002 (July 7, 1992) (Part III Proving Disparate Treatment Through Direct Evidence). The Commission has found direct evidence of discrimination when there was testimony by more than one witness that a supervisor made racially derogatory comments about the race of the complainant and others, and that this <span id="Page_767"></span>discrimination contributed to the challenged employment decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Winnie v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span>, EEOC Request No. 01890969 (June 28, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contended that the agency's decision to remove him was racially motivated as evidenced by the racial comments and slurs that management officials made against him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that there is direct evidence of discrimination in this case. Employee A testified that Supervisor A told him that he was "going to get that sorry ass white drunk out of here," and that he referred to appellant as an "old sorry white drunk" or a "sorry ass white boy." Other witnesses' testimony established that other agency officials also referred to appellant in racist terms. Because of Supervisor A's comment that he was "going to get that sorry ass white drunk out of here," and because of the pervasive use of racial slurs toward appellant by other agency officials, the Commission finds that the agency's decision to remove appellant was motivated by unlawful racial animus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are aware of the agency's finding that Employee A's testimony was not credible because it was inconsistent. First, because of Employee A's reluctance to testify, the Commission believes that Employee A was truthful in testifying that management officials made racial statements and comments about appellant. Second, although Employee A had difficulty determining which supervisor had made which remark about appellant, he nonetheless was sufficiently certain about Supervisor A's remarks that the Commission credits his testimony in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because appellant demonstrated that his race was a motivating factor in the agency's removal, the burden shifts to the agency to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered appellant's race.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contended that he was not intoxicated on the date in question and that agency officials assumed--but did not prove--that he was intoxicated. In support of his contention, appellant presented testimony to show that he did not drink before he went to work and that there were other occasions when agency officials mistakenly had believed that he had been drinking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Testimony by numerous witnesses established that appellant had a drinking problem and that the agency previously had offered appellant assistance by referring him to EAP and by allowing him to enter a detoxification program on two occasions. Record evidence showed that on the date in question, agency officials closely observed appellant's behavior. Two of those agency officials testified that appellant had difficulty standing or walking, that his speech was slurred, that he was incoherent, and that he smelled strongly of alcohol. When asked if he had been drinking, appellant indicated that he had had something to drink that night. Appellant also was offered and declined the opportunity to take a blood alcohol test. Further, testimony by the Labor Relations Specialist established that appellant did not deny that he had been intoxicated when the incident occurred and that he may have admitted to her that he was "drunk." Finally, the agency presented evidence to show that when an employee was determined to be intoxicated, it was normal procedure to issue a removal notice and then reduce the discipline and/or present the employee with a last chance agreement during the grievance process. Based on the evidence of record, the Commission finds it more likely than not that appellant was intoxicated on the date in question and that the agency has demonstrated that it would have taken the same action even if appellant's race had not been a motivating factor in its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we have found that the evidence supports the agency's position that a legitimate factor, i.e., appellant's intoxication, also motivated its decision to remove him, appellant is not entitled to any damages in this case. However, the Commission takes notice of the pervasive use of racially derogatory comments in the workplace by agency officials. These comments are patently offensive and they constitute conduct prohibited by Title VII. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Yabuki v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920778 (June 4, 1993) (finding race and national origin discrimination when the supervisor subjected appellant to verbal abuse and negative comments about the Japanese people). The agency is advised that it has a duty to eliminate all such conduct in the workplace, not ignore it. To ensure that the discriminatory conduct ceases and does not recur, the agency shall provide training to those supervisors or management officials who engaged in such conduct and also to those supervisors or management officials who knew or should have known of the conduct and failed to take effective corrective action. The agency also shall monitor the workplace environment for a 6-month period to ensure that the workplace remains free of racially derogatory comments.</p>
<p class="noindent">In asserting a <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> defense, an agency must be careful to focus on the actual personnel action at issue. Although the premise seems elementary, in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto v. Dalton</span>, 118 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 1997), the government's defense failed, in part, because it focused on the wrong personnel action. The employee in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span> was given a negative employment reference by her Navy supervisor in retaliation for filing an EEO complaint when she applied for a job with the Army. The Navy established that the employee would not have been hired by the Army even absent the negative reference. The Navy then asserted that <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> precluded a finding of liability. After finding that the employment reference itself was actionable, the court in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span>, 118 F.3d at 675, rejected the government's defense:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government's initial misstep leads it to the erroneous conclusion that <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), supports its position. On the basis of statements made in the various opinions of a divided Supreme Court, the government asserts that there can be no Title VII violation here because the Army did not rely upon Lowery's negative reference in its decision not to hire Hashimoto. The plurality opinion in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> concludes that "an employer shall not be liable if it can prove that, even if it had not taken [an illegitimate factor] into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding a particular person." 490 U.S. at 242. Once it is understood, however, that it is the reference itself which is the actionable employment decision, the plurality's statement fully supports the district court's decision. Properly applied to this case, that statement merely means that the government could have avoided Title VII liability if it had established that Lowery would have given Hashimoto the negative employment reference even if she had not filed a complaint with the EEOC. This, according to both the EEOC and the district court, the government failed to do. Thus, the district court did not flout the teachings of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> in holding that Lowery's conduct violated Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant is forced to work in an environment charged with racial tension, the Commission will not engage in speculation about what might have been in the absence of such tension in assessing whether the agency has proven it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 01892853 (1989). Although acknowledging that some of the employer's motives may have been legitimate, the Commission noted that some of the instances for which the complainant was terminated might never have occurred but for the racial tension.</p>
<p class="noindent">But when an agency shows that the supervisor treated the complainant in the same gruff manner both before and after he testified at an EEO hearing, this is sufficient to demonstrate the agency would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Kinnison v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01970458 (1999), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he AJ found that the supervisor had confronted appellant about his testimony in the other individual's EEO complaint, and that the supervisor stated to the Design Engineer that appellant and another person had not been truthful in their EEO testimony. The AJ found that these actions constituted direct evidence that the supervisor harbored an animus toward appellant based on his prior protected EEO activity. Therefore, the AJ determined that a retaliatory animus was "one of the factors which played a role in [the Supervisor's] treatment of [appellant]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, for the appropriate analysis of the evidence in this complaint, the AJ cited to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), and noted that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 ("CRA"), which became effective on November 21, 1991, reversed the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> approach to liability. Under the CRA, an employing agency is liable for discrimination once a prohibited basis is found to be a motivating factor in an employment decision. Because the supervisor made retaliatory statements, and the AJ found that such statements were sufficiently linked with his treatment of appellant, the AJ found that appellant's protected EEO activity was a motivating factor in the supervisor's treatment of appellant. Pursuant to the CRA, liability is established once the trier of fact has accepted direct evidence. EEOC Policy Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, No. 915.002, July 14, 1992, Section III.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, once a complainant proves that discrimination or retaliation was a motivating factor, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to establish that it would have taken the same action absent the discrimination or retaliatory animus<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Policy Guidance, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Here, after reviewing the testimony, the AJ concluded that the agency had met its burden to establish that, even in the absence of a retaliatory animus, the supervisor would have subjected appellant to the treatment which he found humiliating and would have issued the same performance rating. In this regard, the AJ stated that she found that the most credible testimony offered at the hearing was provided by the Design Engineer and the Construction Engineer, who testified that the supervisor's treatment of appellant did not change during appellant's tenure and that the supervisor treated everyone below him in a similar manner. The Commission notes that it generally will not disturb the credibility determination of an AJ where, as here, such determinations are based on the observation of the witnesses<span class="Italic">. Esquer v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960096 (September 6, 1996); <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900589 (July 26, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, the relief permitted pursuant to the CRA is limited. For example, an employer making this showing is not required <span id="Page_768"></span>under the CRA to pay compensatory damages, or to be subject to any order requiring backpay or reinstatement<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, EEOC Policy Guidance, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Parvin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950017 (June 20, 1996); <span class="Italic">Hill v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970305 (September 1, 1998). The employer is, however, required to pay appropriate attorney's fees and may be ordered to post a notice<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kinnison</span>, as part of the injunctive relief, the Commission ordered training for the offending supervisor. The training was ordered even though the complainant had left the agency by the time of the Commission's decision in the case, noting it found "that requiring training for the supervisor regarding the protection of the rights of employees engaged in protected EEO activities is in the nature of injunctive relief." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the administrative judge properly applied the mixed motive analysis in <span class="Italic">Bell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0720080024 (2008), where the selection panel specifically discussed the fact that the complainant was black and the selectee was Native American. The Commission held that the agency demonstrated that the selectee was better qualified and performed better during the job interview. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120065053 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120122370 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found as to claim (1) that Complainant presented direct evidence that the Agency's denial of a SCI pay increase for the 2008 rating period was motivated by her sex/pregnancy. The Manager stated "just keep doing what you're doing and I'll see what I can do for you next year, unless you plan on taking maternity leave again. You don't have something you need to tell me, do you?" Accordingly, the AJ found that Complainant's sex/pregnancy was a motivating factor in the Agency's decision to deny the SCI.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the AJ further found that the Manager would have denied the SCI regardless of his unlawful motive. Specifically, the AJ concluded that the evidence establishes that the Manager would have denied Complainant the SCI because she was not a top performer who distinguished herself above others. There were a limited number of SCI awards that could be given. Complainant received an OSI award but she did not present credible evidence that she was more deserving of a SCI award than those who received it. The evidence establishes that although discrimination occurred, the Manager nonetheless would have not given Complainant a SCI award absent the discrimination. Therefore, we find that the AJ appropriately limited Complainant's remedy for discrimination in this claim to declaratory relief, injunctive relief and costs.</p>
