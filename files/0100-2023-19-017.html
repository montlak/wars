<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-11"><span class="space">2.</span> No Comparison Employees</h4>
<p class="noindent">As a practical matter, many times there are no comparison employees. Given the degree of similarity that must exist for an employee to be considered similarly situated, sometimes the work unit is simply too small. Other times, even if the work unit is large, the specific circumstances of the case may make it sufficiently unique that no employees are similarly situated. With respect to both a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the ultimate analysis of pretext, it is important to bear in mind that establishing treatment that is different from that of a comparative employee outside of the complainant's protected group is only one way of creating an inference of discrimination; it is not the only way. "A lack of comparators is not fatal to establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The complainant can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by showing that similarly situated individuals outside of her protected class were treated more favorably than she was <span class="Italic">or by setting forth some other evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could draw an inference of discrimination</span>." <span class="Italic">Denise Y. v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120160694 (2018) (emphasis added), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden on a complainant to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination is not intended to be onerous. This is one of the reasons that in <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 75 L. Ed.2d 403 (1983), the Supreme Court held that once the employer asserts a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action, the focus on the complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is misplaced and the analysis should proceed to the issue of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Norton</span>, 254 F.3d 889, 894-98 (10th Cir. 2001), the court explained how an improper focus on similarly situated employees not only skews the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case analysis but can preclude a complainant from any opportunity of demonstrating pretext. A significant portion of the <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> opinion follows because it points out the analytical errors commonly made in cases where there is no similarly situated employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The judge said that at the outset he would have to determine which employees were "similarly situated." In this regard the judge said:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Comparable" employees must be similarly situated in all respects relevant to the employer's decision, but they need not be identically situated. In this case, FWS identified three factors in denying Ortiz's leave request: Ortiz's position of responsibility as a key participant in a high-priority land exchange deal, the extended length of the requested leave, and Ortiz's lack of candor in refusing to provide a reason for the sudden "emergency" leave request. All of these are reasonable, legitimate factors to be considered under FWS policy. . .. Based on these relevant factors, <span class="Italic">I conclude that a similarly situated employee would be an employee with significant project management responsibilities who requested an extended leave on short notice without providing the reason for the leave</span>. (emphasis added; internal citations and footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The judge then found that plaintiff could not make the required showing for the fourth element of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case because there were no employees who were "similarly situated" as he had defined the term in the circumstances of this case. We hold that the district judge erred by defining the fourth element of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case as he did and in not recognizing that a genuine issue of material fact was raised by plaintiff Ortiz's evidence, discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, which suggested that Ortiz did provide the reason for the requested leave and the shortness of notice of the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">III</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_694"></span>The criteria used by the district judge to define "similarly situated" employees were based on the reasons given by the defendant Secretary to justify the employment actions at issue as noted above. Using the defendant's reasons for the challenged actions (denying the leave requests and discharging Ortiz for being AWOL) made the playing field unlevel for the plaintiff when his burden was supposed to be "not onerous." Instead, the judge's approach cut off the plaintiff's opportunity to show that the proffered reasons for the adverse dismissal were pretext, and we have previously held that this is an erroneous analysis<span class="Italic">. MacDonald v. Eastern Wyoming Mental Health Ctr</span>., 941 F.2d 1115, 1119 (10th Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">MacDonald</span>, an age discrimination case, the employer had justified its termination of the two plaintiffs by contending that their work had been unsatisfactory. In granting the employer's motion for summary judgment, the district court had held that the plaintiffs had failed to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case because they had failed to show that their work was satisfactory. Although this court affirmed the judgment, our opinion expressly rejected the reasoning of the district court. We said there:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[C]oncluding that the MacDonalds did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case based on the reasons for their discharge raises serious problems under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis, which mandates a full and fair opportunity for a plaintiff to demonstrate pretext. Short-circuiting the analysis at the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> stage frustrates a plaintiff's ability to establish that the defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual and/or that age was the determining factor; if a plaintiff's failure to overcome the reasons offered by the defendant for discharge defeats the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the court is then not required to consider plaintiff's evidence on these critical issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Accord EEOC v. Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp.</span>, 220 F.3d 1184, 1193 (10th Cir. 2000) (discussing <span class="Italic">MacDonald</span> and summarizing it as holding that "a defendant cannot defeat a plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by articulating the reasons for the adverse employment action because the plaintiff in such a situation would be denied the opportunity to show that the reasons advanced by the defendant were pretextual").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, we have stated that it "should now be obvious" that "the burden imposed on a plaintiff at the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> stage is 'not onerous.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1197 (quoting <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981)). In <span class="Italic">Horizon</span> we also noted that "[a] plaintiff alleging discrimination in violation of Title VII can satisfy the fourth element of her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in a number of ways." 220 F.3d at 1195 n.6. One of those ways in a discriminatory discharge case is simply by showing that the job was not eliminated<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Perry v. Woodward</span>, 199 F.3d 1126, 1140 (10th Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 529 U.S. 1110, 120 S. Ct. 1964, 146 L. Ed.2d 796 (2000)); <span class="Italic">accord English v. Colorado Dept. of Corrections</span>, 248 F.3d 1002 (10th Cir. 2001). "The firing of a qualified minority employee raises the inference of discrimination because it is facially illogical for an employer to randomly fire an otherwise qualified employee and thereby incur the considerable expense and loss of productivity associated with hiring and training a replacement." <span class="Italic">Perry v. Woodward</span>, 199 F.3d at 1140. Here, the district court erred by making the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> burden not just onerous but virtually impossible for plaintiff to meet, defining "similarly situated" employees so that there were no employees against whom comparison could be made. Moreover plaintiff Ortiz established the fourth element of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that his job was not eliminated<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing these arguments, the district judge first concluded that evidence of a pattern and practice of discrimination against Hispanics was irrelevant to a pretext analysis because, at best, such evidence would merely help to create an inference of discriminatory motive. In a pretext analysis, the focus is on the facially nondiscriminatory reasons offered by the employer; evidence of discriminatory motive "simply drops out of the picture." <span class="Italic">Durham v. Xerox Corp</span>., 18 F.3d 836, 839 (10th Cir. 1994) (quoting <span class="Italic">Martin v. Nannie &#x0026; The Newborns, Inc.</span>, 3 F.3d 1410, 1417-18 (10th Cir. 1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The judge misread <span class="Italic">Durham</span>. After the employer presents evidence of a neutral reason for the adverse decision, it is the presumption of discrimination which drops out of the picture, the presumption created by the plaintiff's showing of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Intentional discrimination, as <span class="Italic">Durham</span> explained in a parenthetical comment on the Supreme Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993), is the "ultimate question"; consequently, it is paradoxical to assert that evidence of discriminatory motive cannot be considered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district judge here also said that plaintiff's evidence of discrimination in promotion practices was irrelevant in any event because the adverse employment action in question was not the failure to promote. However, as noted, all rational inferences from the evidence must be made in favor of the party opposing the summary judgment motion<span class="Italic">. Curtis v. Oklahoma City Public Sch. Bd. of Ed.</span>, 147 F.3d 1200, 1214 (10th Cir. 1998). The evidence could support an inference that the decision makers harbored a bias against Hispanics which might have affected other decisions, including the decisions adverse to plaintiff Ortiz. The evidence thus meets the test of relevance set out in Fed.R.Evid. 401. It is true, as defendant points out in the appellate brief, that we have said that pattern and practice evidence standing alone "will rarely suffice" to show pretext<span class="Italic">. Bullington v. United Air Lines</span>, 186 F.3d 1301, 1319 (10th Cir. 1999). Therefore, we proceed to consider the other evidence offered by plaintiff to show pretext, as the district court did.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we read the district court's Memorandum Opinion, the Court found that plaintiff had presented no evidence to rebut the defendant's contention that the workload was extremely heavy in February and March, that plaintiff was assigned to a position of responsibility on an important project that was being scrutinized by a high-level official in Washington, and that granting plaintiff leave "for a two-to-twelve month period, on short notice, would jeopardize the project." The record shows, however, that plaintiff did controvert this last assertion by the defendant. The decision-maker, Acting Regional Director Lynn Starnes, testified in her deposition that if plaintiff had "sat down with us at some point in time prior to walking out the door, we could have probably worked Out workload."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this statement and elsewhere, Starnes indicated that the problem was that plaintiff had not been "forthright." She said that "the region accommodated other employees' requests. We do do that. People come in, put down on the table what their problem is and we work things out." This part of the evidence supports the Secretary's position, which the judge adopted, as justification for the denial of leave and the resulting dismissal of Ortiz. As noted, the judge pointed to the factors defendant identified in denying plaintiff's leave request: his position of responsibility, the extended leave sought, and "Ortiz's lack of candor in refusing to provide a reason for the sudden 'emergency' leave request." However, there is contradictory record evidence which must be considered in deciding if this summary judgment can stand. There is the plaintiff's statement that he <span class="Italic">did</span> reveal to his supervisor the nature of the personal emergency underlying his request for leave, thus undercutting Starnes's premise for not attempting to "work things out" for plaintiff. As we have discussed, in defining what employees were "similarly situated," the judge expressly took the view that plaintiff had shown "lack of candor in refusing to provide a reason for the sudden 'emergency' leave request." In this summary judgment appeal we cannot ignore the fact that in an unsworn statement made pursuant to 28 USC 1746, plaintiff stated that on February 24, 1995, he was summoned to Mr. Segura's office where he and Mr. Ault were waiting. Plaintiff's statement continues:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">I told them I was very embarrassed and hurt by my need to request leave to serve a period of incarceration. I told them I would discuss each detail of the situation, and did tell them of my eligibility</span> <span class="Italic">for work release, where I would be housed and when I could return to work.</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus a critical basis for the summary judgment involved a genuinely disputed issue of material fact. The third type of evidence considered by the district court was that Ault had acted beyond his authority or "<span class="Italic">ultra vires</span>." The district court expressed doubt about whether plaintiff's evidence had established this premise and concluded that, in any event, such evidence did not show pretext. We conclude, however, that this evidence was of some probative value. As far as we can determine, plaintiff's evidence that Ault made certain misrepresentations about plaintiff's leave requests is undisputed. At least in his second request for leave, in writing, plaintiff asked for a definite amount of time, 160 hours. But Ault told Starnes and Segura that plaintiff had never stated the amount of leave needed. Further, the evidence of Ault's possible bias against plaintiff suggests an ulterior motive for Ault's failure to disclose all of the relevant facts to the supervisors. On this point, we again disagree with the district court's conclusory statement about the evidence. The district Judge concluded that plaintiff's evidence was sufficient to show "that Ault developed a personal bias against Ortiz, but does not provide any indication as to whether the bias was due to Ault's animus against Hispanic employees, to Ortiz's prior EEO activity, or for non-protected personal or legitimate business reasons." We think that when plaintiff's evidence is viewed as part of the record as a whole, a rational juror could infer that Ault's bias was of a retaliatory nature or was based on ethnicity. The district court erred in not recognizing these permissible inferences in favor of the plaintiff Ortiz which made summary judgment against him impermissible. Plaintiff Ortiz produced sufficient evidence that the defendant's proffered reason was pretext, and it was error to grant summary judgment against him<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.</span>, 530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed.2d 105 (2000) (evidence of pretext "may, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffice to show intentional discrimination") (quoting <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we are convinced that plaintiff succeeded in showing the <span id="Page_695"></span>existence of genuine issues of material fact and that the district court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's retaliation claim as well as his claim of discrimination based on national origin.</p>

<p class="noindent">It In <span class="Italic">Hayden K. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120151347 (2018), for example, the Commission found that the complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, and ultimately that the agency subjected a teacher to race discrimination when it terminated him during his probationary period, despite the lack of similarly situated comparators. A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination can be established with other kinds of evidence. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hayden K</span>., explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to disparate treatment, the Commission notes that while comparator evidence is usually used to establish disparate treatment, Complainant need only set forth some evidence of Agency actions from which, if otherwise unexplained, an inference of discrimination can be drawn. <span class="Italic">See Furnco</span>. The statements by various witnesses suggest that the Principal may have held a bias against Caucasians and men. In light of those statements, we find that Complainant set forth a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race and sex discrimination with regard to his termination. As to Complainant's reprisal claim, the record indicates that the Principal was intent on terminating Complainant before Complainant and the District President of the Teacher's Association raised their concerns about discrimination with the Superintendent in March 2012. The Principal consulted with the Superintendent and Agency labor-management officials a few weeks before the meeting between Complainant and the Superintendent. Although Complainant's termination occurred shortly after her meeting with the Superintendent, we find that the termination had already been set into motion before Complainant began to oppose alleged discriminatory action. Thus, we find Complainant has not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Haddock v. Department of Air Force</span>, B01780966 (1981), through a long and somewhat confusing set of circumstances, the employee was required to perform the duties of a couple of positions for an extended period of time. Ultimately, the employee filed a complaint when the agency refused to downgrade one of the vacant positions so she would be eligible for it and subsequently filled the position with a male. The Commission found that there were no similarly situated employees in the agency nationwide. The employee was able to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on age and sex by showing a disproportionately low percentage of older females in higher-grade positions throughout the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">While "the failure to identify comparators is not necessarily fatal to the establishment of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, nonetheless, in the absence of comparators, complainant must point to other acts from which, if otherwise unexplained, an inference of discrimination can be drawn." <span class="Italic">Huang v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01175 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Though the quantity of evidence that a complainant must present in lieu of the treatment of similarly situated employees cannot be precisely defined, there must be some specific evidence that would support an inference of discrimination. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Archibald v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01A54280 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we do not agree with complainant that the AJ inappropriately applied the law in determining that he had failed to establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> cases of race discrimination and retaliation. Under EEO law, a complainant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment on the basis of a discriminatory factor by presenting facts that, if unexplained, reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination, i.e., that a prohibited consideration was a factor in an adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567 (1978). It is true that a showing of similarly situated employees outside complainant's protected classes being treated differently than complainant is not necessary to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; however, in this instance, when there is no comparative, the complainant must be able to point to some other evidence that, if unrebutted, would at least permit an inference of discrimination.<span class="Italic"> See Gower v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950089 (Feb. 1, 1996). Reviewing the evidence here, we find that the AJ made no error. Substantial evidence shows that complainant's proof fails to raise an inference of discrimination as complainant insists on appeal. The testimony of the secretary that he points to as dispositive is too vague. More proof is needed, proof such as other similarly situated non-black employees did not have their telework privileges revoked even though they too carried out personal endeavors while on the job.</p>
<p class="noindent">Those other acts can come in the form of comments made by persons in a position of authority that would indicate discriminatory bias. Note that when such comments are not linked to the personnel action at issue, they are not considered direct evidence of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> below. But, such comments can help establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> of discrimination in the absence of a comparative employee. In <span class="Italic">Mayfield v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A21083 (2003), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that complainant did establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination. Although complainant did not provide evidence of a comparator outside of her race, we find that complainant established through other noncomparative evidence, that the agency was motivated by unlawful discrimination. In so finding, we rely on Former Chief Nurse's (FCN) statements that a former Chief of Personnel told FCN that there were too many Black nurses. FCN stated that another individual from Personnel made the same remarks. FCN also stated that Medical Center Director (MCD) told FCN that if she hired another nurse recruiter that she would be "better off" with a White nurse recruiter because she "might get more White nurses" as a result. Additionally, we note that the Chief of Human Resources (CHR) stated that when a position has been abolished, it is the policy of the agency to realign that individual without a position and allow her to compete for another position if she is not pleased with the position to which she has been realigned. CHR stated that no one is ever required to compete for another position when their position is eliminated. We find that this evidence is sufficient to establish an inference that the agency was motivated by unlawful race discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Allan F. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120132640 (2015), the Commission found that administrative judge erred in granting summary judgment on the basis that the complainant had presented no comparative evidence. The Commission found that the "harsh and unusual business practice" of withdrawing an offer of employee after a two-year background check, which the complainant passed, along with the agency's knowledge that the complainant had relocated to take the job created a genuine issue of material fact:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Withdrawing Complainant's offer of employment was harsh and an unusual business practice, especially after he had formally accepted the Agency's contingent offer and relied thereon in changing his position--moving and so forth. Shortly prior to the Agency's withdrawal, Complainant underwent a lengthy clearance process requiring him to surrender and have destroyed his Irish passport. According to Complainant, by June 3, 2011, he submitted all the requested pre-employment paperwork to the Agency. At this point, the Agency had not completed processing it. While the Director, Materials Technology Directorate stated that when the decision was made to rescind Complainant's offer, it was noted he had not yet accepted the tentative offer, the record shows that not only had he accepted the contingent offer long before, he cooperated with the Agency in obtaining a favorable adjudication of his security clearance and completing pre-employment forms, further demonstrating his acceptance of the Agency's offer. Given this, there is a question of whether, as a practical matter, the offer had become finalized by the time it was withdrawn.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record strongly suggests that unlike two other cited offers that were withdrawn for reasons connected to a candidate being found unqualified, here the Agency was free to bring Complainant on board. Further, given Complainant's background in information technology, a question arises on whether the Agency could have had its computer technical needs met without having to go through harsh and usual process of withdrawing Complainant's offer and upgrading his position after he was so far along in the process, and changed his position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that the Chief, Sciences Support Division and Director, Materials Technology Directorate, who made the decision to rescind Complainant's offer, were unaware of Complainant's age and national origin. While both indicated they were unaware when the decision was made, their denials were not examined--for example, while they may not have had confirmation of these protected bases, they may have strongly suspected such.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the harshness and unusual business practice of withdrawing an offer to Complainant after be was so far along in the pre-employment process and changed his position based on this, allegedly being repeatedly assured the position was his once his security clearance was favorably adjudicated (which it was), that the Agency was free to bring him on board, and his skills and experience may have met the Agency's need for computer skills in any case, we find that Complainant has created a genuine issue of material fact on whether the Agency was actually motivated by discrimination when it rescinded his job offer.</p>
