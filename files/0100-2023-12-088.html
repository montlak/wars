<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-87"><span class="space">13.</span> National Guard Technicians</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968, 32 USC 709, members of the National Guard who are technicians are treated as federal employees for purposes of retirement and other fringe benefits. A technician's civilian employment status is dependent upon his or her position as a uniformed member of the National Guard.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission had held that National Guard technicians are not civilian employees for Title VII and ADEA purposes. <span class="Italic">See In re National Guard Bureau</span>, 05880189 (1988) <span class="Italic">(</span>citing <span class="Italic">Lear v. Schlesinger</span>, 17 FEP 337 (D.C. Mo. 1978) and <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Alexander</span>, 572 F.2d 1219 (8th Cir. 1978)). However, in other cases such as <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. National Guard Bureau</span>, 01903053 (1990), the Commission has determined that National Guard technicians are covered by Title VII to the extent their complaints relate directly to their civilian duties as opposed to their military duties:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Darrel J. Brazill and Herbert R. Temple, Jr., Chief Lieutenant, National Guard Bureau</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01891698 (June 22, 1989), the Commission discussed in detail the status of employees like appellant who are National Guard Technicians (NGTs). The Commission noted that the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968, 32 USC 709, conferred upon NGTs a unique dual status in that they are both uniformed members of the National Guard as well as employees of the Departments of the Army or Air Force and employees of the United States. As a prerequisite to employment as a technician, persons must be members of the National Guard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Jones</span>, 495 F. Supp. 1285 (E.D. Ark. 1980). In <span class="Italic">Melvin L. Coombs v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05860067 (June 8, 1987), the Commission determined that federal technicians are covered by Section 717 of Title VII when the alleged discriminatory action arises from their capacity as federal civilian employees. The Commission stated in <span class="Italic">Coombs</span> that "it is necessary to review the facts in each case to determine whether the alleged discrimination took place in the context of the individual's capacity as a federal civil employee or his or her capacity as a uniformed member of the military unit in question." Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Brazill</span>, the Commission stated that "federal technicians are covered by Title VII when the alleged discriminatory action arises from their capacity as federal civilian employees and are not covered by Title VII when personnel decisions affect the capacity as uniformed military personnel."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_199"></span>In two footnotes in <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span>, the Commission further illustrated the distinction between civilian and military matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Brazill</span>, the Commission determined that the complainant's allegation that she had been discriminated against on the bases of race and sex when she was continually denied a direct commission into the Colorado Army National Guard since June 1984 was not within the purview of the EEOC's regulations because the allegation involved "exclusively military matters." In addition, the Commission found that the complainant's allegations concerning her performance rating, her termination as a Military Personnel Technician, the bonus and the nonselections for civilian positions were within the purview of the EEOC's regulations "since they all arise from [her] capacity as a federal civilian employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;We are mindful of appellant's assertion that her civilian position would be terminated once her military enlistment was terminated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> 32 USC 709(b), (e)(1) ("a technician who is employed in a position in which National Guard membership is required as a condition of employment and who is separated from the National Guard or ceases to hold the military grade specified for his position by the Secretary concerned shall be promptly separated from his technician employment by the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned"). Nevertheless, we are persuaded on the basis of the authority cited by the agency in its response to appellant's appeal that the decision regarding the length of enlistment is a military decision beyond the purview of EEOC Regulations....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission looks at cases involving National Guard technicians on a case-by-case basis to determine if the allegations relate to military or civilian duties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120120460 (2014) ("the Commission requires a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the alleged discriminatory action impacted the complainant in the capacity of federal civilian employee or uniformed member of the military"); <span class="Italic">Neville v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720110023 (2013) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mier v. Secretary of Army, National Guard Bureau</span>, 01920400 (1992), the Commission intimated that it might have jurisdiction over allegations that failure to achieve a military promotion on a discriminatory basis resulted in a termination of the member's civilian employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Welbon Delon v. National Guard Bureau</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880189 (April 11, 1988), the Commission found that it lacked jurisdiction over the allegations contained in appellant's complaint (which only raised issues relative to appellant's military position). In that decision we agreed with the rule articulated in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> that Title VII is not applicable to persons who enlist or apply for enlistment in any of the armed forces of the United States. We cited <span class="Italic">Lear v. Schlesinger</span>, 17 FEP Cases 337 (W.D. MO. 1978), in which the plaintiff had lost his position as a member of the Missouri National Guard. In <span class="Italic">Lear</span>, the court held that uniformed members of the armed services were not covered by Title VII or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. However, we note that in <span class="Italic">Delon</span>, <span class="Italic">Lear</span> was inadvertently cited for the general proposition that a "National Guard Technician did not fall within the umbrella" of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Darrell J. Brazil v. National Guard Bureau</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01891698 (June 22, 1989), the Commission found that the allegations concerning the direct commissioning into the Colorado Army National Guard were not within the purview of our Regulations. Therein, the Commission concluded that the allegations were military in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our case, appellant is a Supply Management Officer (Captain). In the complaint, appellant alleged, in the pertinent part, that he was denied a promotion to Major and that an informal Army Regulation 15-6 Investigation was forwarded to the 6th Army for the purpose of trying to have his Federal Recognition withdrawn. The agency represents that appellant's allegations are military in nature; therefore, they are not covered under the regulations. On appeal, appellant contends that the alleged discriminatory actions by the agency deal with his federal civilian employment, in that failure to be promoted within the prescribed time frames will result in the loss of his civilian employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the appellant's contention is, at this point, speculative. While appellant's civilian employment may be affected if he fails to be promoted, at this point in time that circumstance has not occurred. A review of the record reflects that the alleged promotion to Major and Army Regulation 15-6, Procedures for Investigating Officers and Boards of Officers, took place in the context of appellant's capacity as a uniformed member of the military personnel, not as a civilian employee. Consequently, we find that the appellant's allegations are not covered by Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because it found the injury alleged in the complaint--the failure to receive a military promotion would result in the loss of civilian employment--was still speculative, the Commission gave no indication of how it might resolve the conflict inherent in reviewing the loss of civilian employment without reviewing the merits of the military promotion denial.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion. In <span class="Italic">Meir v. Owens</span>, 57 F.3d 747 (9th Cir. 1995), the court held that under the National Guard Technicians Act the appellant was not entitled to coverage by Title VII where the gravamen of his complaint that he was suspended from his civilian National Guard duties related to his failure to achieve specified military promotions. Noting that the NGTA did not expressly state that Title VII was applicable, the court also noted that the Act did expressly identify a number of employment statutes that did not apply to National Guard technicians.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on <span class="Italic">Lutz v. Secretary of Air Force,</span> 944 F.2d 1477 (9th Cir. 1991)<span class="Italic">, supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Bledsoe,</span> 838 F.2d 1357 (9th Cir. 1988),<span class="Italic"> supra</span>, the <span class="Italic">Meir</span> court, 57 F.3d at 750, found that "[b]ecause Guard technicians are in a hybrid job entailing both civilian and military aspects, we conclude that Title VII coverage of civilians employed by the military encompasses actions brought by Guard technicians except when the challenged conduct is integrally related to the military's unique status." The court further found that a claim of retaliation based on his EEO complaint activity was not actionable because the retaliatory acts were likewise "integrally related to the military's structure." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 751.</p>
<p class="noindent">When both military and civilian qualifications are weighed in the decisionmaking process for a position, the <span class="Italic">Feres</span> doctrine puts any complaint about the selection outside the ambit of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Feres v. United States</span>, 340 U.S. 135 (1950). In <span class="Italic">Hupp v. Secretary of Army</span>, 144 F.3d 1144 (8th Cir. 1998), the court found the dual military and civilian aspects of the National Guard technician position to be inseparable. Moreover, the hiring process did not utilize distinct stages of review reflecting the two aspects.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not merely assert that the complainant's termination relates solely to her military duties. Basing dismissal of a complaint on such an assertion amounts to a decision on the merits. A decision on the merits may only be made after a full investigation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Secretary of Air Force, NGB</span>, 01953368 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant alleged that she was terminated from her civil technician position in retaliation for her prior EEO activity, as well as due to her sex and mental disability. However, the agency asserts that the termination in question was caused by her discharge from her military position with the National Guard; thus, the Commission has no jurisdiction regarding the matter. It seems that the agency has addressed the merits of the case without a proper investigation as required by the regulations. Upon review, we note that the issue disputed here is very much analogous to the issue of whether the Commission has jurisdiction over the matter concerning an individuals qualification to receive a security clearance. In this regard, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 529, 108 S. Ct. 818, 824 (1988), that nonexpert bodies cannot second-guess the discretionary decisions of agency heads in determining whether an individual is qualified to receive a security clearance. Similarly, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lyons v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890839 (March 22, 1990), held that its authority might not be divested, but it was limited to ascertaining whether the security clearance considerations were applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. Applying this finding to the instant case, we find that while we cannot review the substance of the agency's decision to discharge appellant from her military position, we are not precluded from determining whether her termination from her civilian position was based on discrimination. Although the agency states that appellant's termination from her civilian service technician position was directly related to her discharge from her military position, the record does not contain any documentation to reflect whether appellant's Federal technician position was a position by which a military discharge compelled a civilian employment termination<span class="Italic">. See Faircloth v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942480 (August 16, 1994). Since appellant clearly alleged that her civilian employment termination was based upon her sex, mental disability, and in reprisal for her prior EEO activity, we find that her complaint stated a justiciable EEO claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The analysis used in Title VII cases to determine whether a matter implicates civilian or military employment is also used in cases of age discrimination. It is not enough that the matter complained of affects the civilian employment; it must directly involve that civilian employment. In <span class="Italic">Birkle v. Secretary of Air Force, NGB</span>, 05931001 (1994), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Mier v. Stone</span>, 01920400 (1992)], the case relied on by the agency, the Commission stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The National Guard Technicians Act of 1968, 32 USC 709 (NGTA), granted federal employee status to National Guard Technicians (NGTs) in order to create a uniform and adequate retirement and fringe benefit program for such persons who had previously not been considered federal employees. The NGTA confers upon NGTs a unique dual status. They are uniformed members of the National Guard as well as employees of the Departments of the Army or Air Force and employees of the United States<span class="Italic">. See</span> 32 USC 709. As a prerequisite to employment as a technician, [one] must be [a member] of the National Guard<span class="Italic">. See</span> 32 USC 709(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Mier</span> also cited <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Alexander</span>, 572 F.2d 1219 (8th Cir. 1978), in which a black male was denied enlistment in the United States Army. In finding that the plaintiff was not covered by Title VII, the court found that Congress did not intend for Title VII to apply to individuals who enlist or <span id="Page_200"></span>attempt to enlist in the uniformed services of the military<span class="Italic">. See Johnson</span>, at 1224. In addition, <span class="Italic">Mier</span> cited <span class="Italic">Lear v. Schlesinger</span>, 17 FEP Cases 337 (W.D. Mo. 1978), in which the United States District Court of Missouri relying on the <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> decision determined that uniformed members of the armed services were not covered by Title VII or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mier</span> determined that because appellant's allegations took place in the context of his capacity as a uniformed military member, he was not protected by Title VII. It also noted that any effect on his civilian employment was speculative. In Commission Decision No. 84-4, 2 Employment Practices Guide &#x00B6; 6842 (CCH May 16, 1984), the Commission determined that National Guard technicians are covered by Section 717 of Title VII when the alleged discriminatory action arises from their capacity as federal civilian employees. When the alleged discriminatory action arises from their capacity as uniformed military personnel of the national guard, the Commission determined that Title VII was not available<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Therefore, it is necessary to review the facts in each case to determine whether the alleged discrimination took place in the context of the individual's capacity as a federal civilian employee or as a uniformed member of the military unit in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing legal standards to the facts of this case, we find that appellant's allegation of discrimination based on age regarding the Detachment Commander's interference with the "military selective retention process" of his reenlistment is not within the purview of the Commission. Appellant's reenlistment arises from his status as a uniformed military member and therefore involves a matter that is exclusive to the military. The Commission understands that appellant's civil service employment was dependent upon his continued status as a military member and that the denial of his military reenlistment resulted in his separation from civil service employment. However, because the decision to deny appellant's reenlistment arose out of his status as a military member, the Commission lacks jurisdiction to address it. Therefore, we also do not address his civil service separation, which he asserts was the result of the denial of his reenlistment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The protection of National Guard technicians extends to protection against reprisal from participating in a military hearing involving issues of employment discrimination. <span class="Italic">Standley v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01945130 (1994). As a result, the agency erred in dismissing complaints related to the failure of the technician to be selected for civilian positions because of alleged reprisal, but did not err in dismissing similar allegations related solely to the employee's military duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120122088 (2014), the Commission found that an alleged discriminatory suspension based on charges of sexual harassment was within its jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency has not raised any persuasive arguments, Supreme Court cases, or acts of Congress that would cause us to reverse our previous position regarding the Commission's jurisdiction over dual-status technicians' allegations of discrimination in their civilian federal employee capacity. The case-by-case determination of whether a personnel action arose during the dual-status technician's military or civilian capacity is a factual determination that must be made by the Commission for the purpose of deciding whether the Commission has jurisdiction in a particular case. As a result, we will analyze the facts of this case to determine whether Complainant's claim arose in his military capacity or in his civilian federal employee capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the alleged sexual harassment that led to Complainant's suspension occurred while Complainant was in his federal civilian position as a Powered Support Systems Mechanic. Specifically, the memorandum informing Complainant of his proposed suspension unequivocally stated "This is notification that I propose to suspend you from your position as Powered Support Systems Mechanic, WG-5378-10 Step 2." This is further reiterated in the Standard Form 52, where it states that Complainant is suspended from the position of Powered Support Systems Mechanic. Additionally, the alleged sexual harassment took place during the work week while Complainant was performing his civilian Powered Support Systems Mechanic duties. As a result, it is clear that the suspension occurred in Complainant's federal civilian capacity. Therefore, we find that this complaint is within the Commission's jurisdiction and was improperly dismissed by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is possible that some issues from the termination of a National Guard technician will fall within EEO purview and others will not. For example, in <span class="Italic">Faircloth v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01954018 (1997), the Commission found that an allegation involving the complainant's notification of his pending discharge from the National Guard clearly involved his status as a military employee and was outside the ambit of Title VII. However, an allegation by the same complainant that he was misled as to the benefits he would receive on termination related to his civilian employment and did state a claim for relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example is provided by <span class="Italic">Colby S. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0520120426 (2015), where the Commission found that some of the complainant's claims related to his civilian employment while others related to his military status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. National Guard Bureau</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0420140014 (July 2, 2015), the Commission reiterated its long-standing position that dual-status technicians are both considered uniformed military personnel as well as federal civilian employees. We reiterated that uniformed military personnel, of any branch of the armed forces, are not covered under Section 717 of Title VII. We also stressed our long-held position that dual-status technicians are covered by Section 717 of Title VII when the alleged discriminatory action arises from the individual's capacity as a federal civilian employee and, as a result, the Commission has jurisdiction over those cases. The Commission reiterated that each National Guard dual-status technician complaint must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the Commission has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to claims raised in these complaints, Complainant alleged that he was discriminated against on the bases of age and reprisal when he was detailed from the Wing Commander position into the Joint Air Operations position without a locality pay increase. We find that this claim arose from Complainant's civilian federal employee position. Specifically, the record contains numerous Notice of Personnel Action forms for Complainant's Wing Commander position, which reveal that it is a civilian position at the civilian Occupational series and grade-level of GS-0240-15. The record also contains the notification of his civilian grade-level for when he was first appointed to this civilian position. Further, the Brigadier General's February 19, 2010, memorandum made clear that the Wing Commander position was a civilian position, and that the Agency believed that legally only an individual in civilian status could be appointed to this position. Adverse actions taken against Complainant in this position arose in Complainant's civilian capacity and are therefore within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also alleged discrimination on the bases of age and reprisal when he was relieved of his duties as a Wing Commander and when he was advised to stay away from any military installations pending the investigation. This is an adverse action taken against Complainant's civilian position and, as a result, is within the jurisdiction of the Commission. Additionally, being told to stay away from any military installation is not inherently military in nature as employees may access these facilities while in their federal civilian capacity. As a result, this claim is also within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that he was subjected to discrimination on the bases of age and reprisal when he was placed on Leave without Pay (LWOP), and his military Title 10 Orders were ended. Complainant's allegation of discrimination with regard to the ending of his military Title 10 Orders is a claim of discrimination that arose in Complainant's military capacity, and as a result this claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. However, to the extent that Complainant was placed on LWOP in his civilian status, this claim is within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that he was informed that he was under investigation for Title 10/32 fraud. To the extent that this investigation was about his alleged fraudulent placement into military status, this claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. However, to the extent that this investigation had effects on Complainant's civilian capacity, such as in the claims below, those specific civilian capacity claims are within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that he was subjected to discrimination when he was notified that he was being moved "militarily" to Nevada State Headquarters and relieved of his command as Wing Commander. The record reveals that Complainant clearly states that his move to the Nevada State Headquarters was a military move. Therefore, the record establishes that this claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. However, Complainant's relief from command of his federal civilian Wing Commander position is a claim that arose within Complainant's civilian capacity, and therefore is within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that he was subjected to discrimination when, on March 26, 2010, he received notification that he would be terminated from his position as Wing Commander. This adverse action affected Complainant's federal civilian position, and as a result is within the jurisdiction of the Commission</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that he was subjected to discrimination when he was notified of debt he owed for his duty as a civilian service technician. To the extent that Complainant may be accused of owing debt for military pay, we find that is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. However, the record shows that this debt was for civilian pay that he was given for his civilian position. Therefore, this claim is within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that on January 27, 2012, he was informed that he was being recommended for non-retention in the Nevada Air National Guard. To the extent that Complainant was not recommended for retention for his military position, that claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. However, to the extent that the recommendation for non-retention had an effect on his civilian position, the claim of discrimination for the adverse action against his civilian position is within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_201"></span>We note that the Agency offers legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. An Agency's articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions go to the merits of the claims. Before a fact-finder can analyze the merits of Complainant's claim that he was discriminated against while he was in his civilian capacity, there must be a thorough investigation of the claims that produces an appropriate factual record that allows a reasonable fact-finder to draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred. 29 C.F.R. 1614 &#x00A7; 1614.108(b). As a result, it would be premature for us to consider these articulated reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pugilese v. Attorney General</span>, 01A3443 (2004), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint by a Guardsman who was detailed to the Drug Enforcement Agency and remanded the case for the taking of additional evidence on whether the complainant met the common law test of set forth in <span class="Italic">Ma and Zheng v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 01962390, 01962389 (1998), for being an employee of the Department of Justice. The Commission found the arguments of the parties on the "dual status" of Guard members to be irrelevant because the complaint was not filed against a military agency but against a civilian agency. In <span class="Italic">Pugilese</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant, by contrast, remained on active-duty at all times, but was detailed to a different agency to perform civilian duties. She has not filed a discrimination claim against the Guard; she contends that the agency is responsible for the discrimination she suffered, and that, in essence, she should be considered an employee of the agency for Title VII purposes. Therefore, the "dual status" issue argued at length by both parties is not relevant in the present case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether complainant is an employee of the agency under Title VII, the Commission applies the common law of agency test. <span class="Italic">Lonergan v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970406 (July 10, 2000) (applying the test from Community for <span class="Italic">Creative Nonviolence v. Reid,</span> 490 U.S. 730, 751-752 (1989) and<span class="Italic"> Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., et al. v. Darden</span>, 503 U.S. 316, 323-324 (1992)). Under this test, the fact-finder must analyze complainant's work relationship with the agency. The common law of agency test "contains no shorthand formula or magic phrase[,]...all of the incidents of a relationship must be assessed and weighed with no one factor being decisive." <span class="Italic">Ma and Zheng v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01962390, 01962389 (May 29, 1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Darden</span>, 503 U.S. at 324).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in the present case is insufficient to determine whether complainant is an employee of the agency. It provides no clue into the terms of the detail between complainant, the Guard, and the DEA. It also provided no information concerning the work relationship between complainant and DEA officials, who had authority over complainant for personnel concerns, whether and to what degree complainant continued to report to her Guard chain-of-command as opposed to agency supervisors, whether she had to wear a uniform while on duty at the DEA, and other matters as outlined in the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Ma</span>. On remand, the agency must gather the necessary documentation, and issue a new final order.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the EEOC has jurisdiction over the civilian aspects of employment of National Guard technicians, it does not have the authority to award relief related to the military aspects of employment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Daniel v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120083463 (2012), the Commission found that its administrative judge erred in awarding back pay for military pay lost and ordering that the complainant be awarded a higher-level military position. "However, we note that we do not agree with the Agency that this complaint should be dismissed under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. While we may not be able to enforce relief that is irreducibly military in nature, there is still relief available that is not military in nature, such as pecuniary and non-pecuniary compensatory damages, injunctive relief, training, consideration of disciplinary action against the responsible management officials, posting a notice of discrimination, etc." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0420140014 (2015), in addition to restating its longstanding position that not all National Guard position duties are military in nature, the Commission rejected an argument that it had no jurisdiction over the Texas National Guard because it was a state agency and not a federal agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Commission lacks authority to adjudicate this claim because the Texas National Guard and the Texas Adjutant General (an officer appointed by the Governor of the state and in charge of the state's National Guard) are the responsible entities, and the state of Texas has not waived its sovereign immunity and has not consented to the adjudicatory authority of the Commission's federal sector process. The Agency also asserts that the Commission cannot compel the state adjutant general to comply with the damages awarded in the AJ's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 717(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which gives the Commission jurisdiction over the federal sector, applies to all personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment in military departments as defined in section 102 of Title 5, and in executive agencies as defined in section 105 of Title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(a). Section 102 of Title 5 states that the military departments are the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 102. Section 105 of Title 5 broadly defines an "executive agency" as "an Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Texas National Guard and the Texas Adjutant General are neither a military department nor an executive agency. We will first look at whether the Texas National Guard and the Texas Adjutant General may be considered an "executive agency" for purposes of section of Title VII. The National Guard Technicians Act designates, through the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force, the adjutant generals of each state to employ and administer the dual-status technicians. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(d). Congress gave the state adjutant generals the authority to make all personnel decisions for these federal employees, for example: hire all federal dual-status technicians; control the day-to-day supervision of the dual-status technicians; discipline the technicians including suspension and demotion; administer reductions in force for dual-status technicians; and terminate the dual-status technicians from their federal civilian positions. The adjutant general is also responsible for ensuring that dual-status technicians receive federal pay, federal benefits, and federal retirement for their federal civilian work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Guard and the state adjutant generals are governed by substantive federal law and control. For example, under the National Defense Act of 1916, the National Guard must be trained in accordance with federal standards and must be armed and funded by the United States Government. 39 Stat. 166; 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 501-505. Additionally, the Supreme Court noted in <span class="Italic">Perpich v. Department of Defense</span>, 496 U.S. 334, 351 (1990), that "[t]he Federal Government provides virtually all of the funding, the material, and the leadership for the State Guard units."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal courts have previously addressed the issue of whether the state National Guard and the state adjutant general are executive agencies. For example, the Fifth Circuit, which is the circuit that this case arises from, found in <span class="Italic">Lipscomb v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 333 F.3d 611 (5th Circuit 2003), that National Guard dual-status technicians were clearly federal employees by virtue of the National Guard Technicians Act, and therefore, had the right under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act (FSLMRA) to choose union representation. Specifically, the court found that because the Mississippi Adjutant General, the Mississippi National Guard, and the Mississippi Army National Guard were an employer of these federal employees and had the authority to direct the day-to-day work of these federal employees, they are effectively a federal executive agency subject to jurisdiction of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and the FSLMRA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Fifth Circuit noted that to the extent that the Adjutant General acts as an executive agency of the federal government, when the Mississippi National Guard and Mississippi Air National Guard carry out his federal duties, they likewise are departments of the federal agency or are "activities" of a federal agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">See also NeSmith v. Fulton</span>, 615 F.2d 196 (5th Cir. 1980) (The Fifth Circuit found that the Adjutant General is itself a federal agency, despite its status as a state office, because of the federal nature of the employees the Adjutant General supervises and the substantive federal law that governs the Adjutant General's duties.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Third Circuit found in <span class="Italic">Chaudoin v. Atkinson</span>, 494 F.2d 1323 (3rd Cir. 1974), that the National Guard Technicians Act "charges the adjutant general with employment and administration of the civilian technicians who are federal employees. In view of the foregoing there can be no doubt that the Adjutant General of Delaware is an agency or an agent of the United States, and therefore within the purview of [28 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 1361 [which provides action for mandamus in district courts against federal officers or agencies]." The court found that the Adjutant General abused his discretion when he dismissed a National Guard technician for refusing to perform duties while in his federal civilian capacity. The court noted that a writ of mandamus properly may be issued by a federal court when a government official fails to comply with a specific statutory or regulatory direction, and the court ultimately issued a writ for injunctive and mandatory relief as well as compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Tenth Circuit held that a state adjutant general is an agent of the United States. <span class="Italic">Costner v. Oklahoma Army National Guard</span>, 833 F.2d 905, 907 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">citing NeSmith, supra</span>. While determining whether a dual-status technician could bring a claim of age discrimination under the ADEA, the court found that the National Guard Technicians Act conferred federal status on civilian technicians while granting administrative authority to the Adjutant General. Although the Oklahoma Adjutant General is a state officer, the court found that his status as a state officer did not preclude him from being an agent of the United States in his capacity as administrator for federal personnel. <span class="Italic">See also Association of Civilian Technicians v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 756 F.2d 172 (D.C. Ct. App. 1985) (D.C. Court of Appeals recognized the Montana Air National Guard as an "agency" when analyzing a collective bargaining agreement for dual-status technicians under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_202"></span>While the National Guard is a unique hybrid entity that has both state components and federal components, we find that when the Texas Adjutant General, the Texas National Guard, and the Texas Air National Guard make personnel decisions for federal employees or take employment actions that affect federal employees, they are acting in their capacity as a federal executive agency. The Commission clearly has jurisdiction over these entities. If a dual-status technician raises a claim of discrimination under Title VII that arose in the technician's federal civilian capacity, the Commission may adjudicate those claims under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 717(a) of Title VII applies to all personnel actions affecting civilian employees or applicants for employment in military departments as defined in section 102 of Title 5. Section 102 of Title 5 states that the military departments are the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force. When the adjutant general acts through the Secretary of the Army or the Air Force with regard to federal personnel pursuant to 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709, the adjutant general is engaging in a federal activity through a military department as defined by Title VII. Claims that arise from a dual-status technician's civilian capacity are squarely within the jurisdiction of Title VII and must be processed through the 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614 process.</p>
