<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-10"><span class="space">4.</span> Signature of Agreement</h4>
<p class="noindent">The best practice for all concerned is to have the complainant and an agency official with specific settlement authority sign any agreement, even if the both parties are represented by counsel. This result was clearly envisioned by the Commission's regulations at 29 CFR 1614.603 in the requirement that "[a]ny settlement reached shall be in writing and signed by <span class="Italic">both parties</span> and shall identify the claims resolved." (Emphasis added.) Though it is possible for a representative to have full settlement authority, a representative is not a party to litigation. The complainant and the agency are the parties. If for some reason the parties are not signatories to the agreement, it should contain a clause to the effect that the representatives have full settlement authority and are authorized to sign on behalf of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the actual signature of a party is in dispute, the Commission will closely scrutinize the signature on the settlement agreement and may compare it to signatures on other documents included in the record. For example, in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976370 (2000), the Commission found that the complainant failed to prove that the signature on the settlement agreement was fabricated because the signature on the agreement matched the complainant's signature on other complaint records:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">He attempted to argue that he had not signed the SA which converted his termination into a resignation and that the signature on the SA was not his. A careful examination, however, of the signature on the SA reveals that, while it does not exactly match complainant's signature on his appeal letter and brief, it is nearly identical to complainant's signatures on his request for EEO counseling, his formal complaint, various OWCP forms contained in the record, and the signature on complainant's investigative affidavit. We find that complainant had signed the SA with the intent to withdraw his EEO request for counseling in exchange for a conversion of his termination to a resignation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_345"></span>Despite the fact that the requirement of having the agreement signed by both parties is spelled out in the Commission's regulations and is the only fundamentally sound legal practice, both parties do not always sign the agreement. In the past, it was by no means clear that a signature by both parties was required. For example, in <span class="Italic">Finch v. USPS</span>, 01872472 (1987), the Commission held that the employee authorized his representative to act for him and was bound by the subsequent settlement agreement that was entered. The Commission apparently reached this conclusion because the employee authorized the representative to act on his behalf on the EEO complaint. Generally speaking, the <span class="Italic">Finch</span> case goes against the accepted norm in settlement and also against common sense. Given the fact that settlement must be knowing and voluntary, the complainant's signature should be required on all agreements. There is no indication in <span class="Italic">Finch</span> that the employee was aware of the agreement reached prior to his representative signing it and, because he later disputed that agreement, it is hard to characterize it as voluntary. On reconsideration, the Commission agreed. In 1988, it revisited the case in <span class="Italic">Finch v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880030 (1988), and held that the complainant must sign an agreement, unless the representative has express authorization to enter into an agreement on the complainant's behalf.</p>
<p class="noindent">In at least one case, the Commission found that an agreement reached in mediation and signed by the parties with a clause that the parties agreed to sign the "formal document" once it was completed by the agency's Office of Civil Rights, was not in fact a settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">Henretty v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A20420 (2002), the parties entered a handwritten agreement at the conclusion of mediation that provided for a reclassification of the complainant's job, up to $3,500 in attorney fees subject to documentation, a $500 performance award, and up to 80 hours of training for the complainant. The agreement also included a clause that read, "The parties agree to sign the formal document once it is completed by the Office of Civil Rights." In response to a claim that the agency breached the agreement, the EEOC found that no settlement agreement ever existed and that "[t]he agency and the complainant have merely drafted terms and agreed to sign a formal completed document to be created by the Office of Civil Rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Given the specificity of the terms in the agreement, the Commission's decision is surprising.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Price v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a53176.txt">01A53176</a> (2005), the Commission found that there was no settlement agreement where the agreement was reduced to writing by the complainant and her supervisor and signed by both parties, but contained a clause indicating it was subject to review by the agency attorney and signature by the medical center director. The attorney subsequently rewrote the agreement and the complainant refused to sign it. The Commission dismissed the complainant's breach claim finding that no settlement in the case had been reached.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most attorneys do not view themselves as having authority to settle a complaint without the consent of their client. A reasonable stance is to insist that settlement agreements be signed by both the employee and his or her representative. The employee's signature then represents a knowing and voluntary acceptance of the agreement. The representative's signature attests to the fact that the written document reflects that the agreement contains the terms that were negotiated and that the agreement, in the representative's opinion, is lawful and binding on the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">The signature of agreements also can present a problem from the complainant's perspective. In most cases, the complainant has no real way of knowing just who within an agency has the actual authority to enter into an agreement that binds the agency. Generally, agencies have the agreement signed by the proper official, but not always. It is not unreasonable for a complainant to insist on a clause in the agreement to the effect that the agency's signatory specifically represents that he or she has the authority to bind the agency. Although, technically speaking, an agency is not bound by the actions of an official acting outside the scope of his or her actual authority, the Commission has found that settlement agreements are binding where the agency official acts under apparent authority, even if he or she lacks actual authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has had a difficult time with cases in which a party contends it is not bound by a settlement agreement because the duly-appointed representative has exceeded his or her authority. Because of inconsistency in the Commission's decisions in this area, a definitive rule is hard to articulate. At times, the Commission has held that even if the representative did not have actual authority to bind a party, by virtue of being appointed a representative he or she had apparent authority to enter the agreement and it is, therefore, binding. In these cases, the Commission has indicated that any dispute is purely a matter between the representative and his or her client. At other times, the Commission has found that a demonstration that the representative did not have actual authority can void an agreement. Compounding the inconsistency in the Commission's decisions is that, assuming the representative lacked actual authority, the use of apparent authority to validate settlement agreements is a combination of two doctrines--detrimental reliance or promissory estoppel and subsequent ratification. Either of these doctrines may make an otherwise invalid agreement binding.</p>
<p class="noindent">The most consistent position of the Commission that emerges from these cases can best be summarized as follows. As a general rule, the parties will be bound by the signature of a duly-appointed representative. A party seeking to void an agreement due to lack of authority bears a heavy burden of demonstrating, through specific evidence, an actual lack of authority. Once an actual lack of authority is demonstrated, the agreement will still be considered binding if detrimental reliance, or subsequent ratification applies. The doctrine of detrimental reliance, also called promissory estoppel, applies if the complainant has reasonably taken some action to his or her detriment based on the promises made by the agency. The doctrine of subsequent ratification applies if either or both of the parties have taken actions to execute the terms of the agreement. Only if neither of these doctrines applies and the representative had no actual authority to enter the agreement will it be set aside. With that introduction, the case law of the Commission is discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">After its initial confusion in <span class="Italic">Finch</span>, the Commission revisited the issue of whether a party is bound by an agreement signed by a representative in <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01922308 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn</span>, the Commission held that agencies generally may not plead a lack of knowledge based on the contention that a representative has exceeded his settlement authority. When an agency designates a representative, that person has at least the apparent authority to settle a complaint. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn</span> held that subsequent to settlement the agency may not void the agreement based on the argument that the representative exceeded his actual authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the agency acknowledges noncompliance with the settlement agreement. However, the agency contends that the agency official who signed the settlement agreement acted outside of the scope of his authority when he did so; and that, absent the signatures of the agency officials with actual authority to bind the agency to the terms of the settlement agreement, the agency is not bound thereby. The Commission finds that the settlement agreement in the instant case constitutes a contract between the parties. The intention of the parties to a contract, and the meaning of the contract, are deduced from the language and contents of the contract; where the terms are plain and unambiguous, the contract is conclusive. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">First American National Bank of Nashville v. Automobile Insurance Co.</span>, 252 F.2d 62 (1958). The terms of the instant settlement agreement are clear and unambiguous; regardless of whether he possessed actual authority to bind the agency, the Regional CLJ, acting on behalf of the agency, signed the settlement agreement, as did appellant, agreeing to be bound thereby. The agency, however, despite its initial performance of the terms of the agreement, has since repudiated the agreement, and stated its intention not to be bound by its terms. The Commission therefore finds the agency to be in breach of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01921566 (September 8, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">On reconsideration, the Commission held that in order to effectively repudiate an agreement signed by an agency representative, the agency must affirmatively demonstrate that the representative lacked either the authority or apparent authority to bind the agency. Moreover, even when an agency can make such a showing, it still may not repudiate the agreement if the complainant can establish detrimental reliance, or if the agency, through subsequent acts, ratifies the agreement by taking actions to comply with the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 05930689 (1994), the agency attempted to repudiate a settlement agreement on the basis that the person who signed the agreement on behalf of the agency lacked the authority to bind the agency. Even though the Commission found the agency failed to demonstrate that the agency official lacked authority to settle the case, it also analyzed the case from the perspective of detrimental reliance and subsequent ratification. In the <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn</span> decision on reconsideration, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, the Commission determines that appellant has timely raised a breach of settlement agreement issue before us, based on the agency's repudiation of the terms of the agreement and reprocessing of the EEO complaint, including the issuance of the April 17, 1992 final agency decision<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.217(b). Next, we find that the previous decision erred when it held that there was a contract in this case due to the plain, unambiguous terms of the settlement agreement, regardless of whether the Regional Chief Law Judge possessed the authority to bind the agency. In fact, the initial, vital issue to be decided here is whether the written agreement, dated February 5, 1992, signed by appellant and the Regional Chief Law Judge, on behalf of the agency, was a valid contract or was otherwise enforceable, binding on the agency as a result of the Chief Law Judge's conduct and/or the conduct of various agency officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts and this Commission have consistently recognized the importance of encouraging the voluntary settlement of employment discrimination disputes<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc.</span>, 517 F.2d 826 (5th Cir. 1975), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 425 U.S. 944 (1976); <span class="Italic">Shuman v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900744, at 9 (July 20, 1990). EEOC regulations provide that a settlement agreement, knowingly and voluntarily entered into by the parties, reached at any stage of the complaint process, shall be binding on both parties<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.217(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_346"></span>Further, the Commission has previously held that a signed settlement agreement, in order to be valid and enforceable, must be executed by an authorized representative of the agency<span class="Italic">. See Soliz v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901010 (October 25, 1990). In <span class="Italic">Soliz</span>, the Commission determined that the purported settlement document was not a valid contract because it was not signed by a designee of the agency, that signature line was left blank, and was only signed by the EEO counselor. According to that decision, the EEO counselor's signature, in the absence of the signature on the line for the "Designee, United States Postal Service," was insufficient to bind the agency<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 4. The Commission also noted that the EEO counselor was "not acting on behalf of the agency, but rather, was acting more as a witness."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, in contrast, the settlement document included the signature block and the signature of only one designee of the agency, the Chief Regional Law Judge, Social Security Administration. We find that <span class="Italic">Soliz</span> is therefore distinguishable. Furthermore, the agency has not cited the Commission to any agency regulation which demonstrates that the Regional Chief Law Judge did not have the authority to bind the agency in the settlement document at issue. Instead, the agency has simply included assorted pages from its Personnel Manual, without citation and out-of order and incomplete in places, in support of its claim here. The agency has not explained with precision or otherwise supported its claim that the settlement document in this case was absolutely subject to the approval of the Director of the EEO or a designee. Further, even if the settlement document was subject to such approval, the agency has not provided evidence showing that the Regional Chief Law Judge was not in fact the designee in this case. The agency has simply failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that reconsideration is justified because the Chief Regional Law Judge did not have the authority to settle appellant's discrimination complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, following the signing of the settlement agreement, the agency continued to take steps to facilitate appellant's employment, so that even if the Regional Chief Law Judge did not have the actual authority to settle appellant's EEO claim at the time the formal document was signed, subsequent conduct by agency officials ratified the agreement. In addition, appellant clearly acted to her detriment in reliance upon the settlement agreement and the agency's subsequent conduct and representations by leaving her job working as a superior court law clerk in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, beginning work with the agency on February 23, 1992, and continuing to work for a week thereafter until the agency abruptly informed her that she had no job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, even in the absence of a contractual obligation based only on the settlement agreement, we find that ratification of the agreement subsequently occurred<span class="Italic">. See Editor's Press Inc. v. United States</span>, 415 F. Supp. 407, 413 n.15 (D. Md. 1975); 1A A. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 229, at 340 (Supp. 1984). We also find that enforcement of the agreement at issue would be appropriate under a detrimental reliance theory<span class="Italic">. See Restatement Second on Contracts</span>, Section 90 (1981); E. Farnsworth, Contracts, &#x00A7; 219, at 89-98 (1982). As the court observed in <span class="Italic">Jablon v. United States</span>, 657 F.2d 1064, 1069 n.9 (9th Cir. 1981), some cases have recognized a potential remedy against the federal government based on a promissory estoppel theory<span class="Italic">. See also Reamer v. United States</span>, 532 F.2d 349 (4th Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Kaye v. United States</span>, 467 F.2d 415 (D.C. Cir. 1972); <span class="Italic">Putnam Mills Corp. v. United States</span>, 432 F.2d 553 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so finding, we recognize the general proposition that principles of detrimental reliance, or promissory estoppel, apply less broadly against the federal government than they might in the private sector<span class="Italic">. See McCauley v. Thygerson</span>, 732 F.2d 978 (D.C. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Kizas v. Webster</span>, 707 F.2d 524 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Shaw v. United States</span>, 640 F.2d 1254 (Ct. Cl. 1981). Further, in cases involving the hiring of federal employees, courts have often refused to apply a detrimental reliance theory. As the court in <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Federal officials who by act or word generate expectations in the persons they employ, and then disappoint them, do not ipso facto create a contract liability running from the federal government to the employee, as they might if the employer were not the government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">640 F.2d at 1260; <span class="Italic">See also Riplinger v. United States</span>, 695 F.2d 1163 (9th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These cases may be distinguished, however, based on the fact that they involve only the appointment to federal service where Title 5 of the U.S. Code and its implementing regulations detail the parameters of hiring. Such cases reject both contract and reliance theories upon which disgruntled federal applicants may bring suit<span class="Italic">. See Kizas</span>, 707 F.2d at 535 (federal employees are appointed, and courts refuse to give effect to "government-fostered expectations" that, had they arisen in the private sector, might well have formed the basis for a contract, reliance, or estoppel). In the case before us, however, appellant's status is primarily as a party settling an existing legal claim in the EEO administrative process where principles of contract law are well-recognized and routinely applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in sum, we reject the agency's argument that the entire settlement agreement in this case is unenforceable. The agency has failed to demonstrate the Chief Regional Law Judge's lack of authority. In the alternative, we conclude that the doctrine of ratification and detrimental reliance should be applied to support enforcement of the agreement in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies have continued, without much success, to attempt to avoid their obligations under settlement agreements by arguing that the official who signed the agreement lacked the authority to bind the agency. In <span class="Italic">Bartney v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953929 (1996), the Commission rejected such a claim because the agency failed to submit any evidence, aside from its conclusory claim, that the official actually lacked such authority. Moreover, as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Bartney</span>, the agency's subsequent actions ratified the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency concedes that it is not honoring the settlement agreement. However, the agency concludes that the agreement is invalid because it was not signed by an agency representative authorized to bind the agency to the terms specified therein. The agency has stated that the signatory to the agreement, an acting supervisor, had no authority to make route changes such as those contained in the agreement; only the Station Manager may authorize route changes. In support of its claim that the agreement is not valid, the agency has submitted documents indicating that the Station Manager was asked to sign the settlement agreement on May 20, 1992, and refused to do so. The record contains a routing slip to the Station Manager from the EEO Counselor, seeking his authorization of the agreement, a copy of the settlement agreement with the management's representative and complainant signature lines blank, and a letter from the Station Manager, dated December 20, 1994, stating that he decided not to sign the agreement and that the agency signatory was not authorized to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has submitted no evidence, other than the statements of agency officials, that the acting supervisor who signed the settlement agreement had no authority to bind the agency to its terms. The agency has submitted no agency regulations, for example, or any other agency publication enumerating the rule that only a Station Manager may authorize route changes. Furthermore, the agency has submitted no evidence that the acting supervisor was not authorized to represent the agency in settlement negotiations. In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the agency has not met its burden of demonstrating that the agreement is invalid<span class="Italic">. See Jacobsohn, supra</span> (agency must demonstrate that its signatory lacks authority to settle appellant's complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Perhaps more importantly, the agency gave no indication to appellant that the settlement agreement was invalid for more than two years. Even if the acting supervisor did lack authority to bind the agency to the terms of the agreement, appellant had no way of knowing that the agreement was not valid. In fact, it appears that the agency immediately took steps to comply with the terms of the agreement, and did so for more than two years. Furthermore, the agency indicated, through its correspondence with appellant, that the agreement was valid and binding. In this case, the agency's subsequent conduct has ratified the agreement<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission therefore finds that the settlement agreement in this case is enforceable, both because the agency has failed to demonstrate that its signatory to the agreement lacked authority to bind the agency, and because the agency's subsequent conduct has ratified the agreement<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> The agency has conceded that it breached the agreement. We note that the agency has not contended in this case that because of changed circumstances the terms of the agreement can no longer be followed<span class="Italic">. See Parker v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910576 (August 29, 1991). We therefore ORDER the agency to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement, as required by our regulations<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to have any chance of invalidating an agreement on the basis that the agency representative lacked authority, the agency must, at least, present evidence to prove this contention. <span class="Italic">See Epstein v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01952695 (1997). Moreover, as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Epstein</span>, a representative can create apparent authority to settle by acting as though she had that authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also argues that its attorney was not authorized to bind the agency to provide a letter of apology from the secretary; thus, the agency contends, this provision of the agreement is unenforceable. The Commission has previously held that a signed settlement agreement, in order to be valid and enforceable, must be executed by an authorized representative of the agency<span class="Italic">. Jacobsohn v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930689 (June 2, 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Soliz v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901010 (October 25, 1990)). However, the agency must present evidence indicating that the signatory to the agreement lacked the authority to agree to its terms<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency has presented no evidence indicating that its attorney <span id="Page_347"></span>was not authorized to bind the agency to the terms of the settlement agreement. The agency has submitted no internal regulations or procedures showing that attorneys representing the agency in EEO matters are not authorized to enter into settlement agreements with complainants, or are authorized to agree only to certain terms. Furthermore, this is not a case where the agency's representative has agreed to a settlement provision that exceeds the agency's legal authority<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Thompson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910892 (March 11, 1992) (affirming the removal of a settlement agreement provision awarding appellant attorney's fees for the administrative processing of his complaints under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) because such fees are not contemplated under the statute: "In a settlement agreement, an agency cannot incur a financial liability that the agency is not legally obligated to incur"). Rather, it appears from the record herein that the agency's attorney simply failed to get permission to promise a letter of apology from the Secretary. Because the agency has failed to provide evidence showing that its attorney lacked the authority to agree to this provision on her own, the Commission finds that the agency has not met its burden of demonstrating that this provision is invalid<span class="Italic">. See Jacobsohn, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, appellant has submitted evidence demonstrating that the agency's attorney had apparent authority to promise a letter of apology from the Secretary. The Commission has defined apparent authority, citing the Second Restatement of the Law of Agency, as "'the power to affect the legal relations of another person [or entity] by transactions with third persons, professedly as agent for the other, arising from and in accordance with the other's manifestations to such third person.'" <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01934907 (February 18, 1994). Appellant has submitted affidavits stating that the agency's attorney acted as if she had the power, and permission, to bind the agency to all provisions of the settlement agreement. The agency's attorney has submitted a declaration stating that appellant was aware she had not gotten permission to promise a letter of apology; however, the attorney also states that she "advised the others that I believed that I could agree to the letter of apology, even though I had not been able to confirm this." Regardless of whether appellant knew that the agency's attorney had not received formal permission to agree to the terms of the settlement, the evidence demonstrates that the agency's attorney purported to have the authority to promise a letter of apology. Thus, it appears that appellant entered into the agreement relying on the agency attorney's apparent authority to agree to its terms<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> Moreover, the Commission finds this reliance quite reasonable, as the agency's attorney was in attendance at the hearing as the agency's representative regarding appellant's EEO complaints. The Commission therefore finds that the agency's attorney had the apparent authority to enter into this agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission therefore finds that the settlement agreement in this case is valid and binding on both parties. The agency has conceded that it is not in compliance with the agreement. Where, as here, the Commission has determined that an agency is not in compliance with a valid settlement agreement and the noncompliance is not attributable to acts or conduct of the appellant, we may order compliance with the agreement or we may order that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c)<span class="Italic">. See Hostetter v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950977 (December 6, 1996). It appears that none of the provisions of the settlement agreement have yet been carried out; furthermore, the agency has indicated that it does not intend to furnish an apology from the Secretary. We therefore ORDER the agency to reinstate appellant's complaint for further processing from the point at which processing ceased.</p>
<p class="noindent">On reconsideration, in <span class="Italic">Epstein v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05970671 (1998), the Commission found the agency's actions constituted bad faith and as a result imposed sanctions against the agency in the form of an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Roby v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05950684 (1996), the agency argued that a settlement agreement was not valid because agency regulations provided that the authority to settle complaints rested with the activity head, and the agreement was instead signed and approved by the deputy EEO officer. However, agency regulations provided that the deputy EEO officer may settle a complaint on behalf of the activity head, when the activity head delegated such authority "by direction." While the activity head contended that he did not delegate authority to the deputy EEO officer, the investigator assigned to the case represented that he confirmed that the deputy EEO officer had the authority to sign and approve an agreement prior to the June 1994 settlement negotiation. The Commission found that the EEO officer in <span class="Italic">Roby</span> had at least the apparent authority to enter the agreement and therefore it was enforceable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserted that the Deputy EEO Officer did not have the authority to sign the June 1994 settlement agreement. The Commission has previously held that a signed settlement agreement must be executed by an authorized representative of the agency in order to be valid and enforceable<span class="Italic">. See Soliz v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901010 (October 25, 1990). Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Soliz</span>, the Commission determined that the purported settlement document, which contained a blank signature line for the agency designee, was not a valid contract despite the document having been signed by the EEO Counselor. However, unlike <span class="Italic">Soliz</span>, the settlement agreement in the case at hand included the signature block and signature of only one agency designee, that is, the Deputy EEO Officer. In addition, the agency's regulations provide that the Deputy EEO Officer may settle a complaint on behalf of the Activity Head, when the Activity Head has delegated such authority "by direction." While the Activity Head averred that he did not delegate authority to the Deputy EEO Officer, the OCI Investigator specifically represented that he confirmed that the Deputy EEO Officer had the authority to sign and approve an agreement prior to the June 1994 settlement negotiation. Such confirmation was apparently given by both the Deputy EEO Officer and the agency's Human Resources Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the testimony of the OCI Investigator, that is, the individual contracted by the agency to investigate the matters at issue, to be credible. In addition, the Commission is not persuaded by the agency's argument that the parties understood that the agreement was subject to further approval by the Director of Human Resources. Specifically, there is no such language contained in the agreement. Further, the agreement was signed by a high-level agency official in the capacity of "Activity Representative," and witnessed by the OCI Investigator, thereby implying that the individual had at least the apparent, if not actual, authority to bind the agency without further action. Thus, we conclude that the June 1994 settlement agreement was valid and enforceable. The record contains no evidence showing that the agency has complied with the terms of the agreement by promoting appellant to the position in question, and providing her with the appropriate training. Accordingly, we find that the agency has breached the June 1994 settlement agreement. The final agency decision is therefore REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED to the agency for further processing in accordance with the following Order.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Moncada v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01955545 (1997), however, the Commission held that the settlement agreement was invalid because the signatory lacked authority to bind the agency. Significantly, in <span class="Italic">Moncada</span> the agency presented specific proof that the agency representative lack signatory authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the agency found that the April 1994 settlement agreement was invalid because it did not adhere to agency regulations. In support of its determination, the agency submits Chapter 7 of National Guard Regulation (AR) 690-600/NGR(AF) 40-1614, Volume II. Chapter 7-5(b) provides in relevant part that unless a settlement requires approval by the National Guard Bureau pursuant to Chapter 7-5(d), it will be approved and signed at the state National Guard level. Chapter 7-5(d) states that National Guard Bureau approval of a settlement is required when the payment to the complainant or to the attorney for the complainant will exceed $5,000.00. A proposed, unsigned settlement agreement will be forwarded to the agency CMSA for review and coordination with the agency JA. Upon approval of the settlement, it will be returned to the state National Guard for execution and submission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the settlement agreement, we note that it provides in part that the amount of $18,000.00 will be paid during the first pay period of appellant's reemployment. A second payment of $17,000.00 will be made at the end of the first pay period in FY96.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the payments at issue, under Chapter 7-5(d), the state National Guard was required to secure the approval of the National Guard Bureau before entering into the April 1994 settlement agreement. The state National Guard lacked the authority to enter into the agreement because it did not have the approval of the National Guard Bureau. We find that the National Guard Bureau's determination that the April 1994 settlement agreement was invalid was proper. Accordingly, the agency's decision to reinstate the oriGINAl complaint for processing was proper and is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the Commission did not explain in <span class="Italic">Moncada</span> why the agency should not be bound by the apparent authority of its representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Powell-Behiavis v. Small Business Administration</span>, 0120073191 (2007), the Commission did find a settlement agreement was void where the agency established that it had a standard operating procedure for EEO agreements, that the complainant was aware of that procedure, and that the agreement did not go through that procedure before being signed by a human relations director who was retiring. The Commission specifically found that the director had neither the actual nor the apparent authority. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Powell-Behiavi</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the SOP supports fee agency's contention that the Chief acted outside her authority when negotiating and signing the purported settlement agreement. For settlement of EEO claims by non-Office of Inspector (OIG) employees, the SOP requires that the Assistant Administrator for the agency Equal Employment Opportunity and Civil Rights Compliance (EEO &#x0026; CRC), a representative of OGC, and an appropriate management official must be signatories to all formal settlement agreements unless waived in writing by those individuals, and an OGC representative must sign any settlement agreement entered <span id="Page_348"></span>at any stage of the process in which the payment of federal funds is involved. Also, in EEO settlements involving non-OIG employees, OGC must review and concur on legal sufficiency, it must be reviewed by the Assistant Administrator of EEO &#x0026; CRC, and OGC must be involved in negotiations involving pre-complaint EEO settlements involving the payment of agency funds. The weight of the record shows that most or all these SOP requirements were violated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In two emails sent by the Acting Assistant Administrator of EEO &#x0026; CRC to the Chief a week and a half prior to the purported settlement agreement, she was notified of some of the above requirements. The first email advised that in settlement agreements involving the payment of agency funds, including a promotion, OGC must sign the settlement agreement; that in instances where promotions are indicated, EEO &#x0026; CRC always attempts to ensure coordination through appropriate offices to ensure the position and funds exist and the complainant is qualified, and that settlements outside the informal EEO process should be fashioned in conjunction with OGC. The second email recommended that before going further on resolution attempts, they meet with OGC for advice on how to proceed, and without such a meeting, a resolution agreement cannot be finalized by his office. The Chief knew she did not have authority to enter into the purported settlement agreement because the weight of the record shows little or none of the above things occurred. When asked questions such as how she became involved in the settlement negotiations or why she believed she had authority to offer complainant the promotion, the retired Chief wrote she did not recall. The above emails were forwarded to complainant on April 21, 2004.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, in order to be valid and enforceable, a signed settlement agreement must be executed by an authorized representative of the agency. <span class="Italic">Soliz v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901010 (October 25, 1990). This did not occur here. However, where the purported representative of the agency had apparent authority to sign the settlement agreement, it can be valid and enforceable. Apparent authority is the power to affect legal relations of another person or entity by transactions with third persons, professed as agent for another, arising from and in accordance with the other's representations to such persons. <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995569 (March 27, 2002). We find the Chief did not have apparent authority by virtue of the referenced emails forwarded to complainant a week and a half before the purported settlement agreement was signed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant argues that the Chief had actual authority to sign the purported settlement agreement, as evidenced by her being the sole signatory for the agency other agreements. In support, complainant submits a Memorandum of Understanding signed by her and the Chief on April 2, 2003. Complainant signed the Memorandum as a union President. This was not settlement agreement closing an EEO claim. Rather, it was Memorandum of Understanding between the agency and union regarding the performance appraisal system, working conditions and allowance of credit hours. This does not prove the Chief had actual authority to sign the purported EEO settlement as the sole agency representative. Complainant also argues that the Chief had apparent authority, but this is rebutted by the emails sent to complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Taking the matter to absurd heights, in <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01982611 (1999), the Commission remanded a case to give an agency the chance to prove that the five officials who signed the agreement did not have actual or apparent authority. In <span class="Italic">Gutierrez</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the issue of whether the subject complaint has been settled first must be resolved before the propriety of the agency's January 22, 1998 dismissal can be addressed. In the present case, appellant contends that the agency entered into a signed Settlement Agreement, signed by five agency officials in May 1997, and the agency subsequently refused to honor the agreement, and issued a final agency decision on January 22, 1998. While claiming that the agreement was not effective without the EEO Director's signature, the agency has submitted no evidence, such as internal regulations or procedures showing that the SFSU Clinical Director, EEO Manager, Service Unit Director, Acting Executive Director, and Area Director were not authorized to enter into settlement agreements with complainants. Even if the above officials do not have the actual authority to bind the agency to a settlement, the agency has provided no evidence to support its claim that the officials did not have the apparent authority to act on behalf of the agency, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that they did not represent to appellant that they had the authority to enter into a settlement agreement. Accordingly, the Commission is unable to determine whether appellant and the agency entered into a binding settlement agreement; and the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint is VACATED. This case is REMANDED for a determination of whether a binding settlement agreement was entered by appellant and the agency resolving the present complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">By the time five different agency officials have signed a settlement agreement, common sense dictates that the complainant has a right to rely on those signatures as binding.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991504 (2000), the Commission rejected an agency's attempt to repudiate an agreement because the management official who signed the agreement lacked authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency initially asserted that the EEO Counselor/Investigator and not MO1 had the authority to enter into a settlement agreement. The Commission has previously held that a signed settlement agreement must be executed by an authorized representative of the agency in order to be valid and enforceable<span class="Italic">. See Soliz v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901010 (October 25, 1990). Unlike <span class="Italic">Soliz</span>, however, which included a blank signature block, the settlement agreement in the case at hand included the signature block only for the management representative. Further, even the "correct" form referred to by the agency includes only a similar signature block. Complainant indicated that the agency has not designated any specific person to settle complaints, and that various management officials have executed settlement agreements in the past. The agency has not presented any evidence to refute complainant's assertion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also contended that MO1 did not have the authority to waive the CBT 712 typing test or to create a position in another Department. Nevertheless, complainant stated that the collective bargaining agreement specifically provides for the waiver of the examination requirement where the employee has demonstrated the skill for a period of one year. Complainant noted that she was assigned to the position on a temporary basis for in excess of six years, and continues to perform all of the duties thereof. Further, complainant stated that MO1 is the head of In Plant Support, and that she has been working under MO1 in a temporary capacity. Finally, complainant stated that she continues to occupy a General Clerk, In Plant Support, position. Thus, we find that the agency has failed to show that the August 1998 settlement agreement is unenforceable. Accordingly, we find that the agency has breached the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, where an employee designates an attorney as his representative and the attorney enters into a settlement agreement with the agency, the employee is bound by that agreement. The Commission in <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961518 (1997), noted that when there is a subsequent dispute about the representative's authority it is a matter of attorney-client relationship, and thus not within the EEO purview:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record, the Commission finds that appellant has not established that the agency is attempting to bind him to an invalid settlement agreement. Although appellant alleges that he had not authorized his attorney to enter a settlement agreement with the agency, he had duly designated the attorney as his representative in this matter, and thus the attorney's acceptance of the terms is binding. Despite appellant's arguments that the attorney's actions have compromised his rights in the EEO process, the claim actually relates to the attorney-client relationship which is a matter outside of the EEO process. Accordingly, appellant failed to establish that the settlement agreement should be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">As'Salaam</span> case is somewhat problematic because the complainant did present some evidence that his representative was only authorized to enter into a settlement agreement subject to his approval. However, the decision does not indicate what that evidence was.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant's knowing and voluntary consent to the agreement may be negated where the complainant and the agency representative sign an agreement and the complainant's representative later initials subsequent changes made to the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A02946 (2002), the Commission remanded the case for further investigation into the validity of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Initialing a settlement agreement is sufficient to make it binding. The parties are not required to sign their full names. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Sligar v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01966476 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin, we note that the parties to the settlement agreement affixed their initials, rather than their full signatures, on the settlement agreement. The manner and means of inscribing a signature, however, are immaterial except so far as they bear on the question of intention to authenticate. Corbin on Contracts 521 (1950); <span class="Italic">see also George A. Ohl Co. v. Smith Iron Works</span>, 288 U.S. 170 (1933); Restatement (Second) of Contracts 134 (1980). Here, appellant acknowledges that the settlement agreement was entered into on June 10, 1996. Therefore, we find that the parties' "initials" were sufficient to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1614.603.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the agreement is binding on both parties, despite appellant's contention that it was merely a "draft." Appellant contends that she did not have the opportunity to review the agreement in its final form. We note, however, that appellant's initials indicated that she agreed to the terms of the settlement agreement, regardless of whether it was a draft. Appellant does not contend that the terms contained in the typed agreement submitted by the agency are not the terms that she agreed to on June 10, 1996. Thus, even if the agreement that appellant initialed was not in its final typed form, she is nevertheless bound by those terms<span class="Italic">. Cf. Davis v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950023 (Jan. <span id="Page_349"></span>26, 1996) (the Commission found that the parties were bound by the terms of a settlement agreement entered into during a hearing and read into the record, even though appellant later refused to sign the written settlement agreement submitted by the agency which memorialized the agreement entered into during the hearing). Appellant has presented no evidence establishing that she did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the Commission found that the settlement agreement was valid, the appellant was precluded from raising the allegations therein as part of a new EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961066 (1997), the Commission found there was another instance when a signed settlement document was not required. In that case, discussed in more detail above under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-14-007.html#sec5-7">Oral Agreements</a>," the complainant submitted a written offer to the agency and the agency responded with a written acceptance. In those circumstances, the Commission found that a settlement agreement existed and was enforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent">The settlement agreement should be signed by an agency official who has no connection to the complaint. In <span class="Italic">Emerson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01970325 (1997), the Commission found that it was error for the alleged discriminating official to sign the settlement agreement. However, in <span class="Italic">Emerson</span>, the Commission also found that such error was harmless where the complainant did not specifically object to any of the terms of the agreement, and her allegation that it was signed under duress was not supported by any evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agreement is altered after its signature by one party, there is no agreement. Contract law provides that an agreement only is consummated when there is an offer and acceptance. If the "acceptance" in any way alters the offer, it becomes a counter-offer that is subject to rejection. For example, in <span class="Italic">Loeb v. Postmaster General</span>, 01973970 (1998), the Commission found there was no settlement agreement where the complainant signed the agreement, but the agency lawyer did not sign the agreement for several months. Prior to finally signing the agreement, on the face of the agreement, the agency lawyer noted that a full investigation was conducted and that no misconduct on the complainant's part was found. The Commission held the complainant did not knowingly accept the entire agreement. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120142666 (2014), finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that the Agency representative signing the agreement changed critical language after Complainant had already signed the agreement. While much justification is offered for this, including proffered evidence of side communications between the parties, an agreement is simply not valid until both parties sign on to the same language. The proper procedure in this case was to allow Complainant an opportunity to re-review the proposed agreement after the change in language was made and have her sign again to acknowledge that she was accepting the change.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission encourages settlement in the precomplaint stage. However, where the complainant signs an agreement in the counseling stage and the agency waits until after the formal complaint is filed to sign, the agreement is invalid. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Health and Human Services,</span> 05970174 (1998), the Commission found the agency's delay in signing the agreement was bad faith. In the absence of having the complainant sign after the filing of the formal complaint, the formal complaint was an intervening circumstance that nullified the agreement.</p>
