<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-49"><span class="space">3.</span> Regarded as and Other Major Life Activities</h4>
<p class="noindent">Long before passage of the ADA, the Commission had held that the Rehabilitation Act not only extends protection to employees who have conditions that substantially limit major life activities, but also extends protection to persons whom the agency regards as having such impairments. In <span class="Italic">Plotkin v. USPS</span>, 01821233 (1983), the agency terminated the complainant for falsifying his employment application by not reporting an alleged back condition. The termination followed an on-the-job back injury. Prior to being taken to the hospital, the employee's supervisor questioned complainant as to whether he had a history of back trouble. The complainant related that he had sustained an injury when he was 12 years old that did not require hospitalization or treatment. The Commission found the termination constituted disability discrimination because the agency regarded the complainant as disabled, despite the lack of any medical evidence of a disabling condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere reliance of the agency upon the employee's physical condition in taking a personnel action did not constitute the perception of a qualified disabling condition. <span class="Italic">Kelly v. USPS</span>, 01830028 (1983). The condition must have been perceived as substantially limiting a major life activity. The EEOC found it was not discrimination on the basis of a disabling condition for the agency to terminate the complainant as a result of absences resulting from an on-the-job injury that the agency believed could have been avoided with the exercise of reasonable care.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ADAAA now takes the requirement that the agency perceive the individual as being substantially limited out of the equation. The only questions are whether the agency acted on the basis of the perceived or actual impairment and, if so, whether the agency's action is job-related and consistent with business necessity. For example, a direct threat defense may be available to the agency--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, demonstrating that the employee is a threat to the health and safety of himself or someone else. See Chapter 15 under the heading "'<a href="0100-2023-24-022.html#sec15-23">Direct Threat' or 'Elevated Risk' Defense</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">"[I]n a case where a complainant is alleging that s/he was regarded as having a disability, the focus is on the employer's state of mind." <span class="Italic">Keown v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01943171 (1995). Because the focus is on the employer's state of mind, these cases do not raise true issues of reasonable accommodation. Rather, they are properly analyzed as intentional discrimination cases. For example, in <span class="Italic">Keown</span>, the Commission found the reasons for not assigning the complainant certain responsibilities were pretextual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant, whom we have found to be a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the regulations, was assigned to the IK Crew, he performed igniter duties on straight time, but was not selected for such duties on overtime when other co-workers without restrictions were selected. The individuals chosen for the duties were not disabled, did not have records of disabilities, and were not regarded as disabled. The Commission therefore finds that appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has set forth legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision not to assign appellant overtime hours on igniter duties. Agency officials determined that appellant was not qualified to work with an Electrician because he did not have enough experience on the igniter equipment. The Maintenance Superintendent stated that the agency sought overtime crew members who had the experience to act independently on the igniter duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant can establish discrimination based on disability by showing that the agency was motivated by a discriminatory intent. Appellant asserts that his disability was a factor in the agency's decision because it was apparent that his disability was considered when overtime was assigned. The Maintenance Superintendent stated that the primary consideration in assigning appellant overtime assignments on the igniter equipment was that he might not be able to reach the equipment needed to be maintained, since it would require climbing a ladder. Furthermore, the Maintenance Supervisor acknowledged that at the resolution meeting in the counseling stage, he stated that if appellant had his restrictions for climbing changed, he would assign appellant igniter duties. The record indicates that such consideration of appellant's disability was made a management policy as the Midnight Foreman stated that he had been told that appellant was not to work the overtime assignments on igniters because of his physical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency argues that appellant was not qualified for the igniter duties, such reason lacks credibility as the Maintenance Superintendent acknowledged that he told appellant in May 1991 that if appellant no longer had such restrictions, he could work overtime on the igniters. Also, the Maintenance Superintendent indicated that appellant's limitations were the "primary" reason for the denied assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the agency failed to substantiate its conclusion that appellant was not qualified to work on the igniter equipment. In this regard, the Commission notes that the agency did not specifically set forth what level of experience was necessary before appellant would be qualified to work overtime assignments with an Electrician. When appellant specifically questioned the Supervisor about qualifications, the Supervisor did not give him a specific answer. The record indicates that <span id="Page_1151"></span>two Electricians stated that appellant had worked with them on igniter assignments during straight time, yet inadequate explanation was given by supervisory officials to distinguish the feasibility of appellant's assignment in those instances and the overtime assignments. Although the Supervisor stated that he only recalled one such assignment of appellant on straight time, and that assignment involved only instrumentation, it was not clear that appellant's assignment in that instance was due to the nature of the task. Furthermore, the Commission notes that while the Sub-Journeyman had more experience on that crew than appellant, he was considered an assistant or helper, but was still assigned overtime igniter duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Commission finds that appellant was subjected to disability discrimination by the agency officials involved with the overtime assignment process. The agency officials improperly denied appellant full consideration for the overtime assignments on the igniters due to appellant's climbing restriction and the possibility that climbing could be required in an igniter assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Addiss v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971051 (1999), the Commission found the agency terminated the complainant on the basis of a perceived disability. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Addiss</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do find that the appellant was perceived as disabled under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(5) due to the injuries she sustained prior to her termination. Even though the appellant was able to perform the essential duties of her job, her supervisors perceived her as a problem employee because she had back and knee injuries. By their statements and actions toward her it was clear their motivations to end her employment were related to her physical condition and not because she was a poor employee. For example, the appellant stated that when she attempted to ice her knee at work, her supervisor became hostile and would not allow her to. Supervisor TN claimed not to know that the appellant had lifting restrictions even though she had already been placed in a light duty job prior to her surgery. As a result, he required her to lift trays which she had not done before the knee surgery. On the other hand, the agency claimed that the appellant was a poor performer and did not do the job she was asked to do, but failed to produce any concrete evidence of her failures.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Second Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bruzzese v. Attorney General</span>, 16-2775-cv (2nd Cir. 2018), found that a manager who believed that the employee's personality traits would likely compromise his ability to perform his duties did not necessarily regard the employee as disabled. Bruzzese, a special agent for the ATF, was referred for a fitness for duty examination after making "homicidal and suicidal comments," becoming "openly irate" when an undercover operation was delayed and locking himself inside his car after arguing with his supervisor. The examination report revealed that the agent did not have a mental illness or personality disorder but noted that the agent's behavior "evinced histrionic and narcissistic personality traits" and "could support a decision to restrict him from carrying a weapon." Citing concern as to the agent's "mental and emotional stability," the supervisor reassigned Bruzzese to a non-law enforcement role and required him to relinquish his firearm. Bruzzese alleged that the supervisor's actions violated the Rehabilitation Act because he was regarded as having a disability. The Second Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bruzzese</span> disagreed, reasoning:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the record on appeal, we agree with the district court that summary judgment was warranted because Bruzzese did not raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether SAC Turk, the decisionmaker in this case, regarded him as disabled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, none of the FOH professionals whose findings were detailed in the FFD Report, upon which SAC Turk relied, concluded Bruzzese suffered from a mental, emotional, or personality disorder, or a mental illness. Rather, the psychological and psychiatric evaluations, as well as Dr. Goldhagen's overall evaluation, attributed Bruzzese's behavior to personality traits that likely would compromise Bruzzese's ability to perform all of the duties as an armed ATF agent. Personality traits are not, by themselves, a mental impairment. 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(h). There is no evidence Turk disagreed with, rejected, or misunderstood these conclusions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, to the extent ASAC Reid's or Supervisor Immesberger's opinions about Bruzzese's mental condition or behavior may have differed from those expressed in the FFD Report, the record does not support the inference that SAC Turk adopted these opinions, even if he did rely on Reid and Immesberger for factual information. Substantially all of the behavior that Reid and Immesberger reported to Turk (including Bruzzese's "homicidal and suicidal comments") was also described in the FFD Report as having been considered and accounted for by the FOH professionals. Thus, there is no evidence Turk regarded Bruzzese as disabled based on any additional information from Reid and Immesberger.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that SAC Turk's acknowledgement that he was "worried about...Bruzzese's mental and emotional stability," Joint App. at 1406, is not more than a mere "scintilla" of evidence that Turk regarded Bruzzese as disabled. <span class="Italic">See Lyons</span>, 681 F.3d at 56. Viewed in context with all the other evidence in the record, even in the light most favorable to Bruzzese, a reasonable fact-finder would not understand Turk's comment to refer to any mental disability, or to disagree with the FFD Report's conclusion that Bruzzese was not disabled, but rather to express Turk's concerns about Bruzzese's behavior and how it affected his ability to be a safe and effective armed law-enforcement officer.</p>
<p class="noindent">It would seem an elementary proposition that an individual who is not disabled but is perceived as disabled is not entitled to accommodation because there is no actual impairment to accommodate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baldassarre v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05157 (2003); <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990267 (2002). Still, at least one court had called that proposition into question. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Katz v. City Metal Co.</span>, 87 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 1996). The ADAAA specifically provides that an individual who qualifies for protection under the Act because he or she is perceived as having a disability is not entitled to reasonable accommodation. 42 USC 12201(h).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although it is no longer necessary to make a determination that an individual who is perceived as having a disability is also perceived as being substantially limited, some of the Commission's past case law is still instructive on how cases will likely be viewed under the new amendments. For example, the conclusory denial that an agency regards a complainant as disabled is not controlling when its treatment of the complainant indicates otherwise. In <span class="Italic">Andress v. Postmaster General</span>, 01880706 (1988), the Commission confronted that question in the context of the agency's removal of a letter carrier who was hampered by soreness in the knee approximately two days per year. After finding the employee did not have a physical impairment that substantially limited a major life function, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Andress</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency terminated appellant because of an opinion that excessive walking, knee bending, stair climbing, and so forth could aggravate his condition. The carrier position involved such or similar activities, and thus appellant was deemed medically unsuitable. We find that the agency perceived appellant as handicapped.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not persuaded by the argument that the agency did not consider appellant handicapped, but merely found him unsuitable for a particular job. The RD relies on the agency's request to Doctor 2 for a fitness-for-duty exam. Naturally, the agency at that time would focus on carrier requirements, inasmuch as that was the position at issue. The agency did not require a blanket determination regarding the appellant's ability to perform any and all jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that appellant was not actually substantially impaired does not affect his protection under the statute in light of our finding that he was perceived to be impaired. The agency's perception, even if inaccurate, can be as handicapping as the physical limitations flowing from actual impairment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline</span>, ____ U.S. ____, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 55 LW 4245 (1987). In this case, the agency treated appellant as if he were handicapped, and we find appellant is handicapped for the purposes of the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Marsh</span>, 46 FEP Cases 971, 976 (W.D. Mo. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ginish v. Postmaster General</span>, 01892474 (1989) ("The fact that appellant was not substantially impaired does not affect his protection under the statute in light of our finding that he was perceived to be impaired. The agency's perceptions, even if inaccurate, can be as handicapping as the limitations flowing from actual impairment....") In that case, the Commission found that it was discriminatory to require an employee whom the agency perceived as psychotic to produce a medical certificate that he was fit for duty after an absence of one day.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case, the Commission focused on the labeling of the employee by the supervisor, as well as the supervisor's haste in overlooking past performance by the employee and concluding that his present work was unacceptable in quality. Relying upon these factors, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01920648 (1992), wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we were to find that appellant's psychiatric disorder was not a substantial limitation and that appellant was not a person with a disability, under the facts before us, we would in the alternative conclude that Supervisor I regarded appellant as having a mental impairment, as is set forth in 29 CFR 1613.702(e)(1). Supervisor I thought of and labeled appellant as "sick" and "crazy," told appellant he had a "little mind," treated appellant in an infantile fashion, repeatedly likened appellant to a former employee who had psychiatric problems, and urged other employees to stay away from appellant because he was "crazy." We also find the aforementioned evidence, as well as Supervisor I's hasty conclusion that appellant's work was unsatisfactory, following years of satisfactory and exemplary performance appraisals, shows that Supervisor I merely relegated appellant into Supervisor I's perceived category of "individuals with psychiatric illnesses," applied his own social bias, and dismissed appellant as a noncontributing, burdensome employee of little or no worth to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In some instances, if the Commission determines that an individual was perceived as disabled, the agency's treatment of the individual will amount <span id="Page_1152"></span>to direct evidence of discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lugo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01983971 (2001), the complainant, an applicant for a letter carrier position, had a high school diploma, but during an interview for the job the complainant exhibited problems reading. Knowing that the applicant had a learning disability, the interviewer determined that he did not have the basic competence in reading and speaking English to perform the essential functions of the position. Although the case was remanded because the administrative judge improperly granted summary judgment to the agency, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lugo</span> explained how the reasons the complainant was rejected would constitute direct evidence of discrimination if it was determined the agency perceived him as disabled:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we believe there exist sufficient material facts in dispute which would allow a reasonable fact finder to conclude that complainant was not hired by the agency due to his perceived learning disability. The record indicates that during the interview, HR determined that complainant only held a fourth grade reading level. However, HR was aware that complainant was a high school graduate. We find that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that HR perceived complainant's reading and writing problem to rise to the level of impairment since he also held a high school diploma. In other words, complainant's lack of reading and writing abilities could have been viewed by HR as not being the result of a lack of education but rather likely a mental impairment. In addition, the record indicates that complainant was born and raised in the United States. If HR knew that English was complainant's first language, it would support the likelihood that the agency perceived complainant's fourth grade reading level to be caused from a mental impairment rather than lack of education. We also find that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that complainant was regarded as being substantially limited in the major life activity of learning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find insufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that complainant was not qualified to perform the essential functions of the letter carrier position. While the record contains a "suitability and selection guide" issued by the agency to assist individuals in charge of making hiring selections, the guide simply indicates that the selectee must be able to "receive and transmit information effectively in oral form as required by the job and comprehend written and oral instructions adequately for safe and effective job performance." (emphasis added). There is nothing in the record which indicates what the specific job of letter carrier requires with respect to reading and writing. Moreover, the only evidence in the record which relates to complainant's job qualifications indicates that he is qualified to perform the job. Accordingly, the record evidence presents a genuine dispute of material fact on the issue of whether complainant was a qualified individual with a perceived disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The undisputed record shows that HR failed to hire complainant because he lacked the "basic competence in reading, speaking and understanding English." If, after a hearing, a fact finder determines that complainant was regarded as disabled, this explanation for non-hiring would amount to direct evidence of discrimination. The agency would then be required to show that it would have made the same decision absent discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Walker v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Request No. 05980504 (April 8, 1999); <span class="Italic">Stock v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal Request No. 05980053 (January 8, 1999) (affirming <span class="Italic">Stock v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01953223 (September 12, 1997) holding that selecting official's expressed doubts as to complainant's ability to perform duties given his medical restrictions amounted to direct evidence of discrimination based on perceived disability).</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of a derogatory term in referring to a physical deformity may indicate that the employer perceives an employee as disabled. In <span class="Italic">Perron v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05805 (2001), the complainant had two missing fingers. The administrative judge had found, as a matter of law, that the complainant was not regarded as disabled. The Commission disagreed, and found that the RMO's reference to persons with physical deformations as "gimps" indicated that he may have perceived the complainant as disabled.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's perception that an employee is "burned out" because of his former assignment in a stressful environment does not mean the agency regards the employee as disabled. <span class="Italic">McNeal v. Attorney General</span>, 01951323 (1996). There was no evidence the agency regarded the employee as having a mental impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that an agency has referred an employee for a psychological evaluation could be evidence that the agency regards the employee as mentally disabled. However there is no <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule regarding psychological fitness-for-duty examinations. In fact, agencies with positions that require a security clearance can subject an employee to a psychological examination on the basis of far less evidence than a suspicion of mental illness. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01963110 (1997), an employee who worked at a nuclear power plant was subjected to a psychological evaluation after an arrest. The Commission rejected the employee's contention that the psychological evaluation demonstrated the agency regarded him as mentally disabled. In addition, the Commission further observed that, even if the psychological evaluation could be viewed as proving the agency regarded the employee as disabled, his subsequent loss of his security clearance prevented him from meeting the definition of a qualified individual with a disability. As the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the weight of the evidence does not support appellant's contention that he was regarded as disabled by the agency. The fact that appellant was referred for psychological evaluation does not establish that management thought he was mentally ill. The evidence shows that appellant was referred for the evaluation after his arrest for a number of serious traffic offenses which occurred on the grounds of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant. It is significant to note that appellant worked at a nuclear power plant regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Appellant's position with the agency gave him access to safeguarded material and information, and therefore, under NRC regulations, he was required to have a security clearance. NRC regulations require personnel occupying a position such as appellant's to undergo "psychological assessment designed to evaluate the possible impact of any noted psychological characteristics which may have a bearing on trustworthiness and reliability." 10 CFR &#x00A7; 73.56(b)(2)(ii). Moreover, the regulations require supervisors and management personnel to conduct behavioral observation of employees "designed to detect individual behavioral changes which, if left unattended, could lead to acts detrimental to the public health and safety." 10 CFR &#x00A7; 73.56(b) (2) (iii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The report of appellant's psychological evaluation and the testimony of the agency psychologists clearly establish that appellant was not diagnosed as suffering from any mental impairment. Rather, appellant was found to have certain personality traits and an escalating pattern of conduct which was characterized by the psychologists as demonstrating "poor judgment, irresponsible behavior, poor impulse control, and a rebelliousness towards persons in positions of authority." In light of these findings, the psychologists stated they had serious concerns about appellant's reliability and judgment, and concluded that "his behavior and attitudes were inconsistent with the standards for psychological approval for unescorted access." Two earlier psychological evaluations of appellant, conducted in 1987 and 1988, also found no evidence of a mental impairment, but noted some personality traits and behavior which was questionable, but at that time, were not sufficient to revoke his security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Chief AO's statement that he had been unable to find a manager willing to "take a risk" on appellant, the testimony of agency officials establishes that it is more likely than not that this statement referred to the fact that appellant had a reputation throughout the agency as a difficult employee to manage. The Chief AO said he was told so by a number of managers, especially after they spoke with appellant on the telephone. Several managers at Browns Ferry and Muscle Shoals confirmed that the Chief AO had contacted them regarding rehiring appellant, but that even if they had had openings, which they did not, they had a negative impression of appellant as "aggressive," "obnoxious," "demanding," "belligerent," and "quite vocal" in his criticism of management. Even appellant's union representative noted that appellant had a negative reputation among many supervisors because he had reported a number of them to the Inspector General's office. All the agency officials interviewed during the investigation denied perceiving appellant as having a mental impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Commission finds that appellant has failed to produce adequate evidence to support a claim under the Rehabilitation Act because he has not established that he meets the definition of an individual with a disability as set forth in the statute. Moreover, even if appellant had been able to establish that he was regarded by the agency as disabled, he cannot prove that he is a "qualified" individual with a disability. A qualified person with a disability is one "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others and who...[m]eets the experience and/or educational requirements...for the position in question." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6). The record establishes that the position appellant sought with the agency was required, by NRC regulations, to be occupied by an individual with a security clearance. In this workplace, the agency has established that possession of a security clearance was an essential function of the position. Appellant's did not possess such a clearance as his had been indefinitely revoked.</p>
