<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-83"><span class="space">a.</span> Constructive Discharge</h5>
<p class="noindent">One exception to the general rule that reinstatement is not an appropriate remedy where the employee has resigned or retired is in cases involving the theory of constructive discharge. "<a href="0100-2023-27-006.html#sec18-7">Constructive Discharges"</a> are discussed fully in Chapter 18. However, in at least one case not involving a constructive discharge, the Commission ruled that the employee should be given the option of reinstatement or remaining in retirement status and receiving the difference between the retirement benefits he actually received and those he should have received but for the retirement. In <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Postmaster</span> <span class="Italic">General</span>, 01951472 (1997), the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant's disability. The failure of the agency to accommodate the complainant's disability meant he could not return to work. As a result, the employee elected to retire. In ruling in <span class="Italic">Quinn</span> that the complainant had the option of reinstatement, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the appropriate remedy, we note that, in cases where a complainant has retired, reinstatement is typically not a remedy absent a showing that the complainant was constructively discharged<span class="Italic">. See Harrell v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940652 (May 24, 1995). Although appellant has not made such a showing, we find that the facts of this case warrant that the agency offer him the option of reinstatement. Specifically, to the extent the agency did not permit appellant to return to work in 1993, and because he had no other source of income, we find that the agency gave him no choice but to retire. Therefore, we find appellant shall be afforded the option of either reinstatement into the position of Distribution Clerk, or an equivalent position, retroactive to the date he would have been placed in it had the agency not discriminated against him; or remaining in a retirement status and receiving back pay in <span id="Page_1776"></span>the amount of the difference between what he would have received had he been reinstated and the retirement benefits he did receive.</p>
<p class="noindent">For a time, it seemed that the remedy in <span class="Italic">Quinn</span> may be restricted to Rehabilitation Act cases where the complainant is physically unable to work in the absence of accommodation. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Sandberg v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952301 (1997) (Commission gave an employee, who was not reasonably accommodated and approved for disability retirement, the option of returning to work or remaining retired).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Payne v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A42405 (2004), relying on <span class="Italic">Ghannam v. Agency for International Development</span>, 05A10146 (2001), the Commission found that a complainant who had elected disability retirement because she had been required to work outside of medical restrictions was entitled to retroactive reinstatement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of a back pay award is to restore complainant to the position she would have occupied, but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</span> 442 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975); <span class="Italic">Davis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (November 29, 1990). The agency is required to make certain deductions from back pay awards to ensure that the employee does not receive more in total benefits than she would have received in the absence of the personnel action. The person who has been discriminated against must receive a sum of money equal to what would have been earned by that person in the employment lost through discrimination (gross back pay) less what was actually earned from other employment during the period, after normal expenses incurred in seeking and holding the interim employment have been deducted (net interim earnings). The difference between gross back pay and net interim earnings is net back pay due. Net back pay accrues from the date of discrimination, except where the statute limits recovery, until the discrimination against the individual has been remedied. Gross back pay should include all forms of compensation and must reflect fluctuations in working time, overtime rates, penalty overtime, Sunday premium and night work, changing rates of pay, transfers, promotions, and privileges of employment to which the complainant would have been entitled but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department for the Air Force,</span> Petition No. 04940006 (May 31, 1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Williams v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933156 (May 4, 1994), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940680 (February 16, 1995)). The Commission construes "benefits" broadly to include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, annual leave, sick leave, health insurance, overtime and premium pay, night differentials, and retirement contributions.<span class="Italic"> Vereb v. Department of Justice,</span> Petition No. 04980008 (February 26, 1999). A back pay claimant under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act generally has a duty to mitigate damages. The burden is on the agency, however, to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that complainant has failed to mitigate her damages. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(d); <span class="Italic">McNeil v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960436 (December 9, 1999). The Commission recognizes that precise measurement cannot always be used to reduce the wrong inflicted; nonetheless, the Commission believes that the burden of limiting the remedy rests with the defendant agency.<span class="Italic"> Davis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (November 29, 1990). It is the agency's obligation to ensure that its back pay calculations are clear, supported in the record and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has already awarded restoration of all leave taken as a result of its discriminatory action, but it argues that complainant is not entitled to back pay or reinstatement. The Commission finds that complainant is entitled to this remedial relief, and looks to our Commission precedent in <span class="Italic">Ghannam v. Agency for International Development,</span> for guidance. EEOC Appeal No. 01990574 (November 9, 2000), <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A10146 (August 2, 2001). In <span class="Italic">Ghannam,</span> the Commission held that complainant was denied reasonable accommodation when the agency refused to consider her physician's proposal that assistive computer technology be considered as a reasonable accommodation to permit her to perform her duties as a GS-7 Employee Development Assistant, and absent undue hardship or other affirmative defense, to provide such accommodation in lieu of reassignment to a GS-3 Information Receptionist position. On request for reconsideration, the agency argued that the Commission's decision in Appeal No. 01990574 improperly ordered reinstatement and back pay rather than remanded for an evidentiary determination the issue of whether complainant could have been accommodated at the time in question. The agency also argued that the Commission improperly ordered the agency to place the complainant retroactively in her former GS-7 position, which the agency contended there was no evidence she was able to perform. The Commission found that both contentions were without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency further argued in a "supplement" to its request, that the ordered reinstatement improperly required the agency to place complainant retroactively in her former GS-7 position while recognizing that the record did not establish whether or not complainant would have been separated pursuant to a reduction-in-force (RIF) if she had been accommodated in that position at the time in question. The agency contended that because the record did not indicate whether or not complainant would have been subject to a RIF had she remained in her GS-7 position, the prior decision erred in granting reinstatement. The Commission found, however, that in the absence of evidence establishing that complainant was not entitled to reinstatement, the prior decision properly awarded reinstatement. Additionally, in the absence of any contention or evidence that complainant would have been subject to a RIF even if she had remained in her GS-7 position, she was entitled to receive reinstatement together with back pay from the date she was denied reasonable accommodation through the date that she either returned to duty or declined the offer of reinstatement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, between November 1996, and February 1999, complainant took large amounts of sick leave, annual leave and leave without pay, in order to cope with her reassignment to the Release of Information Clerk position. Copying records and reassembling charts after copying were essential duties of the Release of Information Clerk position that required complainant to stand for long periods at the copy machine and to hold her head down while inspecting copies and reassembling files. These long periods of standing and holding her head down exacerbated her neck and back pain. The agency concluded that she was not provided with an effective accommodation, because her physical impairments were aggravated by her work assignments in Release of Information, thereby forcing her to take leave. The Commission finds that the level of aggravation caused to complainant's physical condition by her reassignment as a Release of Information Clerk rose to a level such that no reasonable person in complainant's circumstances could remain in that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that <span class="Italic">Ghannam</span> is analogous to the instant case. In <span class="Italic">Ghannam</span> we found that the agency put forth no evidence showing that complainant would have been subject to a RIF had she remained in her GS-7 Employee Development Assistant position. In this case, the agency has put forth no evidence to show that had complainant been provided with an effective accommodation at any time between November 4, 1996, and February 1999, that she would have been compelled to go on disability retirement. The irony is that had the agency conducted the EEO process in a timely and fair manner, complainant's complaint may have been resolved before she left the agency on disability retirement. The agency's failure to accommodate complainant coupled with the agency's failure to execute the EEO process as required under the Commission's regulations, inevitably left complainant with little choice: continue to work in a position that was outside of her medical restrictions, or resign from the agency. Complainant made that dilemma clear in her supplemental affidavit, as described above. She clearly stated that she had to go on disability retirement because the agency failed to provide her with a position within her medical restrictions. The agency failed to rebut complainant's contention and provided no evidence to show that she would have gone on disability retirement in February 1999 even if the agency had provided her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Therefore, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to back pay from February 1999, until the date the discrimination is remedied, through an offer of reinstatement. The agency may take into account complainant's receipt of disability retirement beginning in February 1999, when evaluating mitigation of damages as it calculates complainant's back pay award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a petition for enforcement in <span class="Italic">Ghannam v. Agency for International Development</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/04A40007.txt">04A40007</a> (2004), the Commission held that the complainant's acceptance of disability retirement benefits constituted a mitigation of damages in a case where the complainant conditionally accepted a demotion to a lower-graded job pending a decision on her request for reasonable accommodation and was then subjected to a reduction-in-force from the lower-grade job. There was no evidence the employee would have been subject to the RIF if she had been accommodated in her original job. In awarding the complainant back pay for the period of time that she was on disability retirement, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ghannam</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that petitioner has been provided with back pay for the period October 1, 1998, through December 14, 2001. The agency, however, did not pay petitioner any ordered back pay for the period December 12, 1995, through October 1, 1998. Petitioner maintains that she is entitled to back pay for this unpaid period. The agency maintains that petitioner is not entitled to back pay for this unpaid period because she has not mitigated her damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 9, 1995, complainant "conditionally accepted" a transfer to a GS-3 receptionist position, and began working in that position on November 20, 1995. When complainant accepted the GS-3 position, she expressly stated that she still intended to pursue accommodation in the GS-7 Employee Development Assistant Position. However, on December 12, 1995, complainant was formally denied use of assistive technology, e.g., voice activated computer software, to allow her to perform her duties as a GS-7 Employee Development Assistant. On or about September 30, 1996, the GS-3 position was subject to a reduction-in-force<span id="Page_1777"></span> (RIF), and petitioner was separated from the agency. There is no evidence that petitioner would have been subject to a RIF had she remained in her GS-7 position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that petitioner mitigated her damages when she accepted the GS-3 receptionist position to which she was transferred following the unlawful denial of reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. For the period December 12, 1995 through September 30, 1996, petitioner is entitled to back pay at the GS-7 grade level, offset by what she received in pay at the GS-3 level during that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that petitioner is not entitled to back pay from December 12, 1995, through October 1, 1998, because she was not "ready, willing, and able to work" during this period. As we have already found that petitioner mitigated her damages through September 30, 1996, we shall now address the period October 1, 1996, through October 1, 1998.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' briefs indicate agreement that receipt of disability retirement constitutes mitigation of damages. In the Agency Response to Petition for Enforcement/Clarification, the agency states, "As Complainant's retirement annuity constitutes mitigation of damages, the Agency began calculating Complainant's back pay from October 1, 1998." In Petitioner's Rebuttal Statement, petitioner responds that the parties "agree that complainant's disability retirement constitutes mitigation of damages." However, the parties disagree as to the date on which the mitigation began.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant PFE, petitioner maintains that although her application for disability retirement was approved on January 30, 1998, the approval letter from OPM states that annuity payments were to begin on the last day that petitioner was paid, which was the date on which she was subject to the RIF. The Commission notes that in response to petitioner's prior PFE, Petition No. 04A30007, the agency argued," [T]he Agency has established that Complainant has been receiving disability retirement benefits from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) possibly since as early as 1996." A letter dated November 13, 2002, from OPM, states that petitioner's annuity commenced on September 28, 1996; however, OPM benefits began on September 13, 1998, when Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits were terminated. The Commission finds that given the parties' positions that receipt of disability retirement constitutes mitigation of damages, and given that petitioner's disability annuity commenced on September 28, 1996, petitioner began mitigation of damages through disability retirement on or about September 28, 1996. The Commission finds that there is insufficient evidence to prove that petitioner would have been on disability retirement in September 1996, had she not been denied reasonable accommodation by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the agency's July 11, 2003 request for information from petitioner regarding back pay, the agency cites 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 550.805(c)(l)--550.805(c)(2), which implement the Back Pay Act. These regulations state as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in computing the amount of back pay under section 5596 of title 5 United States Code, and this subpart, an agency may not include--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Any period during which an employee was not ready, willing, and able to perform his or her duties because of an incapacitating illness or injury; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Any period during which an employee was unavailable for the performance of his or her duties <span class="Italic">for reasons other than those related to, or caused by, the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission emphasizes the last part of &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(2), because we note that the agency omitted this portion of the regulation in its July 11, 2003 letter to petitioner, in which it requested information from petitioner regarding back pay and mitigation of damages. This portion of the regulation is noteworthy because the record shows that petitioner was unavailable for the performance of her duties due to the agency's unwarranted personnel action, the unlawful discrimination which petitioner has already proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The Commission found that the agency denied petitioner reasonable accommodation under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to consider her December 1995 request to be accommodated by use of assistive technology in her GS-7 secretarial position. <span class="Italic">See Ghannam v. Agency for International Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01990574 (November 9, 2000), <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A10146 (August 2, 2001). Petitioner was unable to report to her GS-7 position during this period because the agency failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. Petitioner applied for disability retirement on or about September 30, 1996, following her RIF from the GS-3 receptionist position to which she was improperly downgraded due to the agency's discriminatory actions. The agency did not offer petitioner reinstatement to her GS-7 secretarial position until September 4, 2001, following the Commission's finding of discrimination. It was not until December 14, 2001, that petitioner informed the agency that she was completely incapacitated from work and therefore unable to resume her duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency cites petitioner's response to its July 11, 2003 request for information as evidence that her request for back pay should be denied. While petitioner's response to question 6 indicates an unwillingness to mitigate damages, we find this response to be inadequate proof that petitioner failed to mitigate her damages. The agency has submitted to the Commission only a limited portion of petitioner's reply to the July 11, 2003 letter. The agency has only provided petitioner's response to question 6. Not only is the rest of the document not submitted by the agency, but the Commission is unsure as to whether a part of the response to question 6 is missing as well. The agency's omission of a critical portion of the statute indicated above, coupled with the agency's omission of the remainder of this document, causes the Commission to regard this isolated statement as inadequate proof of petitioner's failure to mitigate damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the agency cited 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(3)(iii) and (iv) as supporting the agency's assertion that petitioner "must demonstrate that her disability retirement was erroneous." Those portions of the regulations cited by the agency do not state what the agency purports; rather, they state that an agency must make certain offsets and deductions from a gross back pay award, and the provisions specifically cited by the agency refer to health benefit premiums and life insurance premiums, if such coverage continued during a period of erroneous retirement. The agency appears to understand these provisions, as it previously cited these provisions in its Response to Petition for Enforcement/Clarification in order to explain why the agency deducted health and life insurance premiums from the back pay award covering the period October 1, 1998 through December 14, 2001. As detailed below, the panics have come to agreement regarding deductions for health insurance and life insurance premiums.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has presented no comprehensible argument as to why it has not paid petitioner the back pay award ordered by the Commission for the period December 12, 1995, through October 1, 1998. The agency failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner has failed to mitigate her damages, was unavailable for the performance of her duties, or was not ready, willing and able to perform her duties for reasons other than the unlawful discrimination to which she was subjected by the agency beginning on December 12, 1995. Therefore, in addition to finding that petitioner is entitled to back pay at the GS-7 grade level, offset by what she received in pay at the GS-3 level, for the period December 12, 1995 through September 30, 1996, we find that for the period October 1, 1996 through October 1, 1998, petitioner is entitled to back pay, at the GS-7 grade level, offset by petitioner's Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) benefits where such award would result in double recovery. The Commission GRANTS petitioner's Petition for Enforcement with respect to the issue of back pay for the period December 12, 1995, through October 1, 1998, and directs the agency to take the actions set forth in the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hulvey v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0720070059 (2008), the Commission extended the remedy of altering the retirement date in a case of age discrimination where the complainant presented evidence that his plans to retire resulted in not being chosen for a promotion. The complainant presented evidence that a management official had said it would be "'grossly unfair' to hire a candidate who soon planned to retire." The complainant instead retired shortly after being nonselected. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Hulvey</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency is correct to refer to <span class="Italic">Jurgens v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 903 F.2d 386, 390-91 (5th Cir. 1990) for the proposition that when an employer discriminatorily denies a promotion, an employee's duty to mitigate damages requires that the employee remain on the job. The agency is also correct to cite to <span class="Italic">Jurgens</span> for the proposition that an employee must establish that he or she was subject to constructive discharge in order for the employee to recover back pay beyond the date of his/her retirement or resignation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 389, However,<span class="Italic"> Jurgens</span> involves a set of facts that distinguish it from the instant case. Therefore, the end result cannot be as the agency pleads.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Jurgens,</span> the appellant, a white male, competitively applied for a position which was ultimately awarded to an individual outside of his protected class. The appellant testified that had he obtained the promotion, he would have retired eleven years later when he would be eligible for full annuity. Three years later, the agency abolished appellant's position due to a restructuring. As part of the reorganization, the agency offered the appellant the choice of accepting (1) a demotion or (2) early retirement with a reduced annuity. Appellant felt compelled to accept the latter option in light of what he perceived was an environment of racial discrimination and because he believed a demotion would be too degrading. The lower court determined that the agency had discriminated against appellant in denying him the promotion and it awarded him back pay from the time of the non-selection until the effective date of his retirement. The lower court denied appellant's plea <span id="Page_1778"></span>for back pay beyond the date of his retirement, and appellant appealed this conclusion. Upon review, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision finding that appellant was not entitled to back pay beyond the date of resignation absent a finding of constructive discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The critical difference between <span class="Italic">Jurgens</span> and the instant case are the circumstances surrounding the resignation. In <span class="Italic">Jurgens,</span> the appellant had to choose between early retirement and a demotion. The retirement, was prompted by a kind of intervening act--the reorganization--that had nothing to do with his age. There was no direct link between his retirement and the discrimination. On the other hand, in our instant case, there was a direct link between complainant's age, retirement eligibility and his non-selection. In fact, there is evidence showing that management stated at a meeting that it was "grossly wrong" to hire a candidate who soon planned to retire.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Counselor's Report; Affidavit F-1. Due to attitudes and comments like this, complainant was not selected for the promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, where, as here, complainant made it known to management that he planned to retire and this knowledge prompted management to not select him for a promotion, we cannot charge him with failing to mitigate his damages when he in fact retired. An age based retirement does not necessarily amount to a breach of the duty to mitigate. As opposed to other forms of separation and retirement, which we do not address specifically here and upon which our holding does not apply, once an employee reaches a certain age, the employee has earned his or her right to retire. We find it presumptively unjust to penalize an employee who has dedicated many years of service to an agency and has expressed a desire to retire upon reaching retirement age by requiring that the employee forego the retirement privilege and remain in a job to combat perceived discrimination in order to recover any back pay. Complainant testified at the hearing and in other record documents that he would have retired from federal service on September 6, 2006 had he been properly selected because that is the date when he would have acquired the "high three" year average salary for retirement purposes and when he would have received higher retirement annuities.<span class="Italic"> See</span> HT at 287:19-288:11 and 725:13-16; Pre-hearing Statement at 17; Complainant's Responses to Agency's First Set of Interrogatories and First Request for Production of Documents at Qs. 18-20. We find this evidence persuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As complainant has persuasively established that he would have retired on September 6, 2006 but for the discrimination, we find it appropriate to tailor his back pay remedy in accordance with that projected date of retirement. Therefore, complainant is owed back pay for the period between September 7, 2003 and September 6, 2006. As a corollary to this award, complainant is also entitled to increased annuity payments and benefits based on his GS-14 status as of September 2003 and his retirement date of September 2006. The agency is to provide the Office of Personnel Management with all paperwork and clear instructions on how to adjust complainant's retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did, however, in <span class="Italic">Hulvey</span>, find that the complainant was not entitled to reinstatement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we grant complainant's plea for increased back pay and order his retroactive promotion into the GS-14 position at issue, we do not agree with the AJ that complainant was entitled to reinstatement in the next available GS-14 Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Specialist or Supervisory Mining Engineer position. As discussed above, when an employee is subject to a discriminatory non-selection, yet retires due to age, it is reasonable that the employee expect to receive back pay for the wrong he or she endured, regardless of the retirement. However, it is not reasonable for the employee to expect that the agency place him or her into the position at issue because when an employee expresses a desire to retire, even before suspecting that discrimination is afoot, and the person in fact retires due to age it is done with the implied intention that the person will not return to work. As such, we agree with the agency's arguments that given the voluntariness of the retirement and the lack of evidence that complainant had been constructively discharged, he is not entitled to reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kruecke v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A60028 (June 7, 2006) (affirming the AJ's finding that reinstatement should not be awarded where complainant apparently no longer wants to continue her career).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the employee cannot establish a constructive discharge claim, he may be entitled to back pay and a readjustment of his retirement benefits. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bowens v. Postmaster General</span>, 0194056 (1997), the Commission found that the complainant had proved disability discrimination, but failed to prove a constructive discharge claim. The Commission found the complainant had not retired because of the discrimination, but because he was offered a retirement bonus as part of an early-out program. But the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bowens</span> also found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is not persuaded that appellant can establish a claim of constructive termination, in that the record reflects that appellant retired when he did at least in part to avail himself of a lump-sum retirement bonus. Further, it does not appear that the agency informed appellant that he would be terminated from employment after the MJO was rescinded. A conclusion that appellant was constructively terminated therefore would be tenuous at best. However, given that the agency's failure to accommodate appellant clearly was a motivating factor in the timing of appellant's retirement, it may also be a factor in the "make whole" relief to which appellant is entitled<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.</span>, 424 U.S. 747, 764 (1976); <span class="Italic">Adesanya v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 01933395 (July 21, 1994). Accordingly, in addition to whatever back pay and benefits may be appropriate, the agency will adjust appellant's effective date of retirement to reflect that appellant retired April 15, 1995, which appellant states is the date on which he would have retired absent the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 04980006 (1998), the Commission noted that the complainant was entitled to any necessary adjustment in his retirement benefits based on a back pay award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McCutcheon v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 0120081316 (2010), the Commission found that the complainant had not established a constructive discharge after her nonselection for a position and, as a result, was not entitled to relief in the form of extending her retirement date. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">McCutcheon</span>, specifically contrasted its holding in that case to its holding in <span class="Italic">Hulvey</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that an agency is not required to reinstate an employee as part of make-whole relief where the employee has retired in the interim and there has been no finding of constructive discharge. <span class="Italic">See Uyehara v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933721 (May 9, 1994); <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880192 (July 5, 1988). On appeal, however, complainant states she is entitled to a longer back pay period and cites to a Commission case as support. In <span class="Italic">Hulvey v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070059 (February 7, 2008), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080384 (April 17, 2008), the Commission found complainant proved that he would not have retired but for the discrimination he encountered when he was not selected for a position. In that regard, the decision also found that complainant's non-selection was directly related to his eligibility for retirement, and that his subsequent retirement did not constitute a failure to mitigate his damages. <span class="Italic">Hulvey</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070059. Accordingly, the decision found complainant was entitled to back pay past his date of retirement, so that he could get his "high 3" for retirement purposes. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The distinction between <span class="Italic">Hulvey</span> and the instant case is based on the evidence in the cases. The <span class="Italic">Hulvey</span> case specifically found persuasive evidence that complainant was going to retire in the coming years, and that agency officials considered this information as part of the reason he was not selected for the position. In the instant case, the record contains no such evidence that complainant was planning on retiring and no persuasive evidence that she retired because of the discrimination or intolerable work conditions. The only evidence in this regard was submitted on appeal. As a general rule, the Commission will not consider new evidence on appeal unless there is an affirmative showing that the evidence was not reasonably available prior to the investigation or during the hearing process. EEO Management Directive 110, Chapter 9 &#x00A7; VI.A.3 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that complainant, who has been represented by counsel during these proceedings, had several opportunities to present evidence related to her retirement or allegation of constructive discharge but failed to do so. When the agency conducted a supplementary investigation, complainant was provided with an opportunity to rebut the evidence, and failed to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find complainant's claim is speculative, and find no evidence to support her contention that she would not have retired until May 2, 2008, had she not been subjected to discrimination. We further find no evidence that complainant raised constructive discharge until the filing of this appeal. Accordingly, we deny her request for reinstatement (and remedies that would have been associated with that reinstatement), and conclude that her entitlement to back pay ends on October 31, 2005, the date of her retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, under the 1991 Civil Rights Act, employees who have resigned or retired still may be eligible for an award of compensatory damages.</p>
