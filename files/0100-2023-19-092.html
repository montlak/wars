<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-85"><span class="space">A.</span> THE <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">PRICE WATERHOUSE</span></span> ANALYSIS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The question of the appropriate burden of proof became slightly more confused by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989), a mixed motive case, where the Court held that the employer must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it was motivated by legitimate factors. Part of the problem with <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> is that, while a majority of justices agreed in the result, there was much less agreement about the rationale. Only three other justices joined the plurality opinion written by Justice Blackmun. Justices White and O'Connor filed concurring opinions. The other part of the problem with <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> is that the courts and the Commission were split on what burden of proof to impose upon an employer that asserts it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. Much of the split, in turn, derived from the fact that there are different circumstances where the employer asserted such a defense--in some cases, the employer asserts that it would have taken the same action because it also was motivated by legitimate reasons and, in other cases, the employer asserts that it could have taken the same action because of information it has discovered after making the disputed employment decision--but that distinction was not always being made in particular cases.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> involved a female plaintiff who was denied a partnership at a national accounting firm. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, 618 F. Supp. 1109 (1985), and the court of appeals affirmed, 825 F.2d 458 (1987). The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to resolve a "conflict among the Courts of Appeals concerning the respective burdens of proof of a defendant and plaintiff in a suit under Title VII when it has been shown that an employment decision resulted from a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives." 109 S. Ct. at 1781. The district court found there was little to question in the plaintiff's qualifications for partner status. There also was direct evidence of discriminatory motive. After her unsuccessful bid for partner status, she was advised that, to improve her chances, she should "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1782. However, at the same time, there was evidence that she was viewed as overly aggressive, particularly in her dealings with subordinates. Summarizing the findings below, the Court in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 1783-84, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The judge went on to decide, however, that some of the partners' remarks about Hopkins stemmed from an impermissibly cabined view of the proper behavior of women, and that Price Waterhouse had done nothing to disavow reliance on such comments. He held that Price Waterhouse had unlawfully discriminated against Hopkins on the basis of sex by consciously giving credence and effect to partners' comments that resulted from sex stereotyping. Noting that Price Waterhouse could avoid equitable relief by proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have placed Hopkins' candidacy on hold even absent this discrimination, the judge decided that the firm had not carried this heavy burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ultimate conclusion, but departed from its analysis in one particular: it held that even if a plaintiff proves that discrimination played a role in an employment decision, the defendant will not be found liable if it proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination. 263 U.S. App. D.C. at 333-334, 825 F.2d, at 470-471. Under this approach, an employer is not deemed to have violated Title VII if it proves that it would have made the same decision in the absence of an impermissible motive, whereas under the District Court's approach, the employer's proof in that respect only avoids equitable relief. We decide today that the Court of Appeals had the better approach, but that both courts erred in requiring the employer to make its proof by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting that the question of which approach and what burden of proof to apply had left the courts of appeals in "disarray," Justice Blackmun, in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 109 S. Ct., at 1785-89, went on to analyze the precise wording of Title VII and the defendant's argument that the plaintiff must show that gender was a "but-for" cause of the employment decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But-for causation is a hypothetical construct. In determining whether a particular factor was a but-for cause of a given event, we begin by assuming that that factor was present at the time of the event, and then ask whether, even if that factor had been absent, the event nevertheless would have transpired in the same way. The present, active tense of the operative verbs of &#x00A7; 703 (a) (1) ("to fail or refuse"), in contrast, turns our attention to the actual moment of the event in question, the adverse employment decision. The critical inquiry, the one commanded by the words of &#x00A7; 703(a)(1), is whether gender was a factor in the employment decision at the moment it was made. Moreover, since we know that the words "because of" do not mean "solely because of," we also know that Title VII meant to condemn even those decisions based on a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate considerations. When, therefore, an employer considers both gender and legitimate factors at the time of making a decision, that decision was "because of" sex and the other, legitimate consideration--even if we may say later, in the context of litigation, that the decision would have been the same if gender had not been taken into account.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To attribute this meaning to the words "because of" does not, as the dissent asserts, <span class="Italic">post</span>, at 1808, divest them of causal significance. A simple example illustrates the point. Suppose two physical forces act upon and move an object, and suppose that either force acting alone would have moved the object. As the dissent would have it, neither physical force was a "cause" of the motion unless we can show that but for one or both of them, the object would not have moved; apparently both forces were simply "in the air" unless we can identify at least one of them as a but for cause of the object's movement. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Events that are causally overdetermined, in other words, may not have any "cause" at all. This cannot be so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We need not leave our common sense at the doorstep when we interpret a statute. It is difficult for us to imagine that, in the simple words "because of," Congress meant to obligate, a plaintiff to identify the precise causal role played by legitimate and illegitimate motivations in the employment decision she challenges. We conclude, instead, that Congress meant to obligate her to prove that the employer relied upon sex-based considerations in coming to its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our interpretation of the words "because of" also is supported by the fact that Title VII does identify one circumstance in which an employer may take gender into account in making an employment decision, namely, when gender is a "<span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification [(BFOQ)] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of th[e] particular business or enterprise." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(e). The only plausible inference to draw from this provision is that, in all other circumstances, a person's gender may not be considered in making decisions that affect her. Indeed, Title VII even forbids employers to make gender an indirect stumbling block to employment opportunities. An employer may not, we have held, condition employment opportunities on the satisfaction of facially neutral tests or qualifications that have a disproportionate, adverse impact on members of protected groups when those tests or qualifications are not required for performance of the job. <span class="Italic">See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed.2d 827 (1988); <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To say that an employer may not take gender into account is not, however, the end of the matter, for that describes only one aspect of Title VII. The other important aspect of the statute is its preservation of an employer's remaining freedom of choice. We conclude that the preservation of this <span id="Page_753"></span>freedom means that an employer shall not be liable if it can prove that, even if it had not taken gender into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding a particular person. The statute's maintenance of employer prerogatives is evident from the statute itself and from its history, both in Congress and in this Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin with, the existence of the BFOQ exception shows Congress, unwillingness to require employers to change the very nature of their operations in response to the statute. And our emphasis on "business necessity" in disparate-impact cases, <span class="Italic">see Watson</span> and <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>, and on "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason(s)" in disparate-treatment cases, <span class="Italic">see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973); <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981), results from our awareness of Title VII's balance between employee rights and employer prerogatives. In <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, we described as follows Title VII's goal to eradicate discrimination while preserving workplace efficiency: "The broad, overriding interest, shared by employer, employee, and consumer, is efficient and trustworthy workmanship assured through fair and racially neutral employment and personnel decisions. In the implementation of such decisions, it is abundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no racial discrimination, subtle or, otherwise." 411 U.S., at 801, 93 S. Ct., at 1823-1824. When an employer ignored the attributes enumerated in the statute, Congress hoped, it naturally would focus on the qualifications of the applicant or employee. The intent to drive employers to focus on qualifications rather than on race, religion, sex, or national origin is the theme of a good deal of the statute's legislative history. An interpretive memorandum entered into the Congressional Record by Senators Case and Clark, comanagers of the bill in the Senate, is representative of this general theme. According to their memorandum, Title VII "'expressly protects the employer's right to insist that any prospective applicant, Negro or white, must meet the applicable job qualifications. Indeed, the very purpose of Title VII is to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis of race or color.'" 110 Cong. Rec. 7247 (1964). quoted in <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra</span>, 401 U.S., at 434, 91 S. Ct., at 855. The memorandum went on: "To discriminate is to make a distinction, to make a difference in treatment or favor, and those distinctions or differences in treatment or favor which prohibited by section 704 are those which are based on any five of the forbidden criteria: race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Any other criterion or qualification for employment is not affected by this title." 110 Cong. Rec. 7213 (1964).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Many other legislators made statements to a similar effect; we see no need to set out each remark in full here. The central point is this: while an employer may not take gender into account in making an employment decision (except in those very narrow circumstances in which gender is a BFOQ), it is free to decide against a woman for other reasons. We think these principles require that, once a plaintiff in a Title VII case shows that gender played a motivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving that it would have made the same decision even if it had not allowed gender to play such a role. This balance of burdens is the direct result of Title VII's balance of rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our holding casts no shadow on <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, in which we decided, that, even after a plaintiff has made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under Title VII, the burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that its stated legitimate reason for the employment decision was the true reason. 450 U.S., at 256-258, 101 S. Ct., at 1095-1096. We stress, first, that neither court below shifted the burden of persuasion to Price Waterhouse on this question, and in fact, the District Court found that Hopkins had not shown that the firm's stated reason for its decision was pretextual. 618 F. Supp., at 1114-1115. Moreover, since we hold that the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion on the issue whether gender played a part in the employment decision, the situation before us is not the one of "shifting burdens" that we addressed in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>. Instead, the employer's burden is most appropriately deemed an affirmative defense: the plaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point, and then the employer, if it wishes to prevail, must persuade it on another. <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp.</span>, 462 U.S. 393, 400, 103 S. Ct. 2469, 2473, 76 L. Ed.2d 667 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Price Waterhouse's claim that the employer does not bear any burden of proof (if it bears one at all) until the plaintiff has shown "substantial evidence that Price Waterhouse's explanation for failing to promote Hopkins was not the true reason, for its action" (Brief for Petitioner 20) merely restates its argument that the plaintiff in a mixed-motives case must squeeze her proof into <span class="Italic">Burdine's</span> framework. Where a decision was the product of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives, however, it simply makes no sense to ask whether the legitimate reason was "the 'true reason'" (Brief for Petitioner 20 (emphasis added)) for the decision--which is the question asked by <span class="Italic">Burdine.</span> <span class="Italic">See Transportation Management, supra</span>, at 400, n.5, 103 S. Ct., at 2473, n.5. Oblivious to this last point, the dissent would insist that <span class="Italic">Burdine's</span> framework perform work that it was never intended to perform. It would require a plaintiff who challenges an adverse employment decision in which both legitimate and illegitimate considerations played a part to pretend that the decision, in fact, stemmed from a single source--for the premise of <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> is that either a legitimate or an illegitimate set of considerations led to the challenged decision. To say that <span class="Italic">Burdine's</span> evidentiary scheme will not help us decide a case admittedly involving both kinds of considerations is not to cast aspersions on the utility of that scheme in the circumstances for which it was designed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Later in his opinion,<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 1791, Justice Blackmun noted the distinction between an employer who would have been justified in making the same decision and an employer who actually was motivated, in part, by legitimate reasons at the time of the decision. The Court then adopted the preponderance of the evidence standard to apply in mixed motive cases. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1792.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although Justice Blackmun wrote the plurality opinion in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, it is Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion that is most often cited in the discussion of mixed-motive cases. Justice O'Connor disputed the plurality's assertion that the words "because of" in Title VII did not create a "but-for" standard. Rather, Justice O'Connor focused on the unfairness of requiring the Title VII plaintiff, who has already proved that discrimination was a factor in the employer's decision, to further prove that discrimination was the "but-for" cause of the employer's decision. Relying upon the traditional civil burdens of proof in tort cases, Justice O'Connor believed that burden fell more properly on the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent">In her <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> concurrence, 109 S. Ct. at 1796-99, Justice O'Connor wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I agree with the plurality that, on the facts presented in this case, the burden of persuasion should shift to the employer to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision concerning Ann Hopkins' candidacy absent consideration of her gender. I further agree that this burden shift is properly part of the liability phase of the litigation. I thus concur in the judgment of the Court. My disagreement stems from the plurality's conclusions concerning the substantive requirement of causation under the statute and its broad statements regarding the applicability of the allocation of the burden of proof applied in this case. The evidentiary rule the Court adopts today should be viewed as a supplement to the careful framework established by our unanimous decisions in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981), for use in cases such as this one where the employer has created uncertainty as to causation by knowingly giving substantial weight to an impermissible criterion. I write separately to explain why I believe such a departure from the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> standard is justified in the circumstances presented by this and like cases, and to express my views as to when and how the strong medicine of requiring the employer to bear the burden of persuasion on the issue of causation should be administered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII provides in pertinent part: "It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer. . .to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin., 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a) (emphasis added). The legislative history of Title VII bears out what its plain language suggests: a substantive violation of the statute only occurs when consideration of an illegitimate criterion is the "but-for" cause of an adverse employment action. The legislative history makes it clear that Congress was attempting to eradicate discriminatory actions in the employment setting, not mere discriminatory thoughts. Critics of the bill that became Title VII labeled it a "thought control bill," and argued that it created a "punishable crime that does not require an illegal external act as a basis for judgment." 100 Cong. Rec. 7254 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Ervin). Senator Case, whose views the plurality finds so persuasive elsewhere, responded:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"The man must do or fail to do something in regard to employment. There must be some specific external act, more than a mental act. Only if he does the act because of the grounds stated in the bill would there be any legal consequences." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, I disagree with the plurality's <span class="Italic">dictum</span> that the words "because of" do not mean "but-for" causation; manifestly they do. <span class="Italic">See Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC</span>, 478 U.S. 421, 499, 106 S. Ct. 3019, 3062, 92 L. Ed.2d 344 (1986) (WHITE, J., dissenting) ("[T]he general policy under Title VII is to limit relief for racial discrimination in employment practices to actual victims of the discrimination"). We should not, and need not, deviate from that policy today. The question for decision in this case is what allocation of the burden of persuasion on the issue of causation best conforms with the intent of Congress and the purposes behind Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence of congressional intent as to which party should bear the burden of proof on the issue of causation is considerably less clear. No doubt, as a general matter, Congress assumed that the plaintiff in a Title VII action would bear the burden of proof on the elements critical to his or her case. As the dissent points out, <span class="Italic">post</span>, at 1809, n.3, the interpretative <span id="Page_754"></span>memorandum submitted by sponsors of Title VII indicates that "the plaintiff, as in any civil case, would have the burden of proving that discrimination had occurred." 110 Cong. Rec. 7214 (1964) (emphasis added). But in the area of tort liability, from whence the dissent's "but-for" standard of causation is derived, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 1807, the law has long recognized that in certain "civil cases" leaving the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff to prove "but-for" causation would be both unfair and destructive of the deterrent purposes embodied in the concept of duty of care. Thus, in multiple causation cases, where a breach of duty has been established, the common law of torts has long shifted the burden of proof to multiple defendants to prove that their negligent actions were not the "but-for" cause of the plaintiff's injury. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Summers v. Tice</span>, 33 Cal.2d 80, 84-87, 199 P.2d 1, 3-4 (1948). The same rule has been applied where the effect of a defendant's tortious conduct combines with a force of unknown or innocent origin to produce the harm to the plaintiff. <span class="Italic">See Kingston v. Chicago &#x0026; N.W.R. Co.</span>, 191 Wis. 610, 616, 211 N.W. 913, 915 (1927) ("Granting that the union of that fire [caused by defendant's negligence] with another of natural origin, or with another of much greater proportions, is available as a defense, the burden is on the defendant to show that. . .the fire set by him was not the proximate cause of the damage")<span class="Italic">. See also</span> 2 J. Wigmore, Select Cases on the Law of Torts &#x00A7; 153, p. 865 (1912) ("When two or more persons by their acts are possibly the sole cause of a harm, or when two or more acts of the same person are possibly the sole cause, and the plaintiff has introduced evidence that one of the two persons, or one of the same person's two acts, is culpable, then the defendant has the burden of proving that the other person, or his other act, was the sole cause of the harm").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While requiring that the plaintiff in a tort suit or a Title VII action prove that the defendant's "breach of duty" was the "but-for" cause of an injury does not generally hamper effective enforcement of the policies behind those causes of action, "at other times the [but-for] test demands the impossible. It challenges the imaGINAtion of the trier to probe into a purely fanciful and unknowable state of affairs. He is invited to make an estimate concerning facts that concededly never existed. The very uncertainty as to what might have happened opens the door wide for conjecture. But when conjecture is demanded it can be given a direction that is consistent with the policy considerations that underlie the controversy." Malone, <span class="Italic">Ruminations on Cause-in-fact</span>, 9 Stan. L.Rev. 60, 67 (1956).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the common law of torts, the statutory employment "tort" created by Title VII has two basic purposes. The first is to deter conduct which has been identified as contrary to public policy and harmful to society as a whole. As we have noted in the past, the award of backpay to a Title VII plaintiff provides "the spur or catalyst which causes employers and unions to self-examine and to self-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges" of discrimination in employment. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 417-418, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 2371-2372, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975) (citation omitted). The second goal of Title VII is "to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 418, 95 S. Ct., at 2372. Both these goals are reflected in the elements of a disparate treatment action. There is no doubt that Congress considered reliance on gender or race in making employment decisions an evil in itself. As Senator Clark put it, "[t]he bill simply eliminates consideration of color [or other forbidden criteria] from the decision to hire or promote." 110 Cong. Rec. 7218 (1964). <span class="Italic">See also id.</span>, at 13088 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey) ("What the bill does is simply to make it an illegal practice to use race as factor in denying employment"). Reliance on such factors is exactly what the threat of Title VII liability was meant to deter. While the main concern of the statute was with employment opportunity, Congress was certainly not blind to the stigmatic harm which comes from being evaluated by a process which treats one as an inferior by reason of one's race or sex. This Court's decisions under the Equal Protection Clause have long recognized that whatever the final outcome of a decisional process, the inclusion of race or sex as a consideration within it harms both society and the individual<span class="Italic">. See Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.</span>, 488 U.S. 469, 109 S. Ct. 706, 102 L. Ed.2d 854 (1989). At the same time, Congress clearly conditioned legal liability on a determination that the consideration of an illegitimate factor caused a tangible employment injury of some kind.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an individual disparate treatment plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in an adverse employment decision, the deterrent purpose of the statute has clearly been triggered. More importantly, as an evidentiary matter, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that absent further explanation, the employer's discriminatory motivation "caused" the employment decision. The employer has not yet been shown to be a violator, but neither is it entitled to the same presumption of good faith concerning its employment decisions which is accorded employers facing only circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Both the policies behind the statute, and the evidentiary principles developed in the analogous area of causation in the law of torts, suggest that at this point the employer may be required to convince the factfinder that, despite the smoke, there is no fire.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have given recognition to these principles in our cases which have discussed the "remedial phase" of class action disparate treatment cases. Once the class has established that discrimination against a protected group was essentially the employer's "standard practice," there has been harm to the group and injunctive relief is appropriate. But as to the individual members of the class, the liability phase of the litigation is not complete. <span class="Italic">See Dillon v. Coles</span>, 746 F.2d 998, 1004 (CA3 1984) ("It is misleading to speak of the additional proof required by an individual class member for relief as being a part of the damage phase, that evidence is actually an element of the liability portion of the case") (footnote omitted). Because the class has already demonstrated that, as a rule, illegitimate factors were considered in the employer's decisions, the burden shifts to the employer "to demonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment opportunity for legitimate reasons." <span class="Italic">Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 362, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 1868, 52 L. Ed.2d 396 (1977). <span class="Italic">See also Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.</span>, 424 U.S. 747, 772, 96 S. Ct. 1251, 1268, 47 L. Ed.2d 444 (1976).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The individual members of a class action disparate treatment case stand in much the same position as Ann Hopkins here. There has been a strong showing that the employer has done exactly what Title VII forbids, but the connection between the employer's illegitimate motivation and any injury to the individual plaintiff is unclear. At this point calling upon the employer to show that despite consideration of illegitimate factors the individual plaintiff would not have been hired or promoted in any event hardly seems "unfair" or contrary to the substantive command of the statute. In fact, an individual plaintiff who has shown that an illegitimate factor played a substantial role in the decision in his or her case has proved more than the class member in a <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span> type action. The latter receives the benefit of a burden shift to the defendant based on the likelihood that an illegitimate criterion was a factor in the individual employment decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice O'Connor then focused her opinion on the distinctions between the traditional <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> case, involving circumstantial evidence, and the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> case, involving direct evidence of discriminatory intent. Specifically, Justice O'Connor explained why, in a circumstantial evidence case, the burden that shifts to the employer is only the burden of production, but, in a direct evidence case, the burden that shifts to the employer is the burden of persuasion. Arguing that the plurality opinion of Justice Blackmun read any causation requirement out the Statute, Justice O'Connor, in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 1801-06, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> itself dealt with a situation where the plaintiff presented no direct evidence that the employer had relied on a forbidden factor under Title VII in making an employment decision. The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case established there was not difficult to prove, and was based only on the statistical probability that when a number of potential causes for an employment decision are eliminated an inference arises that an illegitimate factor was in fact the motivation behind the decision. <span class="Italic">See Teamsters</span>, 431 U.S., at 358, n.44, 97 S. Ct., at 1866, n.44. ("[T]he <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> formula does not require direct proof of discrimination"). In the face of this inferential proof, the employer's burden was deemed to be only one of production; the employer must articulate a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1978). The plaintiff must then be given an "opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision." <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S., at 805, 93 S. Ct., at 1826. Our decision in <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981), also involved the "narrow question" whether, after a plaintiff had carried the "not onerous" burden of establishing the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, the burden of persuasion should be shifted to the employer to prove that a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action existed. 450 U.S., at 250, 101 S. Ct., at 1092. As the discussion of <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span> and <span class="Italic">Arlington Heights</span> indicates, I do not think that the employer is entitled to the same presumption of good faith where there is direct evidence that it has placed substantial reliance on factors whose consideration is forbidden by Title VII. The only individual disparate treatment case cited by the dissent which involved the kind of direct evidence of discriminatory animus with which we are confronted here is <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 713-714, n.2, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 1481, n.2, 75 L. Ed.2d 403 (1983). The question presented to the Court in that case involved only a challenge to the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> Pet. for Cert. in <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, O.T.1981, No. 81-1044, and the question we confront today was neither briefed nor argued to the Court. As should be apparent, the entire purpose of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is to compensate for the fact that direct evidence of intentional discrimination is hard to come by. That the employer's burden in rebutting such an inferential case of <span id="Page_755"></span>discrimination is only one of production does not mean that the scales should be weighted in the same manner where there is direct evidence of intentional discrimination. Indeed, in one Age Discrimination in Employment Act case, the Court seemed to indicate that "the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston</span>, 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S. Ct. 613, 621-622, 83 L. Ed.2d 523 (1985). <span class="Italic">See also East Texas Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez</span>, 431 U.S. 395, 403-404, n.9, 97 S. Ct. 1891, 1897, n.9, 52 L. Ed.2d 453 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the facts of this case, and a growing number like it decided by the Courts of Appeals, convince me that the evidentiary standard I propose is necessary to make real the promise of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> that "[i]n the implementation of [employment] decisions, it is abundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no. . .discrimination, subtle or otherwise." 411 U.S., at 801, 93 S. Ct., at 1823-1824. In this case, the District Court found that a number of the evaluations of Ann Hopkins submitted by partners in the firm overtly referred to her failure to conform to certain gender stereotypes as a factor militating against her election to the partnership. 618 F. Supp. 1109, 1116-1117 (DC 1985). The District Court further found that these evaluations were given "great weight" by the decisionmakers at Price Waterhouse. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1118. In addition, the District Court found that the partner responsible for informing Hopkins of the factors which caused her candidacy to be placed on hold, indicated that her "professional" problems would be solved if she would "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 1117 (footnote omitted). As the Court of Appeals characterized it, Ann Hopkins proved that Price Waterhouse "permitt[ed] stereotypical attitudes towards women to play a significant, though unquantifiable, role in its decision not to invite her to become a partner." 263 U.S. App. D.C., at 324, 825 F.2d, at 461.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At this point Ann Hopkins had taken her proof as far as it could go. She had proved discriminatory input into the decisional process, and had proved that participants in the process considered her failure to conform to the stereotypes credited by a number of the decisionmakers had been a substantial factor in the decision. It is as if Ann Hopkins were sitting in the hall outside the room where partnership decisions were being made. As the partners filed in to consider her candidacy, she heard several of them make sexist remarks in discussing her suitability for partnership. As the decisionmakers exited the room, she was told by one of those privy to the decisionmaking process that her gender was a major reason for the rejection of her partnership bid. If, as we noted in <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span>, "[p]resumptions shifting the burden of proof are often created to reflect judicial evaluations of probabilities and to conform with a party's superior access to the proof," 431 U.S., at 359, n.45, 97 S. Ct., at 1867, n.45, one would be hard pressed to think of a situation where it would be more appropriate to require the defendant to show that its decision would have been justified by wholly legitimate concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, there is mounting evidence in the decisions of the lower courts that respondent here is not alone in her inability to pinpoint discrimination as the precise cause of her injury, despite having shown that it played a significant role in the decisional process. Many of these courts, which deal with the evidentiary issues in Title VII cases on a regular basis, have concluded that placing the risk of nonpersuasion on the defendant in a situation where uncertainty as to causation has been created by its consideration of an illegitimate criterion makes sense as a rule of evidence and furthers the substantive command of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bell v. Birmingham Linen Service</span>, 715 F.2d 1552, 1556 (CA11 1983) (Tjoflat, J.) ("It would be illogical, indeed ironic, to hold a Title VII plaintiff presenting direct evidence of a defendant's intent to discriminate to a more stringent burden of proof, or to allow a defendant to meet that direct proof by merely articulating, but not proving, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its action"). Particularly in the context of the professional world, where decisions are often made by collegial bodies on the basis of largely subjective criteria, requiring the plaintiff to prove that any one factor was the definitive cause of the decisionmakers' action may be tantamount to declaring Title VII inapplicable to such decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fields v. Clark University</span>, 817 F.2d 931, 935-937 (CA1 1987) (where plaintiff produced "strong evidence" that sexist attitudes infected faculty tenure decision, burden properly shifted to defendant to show that it would have reached the same decision absent discrimination); <span class="Italic">Thompkins v. Morris Brown College</span>, 752 F.2d 558, 563 (CA11 1985) (direct evidence of discriminatory animus in decision to discharge college professor shifted burden of persuasion to defendant). Finally, I am convinced that a rule shifting the burden to the defendant where the plaintiff has shown that an illegitimate criterion was a "substantial factor" in the employment decision will not conflict with other congressional policies embodied in Title VII. Title VII expressly provides that an employer need not give preferential treatment to employees or applicants of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in order to maintain a work force in balance with the general population. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(j). The interpretive memorandum, whose authoritative force is noted by the plurality, <span class="Italic">see ante</span>, at 1787, n.8, specifically provides: "There is no requirement in title VII that an employer maintain a racial balance in his work force. On the contrary, any deliberate attempt to maintain a racial balance, whatever such a balance may be, would involve a violation of title VII because maintaining such a balance would require an employer to hire or refuse to hire on the basis of race." 110 Cong. Rec. 7213 (1964). Last Term, in <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed.2d 827 (1988), the Court unanimously concluded that the disparate impact analysis first enunciated in <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971), should be extended to subjective or discretionary selection processes. At the same time a plurality of the Court indicated concern that the focus on bare statistics in the disparate impact setting could force employers to adopt "inappropriate prophylactic measures" in violation of &#x00A7; 2000e-2(j). The plurality went on to emphasize that in a disparate impact case, the plaintiff may not simply point to a statistical disparity in the employer's work force. Instead, the plaintiff must identify a particular employment practice and "must offer statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions because of their membership in a protected group." 487 U.S., at 994, 108 S. Ct., at 2789. The plurality indicated that "the ultimate burden of proving that discrimination against a protected group has been caused by a specific employment practice remains with the plaintiff at all times."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 997, 108 S. Ct., at 2790.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I believe there are significant differences between shifting the burden of persuasion to the employer in a case resting purely on statistical proof as in the disparate impact setting and shifting the burden of persuasion in a case like this one, where an employee has demonstrated by direct evidence that an illegitimate factor played a substantial role in a particular employment decision. First, the explicit consideration of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in making employment decisions "was the most obvious evil Congress had in mind when it enacted Title VII." <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span>, 431 U.S., at 335, n.15, 97 S. Ct., at 1854-1855, n.15. While the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and the statistical showing of imbalance involved in a disparate impact case may both be indicators of discrimination or its "functional equivalent," they are not, in and of themselves, the evils Congress sought to eradicate from the employment setting. Second, shifting the burden of persuasion to the employer in a situation like this one creates no incentive to preferential treatment in violation of &#x00A7; 2000e-2(j). To avoid bearing the burden of justifying its decision, the employer need not seek racial or sexual balance in its work force; rather, all it need do is avoid substantial reliance on forbidden criteria in making its employment decisions. While the danger of forcing employers to engage in unwarranted preferential treatment is thus less dramatic in this setting than in the situation the Court faced in <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, it is far from wholly illusory. Based on its misreading of the words "because of" in the statute, <span class="Italic">see ante</span>, at 1785-1787, the plurality appears to conclude that if a decisional process is "tainted" by awareness of sex or race in any way, the employer has violated the statute, and Title VII thus commands that the burden shift to the employer to justify its decision. <span class="Italic">Ante</span>, at 1791-1792. The plurality thus effectively reads the causation requirement out of the statute, and then replaces it with an "affirmative defense." <span class="Italic">Ante</span>, at 1788-1789. In my view, in order to justify shifting the burden on the issue of causation to the defendant, a disparate treatment plaintiff must show by direct evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the decision. As the Court of Appeals noted below: "While most circuits have not confronted the question squarely, the consensus among those that have is that once a Title VII plaintiff has demonstrated by direct evidence that discriminatory animus played a significant or substantial role in the employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer to show that the decision would have been the same absent discrimination." 263 U.S. App. D.C., at 333-334, 825 F.2d, at 470-471. Requiring that the plaintiff demonstrate that an illegitimate factor played a substantial role in the employment decision identifies those employment situations where the deterrent purpose of Title VII is most clearly implicated. As an evidentiary matter, where a plaintiff has made this type of strong showing of illicit motivation, the factfinder is entitled to presume that the employer's discriminatory animus made a difference to the outcome, absent proof to the contrary from the employer. Where a disparate treatment plaintiff has made such a showing, the burden then rests with the employer to convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than not that the decision would have been the same absent consideration of the illegitimate factor. The employer need not isolate the sole cause for the decision; rather it must demonstrate that with the illegitimate factor removed from the calculus, sufficient business reasons would have induced it to take the same employment action. This evidentiary scheme essentially requires the employer to place the employee in the same position he or she would have occupied absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 286, 97 S. Ct. 568, 575, 50 L. Ed.2d 471 (1977). If the employer fails to carry this burden, the factfinder is justified in concluding that the decision <span id="Page_756"></span>was made "because of" consideration of the illegitimate factor and the substantive standard for liability under the statute is satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, stray remarks in the workplace, while perhaps probative of sexual harassment, <span class="Italic">see Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 63-69, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404-2407, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986), cannot justify requiring the employer to prove that its hiring or promotion decisions were based on legitimate criteria. Nor can statements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself, suffice to satisfy the plaintiff's burden in this regard. In addition, in my view testimony such as Dr. Fiske's in this case, standing alone, would not justify shifting the burden of persuasion to the employer. Race and gender always "play a role" in an employment decision in the benign sense that these are human characteristics of which decisionmakers are aware and about which they may comment in a perfectly neutral and nondiscriminatory fashion. For example, in the context of this case, a mere reference to "a lady candidate" might show that gender "played a role" in the decision, but by no means could support a rational factfinder's inference that the decision was made "because of" sex. What is required is what Ann Hopkins showed here: direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It should be obvious that the threshold standard I would adopt for shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant differs substantially from that proposed by the plurality, the plurality's suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding. <span class="Italic">See ante</span>, at 1790, n.13. The plurality proceeds from the premise that the words "because of" in the statute do not embody any causal requirement at all. Under my approach, the plaintiff must produce evidence sufficient to show that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the particular employment decision such that a reasonable factfinder could draw an inference that the decision was made "because of" the plaintiff's protected status. Only then would the burden of proof shift to the defendant to prove that the decision would have been justified by other, wholly legitimate considerations. <span class="Italic">See also ante</span>, at 1795 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, because of the concerns outlined above, and because I believe that the deterrent purpose of Title VII is disserved by a rule which places the burden of proof on plaintiffs on the issue of causation in all circumstances, I would retain but supplement the framework we established in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and subsequent cases. The structure of the presentation of evidence in an individual disparate treatment case should conform to the general outlines we established in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>. First, the plaintiff must establish the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing membership in a protected group, qualification for the job, rejection for the position, and that after rejection the employer continued to seek applicants of complainant's general qualifications. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S., at 802, 93 S. Ct., at 1824. The plaintiff should also present any direct evidence of discriminatory animus in the decisional process. The defendant should then present its case, including its evidence as to legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment decision. As the dissent notes, under this framework, the employer "has every incentive to convince the trier of fact that the decision was lawful." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 1813, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S., at 258, 101 S. Ct., at 1096. Once all the evidence has been received, the court should determine whether the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> or <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> framework properly applies to the evidence before it. If the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> threshold, the case should be decided under the principles enunciated in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, with the plaintiff bearing the burden of persuasion on the ultimate issue whether the employment action was taken because of discrimination. In my view, such a system is both fair and workable, and it calibrates the evidentiary requirements demanded of the parties to the goals behind the statute itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I agree with the dissent, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 1813, n.4, that the evidentiary framework I propose should be available to all disparate treatment plaintiffs where an illegitimate consideration played a substantial role in an adverse employment decision. The Court's allocation of the burden of proof in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County</span>, 480 U.S. 616, 626-627, 107 S. Ct. 1442, 1449, 94 L. Ed.2d 615 (1987), rested squarely on "the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 626, 107 S. Ct., at 1449, which we alter today. It would be odd to say the least if the evidentiary rules applicable to Title VII actions were themselves dependent on the gender or the skin color of the litigants. <span class="Italic">But see ante</span>, at 1809, n.3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, I agree with the plurality that petitioner should be called upon to show that the outcome would have been the same if respondent's professional merit had been its only concern. On remand, the District Court should determine whether Price Waterhouse has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that if gender had not been part of the process, its employment decision concerning Ann Hopkins would nonetheless have been the same.</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the lack of a clear majority rationale, it is not surprising that <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> perhaps caused as much confusion as it cleared up.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission adopted the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> analysis in <span class="Italic">Manuel v. Attorney General</span>, 01901521 (1990). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Manuel</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[U]nder the Supreme Court's clear guidance in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. ___, 109 S. Ct. 1775 (1989), this [a finding that discrimination played a "substantial or motivating role"] does not end the inquiry regarding the agency's liability in a "mixed motive" case such as this one. Under <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, when discrimination is proven to have played a significant role in the adverse employment decision, the burden that shifts to the employer is the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the appellant's gender into account. <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 1795. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Manuel</span>, the agency sustained its burden by demonstrating that the complainant could not get along with coworkers and supervisors who were not alleged discriminating officials and that even the supervisors who were not RMOs complained about working with her. "This shifting burden of proof is said to be justified because the employer has been shown to be a wrongdoer, acting out of a motive that is declared illegitimate by Congress, and creating a risk that legal and illegal motives cannot be separated." <span class="Italic">Schoonover v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912338 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the lack of a clear, agreed upon rationale, <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> did resolve the basic question of what burden of proof applies to an employer in a direct evidence or mixed motive case. It was less than clear, however, whether <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> applied where the employer was asserting, for some later-discovered reason, that the plaintiff was not entitled to a remedy because it could have taken the same action even in the absence of discrimination. That question ultimately would be resolved by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Company</span>, 513 U.S. 352, 115 S. Ct. 879, 130 L. Ed.2d 852 (1995), involving the so-called "after-acquired" evidence doctrine. See below.</p>
