<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-138"><span class="space">g.</span> $30,001-$35,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720060050 (2010), the Commission reduced an award of $60,000 by an administrative judge to $32,000 where the complainant's security was suspended--a matter over which the Commission does not have jurisdiction. The Commission does, however, have jurisdiction over security clearance reviews that are initiated on a discriminatory basis. In addition to noting some of the complainant's conditions were preexisting, it appears that the EEOC reduced the award because the administrative judge may have based the award, in part, on the actual suspension of the clearance as opposed to the discriminatory initiation of the clearance review.</p>
<p class="noindent">Citing both a preexisting condition and the intervening factor that the complainant's return to work and not the oriGINAl discrimination exacerbated his condition, the Commission awarded $32,500 in damages in <span class="Italic">Kannikal v. Attorney General</span>, 04A00017 (2001). In doing so, the Commission also observed that in cases where it has awarded $40,000 or more in damages "the evidence of record tended to show that the emotional or psychological injuries which resulted from the agency's actions either had permanent or substantially long-term effects, or were so catastrophic that no inquiry into long-term effects was necessary." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In addition, the Commission discounted the complainant's contention that he so desperately needed money that he participated in medical experiments and, as a result, permanently lost feeling in his foot. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Kannikal</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with petitioner's demand of $200,000. In cases where the Commission awarded nonpecuniary damages of $40,000 and above, the evidence of record tended to show that the emotional or psychological injuries which resulted from the agency's actions either had permanent or substantially-long term effects, or were so catastrophic that no inquiry into long-term effects was necessary<span class="Italic">. See Mack v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (June 23, 2000) ($186,000 awarded where individual was left homeless for two years as a result of discriminatory termination); <span class="Italic">Cook v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950027 (July 17, 1998) ($130,000 awarded where 14-months of hostile work environment caused individual to develop atypical paranoid disorder, leaving her unable to work); <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (October 14, 1998) ($125,000 awarded where agency's discriminatory conduct caused individual to develop severe digestive problems as well as psychological injury); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951729 <span id="Page_1859"></span>(July 29, 1998) ($100,000 awarded where subjection of aggrieved individual to hostile work environment caused her to develop severe psychological injury, from which she was still suffering at the hearing); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997) ($100,000 awarded where, as a result of ongoing sexual harassment, individual sustained severe psychological injury that affected her for four years and was likely to affect her for the foreseeable future); and <span class="Italic">Turner v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956390 (April 27, 1998) ($40,000 awarded where discriminatory harassment, particularly forcing her to carry a 45-pound back pack, caused her to experience psychological trauma and physical injury with permanent effects).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, petitioner stated in his affidavit that the agency's refusal to reinstate him took a debilitating toll on his mental and physical health throughout the first ten months of 1993. Petitioner's psychiatrist stated that he treated petitioner over a five-year period, from May 1993 through August 1998, and that he last examined petitioner on August 21, 1998. He stated that, throughout that period, he prescribed paxil and buspar, and had given petitioner ongoing psychotherapy in order to combat petitioner's anxiety and depression. In addition, he indicated that, although petitioner's condition stabilized by August of 1998, he would still need medical treatment. He did not, however, specify what type of treatment he would need or how long he would need it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, it appears that, by the end of 1993, petitioner had recovered to the point at which his symptoms were manageable. Documents submitted by petitioner himself indicate that, between 1994 and his reinstatement in 1998, petitioner completed his medical education, attained his license to practice medicine, and served successfully in two internships and one residency. Petitioner presented letters of reference from his internship and residency supervisors, all of which attested to his excellent performance. These documents indicate that, unlike the cases in which nonpecuniary damages above $40,000 were awarded, petitioner's psychological and emotional injuries were not so catastrophic or long-lasting as to leave him totally incapacitated, either for work or in his personal life.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the exacerbation of petitioner's pre-existing physical condition, namely diabetes, which aggravated his symptoms. In several cases in which the harm suffered by the individual as a result of the agency's exacerbation of a pre-existing condition was severe, but of limited duration, the Commission awarded $25,000 in nonpecuniary damages<span class="Italic">. See Hogeland v. Department of Agriculture,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Defense,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>; and <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span> EEOC Request No. 05970336 (November 20, 1997). In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the effects that the petitioner experienced as a result of being sexually harassed did not last beyond the point at which the harassment ended. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hogeland</span>, the petitioner was able to manage her symptoms without medical intervention after going through extensive treatment. The record in this case indicates that petitioner experienced his worst suffering in 1993, and thereafter, recovered sufficiently to function well in his medical studies and training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the situations in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> and <span class="Italic">Hogeland</span>, there are indications in the record that petitioner's symptoms were of more than limited duration. While there is little specific information in any of the affidavits on whether or to what extent petitioner experienced the symptoms of depression and anxiety after 1993, petitioner's psychiatrist stated that he would still need medical treatment even after 1998. In addition, petitioner's wife stated that petitioner did not have a normal relationship with his children for almost six years. On the other hand, there are several intervening factors present in this case that were not present in any of the large-award cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner stated that, as a result of being unemployed during 1993, he participated in a series of medical experiments in order to earn extra money. In one of the experiments, he underwent neural surgery which resulted in total and permanent loss of feeling in his left foot. He stated that he felt like a "humiliated guinea pig," as a result, and that he experienced feelings of regret and remorse because he no longer has normal feeling in both feet. Petitioner appears to be arguing that these injuries are also causally connected with the discriminatory denial of his reinstatement. The record does not support his argument. The statements of his witnesses corroborate that he participated in the experiment, and was injured as a result, but that is all. Those statements do not tie his participation in the experiment to the denial of his reinstatement request. While petitioner may have needed money while he was unemployed, he was not compelled to participate in the experiment. The choice to do so was his, and his alone. <span class="Italic">See Hogeland v. Department of Agriculture</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (record did not establish that withdrawal of accommodation and low performance appraisal resulted in the petitioner's decision to undergo a hysterectomy).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another intervening factor is what occurred after petitioner was reinstated in January 1998. Almost immediately after his reinstatement, there had been conflict between himself and the clinical director concerning his performance. <span class="Italic">Infra.</span> Settlement Agreement dated June 2, 1999. To the extent that petitioner continued to experience job-related depression and anxiety after January 1998, there is no doubt that this was attributable to the work situation following his reinstatement, not to the 1992 denial of reinstatement at issue in this complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In consideration of the foregoing, we award petitioner $32,500 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages. Our determination of this amount takes into consideration the exacerbation of petitioner's diabetes, the severe emotional and psychological reactions he experienced throughout 1993, and the fact that after 1993, his symptoms were manageable with medication and treatment. Consequently, we will order the agency to issue petitioner a check for nonpecuniary compensatory damages in the amount of $32,500.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency's nonselection resulted in destruction of the complainant's self--confidence and pride, as well as more than a year and a half of deep depression, the Commission upheld a damages award of $32,500. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A60017.txt">07A60017</a> (2006), held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, considering the nature of the discriminatory actions and the nature of the harm to complainant, we find the award of $32,500.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages was appropriate. The AJ noted that complainant suffered significant emotional distress as a result of the agency's action. The AJ considered complainant's testimony and that of her husband who both stated that prior to the discrimination complainant's work was her life and that she was described as self-confident and proud of her position. After February 2004, when she learned she was not selected, complainant felt betrayed, angry, and lost all pleasure and sense of motivation in her job. The AJ found the evidence showed that complainant sank into and continued to suffer from a deep depression for the past year and a half. Complainant testified that she was miserable, lost her ability to concentrate, and essentially had no interest in anything but sleeping. Although complainant acknowledged that in December 2004, some ten months after the non-selection, she was diagnosed with recurring/remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the AJ did not find that complainant's depression, stress and emotional suffering were attributable to her MS. Rather, the AJ found that the agency's actions resulted in complainant suffering intense mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, humiliation, injury to reputation, loss of self-esteem, a pronounced lack of energy, and damage to familial relationships. The AJ found that the effects will continue to linger for a long period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $32,500 by its administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720120023 (2013), where the agency retaliated against the complainant by not selecting him for a permanent housekeeping aid position and subjected him to a hostile environment. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the hearing, complainant testified that there was a significant change in the way his supervisor treated him after he filed the first EEO complaint in November 2007. Complainant testified that after he proved that the November 9, 2007 termination was issued erroneously, and he filed an EEO Counselor alleging race discrimination, that his supervisor began to "track him down" and berated and belittled him and that all of the factors contributed to an uncomfortable work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further testified that he was very appreciative of his job as a housekeeping aid. Other than his absences, there is nothing in the record to indicate that he did not perform his job well. Complainant testified that he performed his job diligently in hopes of being hired into a permanent position. As a result of his inability to secure a permanent position, Complainant testified at the hearing that he lost his sole source of income and that he has been reliant on friends and family for financial support during his unemployment. Complainant further testified that he has had to seek public assistance to support himself and that the negative reference provided by his supervisor has destroyed his ability to apply for and be offered a position at any Agency facility. Complainant also testified that the uncomfortable environment remained when he visited the facility for treatment after his termination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cornell v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01995329 (2002), the Commission awarded $33,000 in damages where a nonpromotion and denial of monetary performance award led to long-term depression. In <span class="Italic">Cornell</span>, the Commission distinguished several cases where awards ranged from $25,000 to $40,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is compelling evidence, however, that complainant began to suffer from depression as a result of the agency's conduct toward him. A licensed clinical social worker whom complainant was seeing reported in November 1996 that complainant had been exhibiting clear signs of depression. Complainant stated in his March 1, 1999 affidavit that he became outraged at not being promoted with the rest of his co-workers and not receiving the same monetary awards that they received. These events happened December 1994 and April 1995. He reported that he suffered from insomnia, anxiety, and depression, that his relationship with his live-in girlfriend had been negatively impacted, and that he became angry and hostile toward his children and grandchildren. He <span id="Page_1860"></span>also reported that, years after the occurrences at issue, he still breaks down and cries frequently and that he continues to take ten milligrams of prednisone per day. Complainant's girlfriend stated in her affidavit complainant would come home agitated and short-tempered over minor annoyances, and would yell and scream at everyone in the house, including his daughter and her sons. She confirmed that their relationship after 1995 was almost nonexistent because of complainant's anxiety. A union officer who represented complainant stated that complainant communicated feelings of hurt and disappointment at being the only food service worker not to receive a promotion or a monetary award. The union officer also reported that complainant stopped whistling at work and greeting his co-workers with a smile, something that he had always done up until then, and that he would break down emotionally. Finally, the union officer stated that, in September 1995, when complainant approached him about being counseled for absence without leave and being required to obtain medical certification for two absences taken months before, complainant was visibly shaking and could not complete his sentences without breaking down in tears. The union officer emphasized that complainant appeared to be completely overwhelmed at the idea that he would be charged with AWOL.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that both complainant and his girlfriend stated in their affidavits that complainant began to experience depression in March 1993. The agency argues that since complainant's depression predated the acts of discrimination identified in the complaint by nearly two years, it had to have been caused by other work-related incidents that were not part of the complaint, as well as by the worsening of his MS. We disagree. Complainant, his girlfriend, and the union officer identified specific instances in which complainant's stress and emotional distress worsened because of the delay in his promotion, his failure to be given a monetary award along with his co-workers, the AWOL charge, and his placement in medical certification status. Based on the foregoing, we find that the incidents identified in Complaint No. 96-1057, which occurred between December 1994 and September 1995, had been a substantial cause of complainant's depression. We also find that his depression constitutes a compensable harm in and of itself, without regard to its effect on his MS. To the extent that complainant suffered from depression prior to September 1994, we find that the discriminatory acts had the effect of aggravating this pre-existing condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where the Commission awarded nonpecuniary damages of $40,000 and above, the evidence of record tended to show that the emotional or psychological injuries which resulted from the agency's actions either had permanent or substantially-long term effects, or were so catastrophic that no inquiry into long-term effects was necessary<span class="Italic">. See Mack v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (June 23, 2000) ($186,000 awarded where individual was left homeless for two years as a result of discriminatory termination); <span class="Italic">Cook v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950027 (July 17, 1998) ($130,000 awarded where 14-months of hostile work environment caused individual to develop atypical paranoid disorder, leaving her unable to work); <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (October 14, 1998) ($125,000 awarded where agency's discriminatory conduct caused individual to develop severe digestive problems as well as psychological injury); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951729 (July 29, 1998) ($100,000 awarded where subjection of aggrieved individual to hostile work environment caused her to develop severe psychological injury, from which she was still suffering at the hearing); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997) ($100,000 awarded where, as a result of ongoing sexual harassment, individual sustained severe psychological injury that affected her for four years and was likely to affect her for the foreseeable future); <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) ($50,000 awarded where complainant's pre-existing depression aggravated by agency's discriminatory conduct would require treatment for five years); and <span class="Italic">Turner v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956390 (April 27, 1998) ($40,000 awarded where discriminatory harassment, particularly forcing her to carry a 45-pound back-pack, caused her to experience psychological trauma and physical injury with permanent effects).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where permanent or long-lasting harm is less severe, awards tend to range between $30,000 and $40,000. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kannikal v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04A00017 (June 15, 2001), the Commission awarded complainant $32,500. The complainant therein, like the complainant in the instant case, experienced long-term depression, but was able to manage it with medication, and had recovered sufficiently to function well in medical training. The Commission also noted that his condition was affected by several intervening factors, including the complainant's voluntary participation in a medical experiment and his subsequent problems with his supervisor after he was reinstated. In another case, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961812 (June 18, 1998), the Commission awarded the complainant nonpecuniary compensatory damages in the amount of $35,000 for depression and stress. The complainant had become depressed as a result of the agency's discriminatory conduct. Although the complainant had to remain on medication for three years after the incidents, her depression had significantly improved several months after those incidents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where the harm suffered is severe, but of limited duration, the Commission tends to award $25,000. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01943844 (May 8, 1996), the Commission awarded the complainant $25,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages after finding that she had been subjected to sexual harassment between 1990 and 1993. She had been diagnosed with depression many years before her employment with the agency, but had never been hospitalized prior to the incidents that gave rise to her complaint. She was hospitalized four times as a result of the agency's conduct. However, the trauma that complainant experienced did not last beyond the cessation of the harassment. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span> EEOC Request No. 05970336 (November 20, 1997), the Commission awarded complainant $25,000 in non-pecuniary damages in connection with the depression he experienced after not being selected for a particular position. The Commission noted that complainant had been experiencing numerous problems outside the workplace before the nonselection, including bankruptcy, marital difficulties, and his wife's illness. The Commission found that the nonselection exacerbated the complainant's pre-existing emotional and psychological problems, but to a limited extent. In awarding the complainant $25,000, the Commission took into consideration the presence of various outside factors and two-year duration of the complainant's depression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, the social worker stated that complainant would have to continue with psychotherapy for the foreseeable future. However, even though complainant retired from the agency on disability, neither of the two physicians who had been treating him recommended that any restrictions be placed on complainant's work and non-work activities. Thus, the harm suffered by complainant appears to be of long-term duration, but is not as severe as it was in Wallis and Turner. As in Johnson, complainant has had to remain on medication for years after the discriminatory incidents occurred, but, as in Terrell, other factors contributed to complainant's depression, namely the agency's conduct between March 1993 and December 1994, and the worsening of his MS. Based upon these considerations, we award complainant $33,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency damage award of $12,000 was increased by the Commission to $33,000 where the agency had "greatly inflated" the effects of the litigation-harm which is not compensable. In <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Attorney General</span>, 01A40538 (2005), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an affidavit dated September 22, 2002, complainant stated that her supervisor's harassment made her nervous and uncomfortable. She stated that she stopped coming to work on days that she thought she might be alone with her supervisor. She further stated that in the early weeks and months of the harassment, she cried every day and even in September 2002, still felt persecuted and guilty. Complainant maintained that over the previous three years, she has felt too stressed to work and has had to call in sick or leave work early many times. She further stated that since September 1999, she has gained 75 pounds because she eats out of nervousness. Complainant also claimed that several months after the incidents of September 1999, she experienced "horrible nightmares." Complainant further asserted that she has been concerned about her safety because she knew her supervisor "paid a heavy price for his actions and I am the most logical person for him to blame for his losses." She further stated that on many occasions, she imagined her supervisor in the car behind her in traffic, and on at least two occasions, was convinced her supervisor was following her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's husband stated that the harassment has taken a serious toll on complainant's life and placed "a lot of stress on our relationship." He stated that complainant shared details of her supervisor's harassing conduct at first, but felt "trapped" because she feared reporting it would lead to retaliation. He further stated that after the harassment began, complainant experienced excessive weight gain, often cried, and suffered from insomnia. "Essentially, I have witnessed a once joyful, trusting, and motivated Terri become someone that rarely smiles and is extremely cynical," he stated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A long-term friend of complainant stated that complainant often told her how uncomfortable her supervisor made her feel. She stated that after the harassment began, complainant transformed from a "usually happy and jovial friend" into a "sad and withdrawn" person. She noted that complainant has gained weight and is often depressed. She further stated that complainant has expressed concern for her safety during the ordeal and even considered getting a firearm to protect herself. "Terri has been a completely different person since her dealings with [the harasser]," she stated.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1861"></span>By contrast, the Commission approved an award of $35,000 in emotional distress damages and only $2,500 in damages for physical pain in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Interior,</span> 01961812 (1998). In making such a low award for physical pain, the Commission noted the absence of evidence that complainant's physical pain, except for some migraine headaches, was caused by the discrimination. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Economou v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01983435 (1999), the Commission reduced an award by an administrative judge of $300,000 in damages to $35,000. The complainant testified that he suffered from humiliation, anxiety, depression, stress, and sleeplessness. Significantly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Economou</span> awarded $35,000 even in the absence of any medical testimony. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Knight v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976645 (2000) (a $36,850 award was based on the testimony of coworkers, the complainant's mother, and closest friend).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Zoila P. v. Attorney General</span>, 0720130036 (2015), the Commission upheld an award of $33,000 by the administrative judge, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that Complainant experienced temporary spikes in emotional upset, including feeling horribly upset and disheartened, uncomfortable, dejected, beaten down, distraught, concerned, afraid of what might happen, devastated, terrible, like her career was irrevocably damaged, sick/nauseated and like she had been punched in the gut due to the instances of discrimination that she was able to prove in the instant complaint. AJ Decision, p. 61. The events causing this were the denial of her transfer request and her January meeting with S4 during which S4 made comments deemed to be <span class="Italic">per se</span> retaliation. <span class="Italic">See</span> AJ Decision, p. 61. The AJ indicated that Complainant's award was discounted due to other non-discriminatory incidents that caused or contributed to most of Complainant's mental and emotional symptoms, and those allegations of discrimination that were untimely. AJ Decision, p. 62.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased the agency's award of damages from $15,000 to $35,000 in <span class="Italic">Feris v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 01983167 (1998). <span class="Italic">Feris</span> concerned the agency's failure to provide an accommodation over an extended period of time. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Feris</span> proved that he was not provided adequate interpreter services for a period exceeding two years. The complainant and his wife provided testimony regarding the stress, anxiety, sleeplessness, and loss of self-esteem that resulted from the agency's actions. The Commission noted it was "mindful" that the complainant had not identified a specific career opportunity he was denied as a result of not having an interpreter, nor had he compared his career progression to similarly situated employees. The Commission further noted that the complainant did not claim any "serious physical or mental effects" that required medical treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld a $35,000 award in <span class="italic">Robyn D. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2021000644 (2021), where the agency denied the complainant's request to continue the use of a designated parking spot:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ awarded $35,000 in compensatory nonpecuniary damages for the claim at issue. We conclude the award is appropriate and consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant testified during the hearing that she thought it was "unbelievable" when she learned that the Agency had revoked her reserved disability parking. Complainant noted that the Agency had undergone two other parking lot paint stripping, and she had completed the same application packages she had with the most recent paint stripping and her reserved parking spot was renewed. Complainant stated that she felt "hurt" when her request was denied, and she stated that she was scared that she would physically hurt herself and fall from the walking she incurred after her space was revoked. Complainant explained that she did not feel valued and she felt that people at work did not want her to come in the office to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, Complainant noted that she injured her ankle during the period the Agency denied her revoked her handicap parking spot which resulted in her parking in a parking lot that was approximately 1,200 to 1,500 feet way from her building. Complainant explained that her pain from this injury lasted about two weeks. Although Complainant acknowledged that at the time she sustained this injury, she could have taken the ramp instead of the stairs when making her way from the parking lot to her office building, Complainant's decision to elect to use the stairs over the ramp does not negate the Agency's failure to provide Complainant with an accommodation within her medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Medical documentation in the recorded supported that Complainant's parking spot should have been no more than 100 feet away from her building, and consequently, Complainant having to park in the parking lot across the street was not within her medical restriction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of $35,000 is neither monstrously excessive nor the product of passion or prejudice and is consistent with prior EEOC precedent. <span class="italic">See Marguerite W. v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120142727 (Dec. 21, 2016) (complainant awarded $30,000 when agency denied complainant a computer monitor as a reasonable accommodation for her visual impairment for a period of about three months and complainant suffered emotional harm).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984091 (2001), the Commission awarded the complainant $35,000 in damages as a result of emotional distress because of a denied transfer, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that complainant testified as to the effect the discrimination had on his mental health and family life. Complainant reported that he suffered emotional distress, depression, sleeplessness and mental anguish during the period between 1995-1997 when he was wrongfully denied a transfer to El Paso. Complainant testified that due to his sleeping problems, he consulted a psychiatrist in North Carolina who prescribed medication. Further, the record contains the report of a treating psychologist who stated that complainant suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Dysthymic Disorder, directly caused, influenced and/or exacerbated by the abusive treatment complainant experienced throughout his employment. The treating psychologist further stated that complainant and his wife will continue to need counseling. We find that this uncontroverted evidence establishes complainant's entitlement to nonpecuniary damages<span class="Italic">. See Sinott v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952872 (September 19, 1996) (stating that an complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can establish mental or emotional harm).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $35,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Ly v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A00048 (2001), where the complainant submitted medical evidence that she suffered from major depression that included problems with recall, insomnia, fatigue, and headaches. The complainant also submitted medical evidence that her symptoms were solely the result of the agency's harassment. In <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 07A10072 (2002), the Commission awarded $35,000 where the complainant's emotional distress lasted approximately two years.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $10,000 was increased to $35,000 in <span class="Italic">Harmon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994179 (2002), where it was unclear to what degree work issues other than the discriminatory sexual harassment contributed to the complainant's condition, but the emotional distress lasted some three and a half years. The record established that the complainant had a major depressive disorder, received treatment for several months, experienced a 55-pound weight gain, asthma, and insomnia.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found it appropriate to award $35,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Henry v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20113 (2003), where the complainant testified that because of the agency's discrimination she was unemployed for a year and had to put her children on medicaid and welfare. She also had her car repossessed because she could not make the payments, fell behind in child-support payments, and had to pay a lawyer to represent in court proceedings related to her inability to pay child support. As a result, the complainant suffered humiliation, embarrassment, and stress.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $35,000 in damages by the administrative judge was upheld in <span class="Italic">Yarbrough v. Attorney General</span>, 07A20083 (2003), where the complainant was discriminatorily discharged. The complainant was still suffering emotional and mental distress at the time of the hearing. She also testified that her professional reputation, developed over years of working in the prison system, was damaged and that she became embarrassed and the subject of disparaging names and comments by coworkers.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $35,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Banks v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20037 (2003), where the complainant suffered humiliation, intimidation, embarrassment, and deep depression. In addition, the complainant was assigned to a guard shack for a period of 18 months where she feared for her physical safety and was never certain if her supervisors would respond to her requests for assistance, if needed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Garrett v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30024.txt">07A30024</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $35,000 in damages where "[t]he record reveals that complainant suffered emotional distress, depression, anger, embarrassment and humiliation as a result of the agency's discriminatory conduct. The record also shows through complainant's significant other's testimony that complainant 'has become angry and depressed and he has observed her cry openly over the loss of the opportunity to transfer to Sacramento,' he also testified that complainant suffered constant headaches and did not sleep well."</p>
<p class="noindent">Compensatory damages in the amount of $35,000 was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A33597 (2004), where the agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation resulted in physical problems for the complainant over a period of a year and a half, as well as a variety of financial and emotional problems. An award of $35,000 was also deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Heffley v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40138 (2005), where the denial of interpretive services for a hearing-impaired employee resulted in her becoming frustrated over the inability to communicate with fellow employees and she became fearful of losing her job. She also suffered shortness of breath, loss of appetite and diarrhea.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Arroyo v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30065 (2004), the Commission awarded $35,000 in damages where "the record reflects that after the termination, complainant testified that she was embarrassed and upset. Complainant stated that she could not cope at home, wanted nothing to do with her family and was stressed and depressed. Her pride was also damaged. Complainant also testified that at first she was afraid to tell her husband that she had not been reappointed and after she did, he could not understand her emotional <span id="Page_1862"></span>state. She also testified that she was unable to give her children a lot of attention, and was not interested in sexual relations with her husband. The AJ also found that while giving her testimony, complainant was visibly upset and shaken. Complainant's husband provided testimony that corroborated complainant's testimony."</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Otero v. Secretary of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a44064.txt">01A44064</a> (2005), was awarded $35,000 in nonpecuniary damages based on the "complainant's testimony that as a result of the agency's retaliation, he suffered sleep disturbance with nightmares, weight gain, general fatigue and loss of interest in usual activities, social and interpersonal withdrawal, frequent bouts of crying, feelings of worthlessness, thoughts of suicide, disillusionment with his job and extreme anger."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased a $25,000 damage award to $35,000 where the complainant presented evidence from her physician that she suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and major depression. The doctor testified that the complainant became isolated from family and friends. The complainant also testified that she felt violated, humiliated and embarrassed when her medical information was released from the agency's doctor to her immediate supervisor and "'I became stigmatized, stereotyped because of my disease.'" <span class="Italic">Forde v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A50188 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $35,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Stansbury v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 02100608521 (2006), where the complainant had chronic anxiety and headaches, sleep difficulties, and feelings of anger, paranoia and humiliation that lasted at least four years.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency award of $8,000 in damages to $35,000 in a case where it rejected a claim of some $30,000 in past pecuniary damages due to lack of medical documentation. In <span class="Italic">Hyde v. Attorney General</span>, 0120073964 (2009), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, complainant claims to have suffered emotional and physical suffering due to the agency's harassment. Complainant's husband states that after the harassment began, complainant rejected any contact with him and others. Comp.'s Reply to Agency's Response to Comp.'s Request for Damages, Ex. 2. Further, complainant's husband claims that their relationship deteriorated so much that at one point at he moved out of the house because they had stopped talking. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Complainant's co-worker (CW1) asserts that she could see the stress taking its toll on complainant. Comp.'s Reply, Ex. 4. A second co-worker (CW2) contends that complainant would come to her crying and complaining about the harassment on virtually a daily basis. Comp.'s Reply, Ex. 3. CW2 adds that complainant was nervous all the time because of the harassment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, the Commission rejected an agency argument that an $8,000 award was appropriate and upheld the administrative judge's award of $35,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Rosa v. Attorney General</span>, 0720090035 (2010), where the complainant, a unit manager in a detention center in Puerto Rico was reassigned to the position of phone monitor after a prolonged medical absence. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rosa</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[The] Complainant testified that he endured questions from co-workers about what he did to warrant the assignment, and suffered daily humiliation. The AJ found this affected Complainant's self-esteem and reputation. The AJ found that Complainant was at the end of his career, with no opportunity to redeem his reputation and retire without the stigma of having done "something wrong," and this would affect him for the remainder of his life.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed an award of $35,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Broomfield v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720110038 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant indicated that he felt tired all of the time and that his doctor told him that he was depressed. The AJ noted that Complainant felt bad enough to have contacted the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which, the AJ found, that for someone of Complainant's personality, as she observed his testimony, that he felt considerably worse than he articulated. The AJ also noted that Complainant withdrew from people and found his work less rewarding because of the atmosphere. The AJ concluded that Complainant was a strong individual but that the disparate treatment and the hostile work environment caused Complainant emotional distress and suffering.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $35,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0720130020 (2014), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find the AJ's compensatory damages award should be modified. Complainant, his wife and pastor testified on Complainant's behalf at the hearing. They testified as to the humiliation, job stress and depression that Complainant experienced in response to the Agency's retaliation. Complainant testified that the retaliation affected his relationship with his wife, who at one point suggested that Complainant quit his job. Clearly, having a former supervisor send a negative performance appraisal to a new supervisor with the intent to harm one's reputation and job security would be humiliating and cause substantial stress and anxiety. Therefore, we find Complainant's award should be increased to $35,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant was called a "bitch" by a coworker, who also pounded a table and told her she was not safe "off the clock," the Commission found an award of $35,000 was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720140002 (2014), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ found that Complainant was credible in testifying about the events of November 2010, and about the fear she experienced at the time of the incidents, as well as the stress, anxiety, and depression she felt as a result. The AJ also found Complainant's psychologist credibly testified that: he initially diagnosed her in November 2010, with post-traumatic stress disorder with the collateral symptoms of agoraphobia and depression as a direct result of the November 1, 2010 incident; she was having nightmares, flashbacks, staying home all of the time, and stopped socializing with friends; and he saw her on a weekly basis for a month and a half, then every two weeks, and then every month since the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends on appeal that she is entitled to nonpecuniary, compensatory damages of $150,000. After a thorough review of the record, and given the severity, nature, and duration of distress experienced by Complainant as a direct result of the discrimination, we find that the AJ's award of $35,000 for her emotional distress in nonpecuniary, compensatory damages is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120133384 (2015), the Commission increased an agency award of $1,000 to $35,000 finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that given the specifics of facts in this case, the Agency's remedial award of $1,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages was inappropriate. In his affidavit, Complainant stated that he suffered from anxiety, depression, mental anguish and chronic sleepless after being discriminated against by the Agency that affected his marriage and his relationship with his family and friends. Complainant further stated that he experienced ongoing humiliation. Specifically, Complainant stated, "I know everyone is aware that all of the candidates for this position, I was erroneously ranked next to last by the TVA. I still have to face these people every day and deal with them thinking that I am not good enough to serve in that capacity, and that I am just another 'black person crying.' Management [has] done a pretty effective job of character assassination, so it is hard to face the people at work and those in the community that know."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, Complainant stated that the Agency's adverse actions had damaged his reputation. Complainant stated that, "a derogatory and highly offensive flyer was circulated around my job site in the form of a 'Hurt Feelings Report.' This is attached as Exhibit A. It uses terms such as 'candy ass, 'whiner,' wimp,' and other derogatory terms about employees who report unlawful discrimination against the Agency. This official looking document was circulated immediately as a response to the posting that was ordered by the EEOC to be posted on my job site because of my discrimination. Everybody knows that this offensive flyer was intended for me due to the timing of the court-ordered posting and the circulation of the flyer. Clearly, my reputation has been harmed."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also provided letters of his pastor and a friend in addition to his own affidavit attesting to his claim of emotional harm. In <span class="Italic">Carle v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, the Commission explained that "objective evidence" of non-pecuniary damages could include a statement by Complainant explaining how he was affected by the discrimination. EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (January 5, 1993). Statements from others, including family members, friends, and health care providers can address the outward manifestations of the impact of the discrimination on the complainant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, while it can strengthen a claim, evidence from a health care provider or other expert is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional harm. <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record in its entirety, including consideration of all statements submitted on appeal it is the decision of the Commission to modify the Agency's award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages. We find the award of $1,000 of non-pecuniary compensation damages is incorrect in light of the amount awarded in similar cases, the severity of harm and duration of the harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the Agency's adverse conduct here was inherently degrading and humiliating, we find it reasonable to accept Complainant's affidavit of emotional distress to support an award for emotional damages. We find it appropriate to award Complainant $35,000 because his affidavit testimony along with his supporting witnesses, established that, for a duration of approximately three years, he felt humiliated and degraded when he was not selected for the subject position. This award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Castillo v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01990818 (July 16, 2002) ($35,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant testified to emotional distress, stress at work, anger and tension for a period of approximately three years); <span class="Italic">Carlson v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A51437 (April 27, 2005) ($30,000 in nonpecuniary damages where complainant testified that he suffered depression, anger, alienation, <span id="Page_1863"></span>humiliation, embarrassment, and loss of status); and <span class="Italic">Garrett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30024 (February 25, 2004) ($35,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant experienced emotional distress, depression, anger, embarrassment, humiliation, headaches, and sleep difficulties).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sanora S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120133235 (2015), the Commission rejected the complainants contention that she was entitled to $116,666.67 in damages and awarded $35,000. Although there is no precise formula for apportioning damages when there are multiple causes of the harm, not all of which arise from the agency's discrimination, in <span class="Italic">Sanora S</span>., the Commission determined that the starting point for damages was $150,000, but reduced the award because the complainant had prevailed on only three of 10 claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant contends that she is entitled to a base award of $175,000, but concedes that the award should be reduced by one third to $116,666.67. <span class="Italic">See</span> CAB, pp. 39-40. Throughout her appeal brief, Complainant argues that two thirds of the losses she suffered were attributable to S1's retaliatory acts, and consequently, that she is entitled to recover two thirds of any base award of damages and equitable relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> CAB, pp. 39-40, 49, 67, 77. Complainant identified three causes of the harm she suffered: (1) S1's effective denial of Complainant's request to engage in outside employment, which was found to be discriminatory; (2) flare-ups of Complainant's depression and PTSD and the symptoms associated with those conditions; and (3) S1's requirement that Complainant travel to Washington, DC, which began in April 2008. Complainant concedes that incident (3) was not discriminatory and maintains that because two of the three reasons she suffered harm were based upon the retaliatory acts of S1, she should be entitled to two thirds of any base award of damages and equitable relief. CAB, pp. 39-40.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we agree with Complainant that any award she ultimately receives should be proportional to the harm she suffered, we disagree with the two-thirds proportion she claims entitlement to as well as the manner in which Complainant arrived at that proportion. In cases involving multiple incidents where discrimination is found in some incidents but not on others, any damages award should be based only on those incidents in which discrimination is actually found. <span class="Italic">See Eason v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120062715 &#x0026; 0120062716 (June 6, 2008) (limiting award where the employee prevailed in three of seven incidents and regarding the remaining incidents as independent causes). Because Complainant prevailed in only three of the ten incidents she identified in her oriGINAl claim, her recovery should be 30% of the base award, not two thirds, as she claimed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant cites a number of our prior decisions in which we have awarded between $130,000 and $150,000 in nonpecuniary damages. In <span class="Italic">Burton v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050066 (March 6, 2007), we awarded the employee $130,000 in nonpecuniary damages based on a finding that as a result of being subjected to a hostile work environment, the employee suffered anxiety, depression and humiliation, which resulted in permanent diminishment on quality of life and her ability to earn a salary. The employee attested to being withdrawn from friends and family and to contemplating suicide. Her own testimony was augmented by a sworn statement from her husband and from medical records showing that she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Of the seven incidents she identified in her complaint, she had prevailed on four.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40037 (September 28, 2004), we awarded $150,000 to an employee who had been subjected to numerous suspensions and terminations. We noted that in cases where we have made substantial awards of nonpecuniary damages, the evidence of record tends to show that the emotional or psychological injuries that resulted from the Agency's actions had permanent or substantially long term effects. In <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, the award was supported by the testimony of the employee, his wife, and brother, as well has his medical providers, who had diagnosed him with and prescribed treatment for major depression, anxiety disorder, and PTSD. We reduced the Administrative Judge's oriGINAl award from $200,000 down to $150,000 because the employee was able to successfully train as a firefighter and complete his probation for that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Coopwood, supra</span>, we again awarded an employee $150,000 after our review of affidavits from various witnesses and medical documentation that the racially charged hostile environment to which the employee was exposed for two and a half years caused her to suffer severe depression, nausea and vomiting in the office, uncontrollable crying, frequent panic attacks, fears for her safety, difficulty concentrating, nightmares, and insomnia. She also suffered significant injury to her professional standing and reputation, weight fluctuation, and stomach problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each of these three cases shares a number of features in common with the case now before us. In addition to being supported by extensive testimony and medical documentation, the harm suffered by the employee in each of these prior decisions was found to be either permanent or substantially long term. In the present case, the testimonial and documentary evidence establishes that Complainant had never completely recovered from her ordeal. The overall picture conveyed by the documentary and testimonial evidence that Complainant presented in support of her claim for nonpecuniary damages is that she had preexisting anxiety and depression that had been aggravated by S1's discriminatory actions and that had subsided to the point where, although she was able to continue working, her personality and outlook had permanently changed from optimistic and hopeful to gloomy and pessimistic. Her relationships with family, friends, and colleagues had clearly deteriorated by mid-year 2008. On the basis of this evidence, we agree that the starting point for determining Complainant's nonpecuniary damages should be a base award of $150,000. We premise this determination on the severity and duration of the harm she suffered and the extensiveness of the evidence that Complainant has in support of her claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, however, the causal connection between the three incidents of retaliation by S1 and Complainant's PTSD, depression and other conditions is much more tenuous than it was in the cases cited above. Complainant started to experience workplace-related stress and anxiety as far back as her detail to New York City in November 2004, well over two years before she came to be under S1's supervision. Just as critical is the fact that Complainant had been subjected to seven nondiscriminatory incidents that affected her symptoms while she was being supervised by S1, particularly S1's imposition of mandatory travel to Washington, DC, which occurred several months after the last incident found to be discriminatory. Third, Complainant experienced stress that arose from factors outside of work that had arisen after the retaliatory incidents at issue, including issues with her children and her aging parents, in particular the passing of her father.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since Complainant had prevailed in only three out of ten incidents, the base award must initially be reduced to 30% in accordance with Complainant's recovery ratio. Moreover, the fact that Complainant not only had a preexisting condition, but had also been exposed to stressors outside of work after the retaliatory incidents had occurred must also be accounted for in determining the size of the award. Based upon those considerations, we find that Complainant is entitled to nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $35,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0720150006 (2015), the Commission rejected the complainant's contention that an award of $35,000 by the administrative judge should be increased to $50,000, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that a portion of Complainant's sufferings was attributable to the incidents of harassment where the AJ did not find discrimination. The AJ found that the clear evidence supported Complainant's claim that a portion of her sufferings resulted from receipt of the U-PAR including Complainant's reported emotional distress and the physical manifestations it caused. The AJ considered that Complainant provided both her own testimony and that of her husband as well as some medical documentation and found that an award of $35,000 was appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
