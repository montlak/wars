<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-60"><span class="space">3.</span> Knew or Should Have Known Requirement</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, the Supreme Court found that the statute of limitations--in federal sector cases, the 45-day period for counselor contact--for discrete personnel actions begins to run from the date the action is taken and a plaintiff cannot rely solely on the fact that past personnel actions are related to get around the statute of limitations on untimely claims. However, the Court noted that the statute of limitations is subject to waiver, tolling, and estoppel. To the extent that continuing violations remain viable, a complainant will have to establish a basis for waiving the statute of limitations; in other words, the complainant will have to establish that he or she was not aware that past personnel actions were discriminatory at the time they occurred and reasonably should not have been aware.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before reversing field in <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, the Commission previously held that the failure to exercise due diligence in asserting a continuing violation barred at least part of the claim as untimely. For example, as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Attorney General</span>, 01922669 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, appellant alleged a pattern and practice by the Section Chief of not selecting her for vacancies in the Press Office for which she was well qualified, while selecting others who lacked the necessary qualifications, because of her race. Allegedly, in each instance appellant's non-selection was based on her race, the same official was involved in each nonselection, the positions were located in the same office, and the positions required similar if not identical qualifications. The Commission has found in other cases that such factual allegations were sufficient to state a claim of continuing violation which the agency should investigate. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Kevin McGivern v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901150 (December 28, 1990) (continuing violation alleged where eleven prior nonselections were approved by the same official; the positions sought were similar in terms of grade, location and level of responsibility; the positions required similar qualifications; and the complaint alleged the same discriminatory basis for the nonselections); <span class="Italic">Sandra Fisher v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900410 (June 21, 1990) (sufficient interrelatedness found even though the position about which appellant had timely contacted an EEO Counselor had been filled competitively while the nineteen prior positions had been filled noncompetitively).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the instant case distinguishable from both the <span class="Italic">McGivern</span> and the <span class="Italic">Fisher</span> cases. In the <span class="Italic">McGivern</span> case, the complainant represented that his latest nonselection was the "catalyst" which confirmed his suspicions of discrimination. In the <span class="Italic">Fisher</span> case, the Commission found that because many of the selections were initially filled on an acting basis, the acts did not have the degree of permanence which reasonably should have triggered the complainant's awareness of and duty to assert her rights. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Gary Thomas v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910171 (April 4, 1991) (complainant asserted that he did not have specific evidence or knowledge of a discriminatory motive at the time of his three prior nonselections but information was uncovered during the EEO Counselor's investigation of his fourth nonselection which led the complainant to believe that a pattern of discrimination had occurred).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed below, our decision in this case is also consistent with the approach taken by the three Courts of Appeals that specifically have addressed the effect of a complainant's prior knowledge or suspicion of discrimination on his or her ability to seek a remedy for that prior discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Fifth Circuit has held that in order to establish a continuing violation of Title VII, a complainant must show: (1) that some independent actionable conduct occurred during the statutory period for filing a charge of discrimination; and (2) that the complainant did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to have realized until the time period for filing her timely charge of discrimination, that the prior discriminatory act was itself actionable. <span class="Italic">Glass v. Petro-Tex Chemical Corp</span>., 757 F.2d 1554, 1561 (5th Cir. 1985). In the <span class="Italic">Glass</span> case, the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court's continuing violation finding as not clearly erroneous. The District Court had found, in essence, that Mrs. Glass need not have known that her 1969 nonselection was actionable, and need not have abandoned her hope for a promotion, until she finally realized, after a 1974 nonselection, that her desire for promotion was hopeless because of her employer's continuing policy against promotion of women to supervisory positions in the department at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1562.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Gadsden Memorial Hospital</span>, 850 F.2d 1549 (11th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's finding that the employer had wrongfully discriminated against Mr. Roberts by denying him fair promotional opportunities in 1981, but reversed the District Court's finding that a 1978 nonpromotion was not time-barred. The Court of Appeals found that, even assuming that the 1978 discriminatory act continued into the statutory filing period, the 1978 claim was time-barred because Mr. Roberts admitted that he was aware of his rights in 1978. The Court of Appeals concluded that Mr. Roberts could have asserted his rights at that time and, to the extent that he was injured on a continuing basis as a result of the 1978 incident, it was because he knowingly had failed to exercise his rights. The Court of Appeals reasoned that a claim arising out of an injury which is "continuing" only because a plaintiff knowingly fails to seek relief is exactly the sort of claim that Congress intended to bar by the limitations period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1550.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The First Circuit cited the <span class="Italic">Roberts'</span> reasoning with approval in <span class="Italic">Sabree v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Local No. 33</span>, 921 F.2d 396, 402 (1st Cir. 1990) (plaintiff failed to establish a sufficient relationship between an act that was timely raised with the EEOC and acts which were not timely raised, to justify an expanded remedy). The First Circuit held in the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> case that a knowing plaintiff has an obligation to file promptly with the EEOC or lose his claim. The First Circuit distinguished the situation in the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> case, wherein the plaintiff admitted that he had believed he was discriminated against at each occurrence, from the situation where a plaintiff is unable to appreciate that he is being discriminated against until he has lived through a series of acts and is thereby able to perceive the overall discriminatory pattern. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, appellant clearly believed that she had been discriminated against after the fourth nonselection. She should have contacted an EEO Counselor within thirty days of that realization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision in this case is also consistent with the Supreme Court's description of the purposes served by the limitation periods in Title VII:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The limitations periods, while guaranteeing the protection of the civil rights laws to those who promptly assert their rights, also protect employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Delaware State College v. Ricks</span>, 449 U.S. 250, 256-57 (1980). The Supreme Court cautioned in the <span class="Italic">Ricks</span> case:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It should not be forgotten that time-limitations provisions themselves promote important interests; "the period allowed for instituting suit inevitably reflects a value judgment concerning the point at which the interests in favor of protecting valid claims are outweighed by the interests in prohibiting the prosecution of stale ones." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc.</span>, 421 U.S. at 463-464. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mohasco Corp. v. Silver</span>, 447 U.S. 807, 820, 825 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">449 U.S. at 259-60 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its next term, the Supreme Court again addressed the purposes of Title VII's charge-filing timeframes. The Court explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By holding compliance with the filing period to be not a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing a Title VII suit, but a requirement subject to waiver as well as tolling when equity so requires, we honor the remedial purpose of the legislation as a whole without negating the particular purpose of the filing requirement, to give prompt notice to the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Zipes et al. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 455 U.S. 385, 398 (1982) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, equity does not require tolling the time limit for contacting an EEO Counselor, where appellant clearly thought she had grounds for filing an EEO complaint after the fourth nonselection, but chose not to exercise her right to file a complaint at that time. To hold otherwise would negate the purpose of the filing requirement, to give prompt notice to the employer. Accordingly, we affirm the agency's rejection of appellant's untimely-raised allegations. We remind the agency, however, that the untimely nonselection allegations are relevant background for appellant's timely allegation of nonselection and should be addressed as such in the investigation of her complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans</span>, 431 U.S. at 558 (untimely raised allegations may constitute relevant background evidence in a proceeding in which the status of a current practice is at issue).</p>
<p class="noindent">Cases prior to <span class="Italic">Wallace</span> suggested that a complainant could establish continuing violation merely by showing the alleged acts of discrimination were interrelated. But later cases made it clear that the theory was not a vehicle to bring otherwise untimely complaints within the limitation period. The complainant also had to make a showing that he or she did not have prior knowledge, or at least a reasonable suspicion, that the earlier acts were discriminatory. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Faina v. Secretary of Transportation, FAA</span>, 01945513 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also important, in determining whether a claim for a continuing violation is stated, to consider whether appellant had any prior knowledge or suspicion of discrimination and the effect of this knowledge<span class="Italic">. Sabree v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Local No. 33</span>, 921 F.2d 396 (1st <span id="Page_83"></span>Cir. 1990) (plaintiff who believed he had been subjected to discrimination had an obligation to file promptly with the EEOC or lose his claim, as distinguished from the situation where a plaintiff is unable to appreciate that he is being discriminated against until he has lived through a series of acts and is thereby able to perceive the overall discriminatory pattern)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite case law, including its own, that clearly indicated that a continuing violation could not be claimed when the complainant was, or reasonably should have been, aware of discrimination more than 45 days prior to initiating counseling, the Commission still issued decisions without regard to this rule. The result was a further muddling of the continuing violation doctrine. For example, in <span class="Italic">Pham v. Postmaster General</span>, 05950385 (1995), the Commission found the complainant had stated a claim of a continuing violation under the analogous theme theory without discussing the agency's contention that the complainant had suspected discrimination nearly two years before filing the complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A continuing violation may properly be defined as an ongoing series of related acts directed against an employee. In <span class="Italic">Tarvesian v. Carr Division of TRW, Inc.</span>, 407 F. Supp. 336, 339-340 (D. Mass. 1976), the court stressed that an essential ingredient of a continuing violation is an analogous theme uniting the alleged discriminatory acts of the employer into a continuous pattern. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Claytor</span>, 469 F. Supp. 22 (D.D.C. 1978), the court determined that an interrelatedness between the past and present acts complained of was essential to establish a continuing violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, it is uncontested that appellant contacted an EEO Counselor in April 1994 complaining that she was denied employment benefits and seniority. Most specifically, appellant argued at that time, and throughout the processing of this complaint, that other persons were hired as full time employees, or converted to full time status, even though they were junior to her. Appellant maintained that such action was tantamount to race, national origin, and sex discrimination because the employees who received permanent status and its attendant benefits were white, male, and American. In her request for reconsideration, appellant submits that the most recent incident of such discrimination occurred in March 1994, and that she informed the agency of this incident at the counseling stage. In fact, she claims that it was this incident which prompted her to seek EEO Counseling. The Commission finds that, in view of appellant's statement that she sought counseling in April, and given the specifics provided by the May letter, appellant's April 1994 contact with the EEO Counselor is timely with regard to the March 1994 incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that appellant has presented a timely allegation to the EEO Counselor, we must now determine whether or not the requisite interrelatedness exists between the timely allegation and the prior allegations of discrimination made by appellant. Relevant to this determination is whether the acts involve the same type of discrimination; whether they recurred, or were more isolated incidents; and whether the same persons were involved<span class="Italic">. See Scott v. Claytor, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the record that an analogous theme of race, sex and national origin discrimination is evident in this case. Specifically, appellant has alleged that she has been passed over for full time status, whereas the agency has hired many persons junior to her into full time positions. Appellant has also clearly alleged that the discrimination has recurred on several occasions, most recently in March 1994. As such, the Commission determines that the agency improperly dismissed appellant's complaint on timeliness grounds. Accordingly, it is the decision of the Commission to grant appellant's request for reconsideration, and remand the case to the agency for further processing as outlined in the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sastry v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01953711 (1996), the Commission accepted the complainant's contention that he did not believe his nonselection for promotion was discriminatory until he had been passed over several times for promotion. Because the nonselections were all for similar positions and the same selecting officials were involved in many of the selections, the Commission accepted the complaint as stating a continuing violation. Although the Commission did accept the complainant's contention that he was previously unaware of the alleged discrimination, it still did not apply the "knew or reasonably should have known" test.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lapina v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01950656 (1996), the Commission reiterated that a continuing violation theory is not a way of getting around the fact that a complainant sat on his or her rights:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also relevant to the inquiry is whether appellant had prior knowledge or suspicion of discrimination and the effect of this knowledge<span class="Italic">. Wood,</span> EEOC Request No. 05930221 (citing <span class="Italic">Sabree v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Local No. 33</span>, 921 F.2d 396 (1st Cir. 1990)); <span class="Italic">Hagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920709 (Jan. 7, 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Sabree</span>, 921 F.2d 396); <span class="Italic">cf. McLaughlin v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920629 (Mar. 4, 1993) (holding that an allegation regarding a performance appraisal arguably should have triggered appellant's duty to assert his rights, but finding that appellant's allegation, if true, that he did not suspect discrimination until he saw a pattern in the supervisor's actions, would make the allegation part of a continuing violation). The Commission described the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> case as holding that a plaintiff who believed he had been subjected to discrimination had an obligation to file promptly with the EEOC or lose his claim, as distinguished from the situation where a plaintiff is unable to appreciate that he is being discriminated against until he experienced a series of acts and is thereby able to perceive the overall discriminatory pattern<span class="Italic">. Hagan</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920709 (citing <span class="Italic">Sabree</span>, 921 F.2d 396). The Commission has stated that it "has declined to find a continuing violation when the complainant has knowingly failed to raise discrimination claims at the time the incidents) occurred." <span class="Italic">Trulli v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910793 (Feb. 4, 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Culpepper v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900825 (September 14, 1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Rabbani v. Secretary of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 01961782 (1997), the Commission issued a decision finding a continuing violation without even a discussion of when the complainant should have been aware of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant allegations are very similar in nature and involve the same third-level supervisor, Dr. G, who is alleged to have discriminated against the appellant since 1986. Without in any way diminishing the full scope of the appellant's allegations, we note that the gravamen of the instant complaint is that the agency has continuously retaliated against him by denying him opportunities for training, attendance at professional meetings, and conducting research in his field of expertise, and that he has been denied performance ratings commensurate with his level of performance. Because the alleged pattern of retaliation continued within the 45-day period preceding his EEO contact as well as thereafter, we find that all the rejected allegations must be accepted by the agency for an investigation under the continuing violation theory.</p>
<p class="noindent">Amazingly, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Rabbani</span> had filed other complaints alleging reprisal between 1986 and 1991. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Gebel v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01964532 (1997) (denying appellant's claim of continuing violation, noting that her earlier suspicion of discrimination was the "undoing" of her complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, the real question appeared not to be whether the Commission accepted the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> standard, but whether it could keep that standard in mind when deciding cases involving continuing violations. There was some indication in late 1997 and early 1998 that the Commission was moving in the direction of consistency and considering the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> standard far more often in its continuing violation cases. In <span class="Italic">Andrews v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01971855 (1998), the Commission rejected a claim of continuing violation because the complaint involved discrete personnel actions that reasonably should have triggered a suspicion of discrimination. As the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A determination of whether a series of discrete acts constitutes a continuing violation depends on the interrelatedness of the past and present acts<span class="Italic">. Berry v. Board of Supervisors</span>, 715 F.2d 971, 981 (5th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 868 (1986). It is necessary to determine whether the acts are interrelated by a common nexus or theme<span class="Italic">. See Vissing v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890308 (June 13, 1989); <span class="Italic">Verkennes v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900700 (September 21, 1990); <span class="Italic">Maldonado v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900937 (October 31, 1990). Should such a nexus exist, appellant will have established a continuing violation and the agency would be obligated to "overlook the untimeliness of the complaint with respect to some of the acts" challenged by appellant<span class="Italic">. Scott v. Claytor</span>, 469 F. Supp. 22, 26 (D.D.C. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relevant to the determination are whether the acts were recurring or were more in the nature of isolated employment decisions; whether an untimely discrete act had the degree of permanence that should have triggered an employee's awareness and duty to assert his or her rights; and, whether the same agency officials were involved<span class="Italic">. Woljan v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950361 (October 5, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, it is important, in determining whether a claim for a continuing violation is stated, to consider whether an appellant had prior knowledge or suspicion of discrimination and the effect of this knowledge<span class="Italic">. Jackson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950780 (June 27, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, appellant argues that the agency's actions present a continued pattern of discriminatory events. Specifically, appellant contends that a low ranking on her 1996 performance evaluation was the final incident in a long process of discrimination that has been occurring since 1989. It is undisputed that appellant made timely contact with an EEO Counselor on March 6, 1996, regarding her allegation that she received a low ranking on her 1996 exit evaluation, which she received on February 23, 1996. The issue then before the Commission is whether or not the requisite substantial relationship exists between the timely allegation (allegation 5) and the prior allegations made by appellant, which the agency dismissed for untimely EEO Counselor contact (allegations 1, 2, &#x0026; 3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that allegations (1), (2), and (3), were discrete acts, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, regarding derogatory remarks involving three different agency officials, and working conditions. These incidents allegedly occurred between 1989 through February 1996. We find that each of the alleged <span id="Page_84"></span>discriminatory incidents described in allegations (1), (2), and (3), were separate and discrete incidents, which should have triggered a suspicion of discrimination at the time they occurred. The record indicates that different personnel/officials perpetrated each incident in the complaint. Based on the foregoing, we find no nexus between allegations (1), (2), and (3), and the performance evaluation in allegation (5). Therefore, appellant failed to establish a continuing violation<span class="Italic">. See Trapani v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940037 (November 10, 1994) (holding no continuing violation when the incidents complained of were of a different nature and involved different agency officials). Thus, appellant's EEO Counselor contact regarding allegations (1), (2), and (3), was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Sty v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984065 (1999) (remanding to the agency to "consider whether [the complainant] had prior knowledge or suspicion of discrimination and the effect of this knowledge.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01965075 (1997), the Commission provided the following analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains appellant's deposition and her answers to interrogatories. These documents indicate that in 1988, appellant's request to be converted to a professional series was denied while a white male was allegedly converted. According to her deposition testimony, appellant felt that she was being discriminated against when this occurred. These records also reflect that, in October 1989, appellant was aware that race was allegedly a factor in her being reassigned. Because appellant had a reasonable suspicion as early as 1988, that she was being discriminated against, her reliance on the continuing violation theory is misplaced. Accordingly, when appellant contacted an EEO Counselor on November 28, 1994, the contact was untimely. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">VanDerMeulen v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01965549 (1997) (it is important, in determining whether a claim for a continuing violation is stated, to consider whether an appellant had prior knowledge or suspicion of discrimination, and to consider the effect of this knowledge).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Fite v. Postmaster General</span>, 01964712 (1997), the Commission found a continuing violation where the complainant suspected that a letter of warning was discriminatory at the time it was issued, but did not suspect it was part of a larger course of conduct on the part of the agency designed to remove her from the federal service. Once again, the Commission seems to have missed the mark in the <span class="Italic">Fite</span> case. This time, the Commission actually applied a reasonable suspicion rule to the ultimate adverse action, instead of the basis of discrimination. The Commission did not explain why the complainant in <span class="Italic">Fite</span> should be excused from filing the complaint when she first believed there was discrimination because she could not foresee the ultimate outcome of the alleged discrimination.</p>
