<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-86a"><span class="space">H.</span> HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT HARASSMENT--NON-EMPLOYEES TO EMPLOYEES</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is possible for an agency to be held liable for discriminatory harassment directed at employees by non-employees. The agency does have, in certain circumstances, an obligation to insulate its employees from sexual harassment by third parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant alleges that she was sexually harassed by a third party who is not employed by the agency, the issue is properly addressed as one of liability. Assuming the complainant can prove the harassment occurred, the agency will be liable to the extent that general agency principles are applicable. For example, in <span class="Italic">Story v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944819 (1994), the employee alleged that she was sexually harassed when she was fondled by a physician during a fitness for duty examination. The agency dismissed the complaint because the physician was not an agency employee. The Commission reversed and remanded the case for further investigation. "We find, however, that the determinative fact is not whether the physician was employed by the agency, but rather whether the physician was selected by the agency to conduct the fitness for duty examination in question and/or whether the agency contracted with the physician to provide service...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Depending upon the answers to those questions, liability could be imputed to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's rule for liability in third party cases is the same as its rule for liability in cases involving coworkers. The employer is liable for sexual harassment by third parties if it knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt and effective remedial action. The Commission will examine the degree of control the employer exercises over the third party and any legal responsibility the employer may have for the conduct of the third party in determining liability. 29 CFR 1604.11(e). As with its rule on coworker liability, the Commission appears to premise third party liability on a finding of negligence on the part of the employer. <span class="Italic">See Restatement (Second) of Agency</span>, 219(2)(b).</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Bautista v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A2388 (2002), the Commission found the complainant stated a claim for relief where she alleged that she was harassed by a "bagger" who was not employed by the agency. The agency dismissed the claim on the premise that it had no control over the bagger and, therefore, no employment action was implicated. In reversing the dismissal, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bautista</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency may be responsible for the acts of non-employees, with respect to harassment of its own employees in the workplace, where the agency (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing such claims, the Commission considers the extent of the agency control and any other legal responsibility which the agency may have with respect to the conduct of such non-employees<span class="Italic">. See Fauntroy v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01995207 (August 18, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that complainant is "aggrieved" because she sets forth an actionable claim of harassment. Specifically, based on complainant's contention that the November 27, 2000 confrontation was so severe as to have resulted in the need for medical treatment, as well as her statements that the head bagger engaged in continuous mistreatment of the Filipino cashiers, to include herself, we find that complainant alleges a failure to prevent conduct that may have been sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment<span class="Italic">. See Fauntroy </span>and <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970077 (March 13, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we find that the record is devoid of any evidence to describe the nature or extent of the agency's day-to-day control over the head bagger. Without this evidence, we find that the agency fails to demonstrate that it is not liable for the head bagger's conduct, or that it does not share joint liability with the contractor providing the head bagger's services<span class="Italic">. See </span>EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Application of EEO Laws to Contingent Workers Placed by Temporary Employment Agencies and Other Staffing Firms</span> (December 3, 1997). The Commission has long held that the agency bears the burden of providing evidence or proof in support of its final decision<span class="Italic">. See Marshall v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910685 (September 15, 1999). Therefore, without evidence to demonstrate that it lacked the requisite control over the head bagger, we find that the agency improperly dismissed the instant complaint on the grounds of failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Brady v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120100292 (2011), the Commission found that the complainant had stated an actionable claim for hostile environment harassment where she alleged she had been kissed and fondled by a contract employee. In reversing the agency's dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Brady</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An Agency may be responsible for the acts of non-employees, with respect to harassment of its own employees in the workplace, where the Agency (of its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing such claims, the Commission considers the extent of the Agency control and any other legal responsibility that the Agency may have with respect to the conduct of such non-employees.<span class="Italic"> See Fauntroy v. Department of the Treasury, </span>EEOC Appeal No. 01995207 (August 18, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that Complainant is aggrieved because she sets forth an actionable claim of harassment. Specifically, based on Complainant's contention that the March 1, 2009 sexual harassment incident was so severe as to have resulted in the need for counseling, we find that Complainant alleges a failure to prevent conduct that may have been sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See Fauntroy and Cobb v. Department of the Treasury,</span> Request No. 05970077 (March 13, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we disagree with the Agency's finding that there did not exist a hostile work environment based on sexual harassment. The complaint alleges that C1's conduct was unwelcome, including groping and kissing her. We note that in her formal complaint, Complainant stated that she received "an email of poor attempt at an apology from [C1] approximately 3:00 pm my time. His email (attached) clearly indicates his attempt to justify his behavior. Joking around and acting silly is totally different from fondling a person. I never fondled anyone while I was joking around. He is trying to make light of his unacceptable behavior." Complainant has alleged a failure to prevent conduct that may have been sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment affecting the conditions of her employment. Therefore, we find that the Agency improperly dismissed the instant complaint on the grounds of failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sparks v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01954507 (1997), the Commission found the agency would have been liable for sexual harassment by a volunteer, had it not taken prompt and effective action when it learned of the harassment. In so holding, however, the Commission gave little consideration to the appellant's arguments that the agency should be held liable, even though it acted promptly when notified of her allegations, because the agency should have known of the potential for sexual harassment. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Sparks</span> was a nurse who was required to work with a volunteer who was part of a work-release program at a local correctional facility. On two occasions, within a few days, the volunteer asked the appellant for hugs. On the first occasion, knowing the volunteer was a convicted criminal, the appellant was upset enough to lock herself in a closet. Indeed, the Commission found the two incidents created a hostile environment, in part, because of the appellant's knowledge that the aggressor was a convicted criminal.</p>
<p class="noindent">There was no dispute that immediately following the appellant's complaints, the volunteer was transferred to another correctional facility, the volunteer program was canceled and other actions were taken to ensure the harassment did not recur. However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sparks</span> found there was no liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency is not liable for the sexual harassment in this case because it has shown that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action as soon as appellant notified agency officials of the harassment. We note in this regard that appellant did not report the harassment to her supervisor immediately, but instead told her husband, who notified prison officials. The prison terminated the harasser's volunteer program, and then transferred him to another facility. Because the prison transferred the harasser, it is clear from the record that the harassment ceased. However, to ensure that such harassment would not recur, the agency took additional steps of terminating the prison volunteer program, ordering the harasser's wife to stay away from appellant's work area, and escorting appellant to special parking located near the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although appellant contends that the agency should be held liable because it allowed a convicted rapist to volunteer at the MVAMC, the Commission finds no basis for imputing liability to the agency on these grounds. First, we note that other than appellant's own assertions, there is no evidence the agency knew the alleged harasser was a convicted rapist. Second, even if it had this knowledge, until it was armed with the <span id="Page_911"></span>knowledge that the convicted rapist was sexually harassing employees, and in the absence of other evidence establishing that the convicted rapist would create a discriminatory work environment, the agency was not obligated to take action pursuant to Title VII principles.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the alleged perpetrator of unwelcome advances is an employee of another federal agency, the proper course is to file a complaint with the agency that employs the perpetrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee-Chee v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01986197 (1999). In that case, the complainant, an employee of the Department of Treasury, alleged that she was harassed by a Transportation Department employee at a convention. The Commission held that the Department of Transportation was the proper respondent if the alleged perpetrator attended the convention as an employee of that agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, even when the alleged perpetrator is an agency employee, there must be a sufficient connection between the employee's actions and the agency to warrant holding the agency liable. For example, in <span class="Italic">Valentime-meyer v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A05897 (2001), the Commission found that an allegation that the complainant witnessed a pornographic email belonging to another employee did not state a claim. The Commission found that even if the conduct could be construed as sufficiently severe or pervasive, "the complaint does not otherwise challenge an unlawful employment policy or practice." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Attorney General</span>, 0120081287 (2009), the Commission found that the agency was liable for the sexual harassment of a corrections officer by a prison inmate. The inmate exposed himself to the complainant on several occasions, masturbated in front of the complainant on one occasion, and physically assaulted the complainant on another occasion. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lemons</span>, brushed aside a suggestion by the agency that the nature of the prison environment reduced its responsibility to protect its employees from harassment, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the final decision's attempt to insulate the agency from liability by asserting that the agency followed its own process for handling inmate misconduct, there is no evidence that the agency actually used the process to effectively respond to complainant's reports of harassment. In fact, although complainant provided the EEO investigator with copies of her incident reports after the agency failed to provide them for the record, there is no indication in the record that the agency actually took any action in response to complainant's incident reports. Even if the agency forwarded complainant's incident reports to the Unit Disciplinary Committee in accordance with its inmate disciplinary process, there is no evidence that the Committee took any prompt or corrective action to address the harassment before complainant was sexually assaulted. After complainant reported that she was subjected to harassment when an inmate repeatedly exposed himself to her, the agency was required to take immediate and effective corrective action instead of deferring its duty to respond to a protracted procedure that did not adequately address the urgency of the situation. Given the fact that inmates were allowed to sometimes roam outside their cells, complainant's job duties included going into or near the inmate's cell, the repeated nature of the indecent exposure, the questionable mental state of the inmate, and the targeted and confrontational manner in which the inmate exposed himself to complainant, we find that the agency did not exercise reasonable care to prevent further harassment of complainant before she was sexually assaulted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we reject the agency's suggestion that its duty to protect its employees in this case is somehow reduced by the nature of a prison facility. In<span class="Italic"> Freitag v. Ayers, </span>468 F.3d 528 (9th Cir. 2006), the Ninth Circuit upheld a jury's determination that a female correctional officer was subjected to a hostile work environment when inmates subjected her to exhibitionist masturbatory conduct on at least five occasions within several months. Regarding the agency's liability for the inmate's harassment of the officer, the Ninth Circuit concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Nothing in the law suggests that prison officials may ignore sexually hostile conduct and refrain from taking corrective actions that would safeguard the rights of the victims, whether they be guards or inmates. As the district court found, "even in an inherently dangerous working environment, the focus remains on whether the employer took reasonable measures to make the workplace as safe as possible." The CDCR is not, by simple virtue of its status as a correctional institution, immune under Title VII from a legal obligation to take such measures and to protect its employees to the extent possible from inmate sexual abuse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Freitag, </span>468 F. 3d at 539.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that in <span class="Italic">Freitag,</span> the Court observed that prisons have curtailed indecent exposure by imposing serious disciplinary measures for sexual misconduct; restraining sexually aggressive inmates or taking away their yard privileges; working with the prosecutor's office to prosecute serious and repeat offenders; and, even installing devices so that officers can observe inmates but inmates cannot see the officers. <span class="Italic">Freitag,</span> 468 F.3d at 535. In this case, the agency failed to avail itself of any such measures, which allowed the inmate's conduct to escalate to the point of physically attacking complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also rejected an agency argument in <span class="Italic">Lemons</span> that it was not aware of any threat to the complainant's safety until the physical assault noting that "the physical assault on complainant was the foreseeable escalation of the inmate's indecent exposure against complainant in light of the agency's failure to take advantage of options available to control his indecent exhibitionist behavior." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Silas T. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019003996 (2021), the Commission held the agency liable for the homophobic actions of a customer/employee directed at the gay employee. In that case, the complainant, a bar manager on an agency air base, alleged the following:</p>
<p class="noindent">On October 26, 2017, Complainant attended a meeting as a witness. During the meeting, an Assistant Manager (C1) issued a Waiter (C2) a written counseling concerning dress code violations. Later the same day, C2's mother, who also worked at Chili's as a Waiter (C3), came to the restaurant. Complainant alleged that, while he and C1 were standing outside the restaurant, C3 verbally threatened to kill them. Complainant stated that C3 approached him, waved her finger an inch from his face, and said, "You can't write up my daughter, I'm going to fuck you up." ROI at 253. C1 called Security Forces (SF) to report the altercation, and Complainant estimated that seven SF officers came to the restaurant to address the situation. Complainant averred that C3 continued to threaten to kill him and C1 even after SF had been called. According to Complainant, while C3 was speaking to SF personnel, she repeatedly referred to Complainant as a "faggot." ROI at 254. Complainant alleged that he was humiliated by C3 using this derogatory term to refer to him in front of customers entering the restaurant, his coworkers, and the SF officers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the October 26, 2017, incident, C3 was removed from the Chili's work schedule, pending an investigation. The AFC stated that C3 was told that she was being removed from the schedule until further notice. According to Complainant, he heard that C3 had come to the restaurant between October 28 and November 13, 2017, when he was not working and expressed that she wanted to get Complainant fired, sue him, or otherwise harm him. ROI at 53. Complainant alleged that C3 told his coworkers that she wished Complainant had been at the restaurant so she could do something, noting that her husband had a high rank in the military and that Complainant had "messed with the wrong person." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 13, 2017, S1A informed Complainant that C3 would be placed on the schedule and returning to work. Complainant stated that, based on her threats and harassing language, C3 should have been barred from returning to Chili's as an employee or as a customer. Complainant alleged that, in the past, an employee who physically assaulted a heterosexual employee at work was terminated within four days of the incident being reported to S1A. Complainant stated that the assault against the heterosexual employee drew blood, whereas C3's threats and comments towards him and C1 were verbal. On November 17, 2017, Complainant submitted his resignation, effective November 22, 2017. Complainant stated that he felt like he had no choice to resign because he was afraid of C3 and because S1A told him that she would be returning to the workplace. According to S2, when he heard C3 was on the Chili's work schedule in November 2017, he directed management to take C3 back off the work schedule until the investigation was completed. S2 averred that, although he had contacted Human Resources to begin the process of terminating C3 less than a week after the incident, she could not be terminated until the investigation was complete.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 20, 2017, C2 and C3 came to Chili's to eat lunch as customers while Complainant was working. Complainant alleged that C2 and C3 harassed him while they were in the restaurant. According to Complainant, C3 stared at him every time he entered the dining room, and C2 would snap her fingers every time Complainant walked past their table. Complainant alleged that C2 and C3 were trying to intimidate him and stated that he felt apprehensive that C3 would jump up and hurt him. According to Complainant, he asked S2 to have C3 removed from Chili's, but S2 refused. S2 stated that C2 and C3 were at Chili's as paying customers and that, based on Complainant's description of what was happening, there was no basis for removing C2 or C3 from the restaurant. According to S2, although Complainant stated that C2 and C3 were staring at him and writing something down every time he walked by, there was no basis to remove them from the restaurant. According to the record, C3 was terminated on December 5, 2017. S2 stated that C3 did not work at Chili's after the incident on October 26, 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the record, C1 did not participate in the investigation of Complainant's EEO complaint because she no longer worked for the Agency and no forwarding contact information was available. ROI at 324. On January 11, 2018, the EEO Counselor interviewed C1. C1 told the EEO Counselor that on October 26, 2017, C3 threatened to kill her and Complainant, was very aggressive, and referred to Complainant as a "fag" while she was interviewed by Security Forces. ROI at 15. C1 also stated that, after the incident, management seemed more concerned with protecting C3 than it was with supporting her or Complainant. According <span id="Page_912"></span>to C1, C3 came to the restaurant a handful of times, threatening to sue or get Complainant and C1 fired and staring at Complainant and taking notes.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant opted to participate in a fact-finding conference at the agency level. A decision was issued finding that the complainant failed to prove that the agency subjected him to discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Silas T</span>. reversed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that preponderant evidence in the record establishes that Complainant was subjected to harassment based on his sexual orientation. S1A, Complainant's first-line supervisor, admitted that he described a problematic situation as "fucked up like two boys kissing." On October 26, 2017, C3 threatened to kill Complainant, threatened to "fuck him up," and repeatedly shouted that he was a "faggot." The Commission has previously observed that the words "fag" and "faggot" have historically been used in the United States as highly offensive, insulting, and degrading sex-based epithets against gay men. <span class="Italic">See Couch v. Dep't of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131136 (Aug. 13, 2013). Additionally, the words "fag" and "faggot" are offensive, insulting, and degrading sex-based epithets historically used when a person is displaying the belief that a male is not as masculine or manly as the other person is. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc</span>., 256 F.3d 864, 870, 875 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that verbal abuse, including the use of the epithet "faggot," occurred because of sex).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although C3 was not scheduled to work pending an investigation into the October 26, 2017, incident, she returned to the restaurant several times, threatening to sue Complainant, get him fired, or otherwise harm him. Shortly thereafter, S1A told Complainant that C3 would be added to the schedule and returning to work. On another occasion, C3 was allowed to remain at the restaurant as a customer even after Complainant reported that she and C2 were harassing him while working by staring at him, snapping their fingers every time he walked by, and writing something down. The statements of C1 and other witnesses substantiate Complainant's allegations that C3 harassed him based on sexual orientation. We find that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that Complainant was subjected to a hostile work environment based on sex and sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission answered the question of liability under the coworker-to coworker-analysis in <span class="Italic">Silas T</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We must therefore determine whether there is a basis for imputing liability to the Agency. Regarding the harassment by S1A, Complainant's supervisor, we do not find that the Agency established its affirmative defense, so the Agency is vicariously liable for S1A's harassment. Although management investigated and issued S1A an Oral Admonishment on October 17, 2017, we find that the Agency has not established that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior. We find that less than 10 days after S1A was admonished, another employee, C3, threatened to kill Complainant while repeatedly shouting that he was a "faggot." We also find that the Agency is liable for C3's harassment of Complainant. Despite C3's egregious harassment of Complainant on October 26, 2017, C3 was allowed to return to the restaurant on various occasions, where she either told coworkers that she wished Complainant was there so she could harm him or where she harassed him while he was working. Management stated that there was no basis for removing C3 from the restaurant because she was a paying customer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we note that an agency can be liable for the harassment of an employee by a non-employee, such as a customer. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Complainant v. Tenn. Valley Auth</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120123132 (May 14, 2015) (agency was liable for harassment of African-American employee including a noose on an agency truck even where it was not clear who placed the noose on the truck); <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081287 (Apr. 23, 2009) (agency was liable for sexual harassment of an employee by a prison inmate). Although the Agency may not have been able to immediately terminate C3 based on her conduct on October 26, 2017, allowing her to return to the workplace, where preponderant evidence establishes that she threatened Complainant, precludes the Agency from establishing its affirmative defense that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding the agency's failures so egregious, the Commission, seemingly <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, also concluded that the complainant's resignation amounted to a constructive discharge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant resigned to get away from the harassment, we further find that his EEO complaint raises a constructive discharge claim. The central question in a constructive discharge case is whether the employer, through its unlawful discriminatory behavior, made the employee's working conditions so difficult that any reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">Carmon-Coleman v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A00003 (Apr. 17, 2002). The Commission has established three elements which a complainant must prove to substantiate a claim of constructive discharge: (1) a reasonable person in the complainant's position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) the complainant's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Walch v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940688 (Apr. 13, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant stated that he felt that he had no choice but to resign when he heard that C3 was being added to the work schedule. C3 threatened to kill Complainant, stated to Complainant, "I'm going to fuck you up," and repeatedly referred to Complainant as a "faggot" in front of customers, his coworkers, and the SF officers. When C3 was removed from the schedule, she continued to stalk Complainant. Complainant stated that C3 had come to the restaurant between October 28 and November 13, 2017, when he was not working and expressed that she wanted to get Complainant fired, sue him, or otherwise harm him. C3 told coworkers that she wished Complainant had been at the restaurant so she could do something to him, noting that her husband had a high rank in the military.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The circumstances of this case establish that Complainant was constructively discharged from his employment. Given the threats of violence and use of derogatory language, a reasonable person in Complainant's position would have found his working conditions to be intolerable. Further, the intolerable working conditions plainly arose from unlawful discriminatory conduct based on Complainant's sexual orientation. And the record plainly supports a finding that Complainant's resignation was the result of these intolerable working conditions. Although the record reflects that C3 had not yet returned to the restaurant as an employee, Complainant submitted his resignation in response to learning that C3 would be returning to work, notwithstanding her continuing harassment of him and threats of doing him harm, even in her capacity as a restaurant customer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances of this case, Complainant need not have waited for C3 to make good on her threats before feeling that he had no choice but to resign.</p>
<p class="noindent">With that, the Commission ordered the agency to reinstate the complainant with "all the rights, benefits and privileges of that position"; determine back pay with interest and pay for any adverse tax consequences of the lump sum payment, and compensatory damages; consider taking disciplinary action against the responsible management officials: and provide "a minimum of eight hours of in-person or interactive EEO training to the responsible management officials, with an emphasis on sexual orientation discrimination and on management's responsibility to respond to allegations of harassment.</p>
