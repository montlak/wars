<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-29"><span class="space">2.</span> Back Pay</h4>
<p class="noindent">In most instances where the parties contemplate back pay as part of a settlement agreement, the agreement will specifically include back pay in its provisions. It is not, however, required that back pay be explicitly mentioned in the settlement agreement. A complainant may be entitled to back pay under the terms of an agreement where it is clear from other provisions that back pay was intended.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before discussing when a settlement agreement that does not explicitly provide for back pay may require an agency to award back pay, it is helpful to understand that an agency's authority to award back pay derives from Title VII and not the Back Pay Act. In MD-110 at 12-3, the Commission, relying on decisions of the Comptroller General, explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In one of these decisions, the Comptroller General affirmed that Title VII contains authority for remedying employment discrimination and this authority is independent of the Back Pay Act to provide back pay only where a finding has been made or an "unwarranted and unjustified personnel action." 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596. "The connection between Title VII and the Back Pay Act arises only because EEOC has provided in its regulations on remedial action that when discrimination is found, an award of back pay under Title VII is to be computed in the same manner as under the Back Pay Act regulations." <span class="Italic">Matter of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Informal Settlement of Discrimination Complaints</span>, 62 Comp. Gen. 239, 242 (1983). The authority to award back pay is derived from Title VII; the regulations borrow the formula for calculating the amount of back pay owed from the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result, there is no requirement that there be a finding of discrimination for an agency to award back pay under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Patel v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01971929 (1998), the Commission determined that, although not explicitly provided for in the agreement, the complainant was entitled to back pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In allegation C, appellant alleged that she was not paid back pay in accordance with the terms of provision 3 of the settlement agreement. The agency argues that it had no obligation under the settlement agreement to provide appellant with back pay. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that provision 3 of the settlement agreement expressly provides that the agency take numerous actions: to take steps to eradicate all evidence that appellant had been demoted to a GS-14 position; to reassign appellant to a GS-15 position effective May 12, 1996; to cancel a denial of a within grade increase; and "to grant her" (emphasis added) a written grade increase from GS-15 Step 2 to GS-15, Step 3, effective May 26, 1996. We find that a reasonable interpretation of these agency obligations, as articulated in provision 3, is that appellant is entitled to back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that despite the agency's assertion that the settlement agreement did not contain an express agency obligation to provide appellant with back pay, it has stated that it nevertheless paid back pay. Upon a review of the record, however, we cannot determine whether appellant has been paid all back pay to which she is entitled, in accordance with provision 3 of the settlement agreement. We note, for example, that the agency indicates that two separate payments of back pay have been issued to appellant, one in reimbursement for a salary at a GS-15, step 2 level, and a second payment in reimbursement for salary at a GS-15, step 3 level. On appeal, appellant acknowledges that "back pay payments were processed as per the agreement." However, appellant then argues that "WGI monies" have not been paid. Appellant further alleges that she has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain information on various components of back pay which she has not yet received, such as interest on monies that should have been invested in the thrift savings plan if she had not been demoted to a GS-14 position. Given the present record, we cannot discern whether appellant has been paid all back pay to which she is entitled pursuant to provision 3 of the settlement agreement. Accordingly, the agency' decision finding that provision 3 was not breached is VACATED. This matter is REMANDED to the agency for further processing in accordance with the ORDER below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless the agreement provides otherwise, the complainant is responsible for paying taxes on back pay provided in a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Brannum v. Corporation for National and Community Service</span>, 01971432 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agreement does specifically provide for back pay and the agency includes an estimate of that net amount due to the complainant in the settlement agreement, the agency will be held to a reasonable approximation of the estimated amount. In <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05970693 (2000), the settlement agreement contained an estimated amount of net back pay due to the complainant. That estimate was included at the complainant's request. The agency subsequently satisfied a garnishment order out of the back pay which substantially reduced the amount the complainant received. In finding that the agency in <span class="Italic">Montgomery</span> breached the settlement agreement, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On its face, the SA states that the agency will pay complainant a net amount of "approximately $27,500." In no way can the agency's final net payment to complainant of $16,480.79, even considering the amount withheld pursuant to the garnishment order, approximate $27,500. That the agency's calculation of the gross amount accurately represented 18 pay periods and that the deductions withheld were lawful and proper does not mitigate its breach to complainant. Complainant's unrebutted testimony that he sought an estimate of the net amount from the agency prior to entering into the SA and that he relied on receipt of that approximate amount in signing the SA support this conclusion. We find that complainant relied on the agency's estimate of the net payment and that he would not have signed the SA if the actual amount of the payment (without deduction for the garnishment order) would have been made known to him. For these reasons, therefore, we find that the agency breached the SA with regard to the final net payment to complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon a finding of breach, the Commission's regulations provide that it may order specific performance or reinstatement of the complaint from the point at which processing ceased. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(c). In our view, reinstatement of the complainant is not appropriate in this matter, given complainant's admission that he cannot repay the money he received pursuant to the SA. For this reason, the Commission concludes that specific performance is the proper remedy herein, and we order a payment to complainant, plus interest, in the amount of $5,344.54.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the parties specify a method of determining the amount in a settlement agreement that is in lieu of back pay, the Commission will honor that method <span id="Page_360"></span>as the one the parties intended. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0120051362 (2008), the parties agreed that the agency owed the complainant an amount that equaled the difference between his retirement benefits and the salary he would have received up until his reinstatement. The Commission rejected the complainant's argument, in <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, that the agency was in breach of the agreement for not following the terms of the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 4d concerns the method of calculating complainant's entitlement to compensation for the time he was retired from the agency until his reinstatement. We note that the term "back pay" is not used in the agreement nor is there reference to the "Back Pay Act," reflecting the parties' agreement to calculate complainant's payment strictly in accordance with the terms of provision 4d. The provision states that the amount owed complainant is the "gross difference between Complainant's retirement payments from the date of his retirement to the date of his return to service and salary he would have received had he not retired and remained an employee during that period." Upon review of this matter, we find that the agency's subtraction of Medicare and retirement deductions was proper because the term "the salary he would have received had he not retired" contemplates that the agency would take mandatory deductions such as Medicare and required retirement contributions into account when calculating the sum owed to complainant. This interpretation is further supported by the agreement's specific language exempting any deductions for state or federal tax from the amount owed complainant under the agreement. It seems clear that the parties anticipated some deductions by the agency, or the exemption for taxes would not have been necessary. Therefore, we find that the agency properly deducted Medicare and retirement withholdings from complainant's gross salary to establish the pertinent base from which the retirement annuity payments he received would be deducted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the subtraction of the lump sum complainant received for annual leave when he retired, we determine that the agency's restoration of complainant's leave to the amount he would have received had he not retired means that complainant's retention of the lump sum leave payment would provide him with a windfall where he would receive both the cash value of his leave and the leave itself. We find that the restoration of leave contemplated in provision 4c does not allow for complainant to receive such a windfall. Therefore, we find that the agency appropriately subtracted the lump sum amount of $10,052.93 from its payment to complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 4d also states that the gross amount paid to complainant under this provision will be characterized as "compensatory damages for personal injuries" and further refers to the final sum as the "computation of compensatory damages to be paid." We determine that the plain language of the agreement states that the gross amount paid to complainant would be characterized by the agency as "compensatory damages for personal injuries," not as "salary" or "interest." Therefore, we find that the agency's characterization of its payment as "salary" and "interest" is a technical breach of the terms of the agreement which the agency must remedy in accordance with the Order set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Both agencies and complainants should be careful in how any back pay provisions in settlement agreements are drafted. In <span class="Italic">Sheehy v. National Security Agency</span>, 0420090007 (2009), the Commission distinguished between two settlement agreements that provided retroactive back pay through to a retirement date, one of which allowed the agency to deduct for periods that the complainant was in a nonpay status and one which did not. In <span class="Italic">Sheey</span>, the agency agreed to pay the complainant <span class="Italic">all</span> back pay for the appropriate period and, in response to the complainant's compliance petition, argued that she was not entitled to back pay for periods during which she was AWOL. The Commission disagreed and distinguished the situation from <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0120062001 (2001). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Sheehy</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In requesting clarification of our previous decision, the agency reiterates its reconsideration argument that complainant should not be paid back pay for the period that she was AWOL or in unpaid status. The agency notes that in <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Department of Education,</span> 0120062001 (September 13, 2001), the Commission held that a settlement agreement must specifically address changing a period of unpaid status to a period of paid status in order for a complainant to receive back pay for that period. However, in <span class="Italic">Jenkins,</span> the agency merely agreed to "pay complainant back-pay less appropriate deductions, for the retroactive period of the promotion to the date of her retirement," whereas in this case, the agency agreed that "complainant will receive <span class="Italic">all</span> [emphasis added] back pay, along with any applicable interest normally associated with back pay awards, from this date, 21 June 1998, until her disability retirement date." By agreeing to comprehensively provide complainant with all back pay for the period from June 21, 1998 until complainant's disability retirement date on November 1, 2001, the agency specifically promised to pay complainant back pay for the entire period without regard to any previously-designated unpaid status. Thus, the agency must pay complainant back pay for the entire period from June 21, 1998 until November 1, 2001.</p>
