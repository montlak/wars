<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-137"><span class="space">2.</span> Destruction of Evidence</h4>
<p class="noindent">When a complaint is filed over a failure to appoint or select, the agency is required to retain the promotion package or background records not included in the EEO complaint file for a period of two years. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Property Management Regulations, GSA, 101-11.4. When the agency fails to retain such records and they are vital to a determination on the complaint, the Commission may draw an adverse inference from the agency's failure to produce the records. <span class="Italic">See Ohlmacher v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01850650 (1987) (dispute over contents of complainant's promotion application resolved in favor of employee).</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all cases in which records are destroyed will <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> result in a finding of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Morales v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01850852 (1987), notes taken during the interviews of candidates were destroyed. There was no evidence that the destruction was intentional and it appeared the notes were destroyed prior to the filing of the complaint. The Commission found it was error for the administrative judge to ignore the testimony of witnesses and base a finding of discrimination on the destruction of the notes. The Commission noted the complainant could have demonstrated the testimony was unworthy of belief, but did not make such a demonstration. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120060831 (2007), the Commission found that the administrative judge properly imposed the sanction of an adverse inference on the agency for the destruction of documents related to the contested promotion. However, the Commission also found that the judge properly entered a finding of no discrimination because the agency had offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the selections and the complainant failed to establish pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">In some cases where the agency has destroyed records relevant to a discrimination complaint, it will be given an opportunity to reconstruct the record. In <span class="Italic">Raymond v. Postmaster General</span>, 01872828 (1988), the Commission noted that the agency could reconstruct selection records by providing the most recent background information on the candidates and deleting all information with regard to positions held since the selections at issue. The Commission further noted that the agency could have sought affidavits from the candidates and reconstructed position descriptions for the positions as they existed at the time of the selection.</p>
<p class="noindent">A finding of bad faith does not necessarily flow from the fact that an agency prematurely destroyed documents relevant to an EEO investigation. The Commission has been less than clear on the precise showing that an appellant must make to establish bad faith. It is clear the appellant must at least demonstrate some circumstances surrounding destruction of the documents that would warrant the drawing of an adverse inference. In <span class="Italic">Taire v. Postmaster General</span>, 01934632 (1994), the Commission failed to find bad faith on the part of the agency in prematurely destroying evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ reached the conclusion that appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by drawing an adverse inference from the non-production of two comparative's files, and determining that the agency had failed to investigate the two comparatives. When a party fails to produce relevant evidence within its control, the failure to produce such evidence raises an inference that the evidence, if produced, would prove unfavorable to that party. <span class="Italic">E.g., International Union (UAW) v. NLRB</span>, 459 F.2d 1329, 1335 (D.C. Cir. 1972). As expressed in Commission regulations, if a party in bad faith refuses or fails to respond to discovery requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witnesses approved by the AJ and in the control of that party, the AJ may draw an adverse inference that the requested evidence would have reflected unfavorably on the party failing to comply with the request; <span class="Italic">Crummer v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01913933 (March 25, 1992). The Commission has previously found "bad faith" where the agency refused to release identifying information necessary for the complainant's representative to contact a prospective witness, <span class="Italic">Crummer, supra</span>; where there was overwhelming evidence of both the underlying discriminatory activity and of perjury during the administrative process, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902438 (October 29, 1990); and where the agency destroyed personnel records relevant to the complainant's case when a class action was already pending in a related matter, <span class="Italic">Weinraub v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01892006 (September 25, 1989). Conversely, the Commission found that bad faith did not exist where a witness within the control of the agency did not appear because he was out on sick leave, <span class="Italic">Reeves v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923237 (December 10, 1992); and where there was "no persuasive evidence of record that suggests the agency's nonproduction was due to an effort to conceal relevant information," <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Veterans Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01891407 (August 21, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Commission does not find the requisite showing of bad <span id="Page_515"></span>faith. The investigator explained that if he had not found any adverse information on the two comparatives, he would have discarded the otherwise empty file folders. There has been no showing that the agency was aware, at the time the two comparatives were investigated, that an EEO action was likely, triggering its obligation to preserve the comparatives' files. Accordingly, the Commission is not persuaded that appellant has made even a facial showing that she was treated differently than any employee outside of her protected groups who was thought by the agency to have falsified her Form 2485, or other such documents, when she was investigated.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Blanco v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01A52674 (2005), the Commission specifically rejected a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that would impose an adverse inference on agencies that destroyed documents even when the destruction was in contravention of EEOC regulations. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Blanco</span>, it would instead adopt a case-by-case approach:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we shall address complainant's arguments on appeal. Complainant asks the Commission to draw an adverse inference in his favor because the agency and/or the selection panel "destroyed" the notes taken during his interview. Complainant states, among other things, that EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14 creates a duty to preserve such records pertaining to appointments, selections and demotions. We agree with complainant that the regulation cited creates an obligation for the agency to retain personnel and employment records for a period of one year from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action in question, whichever occurs later. Moreover, the regulation requires that when a charge of discrimination has been filed, the agency must retain the personnel records relevant to the charge until final disposition of the charge.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> We note that complainant's interview took place on July 10, 2002. He learned of his non-selection on September 4, 2002, and later initiated contact with an EEO Counselor about the claim on October 3, 2002. During the investigation, the agency produced the interview notes of the final four candidates who were referred to the selecting official. Complainant was not among these four. The EEO Investigator noted in the Report of Investigation that "most of the interview notes had been destroyed by the time the investigation herein started." It is clear that the agency did not preserve the notes of all twenty-three candidates, including complainant. We have no information of when, how or by whom these documents were destroyed, and the agency provides no justification for their omission. As such, we find that the agency erred in not fully complying with its obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the agency's failure, however, we decline to draw an adverse inference as complainant asks us to do. The Commission has not articulated a policy on whether the destruction of evidence in violation of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14 gives rise to a<span class="Italic"> per se</span> inference of spoliation. Instead, a review of our case law shows that we engage in a case by case determination on whether an adverse inference is appropriate, paying particular attention on whether the erring party acted in bad faith. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942089 (June 7, 1996). In the case at hand, we find no evidence of bad faith on the part of the agency. The agency produced the documents it had retained on the selection as well as affidavit testimony from each of the six selection panelists who interviewed complainant, including the selecting official, who did not personally interview complainant, but who made the final hiring decision. We find that this additional evidence was sufficient to allow the AJ to issue a decision without a hearing. We agree with the AJ that the omission of the interview notes would be egregious if a genuine dispute of fact existed as to whether complainant had given a good interview. For example, if the affidavit testimony revealed that some panelists recommended complainant for the final cut. However, here, the notes are not determinative because complainant has not given us reason to believe that the notes would show anything other than what the panelists all stated. The panelists' testimony was unanimous--complainant gave a poor interview compared to the final four candidates and that is why he was not selected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although not specifically raised by complainant, we note that this is a situation to which EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3)(i) applies. That provision grants the Commission or AJ the authority to draw an adverse inference, such as the one complainant seeks, against a responding agency when it or its employees fail without good cause to respond fully and in timely fashion to requests for documents. The provision further states that the inference to be drawn is that the requested information or testimony reflect unfavorably on the party refusing to provide it.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3)(i) (2004). This is not to say that we permit an agency to shield itself from liability by producing some but not all the relevant evidence in a case, claiming that it no longer has the evidence within its control. Such permissiveness would defeat the purpose of the regulations that create safeguards for the preservation of relevant evidence. Instead, we limit this finding to this particular matter in light of the circumstances of the case. The agency here did not refuse to provide any notes; it produced what the panelists had along with their individual testimonies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though an adverse inference may not be appropriate, an administrative judge may consider an agency's premature destruction of personnel records in making credibility determinations. In <span class="Italic">Hollis v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01934600 (1994), the Commission upheld a credibility determination of its administrative judge based, in part, upon the agency's early destruction of promotion records:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In March 1992, appellant was nonselected for promotion to the position of Food Service Worker, WG-4. The RO in the instant case was aware of appellant's prior EEO activity and testified that the instant complaint was the third complaint appellant filed against her. Less than four months after appellant filed the December 1991 complaint he was nonselected for promotion. Thus appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency explained that the best qualified persons were selected. The AJ found that this explanation was not a legitimate explanation because, among other things, the agency stated that its primary reasons for appellant's nonselection were that appellant's score was not as high as those selected and he did not do as well in answering the interview questions. However, neither the RO nor the other panel members could recall any of the questions which appellant either failed to answer correctly or answered in a manner inferior to the selectees. Both of the selectees acknowledged that they failed to answer all of the interview questions correctly. The AJ found that the agency destroyed the actual rating sheets used to record the answers to the interview questions and the ratings given by the panel members on individual rating elements. He found that this crucial evidence was destroyed after appellant filed his complaint, after the agency managers were aware of appellant's complaint, and just prior to the agency's investigation. However, the AJ did not invoke an adverse inference. He found instead that the selection panel's unsupported testimony lacked credibility and specificity--not just because the records were not produced, but because of the demeanor of the witnesses and gaps in their testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal regulations require a Federal agency to maintain all records relevant to an EEO complaint until after final resolution of that complaint. General Services Administration, Federal Property Management Regulations, 101.11.4, General Records Schedule I, Item 26. Our regulations, at 29 CFR 1602.14 (a), parallel that requirement and make it clear that in the case of a contested selection decision, the agency shall maintain all pertinent information regarding the employment decision. In this case, the agency has failed to meet its duty to maintain or provide information crucial to this case. The AJ found that the evidence contained in the record is insufficient for purposes of allowing appellant a full and fair opportunity to establish his case of discrimination or to show pretext on the part of the agency. The agency failed to sustain its burden of production by articulating with sufficient clarity, a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for nonselecting the appellant<span class="Italic">. Citing</span> <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, the AJ stated, and the Commission agrees:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Placing this burden of production on the [employer] thus serves simultaneously to meet the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by presenting a legitimate reason for the action and to frame the factual issue with such clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. Sufficiency of the [employer's evidence should be evaluated by the extent to which it fulfills these functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While agency guidelines may have permitted destruction of the information, the record established that the relevant selection information was purged after appellant filed his formal complaint of discrimination. Since the agency had prior notice that appellant had filed a complaint and since the destroyed records were highly relevant to the matters raised in the complaint, we find that the agency had an absolute duty to preserve the records.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on these factors and his observation of the demeanor of the witnesses, the AJ found the agency's articulated reasons for not selecting appellant to lack credibility as well as specificity. Specifically, the AJ found that he testimony of the promotion panel members, including the RO, not credible. The AJ stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"While the promotion panel members assert that the principal reason for [appellant's] nonselection was his incorrect answers to interview questions during the interview, not one person on that panel was able to identify even one question which [appellant] answered incorrectly...and based on my observation of their demeanor during their testimony, I believe that none of them made a serious effort to try to recall specific questions the Complainant failed to correctly answer. Finally, these witnesses' attempts to "reconstruct" their ratings of the candidates during their testimony were obviously influenced, intentionally or unintentionally, by the desire to achieve a certain result, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, higher ratings for the selectees and lower ratings for [appellant]. [RO's] miscalculations of [appellant's] rating on one element during her testimony, illustrates this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recommended Decision page 25.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A credibility determination of an administrative judge is entitled to <span id="Page_516"></span>deference due to the judge's first-hand knowledge through personal observation of the demeanor and conduct of the witness at the hearing. This deference is not automatic. If there is sufficient evidence which suggests that the credibility determinations are erroneous, then deference will not be given<span class="Italic">. Willis v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900589 (July 26, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that there is insufficient evidence to overturn the AJ's credibility determinations in this case. The Commission agrees with the AJ that the agency's articulated reasons for appellant's nonselection, are insufficient and are unworthy of belief. Accordingly, the Commission finds, based on the entire record, that the agency discriminated against appellant based on reprisal when he was nonselected for the challenged position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hollis</span>, the Commission determined that the destruction of records prevented the agency from articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. But the imposition of an adverse inference against an agency for the destruction of relevant records as a sanction does not guarantee that the complainant will prevail. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Clayton v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070042 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kerrie F. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720140026 (2015), the Commission upheld an adverse inference imposed by the administrative judge that led to a finding of reprisal. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Kerrie F</span>., wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3), an AJ may sanction a party for failure to provide requested relevant information, to include an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information, exclusion of other evidence offered by the party refusing to provide the requested information, or issuance of a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party. <span class="Italic">Hale v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (Dec. 8, 2000). The Commission has determined that delegating to its AJs the authority to issue sanctions against agencies, and complainants, is necessary and is an appropriate remedy that will effectuate the policies of the Commission. <span class="Italic">Cosentine v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40114 (Aug. 9, 2006). These sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. A sanction may be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his or her discretion to impose a harsher sanction. <span class="Italic">See Hale</span>. Agencies have a duty to maintain pertinent evidence upon receiving notice that a complainant has initiated the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14. As the destroyed evidence was relied on to support a termination, the obligation to preserve it commenced when it was created, and was extended by the filing of the complaint. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While the record shows the destruction of much of the evidence was deliberate, it does not show it was in bad faith. But Commission's regulations do not require a finding of bad faith. <span class="Italic">See Cosentine</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Cosentine</span>, the selecting official took notes, including a matrix to compare and contrast the qualifications of all the candidates, as well as interview notes, which were not maintained. As sanction for this missing evidence, the AJ drew an adverse inference against the agency, and based on this concluded the complainant was better qualified than the selectee and found discrimination. The Agency argued that the AJ erred in drawing the adverse inference regarding the destroyed documents, asserting that this information was otherwise part of the record--the missing matrix was based on the candidate applications, which were in the record. The Agency argued that when considered along with the investigative affidavits of the responsible agency officials, the record contained the same information as reflected in the destroyed documents. The EEOC found that the appropriate adverse inference for the AJ to have drawn was that the missing information would have reflected unfavorably on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find AJ 1 did not abuse his discretion in finding that the destruction of the observation notes and, as applicable, emails by District Manager 2, S1 and S2 denied Complainant the opportunity to test the veracity of these witnesses and the reliability of the typewritten documents they prepared upon which the Agency based it legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions in this case, and accordingly the typewritten logs and corresponding memoranda by District Manager 2, S1 and S2 were not reliable or accurate and that they would be construed to support Complainant's allegations in this case. This documentation was relied on in terminating the detail, placing Complainant on the PAP and determining she failed it, and placing her on the PEP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ 1 acted within his discretion to the extent he found S2 need not testify because the documents she would testify about were already being construed in Complainant's favor. These documents were relied upon in placing Complainant on the PEP. The Agency argues S2 would have also testified about her decision to reprimand Complainant about the permission to use the desk incident--something which did not involve the destroyed notes. We need not rule on this matter because, as found below, the desk incident does not impact the remedies awarded in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is within the administrative judge's discretion to hold a hearing on the possible destruction of evidence and, just as with any other hearing, to make findings of fact, including credibility determinations, based on the observation of witnesses. In <span class="Italic">Butler v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090010 (2010), the Commission upheld an adverse inference drawn by the administrative judge after he held a hearing on the existence of a logbook that tracked employee work assignments. Taking into account witness credibility, the judge determined that the logbook had existed and drew an adverse inference that the logbook would have shown disparate treatment between the complainant and coworkers had it not been destroyed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Butler</span> also argued that the judge erred when, in response to its argument that the records would have been destroyed, if they existed, consistent with the agency's document retention policy, the agency failed to comply with an order to produce the policy. The judge was correct, the Commission found, in imposed a second adverse inference that the retention policy would, if produced, have reflected unfavorably o the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Massenburg v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120110256 (2012), the Commission found that the destruction of interview notes warranted a sanction of an adverse inference even though the destruction occurred before the complainant initiated counseling and there was no indication of bad faith. Fortunately for the agency, it was able to overcome the adverse inference in <span class="Italic">Massenburg</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we find that the AJ properly drew an adverse interest against the Agency in this case where the interview panel failed to retain their interview notes. <span class="Italic">See Clayton v. USPS,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0720070042.txt">EEOC Appeal No. 0720070042</a> (July 26, 2007). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3), an AJ may sanction a party for failure to provide requested relevant information, to include an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information, exclusion of other evidence offered by the party refusing to provide the requested information, or issuance of a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party. <span class="Italic">Clayton, supra; Cosentine v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40114 (August 9, 2006) (<span class="Italic">citing Hale v. Department of Justice</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a03341.txt">EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341</a> (December 8, 2000)). The Commission has determined that delegating to its AJs the authority to issue sanctions against agencies, and complainants, is necessary and is an appropriate remedy that will effectuate the policies of the Commission. <span class="Italic">See Matheny v. Department of Justice</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05a30373.txt">EEOC Request No. 05A30373</a> (April 21, 2005). These sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. A sanction may be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his or her discretion to impose a harsher sanction. <span class="Italic">Hale, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Agencies have a duty to maintain pertinent evidence upon receiving notice that a complainant has initiated the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Cosentine, supra</span>. Although the record in this case shows that the destruction of the interview notes occurred before Complainant contacted an EEO Counselor, and there is no indication that the Agency acted in bad faith, and the Commission's regulations do not require a finding of willfulness or bad faith. Thus, the AJ acted within her discretion in drawing an adverse inference against the Agency regarding the lack of panel interview notes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, the appropriate adverse inference for the AJ to have drawn was for the missing information to have reflected unfavorably on the Agency. <span class="Italic">Hale, supra</span>. However, even with this adverse inference, the balance of the evidence of record does not establish that the "disparities in qualifications [between Complainant and the selectee were] of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen [the selectee] over [Complainant] for the job in question," as explained below. <span class="Italic">Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc.</span>, 190 Fed. Appx. 924, 88 Empl. Prac. Dec. &#x00B6; 42,608 (11th Cir. 2006), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 127 S. Ct. 1154 (Jan. 22, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">For more on the destruction of evidence, see also discussion in Chapter 8, under subsection on "<a href="0100-2023-17-062.html#sec8-63">Sanctions Against Agencies</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The courts require a showing of bad faith in the destruction of evidence before imposing an adverse inference. For example, in <span class="Italic">Aramburu v. Boeing Company</span>, 112 F.3d 1398, 1407 (10th Cir. 1997), the court explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most importantly in this regard, Aramburu presents the deposition testimony of Whitesell, which indicates that he lost portions of Aramburu's attendance records. Aramburu contends that Whitesell spoiled the evidence and, therefore, that "the facts must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff." As legal authority for his spoilation argument, Aramburu refers only to one case, <span class="Italic">Foster v. Lawrence Memorial Hosp</span>., 809 F. Supp. 831 (D. Kan. 1992). However, the district court in Foster addressed the question of whether Kansas would recognize a common law tort action for intentional spoilation of evidence. Aramburu <span id="Page_517"></span>is not bringing a claim for intentional spoilation and does not explain the relevance of <span class="Italic">Foster</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the parties have not directed us to precedent from this circuit on the evidentiary doctrine of spoilation and we cannot locate any such precedent, the general rule is that bad faith destruction of a document relevant to proof of an issue at trial gives rise to an inference that production of the document would have been unfavorable to the party responsible for its destruction<span class="Italic">. See Coates v. Johnson &#x0026; Johnson</span>, 756 F.2d 524, 551 (7th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see generally Telectron, Inc. v. Overhead</span> Door Corp., 116 F.R.D. 107 (S.D. Fla. 1987). The adverse inference must be predicated on the bad faith of the party destroying the records<span class="Italic">. See Vick v. Texas Employment Comm'n</span>, 514 F.2d 734, 737 (5th Cir. 1975); <span class="Italic">see also Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.</span>, 862 F.2d 910, 926 (1st Cir. 1988). Mere negligence in losing or destroying records is not enough because it does not support an inference of consciousness of a weak case<span class="Italic">. Vick</span>, 514 F.2d at 737. Aramburu principally relies on the following portion of Whitesell's deposition:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Q:&#x2003;Can you show me [Aramburu's] record for '91?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A:&#x2003;No, I cannot.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Q:&#x2003;Where is that?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A:&#x2003;I took it out. I took it out of these. And these were in two or three different spots in my file. And I took them--I took his out and I have misplaced it. I put it up for the sole reason of keeping it, and I misplaced it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While this testimony shows that Whitesell lost certain of Aramburu's attendance records for 1991, it does not show that he did so in bad faith. Whitesell lost a calendar page from Aramburu's 1991 attendance record. However, Boeing presented other attendance records for Aramburu, such as the calendar pages from his 1990 and 1992 attendance records and a computer record entitled "Absence Inquiry by Individual" which records an employee's absences and whether they are charged to sick leave, vacation leave, excused leave without pay, or unexcused leave. This computer record reflects Aramburu's absences for 1991. Aramburu does not point to evidence showing that Whitesell lost his records in bad faith, and any inference of bad faith is undermined by the other attendance records produced by Boeing. Aramburu, thus, has not shown himself entitled to an adverse inference under the spoilation doctrine.</p>
