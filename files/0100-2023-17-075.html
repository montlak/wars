<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-76"><span class="space">e.</span> Show Cause Requirement</h5>
<p class="noindent">Normally, the administrative judge must issue a show cause order prior to issuing default judgment against an agency and give the agency an opportunity to demonstrate why default judgment should not be granted. However, in <span class="Italic">Chere S. v. General Services Administration</span>, 0720180012 (2018), the Commission held that a motion for sanctions specifically requesting default judgment is enough to place a party on notice and provides that party with sufficient opportunity to demonstrate why default judgment would not be appropriate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We commence our discussion with the Agency's contention that the AJ abused her discretion by failing to issue an order to show cause before entering the default judgment against it. The noncomplying party must be put on notice that it could be sanctioned for its conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is typically accomplished via an order to show cause, the purpose of which is to notify the non-complying party that its conduct could be sanctioned, inform the party of the potential sanctions that could be imposed, and give the party the opportunity to explain why the sanction should not be imposed. Show cause orders are unnecessary, however, where a party has filed a motion for specific sanctions and the non-moving party has had an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See e.g</span>. <span class="Italic">Council v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080321 (April 9, 2010) (show cause order not necessary because the employee was previously placed on notice of the sanctions that could be imposed for failure to timely submit a pre-hearing statement); <span class="Italic">Vandesande v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A40037 (Sept. 28, 2004). Commission precedent has established that as long as the offending party is provided with notice of a possible imposition of a sanction and type of sanction, and the opportunity to explain why that sanction should not be imposed, the particular form in which the party receives that notice does not matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her order of November 22, 2016, the AJ specifically warned the Agency that any further attempt to dismiss the first complaint on procedural grounds years after it had accepting the complaint, processed it, and referred it for a hearing would be subject to sanctions as a frivolous motion practice. Thus, the AJ made it very clear in that order what conduct would be sanctioned. The AJ even specified an alternative course of action for resolving procedural disputes: a conference with Complainant and her Counsel. This was sufficient to establish the first prerequisite to the imposition of sanctions. Despite that prohibition against frivolous motions, however, the Agency went ahead and filed a second motion to dismiss, this time on grounds of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, in direct defiance of the AJ's order to engage with Complainant. On February 21, 2017, the opposing party moved for a specific sanction: the entry of default judgment in Complainant's favor. This was enough to satisfy the second prerequisite that the type of sanction being contemplated be identified. Despite the lack of a formal show cause order, the two notice prerequisites were fulfilled by the AJ. As to the third prerequisite, the Agency argues that it was not invited to respond to Complainant's motion for sanctions and therefore did not have an opportunity to explain its conduct. To the contrary, we find, as did the AJ, that the Agency was given over four months to respond to Complainant's motion as to why it should not be sanctioned, but failed to do so between February 21 and June 30, 2017. We therefore find that the AJ did not abuse her discretion in issuing the default judgment without first issuing a show cause order.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40037_r.txt">07A40037</a> (2004), the Commission found that no such order was necessary where the administrative judge rescinded his initial order granting default judgment and gave the agency an opportunity to demonstrate why sanctions should not be imposed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that the agency's argument on appeal, that the AJ's Default Judgment Order was procedurally defective because the AJ did not first issue a Show Cause Order, to be without merit. Specifically, we find that rescinding the initial October 11, 2001 Default Judgment, and giving the agency the opportunity to demonstrate why sanctions should not be levied, had the same effect as the issuance of a Show Cause Order prior to the issuance of the December 10, 2001 Default Judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we find that the record supports the sanction of a Default Judgment in this case, given evidence of the agency's overwhelming failure to investigate the captioned complaints or provide complainant with information crucial to demonstrating his claims. Specifically, we concur with the AJ's findings regarding the agency's failure to justify its lack of compliance with the Commission's regulations, the AJ's Orders, and its own representations that it would engage in meaningful discovery, and find no abuse of discretion in ordering a Default Judgment against the agency. <span class="Italic">See Bak v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20039 (May 15, 2003), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30921 (September 30, 2003). As held by the AJ, we concur that this case could not proceed because of the agency's conduct, such that the imposition of a Default Judgment was warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A01735 (2004), the Commission reversed default judgment as a sanction where the administrative judge failed to give the agency any opportunity to demonstrate why sanctions should not be imposed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the AJ's decision to find for complainant on all issues as a sanction for the agency's failure to comply with the AJ's August 3, 1999, Order to complete the investigation by September 1, 1999, we reassert the Commission's inherent authority to enforce its Part 1614 Regulations, which authorizes administrative judges and the Commission on appeal to take such actions deemed appropriate, where an agency or its employees fails without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to an investigator's requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3). In the present case, however, we find that the AJ erred in not providing the agency with an opportunity to respond prior to the imposition of sanctions. While the AJ's decision noted that the agency "failed to show good cause as to why" sanctions should not be issued, AJ's RD, p.4, the record shows that the agency was not provided such an opportunity. Instead, following the agency's failure to comply with the AJ's deadline, the AJ, on September 22, 1999, simply advised the parties that a decision would be rendered on behalf of complainant. We note that the requirement of permitting a party the chance to respond prior to the issuance of sanctions was explicitly added to EEOC Management Directive 110 shortly after the AJ's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC MD-110, 7-7, fn. 4. While we recognize that such a requirement was not explicitly enunciated in the version of MD-110 in effect at the time of the AJ's order, our case law reflects that, at the time of the AJ's decision, we consistently provided the party against whom sanctions were being imposed the opportunity to respond prior to the issuance of sanctions, whether by issuing that party a show cause order and permitting a reasonable time to respond, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Shine v. United Slates Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972201 (December 21, 1998);<span class="Italic"> Pacheco v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970691 (November 25, 1998); <span class="Italic">Telles v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01980931 (November 25, 1998), or by permitting the party opposing sanctions an opportunity to submit an opposition to the motion for sanctions prior to issuance of the AJ's sanction order.<span class="Italic"> See Cornell v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01974476 (November 24, 1998). Furthermore, such a requirement is consistent with 29 C.F.R. 1614.108(c)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_611"></span>We next turn to the AJ's finding that complainant was prejudiced by the agency's failure to comply with the AJ's Order. We are unpersuaded by the AJ's finding that complainant detrimentally relied on the agency's promise to timely complete the investigation by withdrawing her appeal of the dismissed issues. On the contrary, by withdrawing her appeal, complainant guaranteed that an investigation of the two issues would be completed with an eventual right to an appeal. Had she continued with her oriGINAl appeal, she was under no such guarantee. Complainant, therefore, cannot show detrimental reliance.</p>
<p class="noindent">Default judgment also was reversed in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a30039.txt">07A30039</a> (2005), but this time because the administrative judge abused his discretion in imposing any sanction against the agency. In <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the matter before us, however, notwithstanding the AJ' s authority under our regulations to issue sanctions in appropriate circumstances, we find that the AJ's decision to terminate the May 10 hearing and issue a default judgment in favor of complainant was too extreme under the circumstances of this case. In the first instance, we are not persuaded that the agency did not show good cause with regard to several matters. The AJ identified six instances of misfeasance by the agency in issuing her default judgment; however, examined individually and more critically, the explanations offered by the agency to most of the incidents identified by the AJ, are not unreasonable and do not rise to the level of misconduct requiring imposition of a sanction or, when viewed together, justify the ultimate sanction. However, we find that the agency's conduct before the AJ showed a marked degree of sloppiness and a manifest display of disorganization and carelessness, bordering on disrespect and rudeness. We address the explanations offered by the agency in the order referred to by the AJ and described above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that the AJ might have acted too abruptly in cancelling the April 10 hearing after learning that the agency had not provided witness contact information to complainant. The agency represented that complainant was missing contact information for one witness, although his brief asserted that information had not been provided for (unidentified) "agency employees." The record does not indicate that the AJ sought clarification from complainant, even though such intervention may have resolved the matter and allowed the hearing to proceed. Next, the AJ noted a seeming discrepancy with regard to previously-scheduled leave by the supervisor in the first complaint, implying that the agency was disingenuous in its explanation. The agency stated that Thursday, May 9, was the supervisor's regularly scheduled off-day, and his official leave began the next day; further, the agency did offer to provide testimony by telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also criticized the agency for its failure to have two witnesses available for the May 9 hearing. The agency asserted that all witnesses were available for the April 10 hearing but two had left the agency since that date. Certainly, the absence of the witness, called solely by the agency, would not have caused detriment to complainant. We do, however, find fault with the agency's failure to inform the AJ at an earlier date that a second witness, whom she had requested, was no longer employed by the agency. Although the agency's failure to notify the AJ in a more timely manner is not, standing alone, necessarily deserving of a sanction, we find that it was a further showing of the agency's poor management and planning for this hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the non-appearance of a court reporting service for the hearing on May 9, the evidence in the record does not indicate that the agency was wholly responsible, and we question the AJ's determination to cancel the hearing and close the record when a court reporter could have been secured within a few hours, however much the event may have been the proverbial 'straw' for the AJ. The agency's argument and supporting affidavits are not so lacking in credulity as to show that the agency acted to purposely frustrate the hearing process, notwithstanding that its failure to ensure the appearance of the service is a further indication of its sloppiness and carelessness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, a second justification for imposition of sanctions is to remedy any harm to the opposing party caused by the non-complying party's actions. Here, the agency has represented that complainant was returned to work on December 2, 2002, after the AJ's Decision, and awarded back pay. Thus, we do not find that he has experienced any detriment. To the extent that complainant has not yet received attorney's fees or compensatory damages, we hold that he is not yet entitled to such relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the above reasons, we vacate the AJ's Decision issuing a default judgment in favor of complainant and return this matter for a hearing before another AJ consistent with the findings herein. We note that time has passed since the filing of the underlying complaints. Nevertheless, in the interests of justice, equity, and fairness, we return this matter for a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has also emphasized the importance of protecting the integrity of the EEO process as it relates to grants of default judgment. In <span class="Italic">Cox v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720050055 (2009), the Commission upheld a grant of default judgment, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that AJ-1's decision to issue a default judgment in favor of complainant was appropriate under the circumstances of this case, and does not constitute an abuse of discretion. Although the agency has argued that it had good cause with regard to its non-production of witnesses for deposition, we find that its abandonment of any effort to even partially comply with AJ-1's Order to produce the deponents undermines any legitimate arguments it may have had as to the relevancy of some of the requested witnesses. Further, the agency did not show good cause with respect to the delay in appointing a representative until the discovery process only had 30 of the 90 days remaining, or for its failure to respond to complainant's requests for admissions or her other discovery requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under our decision in <span class="Italic">Royal v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (September 25, 2009), we found that the fourth factor in appropriately tailoring a sanction, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process, should not be underestimated. As we noted there, "Protecting the integrity of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process is central to the Commission's ability to carry out its charge of eradicating discrimination in the federal sector." An agency which treats the deadlines in the hearings process, and the requirement to produce an adequately developed ROI, as optional, based on when its staffing and resources may allow it comply, has a negative effect on the outcome not only of the immediate case, but also of any other cases under its jurisdiction, as well as those under the jurisdiction of an AJ. The Commission must insure that agencies, as well as complainants, abide by its regulations and the Orders of its AJs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision to affirm AJ-1's issuance of a default judgment will effectively emphasize to the agency the need to comply with AJ Orders in a timely manner, as well as ensuring that any ROI produced by the agency, either on its own or through a contractor, is adequately developed from which to make a decision on the merits of complainant's complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission again stressed the importance of protecting the integrity of the EEO process in upholding a default judgment in <span class="Italic">Talahongva-Adams v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120081694 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ's decision to sanction the agency was proper. The Commission found in the case of <span class="Italic">Royal v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (September 25, 2009) that delays in completing the Report of Investigation beyond the 180-day regulatory time frame warrant a sanction. In <span class="Italic">Royal</span>, we held that "the agency's delay in completing the investigation within the 180-day regulatory period is no small non-compliance matter."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the agency has not appealed the decisions of the AJ to the Commission pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.110(a) and 1614.401(b), we need not review the actions of the AJ in great detail. We find, however, that the decision of the AJ to issue a default judgment was proper and that the remedies awarded by the AJ were supported by the evidence before her. As the agency did not file an appeal within the 40-day time frame specified in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.110(a), the AJ's decisions became the final actions of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the agency is bound to implement the remedies ordered by the AJ. The AJ ordered the agency to classify complainant as a GS-13 Review Appraiser, with a start date of October 1, 2004, provide back pay with interest, and benefits, pay complainant $17,000.00 in compensatory damages, and to post a notice of discrimination at complainant's place of work, the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indian, Phoenix Office in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the appeal record is devoid of any evidence that the agency has complied with the Order of the AJ. It has not submitted any documentary proof of complainant's reclassification to the GS-13 level, payment of backpay, interest, benefits, or the $17,000.00 in compensatory damages. Neither has the agency submitted a copy of the posted notice as ordered by the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The Agency's Actions at the Appeal Stage</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the agency has also failed to comply with our regulation found at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.403(e), which requires that an agency submit a copy of the complaint file and the hearings records, if applicable, within 30 days of notification that a complainant has filed an appeal. The agency was notified by complainant of the filing of her appeal on February 25, 2008, as complainant's appeal contains a certificate of service which shows that the agency's Office of the Solicitor in Phoenix, Arizona was duly notified, as was the agency's Washington, D.C. Office of Civil Rights. The Commission sent its letter notifying the agency that an appeal had been filed on March 11, 2008 to the agency's Washington, D.C. Office of Civil Rights. The request letter contained the EEOC Appeal Number for complainant's appeal, as well as accurate identifying information so that the agency would be able to locate and send the correct file. The agency has also failed to respond to a follow-up <span id="Page_612"></span>request for the complete file, sent by this Office to the agency's Office of Civil Rights via e-mail on April 2, 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the agency's repeated and continued failure to comply with the entirety of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 regulations is inexplicable and inexcusable. Our regulations require agency action in a timely manner at many points in the EEO process. Compliance with these timeframes is not optional, and as the Commission stated in <span class="Italic">Royal v. Department of Veterans Affairs, supra</span>, "the Commission has the inherent power to protect its administrative process from abuse by either party and must insure that agencies, as well as complainants, abide by its regulations." We further noted that when weighing the factors pertinent to tailoring an appropriate sanction, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process, and protecting that process, is of "paramount" importance to the "Commission's ability to carry out its charge of eradicating discrimination in the federal sector." The agency should consider itself on notice that future noncompliance with our regulations could subject it to the imposition of more stringent sanctions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although default judgment may be appropriate as a sanction, it is not appropriate on allegations that do not state a claim or are beyond the Commission's jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Myvett v. Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency</span>, 0120103671 (2011), the Commission upheld a sanction of default judgment, but also agreed with the administrative judge that the complainant was not entitled to judgment on allegations where the evidence did not support the basic elements of the claim. The Commission also upheld the ruling of the administrative judge that the complainant was not entitled to default judgment on his removal claim because the removal was not within EEOC jurisdiction. In a lengthy decision, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Myvett</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that on August 31, 2007, the AJ issued a document titled "Order Directing the Agency to Produce Complaint File." In his Order, the AJ directed the Agency to provide him a copy of the complete file, including the report of investigation (ROI), within fifteen (15) days from receipt of this Order. The Order placed the Agency on notice that it could be sanctioned if it did not provide the requested materials within fifteen (15) days from the date of the Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 24, 2007, the Agency forwarded an incomplete complaint file which did not contain a copy of the ROI. Consequently, the AJ issued an Order to Complete Investigation dated September 26, 2007, which gave the Agency 45 days from its receipt of the Order to complete the investigation. On December 3, 2007, nearly 70 days after the September 26, 2007 Order, the Agency requested an extension of time to complete the investigation. The AJ did not issue a ruling on that request. On January 14, 2008, the Agency submitted a letter stating that, after it submitted the extension request, it determined that most of the issues in the instant complaint should be dismissed. In that regard, the Agency issued a final Agency decision (FAD) on January 8, 2008 in which it dismissed most of the instant complaint and advised that the new issues Complainant had raised for purposes of amendment in March 2007 should be referred for EEO counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 15, 2008, the AJ issued an Order to Rescind Final Agency Decision insofar as an Agency, after a Complainant has properly requested a hearing, is precluded from dismissing a complaint. By letter dated January 28, 2008, the Agency rescinded its January 8, 2008 FAD and accepted all of the dismissed claims for processing. The Agency did not thereafter submit an ROI, and on July 17, 2008, the AJ issued an Order to Show Cause requiring the Agency to show cause why it had failed to comply with both his August 31, 2007 and September 26, 2007 Orders and produce a completed ROI.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 24, 2008, the Agency submitted a copy of the ROI, and on August 1, 2008, it provided a response to the AJ's July 17, 2008 Order to Show Cause. In its response, the Agency attributed the delay in producing the ROI for three reasons. First, the Agency cited Complainant's conduct, nothing that his "various efforts to amend his complaint and his contumacious conduct in dealing with the Investigator substantially frustrated the processing of his complaint." The Agency stated that the second reason for its delay is that Complainant refused to return the investigator's calls and "when he ultimately communicated with the Investigator, he indicated that he would not allow the investigation to go forward." Finally, the Agency stated that its EEO Office "had one vacancy and underwent a transition in its leadership. Procuring the services of a contract Investigator also added time to the processing of this case."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 30, 2010, the AJ issued a decision. Therein, the AJ noted although Complainant filed the instant complaint on December 28, 2006, it was not until July 24, 2008 (574 days later) that the Agency produced a copy of the requisite ROI. The AJ noted that it was undisputed that the Agency did not submit an ROI in response to either his August 31, 2007 or September 26, 2007 Orders, and failed to comply with both Orders. The AJ stated that in his July 17, 2008 Order to Show Cause, he found the Agency's reasons set forth to be both vague and unpersuasive. Specifically, the AJ stated although the Agency cited Complainant's alleged "contumacious conduct," the only cited misconduct involved Complainant's interactions or lack thereof, with the investigator. The AJ noted that a review of the record reflects that the Agency did not begin its investigation into Complainant's allegations until March 18, 2008, nearly 450 days after Complainant filed the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the AJ found that the Agency did not show good cause for the delay in the production of the ROI. The AJ stated as discussed, his July 17, 2008 Order to Show Cause stated that the failure to show good cause would result in appropriate sanctions. Therefore, the AJ found that the imposition of sanctions was warranted. The AJ further found that the Agency's delay, for which it had not shown good cause, constituted an egregious abuse of this process. Accordingly, the AJ found that, as a sanction, entrance of default judgment in the Complainant's favor was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found, however, that Complainant was only entitled to relief for some of his claims because the record did not contain sufficient evidence to satisfy the basic elements of a claim of hostile environment harassment. Specifically, the AJ found that claims 2, 4, 5, and 6 did not state actionable claims of discrimination. The AJ stated that in regard to claim 2, it involved an action which occurred within the context of the EEO process and, as such, was not actionable in this forum. Regarding claim 4, the AJ found there was no action specifically identified. Regarding claim 5, the AJ stated that the Commission has consistently held that placement on administrative leave does not state an actionable claim of discrimination. Finally, the AJ found that in regard to claim 6, it constituted a proposed action. The AJ noted although the proposed action in question (Complainant's removal) was ultimately effected, he determined that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the removal. The AJ found, however, that Complainant is potentially entitled to relief with respect to the disparate treatment aspects of claim 3 as well as the March 2006 suspension that is referenced in claim 7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission discerns no basis to disturb the AJ's findings. We find that the findings of facts are supported by substantial evidence, and that the AJ correctly applied the appropriate regulations, policies and law. Despite Complainant's arguments that the AJ erred in finding that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over his removal action, we find that the record supports the AJ's determination that the Agency did not show good cause for the delay in the production of the ROI and that Complainant was only entitled to relief for some of his claims because the record did not contain sufficient evidence to satisfy the basic elements of a claim of hostile environment harassment. Moreover, we further find that given the specific facts in this case, the AJ's remedial award is appropriate.</p>
