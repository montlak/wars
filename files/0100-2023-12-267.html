<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-253"><span class="space">C.</span> CONSOLIDATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Two complaints filed by the same employee that are not like or related to each other must be consolidated. Likewise, complaints filed by two or more separate individuals that contain substantially similar allegations should be consolidated. The regulations, at 29 CFR 1614.606, provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complaints of discrimination filed by two or more complainants consisting of substantially similar allegations of discrimination or relating to the same matter may be consolidated by the agency or the Commission for joint processing after appropriate notification to the parties. Two or more complaints of discrimination filed by the same complainant shall be consolidated by the agency for joint processing after appropriate notification to the complainant. When a complaint has been consolidated with one or more earlier filed complaints, the agency shall complete its investigation within the earlier of 180 days after the filing of the last complaint or 360 days after the filing of the oriGINAl complaint, except that the complainant may request a hearing from an administrative judge on the consolidated complaints any time after 180 days from the date of the first filed complaint. Administrative judges or the Commission may, in their discretion, consolidate two or more complaints of discrimination filed by the same complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The practical differences between consolidation and amendment are few. The main difference is that with consolidated complaints, the complainant goes through counseling for each complaint, whereas an amendment requires no additional counseling. Usually, consolidated complaints will be investigated together. MD-110 at 5-13. Under certain circumstances, however, such as where different alleged instances of discrimination took place in locations distant from one another, separate investigations will be more appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110 at 5-14 to 5-15 describes the process for consolidating complaints under 1614.606:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, a new claim that is not like or related to a previously filed complaint provides the basis for a new, and separate, complaint. The complainant must present the new, unrelated claim to an EEO Counselor and the new claim is subject to all of the regulatory case processing requirements. In order to address a different fragmentation concern, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.606 requires agencies to consolidate for joint processing two or more complaints of discrimination filed by the same complainant, after appropriate notification is provided to the parties.4 While it is anticipated that most consolidated complaints will be investigated together, in certain circumstances, such as significant geographic distance between the sites of two complaints, consolidation does not preclude an agency from investigating each complaint separately. In all instances, however, where an individual requests a hearing, the consolidated complaints should be heard by a single Administrative Judge; or where the complainant requests a final agency decision, the agency should issue a single decision. An agency must consolidate complaints filed by the same complainant before the agency issues the notice required by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(f) at the conclusion of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a complaint has been consolidated with an earlier filed complaint, the agency must complete its investigation within the earlier of 180 days after the filing of the last complaint or not later than 360 days after the filing of the oriGINAl complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> Section II.A.1 of this Chapter for more information on time limits. A complainant has the right to request a hearing, even in the case of consolidated complaints, after 180 days have passed since the filing of the oriGINAl complaint, even if the agency's investigation is not complete. If not already consolidated, an Administrative Judge or the Commission in their discretion may consolidate two or more complaints of discrimination filed by the same complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.606 of 29 C.F.R. permits, but does not require, the consolidation of complaints filed by different complainants that consist of substantially similar allegations or allegations related to the same matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant requests a hearing, the consolidated complaints must be heard by a single administrative judge. MD-110 at 5-15. Likewise, if a final agency decision is requested, only one decision should be issued. Agencies are required to consolidate complaints filed by the same complainant prior to issuing a notice of a right to a hearing or final agency decision. An administrative judge or the Commission may, at any time, exercise the discretion to consolidate complaints of discrimination filed by the same complainant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Consolidation, like amendment of complaints, is intended to avoid fragmentation of claims that lead to cases with inconsistent results. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kaprive v. National Security Administration</span>, 01986151 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, given the complicated nature of the EEO process and its overlapping jurisdiction with the MSPB, the regulations on amendment and consolidation can create their own problems. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gray v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01A21484 (2002), the administrative judge, responding to a request by the complainant to consolidate her pending case with three complaints in precomplaint counseling, ruled the complaints were like or related to the pending complaint. Unfortunately for the complainant, the amendment of her complaint included a 30-day suspension. The administrative judge ruled that, because the complaints were interrelated, all of the complaints should be dismissed and appealed to the MSPB. In <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, the Commission reversed finding the complaints were not like or related:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the instant complaint was pending at the hearing stage, complainant filed three additional "informal" claims, claiming discrimination and harassment, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;On July 23, 2001, complainant received a 30-day suspension regarding a physical altercation with a co-worker;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;On July 23, 2001, complainant discovered inappropriate documentation in her "working record" concerning a telephone call; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;On August 24, 2001, the agency denied complainant's request for advanced sick leave and placed her on AWOL (absent without official leave) status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By letters dated September 12, 2001 and September 15, 2001, addressed to the agency and the AJ respectively, complainant requested that the three above referenced claims be consolidated with her pending complaint. In these requests, complainant contended that all four claims were related because they represented a pattern of retaliatory treatment which all relates to her testimony at the EEO hearing of a co-worker. Complainant further claims harassment due to a hostile work environment, based not only on the adverse actions set forth in her four claims, but also as the result of co-worker harassment and shunning. Complainant requested consolidation so that all of her claims could be expeditiously processed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 19, 2001, the AJ responded to complainant's request by issuing an Order to Show Cause, in which he determined that the three informal claims were "like or related" to the pending complaint, finding that the four purported incidents represented a series of harassing <span id="Page_297"></span>actions by the same management officials. Based on this determination, the AJ amended complainant's pending complaint by including the three informal claims. Next, the AJ determined that this amendment transformed the entire complaint into a "mixed case complaint" because the 30-day suspension raised in the newly appended claim 1 appeared to be appealable to the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB). Furthermore, the AJ determined that complainant's other three claims were either related to the 30-day suspension claim, or should otherwise be considered as relevant background evidence by the MSPB should it assume jurisdiction of the 30-day suspension claim. Therefore, in his Order to Show Cause, the AJ instructed the parties to submit statements addressing why he should not dismiss the complaint as now amended, noting that an EEO hearing was not available in a mixed case complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.302(d)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a Memorandum and Order of Dismissal, dated October 2, 2001, the AJ found that complainant's response to the Show Cause Order merely addressed the merits of the 30-day suspension claim, and was not responsive to the procedural question at issue. Therefore, the AJ dismissed the complaint, as amended, finding that it was a mixed case complaint appealable to the MSPB, <span class="Italic">citing</span> to 29 C.F.R. 1614.107(a)(4); 1614.109(b); and 1614.302. Moreover, in addressing informal claims 2 and 3 above, which the AJ acknowledged were not appealable to the MSPB, the AJ advised the agency to request that the MSPB consolidate these claims should it assume jurisdiction of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its November 16, 2001 final action, the agency adopted and implemented the AJ's Order of Dismissal. The agency further advised complainant to raise her claims concerning the letter of reprimand and the 30-day suspension to the MSPB, providing pertinent appeal rights. Complainant was further advised to contact an EEO Counselor within 45-days of her receipt of the final action in order to pursue claims 2 and 3 above. Finally, the agency provided complainant with appeal rights to this Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her appeal statement, complainant indicated that after she had no success contacting a local EEO Counselor, she telephonically contacted an EEO Counselor in another city, who advised her to fax her three informal EEO claims. Also, complainant contends that in responding to her inquiry about combining these claims with her pending formal complaint, this EEO Counselor advised her to submit this request to the AJ. Complainant indicates that she heard no more from the EEO Counselor after this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, in making reference to the footnote contained in the agency's response to the AJ's Order to Show Cause, which reflects the agency's determination that complainant's request for consolidation "strongly suggests that complainant waived her right to counseling," complainant argues that she never intended to waive this right. Instead, complainant avers that she thought that requesting consolidation would serve to expedite the processing of the three new claims, and that the AJ would either postpone the hearing until EEO counseling was completed; or that the EEO counseling would take place concurrently with the hearing procedure. Complainant further contends that until the AJ provided an explanation regarding mixed case complaints at the settlement conference, she had no knowledge of MSPB jurisdiction, and at that point had no recourse to stop the dismissal of her complaint. Complainant maintains that she was "dumbfounded" at the result of her request for consolidation, and argues that had she had the benefit of EEO counseling, she could have avoided dismissal of all of her claims. Complainant argues that she was effectively denied EEO counseling on her three new claims, and asks that all determinations herein be set aside until she has been afforded the benefit of EEO counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. 1614.106(d) provides that a complainant may amend a complaint, prior to the conclusion of the investigation, to include "issues or claims like or related to those raised in the complaint." A later claim or complaint is "like or related" to the oriGINAl complaint if the later claim or complaint adds to or clarifies the oriGINAl complaint and could have reasonably been expected to grow out of the oriGINAl complaint during the investigation<span class="Italic">. See Scher v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940702 (May 30, 1995). There is no requirement that the amendment be subject to counseling. In the event that a new incident of discrimination is not like or related to the oriGINAl complaint, EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. 1614.606 provides that the complaints be consolidated. However, such a complaint is subject to the counseling requirements of 29 C.F.R. 1614.105.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that the AJ improperly amended complainant's pending complaint. Specifically, we find that the AJ erred in determining that complainant's three informal claims were "like or related" to her pending complaint concerning the February 2000 letter of reprimand. First, although the AJ found that all of these actions were undertaken by the same management officials, we find that the record lacks evidence to demonstrate this common identity. Second, we find that the approximately 18-month time interval between the February 2000 letter of reprimand and the incidents raised in the three informal claims, with no evidence of intervening adverse actions of a similar nature to form a nexus, further suggests that these matters are not "like or related." Third, even though the letter of reprimand and the 30-day suspension both concerned complainant's on-the-job conduct, they were based on completely unrelated and dissimilar circumstances. The letter of reprimand concerned a verbal disagreement about an office move at a staff meeting, and the 30-day suspension concerned a physical altercation with a co-worker. Fourth, we find no similarity between the letter of reprimand and the nondisciplinary incidents referenced in informal claims 2 and 3. Therefore, notwithstanding complainant's claim that these incidents demonstrate a pattern of discrimination and harassment, we find that they are not sufficiently similar to be considered "like or related" so as to warrant amending complainant's pending complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, we find that the AJ should have denied complainant's request for a complaint amendment, and returned the three informal claims to the agency with instructions to continue EEO counseling, and to provide complainant with an explanation of her MSPB rights regarding the 30-day suspension claim, as well as the mixed case complaint procedures involved in pursuing that claim. Additionally, the AJ should have also instructed the agency to advise complainant regarding the effect of her previously filing a union grievance about the 30-day suspension, and further informed her about the possibility of consolidating the complaints for adjudication, as appropriate. The AJ should have also retained the pending complaint on the letter of reprimand for a hearing, and continued processing that complaint at the hearing stage.</p>
