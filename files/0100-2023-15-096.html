<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-96"><span class="space">8.</span> Selection Cases</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a selection case, to avoid summary judgment, the complainant is not required to demonstrate that his qualifications are plainly superior to those of the selectee. It is sufficient if the complainant raises factual questions about the agency's proffered reason for selecting the successful candidate. In <span class="Italic">Khalil v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05A01122 (2001), the Commission reversed the summary judgment decision of its administrative judge, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In granting the agency's motion for a decision without a hearing, the AJ <span id="Page_482"></span>found that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, but ultimately concluded that he failed to prove that the agency's articulated reasons for not selecting him were pretexts for discrimination. In particular, the AJ held that, in order to show pretext, complainant had to demonstrate that his qualifications were plainly superior to those of the selectees. We disagree. The fact that complainant's qualifications were not plainly superior to those of the selectees does not mean that complainant failed to establish the essential elements of his case. An inference of discriminatory motivation may be raised by any circumstances which suggest that unlawful considerations played a role in the selection process<span class="Italic">. See e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</span> ____U.S.____, 120 S. Ct. 2097 (2000); <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</span> 509 U.S. 502, 511, 519 (1993); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span> (April 12, 1994); <span class="Italic">Pavelka v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950351 (December 14, 1995); <span class="Italic">Huerta v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05930802 (April 1, 1994). Such circumstances, if left unexplained, would preclude summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One of complainant's co-workers stated in a sworn affidavit that complainant, "does a superior job and is superior to those who were selected in that he had more experience than either of them." This individual further stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I know both of the men who were selected for the jobs and I have worked with them. One of them [the compliance officer selectee] never worked in the cargo unit before, so I do believe he has no experience at all in cargo. The other [operations desk selectee], is good, but [complainant] had more experience and more knowledge about the job than him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not include any affidavits, sworn statements, or documents which contradict this witness's statement, or which undermine his credibility as a witness. While this alone would not preclude a finding of summary judgment, there are other factors which, when read together with the coworker's assessment, do raise genuine issues of material fact as to whether the selectees were really the best-qualified candidates for these quarantine officer positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin with, the record indicates that complainant and the two selectees were all highly qualified for both positions. The SO acknowledged as much, expressing regret that complainant did not get a position, and that a third position was not available for him. In addition, ranking process used by RO1 and RO2 to evaluate the candidates was highly subjective. While the use of subjective standards is not discriminatory<span class="Italic"> per se</span>, the absence from the record of any notes or paperwork indicating how they determined the candidates' scores and rankings raises questions about the reliability of the rating and ranking process. This is particularly true in the case of the operations desk position, since complainant and the selectee both had the same performance appraisal rating of, "superior." Moreover, complainant appears to have had the edge in education with respect to the operations desk position. Not only did he have a bachelor of science degree in agriculture, he also had taken graduate level courses in food technology and biochemistry. By contrast, the selectee had attained two associate degrees, one in criminal justice, and the other in ornamental horticulture. In terms of educational preparation, complainant not only attained a higher level of education than the selectee, but his degree program and graduate courses appear to be more relevant to the duties of the desk officer position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When viewed in conjunction with one another, these facts make it clear that complainant did not fail to present the essential elements of his case, and that unresolved questions of credibility need to be addressed before a final judgment can be rendered thereon. These credibility questions can best be resolved at a hearing, where witnesses can be observed, and their demeanor assessed. This case was therefore not ripe for summary judgment. To the extent that the previous decision found it so, that decision constitutes a clearly erroneous interpretation of law.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant is not required to prove that the agency's reason for his nonselection is pretextual. He only is required to raise an issue of fact with regard to the agency's reasons. That issue of fact can come from the respective qualifications of the candidate. As the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Bignall-Kreckel v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01984132 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because complainant failed to show that the SO's reason for choosing the selectee was a pretext for age discrimination. While this may be complainant's ultimate burden of proof on the merits of his case, it is not his burden with respect to surviving a motion for summary judgment. After reviewing the record, we find not only that material facts are in dispute, but also that there is an issue of credibility regarding SO's assessment of the candidates. We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, the position description for the commercial sponsorship specialist does not explicitly mention sales experience or contacts as qualifying criteria. Rather, the requirements for the position are described in more general terms: three years of specialized experience in business, event management, and analysis practices; a bachelor's degree in marketing, public relations, business administration or a related field; and ability to determine, develop, and execute short and long-range planning budget requirement, coordinate multidimensional solicitations, interpret laws and directives, analyze problems and devise solutions, plan and organize work, give sales presentations and briefings, and otherwise communicate effectively both orally and in writing. IR 95-100. Second, the selectee's description of his experience is only one page long, hand-written, and devoid of explanatory detail. IR 106. By contrast, complainant's description of his experience is twelve pages long, single-spaced typed, and extremely detailed. IR 115-127. Third, complainant submitted a four-page narrative statement describing his qualifications in terms of the requirements of the position, while the selectee did not. IR 138-41. Fourth, although the selectee met the educational requirements of a bachelor's degree in business administration, complainant had taken graduate-level courses in business administration and management. IR 107-08, 128.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, including complainant's arguments on appeal, the agency's response, and arguments and evidence not specifically discussed in this decision, the Commission finds that this case is not appropriate for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the factual dispute can come from inconsistencies in the agency's explanation of its actions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10581 (2001), the Commission found the administrative judge erred in determining there was no genuine factual dispute where the explanations of the two agency officials involved in the decision to rehire the complainant were at variance with each other. However, in an interesting turn, the Commission held that an agency official's admittance that she initially gave the complainant a false explanation for her nonselection did not create a genuine issue of material fact. <span class="Italic">Juanita K. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120143236 (2016). The agency official in <span class="Italic">Juanita K</span>. cited staffing issues when asked by the complainant why she had not been reappointed to her position. The complainant appealed the administrative judge's grant of summary judgment, arguing that the agency created a genuine issue of material fact when it gave a different answer for its failure to reappoint her. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Juanita K</span>. disagreed, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, according to the Agency, Complainant was not reappointed because Complainant exhibited conduct which was not "conducive" to the workplace, including communicating with coworkers in a tone that was "rude and demanding" and "threatening." This is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the Agency's action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an effort to identify a genuine issue of material fact, Complainant points out that when she asked why she had not been reappointed, her supervisor initially stated that "staffing needs" made reductions in force necessary, never mentioning any problem with Complainant's conduct. As Complainant characterizes it, her supervisor's explanation was "inconsistent with the rationale she latter supplied to allegedly support the non-reappointment." The Agency acknowledges that its initial explanation for its action was false. It explains that the Agency official who gave this explanation was not candid about the true reasons for not reappointing Complainant because she wished to avoid a confrontation with Complainant. Complainant argues that the inconsistency between the Agency's first explanation and what it now claims is the true reason for its action creates a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's position is not well taken. The fact that the Agency initially gave a false explanation does not necessarily provide support for a finding of discriminatory animus. As the Supreme Court observed in <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc</span>., 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000) "[i]f the circumstances show that the defendant gave the false explanation to conceal something other than discrimination, the inference of discrimination will be weak or nonexistent" (internal citations omitted). Here, the only evidence as to motivation shows that the Agency gave a false explanation in an effort to avoid a confrontation with Complainant, whom Complainant's colleagues regarded as rude, demanding and threatening. The inference of discrimination is nonexistent. No genuine issue of material fact requiring a hearing is presented.</p>
<p class="noindent">An issue of material fact can be created in a selection case where the qualifications of the complainant are "observably superior" to those of the selectee. For example, in <span class="Italic">Delmage v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A15329 (2002), the Commission reversed a summary judgment decision in favor of the agency where the complainant, an applicant for a GS-5 police officer position, was a retired police captain with 24 years of previous experience, had commanded every major uniformed division in a large police department, and had some 40 certifications in various areas of law enforcement technology. The report of investigation contained little information about the selectees other than that they were ages 28 and 33, respectively. Under those circumstances, the Commission found the qualifications of the complainant created a material dispute of fact with respect to the issue of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, complainants sometimes maintain that discrimination is the only possible reason for the agency's actions. Such arguments rarely win the day. <span id="Page_483"></span>That is what happened in Harry E. v. Secretary of Homeland Security, 2021004786 (2022)--a nonselection case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations allow an AJ to grant summary judgment when he or she finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). An issue of fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable fact finder could find in favor of the non-moving party. Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1988). A fact is "material" if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the case. In rendering this appellate decision, we must scrutinize the AJ's legal and factual conclusions, and the Agency's final order adopting them, de novo. See 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(a)(stating that a "decision on an appeal from an Agency's final action shall be based on a de novo review."); see also Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110), at Chap. 9, &#x00A7; VI.B. (as revised, August 5, 2015) (providing that an administrative judge's determination to issue a decision without a hearing, and the decision itself, will both be reviewed de novo).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to successfully oppose a decision by summary judgment, a complainant must identify, with specificity, facts in dispute either within the record or by producing further supporting evidence and must further establish that such facts are material under applicable law. Such a dispute would indicate that a hearing is necessary to produce evidence to support a finding that the agency was motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To warrant a hearing on his disparate treatment claim, Complainant must raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the three-part evidentiary scheme fashioned by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). His first step would generally be to establish a prima facie case by demonstrating that he was subjected to an adverse employment action under circumstances that would support an inference of discrimination. Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978). The prima facie inquiry may be dispensed in this case, however, since the selecting official (SO) articulated a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting Complainant. See U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 713-17 (1983). The SO averred that although Complainant had met the minimum qualifications under both vacancy announcements, his application package indicated that he did not possess the expert-level experience in performing audits and quality reviews of human capital programs that she was looking for.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To move forward with a hearing, Complainant must also raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the SO's explanation for not selecting Complainant is a pretext for discrimination. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993); Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981). Questions of pretext can be raised by showing such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the Agency's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence. Opare-Addo v. U.S. Postal Serv., EEOC Appeal No. 0120060802 (Nov. 20, 2007), req. for reconsid. den'd EEOC Request No. 0520080211 (May 30, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In non-selection cases, Complainant could demonstrate pretext by showing that his qualifications for the position were plainly superior to those of the two selectees. Hung P. v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141721 (Dec. 3, 2015). We note that agencies have broad discretion to choose among equally qualified candidates as long as the selection is not based on unlawful considerations. Lashawna L. v. Evtl. Prot. Agency, EEOC Appeal No. 2019000124 (Mar. 8, 2019). They may select candidates with fewer years of experience if they believe that such candidates are best qualified to meet the needs of the organization. Barney G. v. Dep't of Agric., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172111 (Nov. 29, 2018). They may even preselect a candidate as long as the preselection is not premised upon a prohibited basis. Michael R. v. Dep't of Agric., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172112 (Nov. 29, 2018). The Commission cannot second-guess such personnel decisions unless there is evidence of a discriminatory motivation on the part of the officials responsible for making those decisions. Burdine, supra, 450 U.S. at 259.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter, the application is a self-assessment for which an applicant can receive a maximum score of 100. Although Complainant scored 93 and 98 on the self-assessments for the two vacancies, the SO, a Human Resources Supervisor and a Human Resources Specialist who were involved with the process all affirmed that Complainant's application package did not support his self-assessment. We therefore find, as did the AJ, that Complainant has not shown that his qualifications were plainly superior to those of the selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other indicators of pretext include discriminatory statements or past personal treatment attributable to those responsible for the personnel action that led to the filing of the complaint, comparative or statistical data revealing differences in treatment across various protected-group lines, unequal application of Agency policy, deviations from standard procedures without explanation or justification, or inadequately explained inconsistencies in the evidentiary record. Mellissa F. v. U.S. Postal Serv., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141697 (Nov. 12, 2015). When asked by the EEO investigator to explain why his race, national origin, or age were factors in the SO's decision not to select him for either vacancy, Complainant replied that he did not see any other reason for the SO's decisions, that there were no Asian Americans in his work unit, and he was older than the two selectees. Complainant has presented neither affidavits, declarations, or unsworn statements from witness other than himself nor documents which contradict or undercut the SO's explanation for not selecting him or which cast doubt upon the SO's truthfulness as a witness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, we agree with the AJ that Complainant failed to establish the existence of an evidentiary dispute sufficient to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact. Even construing any inferences raised by the undisputed facts in favor of Complainant, a reasonable fact-finder could not find in Complainant's favor. Therefore, upon careful review of the AJ's decision and the evidence of record, as well as the parties' arguments on appeal, we conclude that the AJ correctly determined that the preponderance of the evidence did not establish that Complainant was discriminated against by the Agency as alleged. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the Agency's final order adopting the AJ's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant's argument that his qualifications are plainly superior to those of the selectee does not create a material issue of fact where the agency contends the selection was made on the basis of seniority. <span class="Italic">Couture v. Social Security Administration</span>, 05A20017 (2002); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Roy F. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120141821 (2016) (no material issue of fact where the agency noted selectees' seniority as the reason for complainant's nonselection despite complainant having been rated higher by the rating panel and having a higher education).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, where the selecting official provided no information in his affidavit about the criteria used for the selection, the complainant's argument that his qualifications were observably superior was sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The "complainant was precluded from establishing pretext in any manner other than asserting, generally, that he was observably more qualified." <span class="Italic">Fullman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A06044 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Summary judgment is appropriate where, for example, there is no dispute that the complainant did not have the requisite experience for the job. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Alexandria P. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120182199 (2020):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the Agency's motion for a decision without a hearing shows that the Agency contended that it had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not selecting Complainant for the position of Administrative/Technical Specialist. Specifically, the Agency contended that Complainant's nonselection was due to her lack of relevant experience in the pre-award contracting process. The Agency also cited Complainant's poor interview performance, where she allegedly "bashed" management and failed to respond to some of the interview questions, as another reason for her nonselection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argued that such reasons were pretext for discrimination and that there were genuine issues of material fact to warrant a hearing. In this regard, Complainant strongly disputed the Agency's contention that she "bashed" management during the interview and failed to respond to some interview questions. To the contrary, Complainant asserted that she responded to all questions in a positive fashion and demonstrated that she could fulfill the duties required for the position. Complainant emphasized that evidence of discriminatory motive could be inferred by the fact that no Hispanic Contract Specialist has received a promotion above the GS-12 level since 1990. Complainant further contended that the selecting official's comment about her mother-in-law created a question as to whether age played a role in the hiring process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the AJ's decision to grant the Agency's motion for a decision without a hearing, we must draw all justifiable inferences in Complainant's favor. Nevertheless, we find that the AJ correctly determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact or credibility that merited a hearing. Specifically, we find that the undisputed facts fully support the AJ's determination that the responsible management officials had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not hiring Complainant for the position of Administrative/Technical Specialist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, our review of the report of investigation reveals that the selecting official for the position (also a member of the interview panel) had concerns regarding Complainant's lack of relevant experience in the pre-award contracting process. While we recognize that subjective criteria in the hiring process may offer a convenient pretext, the record in this case shows that the Agency identified relevant competencies for the position and asked all candidates the same questions to assess their ability to perform in each competency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the selectees, Complainant did not have the requisite pre-award contracting experience, as Complainant's own admission reveals that her work within the last few years was in the close-out portion of the contracting process, and she did not participate in the pre-award process. <span id="Page_484"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> ROI, pgs. 19 and 94.5 The selectees, on the other hand, had extensive demonstrated contracting experience in the pre-award contracting process, along with technical backgrounds. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 124.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we acknowledge that Complainant vehemently disputes the Agency's articulated reasons, in addressing an AJ's issuance of a decision without a hearing, a complainant's opposition must consist of more than mere unsupported allegations or denials and must be supported by affidavits or other competent evidence setting forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Celotex</span>, 477 U.S. at 324. We find that Complainant has failed to do so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that there is a dispute as to whether Complainant "bashed" management during the interview and failed to answer some of the interview questions, we find that these matters are not material because the record clearly shows that Complainant did not have the requisite pre-award contracting experience. As for the selecting official's comment comparing Complainant to the selecting official's mother-in-law, even assuming such comment was made, we find insufficient evidence to infer discriminatory motive. We also find the positive feedback from a member of the interview panel to be insufficient to demonstrate pretext. Based on the totality of the record, we conclude that Complainant has failed to fulfill her burden of showing that the Agency's articulated reasons were pretext for discrimination.</p>
