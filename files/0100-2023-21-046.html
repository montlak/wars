<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-43"><span class="space">13.</span> Passage of Time Between Incidents</h4>
<p class="noindent">One issue that can arise in hostile environment cases is whether the passage of time between incidents essentially breaks the required continuity for a claim of harassment. Because of the sliding scale of severity and frequency, the answer depends both on the nature of the incidents and the period of time between incidents. In <span class="Italic">Scherman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A44024 (2006), the Commission found that the passage of little more than a year between kissing incidents did not break the continuity of the claim. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Scherman</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that because there were several months between the hotel room incident in September 2000 and the kiss in May 2001 during which no egregious act of harassment took place that SVP's behavior was not continuous. The agency, however, ignores complainant's allegation that SVP continued to invite her out for drinks over this time period and that she felt the need constantly to avoid him. We find, therefore, that all the alleged incidents are part of the same unlawful employment practice alleged in a timely fashion.[1]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, complainant produced evidence that, when viewed in a light most favorable to the complainant, supports a finding of sexual harassment. Complainant is a woman who was allegedly subjected to sexual advances by an agency official, SVP. SVP's conduct, furthermore, rises to a level sufficient to create a hostile work environment actionable under Title VII because he touched her repeatedly in a sexual manner without her permission and after she told him to stop, including putting his arm around her, touching his body against hers, kissing her on more than one occasion, and making verbal advancements of a sexual nature. <span class="Italic">Copsey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912674 (1991) (finding a hostile work environment where complainant's supervisor touched her twice against her will and verbally harassed her). SVP's conduct was objectively hostile, <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record also reveals that complainant found it subjectively objectionable as she tried to avoid SVP, went on extended sick leave, and was negatively affected physically and psychologically. The agency is liable for the official's conduct because he was complainant's direct superior. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999) ("Vicarious Liability Guidance"), at 4 (citing <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 2270 (1998), and <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 2292-93 (1998)). The agency, moreover, cannot offer an affirmative defense because the harassment culminated in a tangible employment action, SVP's assignment of complainant as his personal secretary. <span class="Italic">See Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742; <span class="Italic">see also Faragher,</span> 524 U.S. 775.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;We note, furthermore, that even if there had been a lapse in SVP's alleged conduct between September 2000 and May 2001 it would not sever the violation for the purposes of timeliness because the incidents are related. <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. at 118. A time lapse does not itself sever a violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Four incidents, in a two-and-a-half year period, leading to allegations that management failed to prevent the complainant's exposure to references to sexual preferences in an email, a survey and training, were of "minor consequence" to his work environment and lacked the requisite pervasiveness or severity necessary to alter the conditions of his employment in <span class="Italic">Ike D. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120160980 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent">The time between incidents of alleged harassment and whether the effects of past harassment have dissipated when new incidents of harassment occur are factors that can be determinative of whether a hostile environment exists. In <span class="Italic">Konstantopoulos v. Westvaco Corp</span>., 112 F.3d 710 (3rd Cir. 1997), the court found there was no hostile work environment where the employee was subjected to harassment from April to August of 1989 and was not subjected to further harassment until April 1990. In the interim, the employee left the workplace only to be rehired. The appeals court rejected the plaintiff's argument that the district court erred by considering the 1990 incidents in isolation in <span class="Italic">Konstantopoulos</span>, 112 F.3d at 715-17, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the district court expressly stated that it had examined the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> Dist. Op. at 30, 34. Konstantopoulos argues, however, that the court merely "paid lip service" to this principle and "then treated the incident of April 19, 1990 in isolation." Appellants' Br. at 22. In making this argument, Konstantopoulos focuses on the court's statement that the events of April 1990 were "'sufficiently removed in time to be considered independently from those occurring in 1989 and, considered independently, were neither severe nor pervasive enough to have created a hostile work environment.'" Appellants' Br. at 19 (quoting Dist. Op. at 35-36) (emphasis added in appellants' brief). We <span id="Page_842"></span>do not believe that Konstantopoulos has fairly interpreted the district court's opinion. A fairer interpretation, in our view, is that the district court found that the effects of the harassment that occurred from April through August 1989 had dissipated by the time that Konstantopoulos returned to work in April 1990; that, therefore, without any new incidents of harassment, there would be no basis for concluding that the working environment in April 1990 was hostile or abusive; and that the few incidents that occurred when Konstantopoulos returned were not sufficiently numerous or severe to warrant the conclusion that the working environment remained hostile or abusive. We see no error in this mode of analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we conclude, based on our own examination of the record, that Konstantopoulos was not subjected to a hostile or abusive working environment when she returned to work in April 1990. Like the district court, we find several factors that support this conclusion. First, the passage of nearly seven months between the end of Konstantopoulos's first period of employment and the beginning of the second is significant. This hiatus provided an opportunity for the lingering effects of the prior incidents to dissipate. Second, as the district court noted, after leaving work for medical reasons in August 1989, Konstantopoulos herself stated that she was ready, willing, and able to return to work by October 1989 "and continued to so affirm through April 25, 1990," when she eventually returned. 6/30/94 Dist. Ct. Op. at 35. Thus, Konstantopoulos's conduct suggests that, in her mind, the effects of the prior incidents had dissipated well before she actually returned to work. Third, the nature of the incidents that took place when Konstantopoulos returned is important. Although we can well understand why Konstantopoulos would be troubled by the mute gestures made by Marshall and Peterman--squinting their eyes and shaking their fists--this incident cannot in itself be characterized as particularly severe. Moreover, the only other incident cited by Konstantopoulos--the throwing away of her lunch--seems minor, since it is not clear that Konstantopoulos's name was on the bag, and the offending co-worker stated that he had thrown it away accidentally. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 19. Fourth, it is apparent that Westvaco sought to prevent any harassment of Konstantopoulos when she returned to work and provided procedures by which any improper conduct by co-workers could have been remedied. As previously noted, foreman Larry Cahall warned the crew that he would not tolerate any harassment of Konstantopoulos and assured her that he would be available in his office if she needed him. He also made frequent, unannounced visits to the Web Department and "spent more time than he normally would in the area." 6/30/94 Dist. Ct. Op. at 18. Konstantopoulos, however, made no complaints to Cahall either during or after her shift, and when she returned to work the next day with a physician's note stating that she had been advised to stay off work for six to eight weeks, she commented: "Am I fired?" All of these factors seem to us to suggest that Konstantopoulos was not subjected to hostile or abusive environment when she returned to work in April 1990.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, there are factors that point in the opposite direction. One of these is the severity of the conduct of her co-workers during the period from April through August 1989. Although the district court observed that "one can find examples of conduct more severe than that evidenced of record," the court added that there was "essentially undisputed" evidence that Konstantopoulos was subjected to "some physically threatening and/or humiliating discriminatory conduct." Another similar factor is Konstantopoulos's assignment to work under circumstances that ensured that she would encounter the co-workers responsible for the prior harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not, however, agree with Konstantopoulos that her argument is substantially supported by her assignment to work under foremen Hurley and Cahall. We recognize that the prior incidents of abuse by co-workers occurred while Konstantopoulos was working under the supervision of these men, but Konstantopoulos did not report any of the most serious incidents to anyone from Westvaco at the time when they occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> 6/30/94 Dist. Ct. Op. at 7, 10. Moreover, when Konstantopoulos briefly worked under Hurley's supervision in April 1990, no alleged acts of sexual harassment occurred, and when she was again assigned to work under Cahall's supervision, he took pains to prevent the recurrence of such abuse. Viewing all of the evidence bearing on Konstantopoulos's working environment in April 1990, including all of the events that took place during her prior period of employment, we agree with the district court that she was not subjected to a hostile working environment in April 1990.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court in <span class="Italic">Konstantopoulos</span>, 112 F.3d at 717-18, also rejected an argument by the plaintiff that it was <span class="Italic">per se</span> discrimination to return her to work in the same area with her alleged harassers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Konstantopoulos argues that requiring her "to [w]ork [w]ith [t]he [v]ery [e]mployees [w]ho [h]ad [s]exually [h]arassed [h]er [s]even [m]onths [b]efore [c]onstituted [a]dditional [s]exual [h]arassment." To the extent that Konstantopoulos is simply arguing that her assignment in April 1990 to work in proximity to Marshall and Peterman is a factor that must be considered in determining whether she was subjected to a hostile or abusive working environment at that time, we readily agree. As we believe we have already made clear, we view this as a significant factor weighing in her favor, but after examining the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that her reassignment to the Web Department and her encounter with Marshall and Peterman are insufficient to justify the conclusion that she was subjected to a hostile working environment when she returned to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that Konstantopoulos goes further and suggests that requiring her to work in proximity to Marshall and Peterman constituted illegal sexual harassment <span class="Italic">per se</span>, we disagree. As prior decisions of the Supreme Court and our court make clear, the proper test is whether, under all the circumstances, a reasonable person would find the working environment to be hostile or abusive. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 23; <span class="Italic">West</span>, 45 F.3d at 756; <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1486. We therefore see no justification for adopting the <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that Konstantopoulos seems to advocate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor do we believe that <span class="Italic">Cortes v. Maxus Exploration Co</span>., 977 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1992), or <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872 (9th Cir. 1991), on which Konstantopoulos relies, supports such a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule. In <span class="Italic">Cortes</span>, an employee, Cortes, was subjected to severe and persistent sexual harassment by her immediate supervisor, Acero. <span class="Italic">See</span> 977 F.2d at 197-98. Although Cortes complained about this harassment to her employer's human resources manager, he did nothing to rectify the situation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Eventually, Cortes was transferred to another department, but Acero continued to harass her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Cortes again complained to the human resources manager, but he dismissed her complaints. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Eventually, Cortes was informed that she would have to work under Acero's immediate supervision or resign. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although she told the human resources manager that she was afraid to work for Acero, the human resources manager replied that there was nothing that he could do. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Faced with this record, the Fifth Circuit sustained the district court's finding that the employer, Maxus, had subjected Cortes to a hostile or abusive environment. The court wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Even in light of the strong evidence that Acero had sexually harassed Cortes when she was under his supervision and that when given the opportunity, he had continued to do so even after she was transferred out of his department, Maxus transferred Cortes to this sexually abusive environment. When Cortes expressed her fears about accepting the transfer, Maxus refused to take any remedial measures to protect her.... We find no clear error in the district court's conclusion that these acts amounted to sexual harassment within the meaning of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 199.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear to us that <span class="Italic">Cortes</span> does not stand for the proposition that it is always illegal for an employer to require a prior victim of sexual harassment to return to work in the company of co-workers responsible for the prior harassment. Rather, <span class="Italic">Cortes</span>, in our view, merely held that the employer in that case violated Title VII by requiring the employee to work in an environment where sexual harassment seemed almost certain and by refusing to take any remedial measures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Ellison</span> provides somewhat stronger support for Konstantopoulos's argument, but we do not interpret it as adopting a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule. In that case, a male IRS agent (Gray) persistently expressed a romantic interest in a female agent (Ellison), who did not reciprocate his sentiments and found his conduct to be "weird[ ]," "crazy" and "frighten[ing]." <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 924 F.2d at 874. After Ellison complained to their supervisor, Gray was temporarily transferred from the San Mateo, California, office to the San Francisco office, but he was permitted to return to San Mateo six months later. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 874. The Ninth Circuit held that "Gray's conduct, as alleged by Ellison, was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of Ellison's employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 876. Turning to the question whether the Treasury Department had taken sufficient remedial action to shield it from liability under Title VII, the Ninth Circuit concluded that it was unable to determine based on "the scant record" before it "whether a reasonable woman could conclude that Gray's mere presence at San Mateo six months after the alleged harassment would create an abusive environment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 883. The court stated that it did not "know how often Ellison and Gray would have to interact at San Mateo" and added that "the facts concerning the government's decision to return Gray to San Mateo" warranted further exploration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not interpret <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> as adopting a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule. Rather, the court merely held that, based on the facts in the record, it was unable to determine whether the employer's decision to permit the harasser to return to the same office as the victim created an environment that violated Title VII. We recognize that the <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> court stated that it believe that "in some cases the mere presence of an employee who has engaged in particularly severe or pervasive harassment can create a hostile working environment." 924 F.2d at 883. Even this statement, however, does not <span id="Page_843"></span>endorse a blanket rule. Rather, it merely states that in some cases (i.e., those involving "particularly severe or pervasive harassment") the mere presence of the harasser "can" be enough to create a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, having considered the totality of the circumstances, we agree with the district court that, although Konstantopoulos was subjected to a hostile and abusive working environment during her first period of employment with Westvaco, she was not subjected to such an environment during her brief second period of employment.</p>
