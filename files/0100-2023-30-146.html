<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-137"><span class="space">f.</span> $25,001-$30,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">In a hostile environment racial harassment case, each complainant was awarded $30,000 in compensatory damages in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972555 (1999). One complainant suffered from depression and was treated by two psychiatrists and both complainants suffered from anxiety and weight gain, as well as other emotional distress. In reducing the awards of the administrative judge from $50,000 for one complainant and $65,000 for the other, the Commission placed considerable emphasis on the fact that both complainants testified at the hearing that their conditions had improved since the harassment ended.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Carriker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04962 (2002), the Commission awarded $30,000 in damages where the complainant had previously been treated for stress and was suffering from family stress at the time she was subjected to racial harassment. In a case that invoked both the preexisting injury and other causes doctrines, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Carriker</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.,</span> 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987). The Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a complainant has a pre-existing condition, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. Second, if the complainant's pre-existing condition inevitably would have worsened, the agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination; the burden of proof being on the agency to establish the extent of this entitlement<span class="Italic">. Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (citing <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States,</span> 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997). The Commission notes, <span id="Page_1857"></span>however, that complainant is entitled to recover damages only for injury, or additional injury, caused by the discriminatory action. Guidance at 12; <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department. of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Non-pecuniary damages are available to compensate the injured party for actual harm, even where the harm is intangible<span class="Italic">. Carter v. Duncan-Higgins, Ltd.,</span> 727 F.2d 1225 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Emotional harm will not be presumed simply because the complainant is a victim of discrimination. Guidance at 5. The existence, nature, and severity of emotional harm must be proved<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The method for computing non-pecuniary damages should typically be based on a consideration of the severity and duration of harm<span class="Italic">. Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995); Guidance at 8. We note that for a proper award of non-pecuniary damages, the amount of the award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Ward-Jenkins v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted a statement dated November 1999 in support of her claim for non-pecuniary damages. She stated that she experienced severe emotional problems as a result of the racial harassment to which she was subjected at the agency. She took leave from the agency in March 1999 and the record does not indicate whether she has ever resumed employment. She first began to see a psychiatrist in May 1999 and was still seeing him when she submitted the November 1999 statement. Complainant stated that the psychiatrist diagnosed her with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder directly caused by the racial slurs and harassment and prescribed her medication. Complainant states that she experiences insomnia, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, feelings of helplessness, irritability, and fear of being followed by those who harassed her. Complainant also states that she has experienced significant hair loss which a dermatologist attributed to her stress and anxiety. Complainant stated that until March 1999, she had worked continuously since she was thirteen years old. As a result of not working, she experienced financial trouble and incurred debt. Complainant stated that she did not have a history of emotional problems with the exception of having seen a therapist between 1991 and 1992 for stress. There is evidence in the record that complainant, at the time of racial harassment established herein, was experiencing some stress related to her son's having moved in with his father and the resultant sense of loss she was experiencing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the foregoing evidence, we find that complainant is entitled to an award of non-pecuniary damages for her injuries in the amount of $30,000.00<span class="Italic">. See Jackson v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (April 15, 1999) (awarding $30,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages for complainant's emotional distress during a six-month period resulting from racial harassment). In the absence of specific evidence concerning the future duration of complainant's emotional suffering, this amount takes into account the severity and duration of her past suffering. The Commission further notes that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar</span>, 865 F.2d at 848.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $35,000 in compensatory damages by the administrative judge was reduced to $30,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Flythe v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01972258 (2000), where the EEOC found the judge improperly relied upon some pre-Act conduct in assessing damages. In <span class="Italic">Flythe</span>, the complainant was subject to a number of nonselections for a permanent position that ultimately resulted in his separation from the agency. In awarding damages, the Commission noted the conduct occurred over the course of a few years, but there was no evidence that the complainant continued to suffer emotional consequences of the agency's discrimination. The complainant's symptoms consisted of anger, pain, anxiety about finances, insomnia, irritability, crying, and some degree of weight gain. However, the Commission noted that the first nonselections of the complainant occurred before the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act and reduced the judge's award by $5,000. The complainant presented no medical evidence, but did offer the testimony of his wife and mother as to the effects of the discrimination, as well as testimony from his minister that he counseled the complainant because of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $15,000 was increased to $30,000 in <span class="Italic">Bains v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03585 (2003), where the complainant's termination aggravated a preexisting depression over the accidental death of her husband. The complainant testified that the removal sent her into a "tailspin" at a time when she was beginning to recover from her husband's death, caused her to constantly overeat, and that she had to borrow money from her family where previously she had been self-sufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission increased the agency's award of $4,500 to $30,000, in <span class="Italic">Marguerite W. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120142727 (2017), where the Commission described the agency's failure to provide the complainant with a requested computer monitor as an accommodation to her visual impairment for a period of about three months as "inherently degrading and humiliating." An additional award of $30,000 in damages was issued by the Commission in a case where the agency's discriminatory conduct aggravated a preexisting condition that was caused by the agency's previous discriminatory conduct. In <span class="Italic">Guajardo-Hartley v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A02073 (2003), did find, however, that a portion of the complainant's depression was caused by an on-the-job injury and the residual effects of that injury.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Riley v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30004 (2003), the Commission awarded $30,000 in damages to a victim of sexual harassment where the harassment led to the complainant being afraid to be alone with the supervisor and coworkers witnessed the complainant shaking at the prospect of being alone with the supervisor. The complainant also felt embarrassed, violated, frightened and angry, and experienced marital difficulties and nightmares.</p>
<p class="noindent">A victim of racial harassment was awarded $30,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40098_07A40108.txt">07A40108</a> (2004), where the complainant experienced humiliation in the workplace, mental stress and anguish, headaches and hair loss. She continued to experience these feelings when the agency denied her request to transfer to another location. <span class="Italic">Bryant</span>, along with its companion case, <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Attorney General, supra</span>, is also a good demonstration of the principals that a perpetrator of discrimination takes its victims as it finds them and compensatory damages are designed to remedy harm and not punish conduct. Although the complainant in <span class="Italic">Kelly</span> was subjected to precisely the same treatment as the complainant in <span class="Italic">Bryant</span>, the awards for damages were different based on the effects the harassment had on each complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Treese v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A33864.txt">01A33864</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $30,000 in damages where the complainant suffered from sleeplessness, sullenness, hopelessness, diminished interest in outside activities, suicidal ideation and fits of rage. The complainant was diagnosed with major depression and spent over a year in counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">A damage award of $95,000 by the administrative judge was reduced to $30,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Christmon v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50006.txt">07A50006</a> (2005). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Christmon</span> testified that after her termination she was forced to enroll in a homeless and food stamp program and also had to move to a crime and drug-infested neighborhood. She also testified that she suffered from depression, but submitted no medical evidence in support of her testimony. Although the Commission noted that medical evidence is not necessary to support a damage award, it noted that the lack of such evidence can affect the amount of an award.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $30,000 in damages where the harassment and subsequent retaliation left the complainant sad, frustrated and angry for a period of some three years. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A54981 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $30,000 in damages based on the testimony of the complainant which was corroborated in an unsworn statement provided by her mother. In <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720070049 (2008), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, contrary to the agency's decision, that complainant has established a nexus between the alleged harm and discrimination. At her hearing before the AJ, complainant testified to the fact that, following the agency's decision to give her a disciplinary downgrade her attitude changed about herself and she felt bad about her situation. Complainant's self-assessment was echoed in an unsworn statement provide by her mother in support of her claim for compensatory damages. Complainant's mother noted that the agency's action impacted on complainant's emotional distress, loss of self esteem, loss of confidence, and the loss of her home. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant established a nexus between the alleged harm and the discrimination and therefore, is entitled to an award of non-pecuniary damages. The Commission finds that the amount awarded by the AJ was AJ correctly awarded complainant $30,000 in compensatory damages, based on the evidence. As a result of the discrimination, complainant experienced increased stress, depression, crying episodes; she had to take stronger medication for acid reflux, had frequent headaches, was unable to pay her rent, lost her home, had to move in with her mother, and suffered from sleep problems. We find the evidence supports the compensatory damages finding and the amount is consistent with EEO cases with similar damages. Therefore, the finding will not be disturbed...</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency's discriminatory nonselection resulted in embarrassment, humiliation, severe headaches, long periods of crying, high blood pressure, and the complainant giving consideration to leaving the legal profession entirely, the Commission found an award of $30,000 was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Carter v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720080005 (2009), the Commission noted that the emotional distress also caused the complainant to take six weeks off from work and withdraw from family, friends, coworkers, and social and professional functions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $5,000 by the administrative judge was increased by the Commission to $30,000 in <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720070056 (2010). However, the Commission gives little explanation of the increased award noting simply that the work environment was abusive "and caused cruel and relentless torment" to the complainant on a daily basis. The Commission also <span id="Page_1858"></span>noted similar awards that it had made in cases of "retaliatory harassment." That comments seems out of place given that damage awards are to compensate the victim of discrimination and are based on cases involving similar harm. Because compensatory damages are not intended to punish the agency for its conduct, the type of discrimination causing the harm is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without much analysis, the Commission increased an award of $10,000 in damages by its administrative judge to $30,000 where the discrimination resulted in an exacerbation of the complainant's asthma which required treatment, he was diagnosed with hypertension and high blood pressure that he testified were aggravated by the discrimination, and he also testified that he suffered harm to his career and reputation and that his personal and family relationships suffered. <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120101559 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency award of $500 to $30,000 in damages where the complainant was subjected to sexual harassment in the form of a coworker reaching down the back of her pants and snapping her underwear, sticking his hand down the back of her shirt and commenting on how soft her skin was, rubbing her shoulders and touching her hair, and commenting about her panties and bras and how good she smelled. After the agency started its investigation of the conduct, the coworker told his supervisor that he had dreamed about hurting and killing women at the facility, which led to several women, including the complainant, to get a temporary restraining order. In <span class="Italic">Adams v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120112249 (2013), the agency awarded $500 contending that the complainant had not made a supplemental decision on damages. Although the complainant's attorney contended there had been such a submission, it was not in the record and not included with the appeal. However, the Commission found that the complainant's affidavit, in which she testified that she was shocked, embarrassed, and felt dirty and violated was sufficient to sustain the $30,000 award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complainant may have other stressors contributing to their distress. An agency's award of nonpecuniary damages should reflect the degree to which its discrimination caused harm to the complainant. In <span class="italic">Terrie M. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2021002279 (2022), for instance, the Commission found that the agency discriminated against the complainant based on her sex when it failed to promote her. The complainant requested $150,000 in compensatory damages citing to damage to her reputation, "constant extreme stress, feelings of inadequacy, hives, skin irritation, and poor sleep [and]...Adjustment Disorder, with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood." The agency awarded her $12,000, finding that "estrangement from her husband and the custody battle with her ex-husband, not the work situation, were the major causes of Complainant's stress and anxiety." Emphasizing that such a damages award must be based on the degree of causation, the Commission increased the award to $30,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonpecuniary losses are losses that are not subject to precise quantification, i.e., emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing, and loss of health. <span class="italic">See</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at 10. There is no precise formula for determining the amount of damages for nonpecuniary losses except that the award should reflect the nature and severity of the harm and the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="italic">See Loving v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01955789 (Aug. 29, 1997). The Commission notes that nonpecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy the harm caused by the discriminatory event rather than to punish the agency for the discriminatory action. Furthermore, compensatory damages should not be motivated by passion or prejudice or be "monstrously excessive" standing alone but should be consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence from a health care provider or other expert is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional harm. <span class="italic">See Lawrence v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (Apr. 18, 1996) (citing <span class="italic">Carle v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (Jan. 5, 1993)). Objective evidence of compensatory damages can include statements from Complainant concerning his emotional pain or suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character or reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other non-pecuniary losses that are incurred as a result of the discriminatory conduct. <span class="italic">Id</span>. A complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can suffice to sustain the burden for recovering compensatory damages for emotional harm. The more inherently degrading or humiliating the defendant's action is, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action. The absence of supporting evidence, however, may affect the amount of damages appropriate in specific cases. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Lawrence</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="italic">Wallis v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (Nov. 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co</span>., 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987)). Where a complainant has a preexisting condition, the Agency is only liable for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. <span class="italic">See Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the record contains sufficient evidence to establish that Complainant is entitled to nonpecuniary compensatory damages, we find that Complainant's requested amount of $150,000 is not supported by the record. However, we also find that the Agency's award of $12,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages was insufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that, as a result of the discrimination, her professional reputation was harmed, and the stress of her delayed promotion weighed on her for years. As a result of the discrimination, Complainant experienced constant, extreme stress, feelings of inadequacy, hives, skin irritation and poor sleep. Coworker-1 noted the importance of professional reputation in the Foreign Service and observed Complainant deal with anxiety, sleep difficulties, and relationship strain. Complainant's mother stated that Complainant, who had always been a high achiever, began to doubt herself, and the stress impacted all areas of her life. According to her mother, Complainant experienced anxiety, insomnia, hives, and hair loss.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant sought therapy for work and family stress, and Therapist-1 diagnosed her with Adjustment Disorder, with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. We disagree with the Agency's characterization of Therapist-1's letter. The Agency contends that Therapist-1 attributed Complainant's symptoms entirely to being separated from her husband and her ongoing custody battle. While the record reflects that Complainant had other stressors, we find that the evidence shows that the discrimination contributed to Complainant's emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we conclude that an award of $30,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages more appropriately compensates Complainant for the harm caused by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our award takes into account the duration and severity of the harm suffered and is neither "monstrously excessive" nor the produce of passion or prejudice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that this amount is more consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="italic">See Thaddeus G. v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019004733 (Sep. 29, 2020) ($30,000 for complainant who experienced emotional harm, damage to professional standing and reputation, increased anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and marital problems); <span class="italic">Roxane C. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120170899 (Dec. 29, 2017) ($35,000 for complainant who experienced stress that affected her marriage and felt ostracized at work after sex and pregnancy discrimination); <span class="italic">Kiara R. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120152620 (Aug. 10, 2017) ($25,000 for complainant who suffered sleep problems, headaches, anxiety, stress, and stopped socializing with friends).</p>
