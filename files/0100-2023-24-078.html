<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-59"><span class="space">H.</span> COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">In a number of cases involving reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, the Commission dealt with agency arguments that the required accommodation would violate the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. As noted below, the Commission's position in these cases has changed over the years. Unfortunately, the case law provides no bright-line rule on resolving conflicts between an agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation and its obligations under a collective bargaining agreement. However, the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 122 S. Ct. 1516 (2002)--a case involving seniority systems-has had an impact on how the Commission deals with such cases when an employee's right to reassignment as a reasonable accommodation conflicts with the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement on seniority. This situation is discussed below in the subsection under Reassignment, entitled "Collective Bargaining Agreements." Here, we discuss briefly the Commission's approach when proposed accommodations, other than reassignment, conflict with collective bargaining agreement provisions. The general rule is that an agency is not required to violate the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to provide reasonable accommodation. However, as further explained below, there are some exceptions to that rule.</p>
<p class="noindent">Initially, the Commission held that an agency and a union cannot "collectively bargain away the accommodation rights given handicapped employees under the Rehabilitation Act." <span class="Italic">White v. Postmaster General</span>, 05870481 (1988). The fact that the agency complied with the appropriate collective bargaining agreement provisions did not ensure that it fulfilled its obligation under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission strayed from this viewpoint and, in adopting Part 1614, made it clear that agencies were not required to offer accommodations that would place them in violation of collective bargaining agreements. The fact that the union complains that a possible accommodation may violate a collective bargaining agreement was not sufficient to demonstrate that such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency. The Commission noted that there was no actual evidence that the collective bargaining agreement would have been violated by the accommodation. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922440 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The ADA changed the Commission's position on the collective bargaining agreement defense to reasonable accommodation. The ADA, at 42 USC 12111(10), requires an employer and union to negotiate, in good faith, a variance to the agreement unless such a variance would constitute an undue hardship. The Commission's <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination," at pp. 841-42 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, an employer should determine if it could provide a reasonable accommodation that would remove the workplace barrier without violating the CBA. If no reasonable accommodation exists that avoids violating the CBA, then the ADA requires an employer and a union, as a collective bargaining representative, to negotiate in good faith a variance to the CBA so that the employer may provide a reasonable accommodation, except if the proposed accommodation unduly burdens the expectations of other workers (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, causes undue hardship). Undue hardship must be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine the extent to which the proposed accommodation would affect the expectations of other employees. Among the relevant factors to assess would be the duration and severity of any adverse effects caused by granting a variance and the number of employees whose employment opportunities would be affected by the variance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's former regulations, at 29 CFR 1614.203(g), exempted the Postal Service from reassignment efforts when such reassignment would conflict with a collective bargaining agreement and did not correctly state the ADA requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at p. 841, n.114; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Flores v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985619 (2001) (reminding the agency of its obligation to attempt to negotiate a variance with union when reasonable accommodation would violate collective bargaining agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Postal Service has generally defended cases involving claims of reasonable accommodation on two bases. First, the agency has contended that it has no permanent light duty positions, particularly in the carrier craft. Second, it has often contended that its contractual provisions prohibit it from accommodating a qualified individual with a disability. In <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Postmaster General</span>, 01940021 (1995), the Commission addressed both contentions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final issue, then, is whether appellant could have been reasonably accommodated, or put another way, whether it would have been an undue burden for the agency to restructure her job or reassign her to a different position for which she was qualified. In spite of the fact that this matter has already been remanded for supplemental investigation once, the agency has not provided any evidence whatsoever of undue burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, there is more than one acknowledgement on the record of the agency's complete failure to ever consider accommodating appellant's disability. Once the agency found out that appellant was not considered to have a work-related injury, the agency considered its responsibilities to appellant to be over. The Manager of Customer Services admitted that he believed that appellant had been accommodated merely by providing a limited duty assignment prior to the outcome of her workers' compensation claim. He further acknowledged his erroneous view that appellant had only two options, given her situation: to be declared fit-for-duty and return to her job or to apply for disability retirement. A third, vital option, mandated by federal law under the Rehabilitation Act was completely ignored by the agency: to fully assess appellant's medical condition, her job skills, the work environment, and the resources of the agency, and make a determination whether appellant could be reasonably accommodated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that there is evidence, although the agency never even considered the question, that appellant could have been reasonably accommodated. Physician I found appellant able to do light manual work or clerical duties, work that did not require lifting over thirty (30) pounds. Moreover, appellant's own sworn statements indicate that, early on, when she began to have problems with her back and believed she might not always be able to carry mail, she completed a supervisory course, took three years of typing, and learned several other areas of postal work. Further, and most important, after two investigations, the agency has still failed to come forward with any evidence that accommodating appellant's medical restrictions at the time in question would have been an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's contention that the collective bargaining agreement somehow dissolved its obligations to reasonably accommodate appellant is also misplaced. First, the agency has submitted portions of more than one collective bargaining agreement, without any evidence of which one applied to appellant, one of which states simply that "[i]n the rural carrier craft, at any local installation, regular rural routes shall not be considered for any light duty assignment." Assuming that this provision applies to appellant, it would be inappropriate to read "light duty assignment" to mean "reasonable accommodation." Also, reassigning appellant would not conflict with the provision in the agreement on light duty for rural routes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, then, we conclude that the agency has discriminated against appellant on the basis of disability, by completely failing to even consider the issue of reasonable accommodation and by failing to submit any evidence whatsoever related to undue burden.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission extended its position on good faith negotiations of contract exceptions for reasonable accommodation purposes to probationary employees. In <span class="Italic">Zarate v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00415 (2001), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the agency has not demonstrated that either of these accommodations would have posed an undue hardship. In particular, the agency contends that extending complainant's probationary period would have violated its CBA. However, an employer cannot claim that a reasonable accommodation imposes an undue hardship simply because it violates a CBA. Rather, if no reasonable accommodation exists that would not violate the CBA, then the employer and the union, as a collective bargaining representative, are required "negotiate in good faith a variance to the CBA so that the employer may provide a reasonable accommodation, except if the proposed accommodation unduly burdens the expectations of other workers (i.e. causes undue hardship)" Guidance at question 45. In the instant case, as noted above, S1 concedes that he neglected to follow up with anyone about the idea of extending complainant's probationary period, and thus made no attempt to obtain a variance to the CBA, and therefore the agency has not satisfied the applicable standard<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Williams v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0398 0121 (November 19, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that in numerous cases, Postal Service managers have, as here, concluded that a CBA prohibits a requested accommodation, and then failed to take any steps to negotiate a variance, thus violating the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, in many such instances, managers have incorrectly assumed that accommodation would violate a particular CBA, and because they never sought to negotiate a variance with union officials, they apparently never learned that the CBA did not in fact bar accommodation<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Purl v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971894 (September 12, 2000); <span class="Italic">Woodley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972665 (July 13, 2000); <span class="Italic">Williams v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01944389 (April 11, 1996). By the <span id="Page_1341"></span>time the agency's counsel or the Commission reviews the matter and management is directed to comply with the foregoing standards, it is long past the time when accommodation efforts should have commenced. An employer should respond expeditiously to a request for reasonable accommodation, and if the employer and the individual with a disability need to engage in an interactive process, this too should proceed as quickly as possible. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance at question 10 (citing examples). The agency should therefore ensure its managers understand that where the agency has obligations under both a CBA and the Rehabilitation Act, they are not mutually exclusive, and the "undue hardship" defense to providing reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act is not satisfied merely because of a provision in the CBA which bars the particular requested accommodation, since a variance may be available through negotiation. Managers must simultaneously satisfy the separate requirements imposed upon them by the Rehabilitation Act and the CBA by promptly utilizing the interactive process and the negotiation procedures referenced above.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Camp v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51024 (2006), the Commission found that the agency had not failed to accommodate the complainant where the collective bargaining agreement provided that as many fulltime employees as possible should have holidays off. Because of the provision, those employees who did work on holidays were required to do multiple jobs, which the complainant was unable to do because of his medical restrictions. The Commission determined that the agency was not required to create work on holidays for the complainant as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Jambora v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40128 (2006), the Commission rejected an argument that <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> precluded the agency from allowing the complainant to remain on the day shift as a reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has argued, citing to <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways v. Barnett,</span> 122 S. Ct. 1516 (2002), that even given complainant's diabetes-related medical need to remain on Tour II, the requested accommodation was "unreasonable" because to allow her to do so would violate the seniority provisions of Article 12 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (concerning excessing of employees). However, after careful review of the record in this case, we are not persuaded that allowing complainant to remain on Tour II would have resulted in a violation of the agency's seniority scheme.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the testimony of the "Manager of In-Plant Support," during the time at issue, complainant and all the other four distribution clerks at her pay location where excessed from Tour II to Tour I as part of a national initiative to eliminate day shift operations from the agency's processing and distribution plants. He testified that the goal was to move the entire manual distribution operation to Tour I. Record testimony provided by both agency and complainant witnesses attests that all of the manual distribution clerks from Tour II were excessed, and that the work they had performed on Tour II was being done by part-time flexible employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, because the record reflects that the agency abolished all of the day shift manual distribution clerk positions, allowing complainant to remain on Tour II would not have resulted in a situation where a more senior distribution clerk was "bumped" from a position on Tour II. This is because all of the distribution clerks were moved to Tour II, regardless of whether or not complainant was allowed to remain on Tour II. Moreover, it appears that there was no impact on these excessed clerks' retreat rights to return to Tour II, sometime in the future, as complainant's Permanent Modified Job was not a bid position, so no other employee could retreat to it. Given these circumstances, we cannot conclude that any seniority rights would have been violated by allowing complainant to remain in her Tour II position. Therefore, we find that complainant's request to remain on Tour II was "reasonable" absent a showing of undue hardship by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the above, even assuming that complainant's request to remain in her Permanent Modified Job on Tour II would somehow speculatively impact on another employee's seniority rights, we find that the agency's claim concerning the reasonableness of the requested accommodation still fails. As noted above, on appeal, the agency relies on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways v. Barnett,</span> 122 S. Ct. 1516 (2002), which holds that it is usually unreasonable to reassign an employee with a disability if to do so would violate the rules of an established seniority system. However, <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> goes on to hold that if there are "special circumstances" that alter other employees' expectations of "uniform treatment," it may be a reasonable accommodation, absent a showing of undue hardship, to reassign a disabled employee. Here, we find that such "special circumstances" exist. That is, we find that it is well-established that the agency has in place a detailed procedure for placing employees with impairments and disabilities, both temporary and permanent, into light and limited duty positions, and that the process for granting permanent limited duty assignments operates outside of the bid process. In fact, Article 13 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement at issue, by its very own provisions requiring the agency to find work for disabled and injured employees, embodies this exception. <span class="Italic">See Burnett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01981618 (September 26, 2002). Therefore, we find that it is "reasonable" for the agency to make exceptions to its seniority scheme under facts similar to the instant matter, and allow complainant to remain in her day shift position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency bears the burden of proving that the requested accommodation would violate a provision of the collective bargaining agreement. At a minimum, this requires including the relevant bargaining agreement provisions in the investigative file. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120081003 (2014), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that accommodation would have violated the bargaining agreement noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision, the Agency noted that S1 rescinded Complainant's Variable Work Week schedule because it violated the terms and conditions of the CBA. However, we note that the Agency has presented no evidence establishing that Complainant's Variable Work Week schedule conflicted with the terms of the CBA. In particular, the Agency has not submitted the CBA or any relevant provision of the CBA. Moreover, the Agency has presented no evidence or argument that the proposed accommodation would pose an undue hardship for any other reason. Thus, we find that the Agency has failed to carry its burden of undue hardship. Accordingly, we find that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when, on October 28, 2006, it rescinded Complainant's Variable Work Week Schedule, which was given to her as a reasonable accommodation for her disability. <span class="Italic">See Lamb v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120103232 (Mar. 21, 2012).</p>
