<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-41"><span class="space">d.</span> Workers Compensation</h5>
<p class="noindent">The general rule is that an agency may deduct workers compensation benefits received for a back pay award if the benefits were intended as compensation for wage loss. The agency remains liable for the difference between the workers compensation benefits paid and the full back pay award. An agency may not deduct workers compensation benefits paid as reparation for physical damages suffered as the result of a work-related injury. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Postmaster General</span>, 04A40041 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission stated in <span class="Italic">Emerson S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420130026 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"A Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) award that is meant to compensate for lost wages should be deducted from the total amount of back pay to which the petitioner is entitled in order to avoid double wage recovery, but the portion of the OWCP award that is paid as reparation for physical injuries should not be deducted from back pay because it is unrelated to wages earned." <span class="Italic">Ulloa v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04A30025 (Aug. 3, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the Commission held that if it ordered reinstatement of an employee for a time period during which the employee was on workers' compensation, the employee was entitled to the difference between her workers' compensation benefits and what she otherwise would have earned. An agency properly deducted OWCP compensation from a back pay award under Title VII. However, the agency could not make further deductions on the theory that the employee saved on expenses during the period of time she collected worker's compensation. In <span class="Italic">Halliburton-Simmons v. Small Business Administrator</span>, 05910762 (1991), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainants who have been awarded compensation for lost wages by OWCP for work missed due to injury may also receive backpay, under Title VII, for work due to prohibit[ed] discrimination, so long as there is no double recovery. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Bolger</span>, 802 F.2d 660, 666 (3d Cir. 1986) and <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Frank</span>, 732 F. Supp. 1085, 1089 (D. Or. 1990). In the instant case, appellant received compensation from OWCP for lost wages at a rate of approximately 75% of her salary. It is not clear whether the award covered the entire period appellant was off work. If appellant is awarded backpay under Title VII, the agency may set-off lost wages compensation by OWCP to the extent identical time periods are covered by both payments to prevent double recovery. (footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that tax treatment of backpay under Title VII and wage loss compensation under FECA would create a double recovery in the instant case. We disagree. For the purposes of determining double recovery, only the gross amounts of a backpay award under Title VII and compensation for lost wages under FECA are considered. <span class="Italic">Ann C. Ferguson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request Number 05880848 (May 8, 1990). The tax treatment a complainant receives on these awards is collateral and relevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the agency argues that appellant while on LWOP allegedly saved on expenses involved with working such as clothing, childcare, and transportation costs. In the agency's opinion such savings should reduce any backpay award due appellant. We disagree. In support of its argument, the agency cited <span class="Italic">Black v. Frank</span>, 730 F. Supp. 1087, 1091, n.5 (S.D. Ala. 1990). <span class="Italic">Black</span> is distinguishable because the Court noted there <span id="Page_1733"></span>was no discrimination. (footnote omitted). Moreover, the <span class="Italic">Black</span> decision has been criticized as being unclear and holding little persuasive value. <span class="Italic">Nichols</span> at 1089. Appellant, under Title VII is entitled to receive back pay for compensation she did not earn because of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-419 (1975).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Finlay v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942985 (1997), the Commission reaffirmed its position that wage loss compensation under FECA does not preclude a back pay award under Title VII, and expanded on its explanation. The Commission rejected the agency's position that FECA provided the exclusive remedy in discrimination cases and proceeded to determine the complainant's back pay award in <span class="Italic">Finlay</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency and appellant disagree as to whether, and to what extent, appellant is entitled to an award of back pay for the same periods of time that she received workers' compensation wage-replacement benefits under FECA. The Commission previously examined this issue in <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (November 29, 1990). In <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, the petitioner received FECA wage-replacement benefits after the agency discriminated against him by failing to reasonably accommodate his disability, thereby forcing him from the workplace. In finding that the petitioner nonetheless was entitled to back pay, the Commission acknowledged that FECA limits an employee's right to obtain other compensation from the Federal government, but held that it does so only with regard to claims which might otherwise be brought under state workers' compensation statutes or Federal tort liability statutes, such as the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Commission further held that FECA does not limit the "make whole" relief to which a victim of discrimination is entitled under Title VII<span class="Italic">. See id.; Schnaidt v. Dept. Of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04960022 (November 15, 1996); <span class="Italic">Santos v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01911380 (May 30, 1991); <span class="Italic">see also Miller v. Bolger</span>, 802 F.2d 660 (3d Cir. 1986) (distinguishing relief available under FECA from that available under Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's position on the non-exclusivity of FECA as a remedy for losses caused by unlawful discrimination recently has been espoused by the Ninth Circuit. In <span class="Italic">Nichols v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 F.3d 503 (9th Cir. 1994), an employee subjected to sexual harassment became disabled for work and began to receive FECA wage-replacement benefits. In finding that the employee nonetheless was entitled to back pay under Title VII, the Nichols court held that unlawful discrimination is not an "injury" within the meaning of FECA, insofar as unlawful discrimination is neither an accidental injury, nor a disease proximately caused by the employment, nor damage to durable medical devices, which are FECA's three definitions of "injury." Likewise, the Sixth Circuit also has held that injuries due to discrimination are not covered by FECA<span class="Italic">. DeFord v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 700 F.2d 281 (6th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">see also Karnes v. Runyon</span>, 912 F. Supp. 280 (S.D. Ohio 1995) (FECA designed as a substitute for common-law tort actions only; no mention of FECA as exclusive remedy when Federal employees were added to Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that FECA is not the exclusive remedy for wage loss in cases of unlawful discrimination, the Commission now turns to the question of the extent of appellant's entitlement. The record reflects that, on account of the effects of the discrimination, appellant did not work during the period April 24 to May 10, 1992, and that appellant again stopped work May 20, 1992; as of the date of the FAD, March 11, 1994, appellant still had not returned to work. Accordingly, appellant is entitled to back pay, with interest, and benefits for the period April 24, 1992, to May 10, 1992; and for the period May 20, 1992, through the date on which this decision becomes final. The award must, however, be offset by the amount of any wage-replacement benefits which appellant has received under FECA; appellant also is not entitled to recover leave which has already been restored under FECA<span class="Italic">. Nichols</span>, 42 F.3d at 516. The Commission notes that back pay and benefits include, but are not limited to, annual leave, sick leave, retirement contributions (CSRS and TSP) with interest, seniority, and salary increases. The Commission further notes that if appellant regularly worked overtime prior to her incapacitation, the agency should take appellant's average overtime into consideration in calculating the amount of back pay due<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent">The EEOC will defer, however, to determinations by OWCP that a modified job offer is within the employee's medical restrictions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Neville v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720110023 (2013), the Commission rejected an argument that she entitled to back pay after she retired because the agency allegedly would not assign her work within her medical restrictions. The Commission noted that OWCP had approved the modified job offer as being within the complainant's restrictions and the proper forum for challenging that determination was OWCP and not the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">But not all payments from workers' compensation are intended to be reimbursement for lost wages. In some instances, an award also is made for the physical damage suffered aside from any lost wages. In <span class="Italic">Wreford v. Postmaster General</span>, 01881509 (1988), the Commission determined that only the portion of workers' compensation awards meant as compensation for lost wages is deductible from back pay awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, a U.S. District Court held that part of a Workers Compensation payment which consists of payments of lost wages due to injury, as opposed to payments received as reparation for physical damages suffered, constitutes interim earnings within the meaning of 42 USC 2000e-5(g) and should be offset against any award for backpay. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Blue and White Service Corp.</span>, 674 F. Supp. 1579, 1582 (D. Minn. 1987). The Court relied on the ruling of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in <span class="Italic">American Mfg. Co.</span>, 167 NLRB 520 (1967), in which the NLRB stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]wards of workmen's compensation consist of two components, one being a payment for lost wages and the other being reparation for physical damage suffered. The entire payment, including the wage component, has been regarded as a collateral benefit where backpay was tolled. But where backpay is awarded for the same period for which wages have already been replaced in part, to continue to hold the wage portion of the award to be nondeductible would result in double payment to the employee for that period, and hence this part is more accurately regarded as deductible interim earnings. However, the portion of the award which is reparation for physical damage suffered is unrelated to wages earned, does not result in double wage payment to the discriminatee, and continues to be excludable from interim earnings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EEOC v. Blue and White Service Corp.</span>, 674 F. Supp. at 1582-83, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">American Mfg. Co.</span>, 167 NLRB 520 (1967). The court found that the "deductibility of workers compensation payments for lost wages remains the rule in NLRB actions."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1583, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Canova v. NLRB</span>, 708 F.2d 1498, 1504 (9th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Graves Trucking, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 692 F.2d 470, 475 n.4 (7th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other courts have also held that workers compensation payments are deductible from backpay awards....(citations omitted)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Commission adopts the approach taken by the NLRB, as discussed in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Blue and White Service Corp.</span>, and finds that only that portion of appellant's workers compensation benefits attributable to the replacement of lost wages shall be deducted from her backpay award. The sum paid for appellant's physical impairment shall not be offset from her backpay award. This approach will avoid doubly compensating appellant for her lost earnings and prevent appellant from being made more than whole....(citation omitted)</p>

<p class="noindent">The fact that a complainant was collecting workers' compensation benefits because of a work-related injury that disables him from one position does not preclude a back pay award resulting from his nonselection for another position. In <span class="Italic">McClendon v. Postmaster General</span>, 04960013 (1997), the Commission found that while the complainant was receiving workers' compensation benefits due to his inability to perform as a letter carrier, he was nonetheless capable of performing the duties of the EEO counselor position he was discriminatorily denied, and therefore the agency was required to provide him with back pay. As the Commission in <span class="Italic">McClendon</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to deprive appellant of his entitlement to back pay and leave during the period when he was not working and receiving workers' compensation payments, it must be determined whether appellant could have performed in the EEO Counselor/Investigator position at the time of the selection. First, the Commission notes that the record contains no medical evidence that had the petitioner been selected, he would have been unable to perform the duties of an EEO Counselor/Investigator during the period of September 7, 1991 through June 22, 1992. Petitioner testified that he had not worked as a Carrier since 1988, when he was injured, because he could not stand or walk for prolonged periods of time. However, the agency has not presented any evidence that the EEO Counselor/Investigator position requires the same prolonged standing or walking as that required of a Carrier. Therefore, we find that the petitioner was able to perform the duties of an EEO Counselor/Investigator during the period of September 7, 1991 through June 22, 1992. Consequently, appellant shall be reimbursed for back pay and have any leave restored pursuant to the qualifications set forth herein.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a finding of discrimination results in a retroactive promotion for a period during which the complainant was receiving OWCP wage loss benefits, the agency is not responsible for paying the increased benefit directly to the complainant but must notify OWCP of the appropriate salary computations on which the award should have been based. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072120 (2010).</p>
