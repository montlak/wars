</header>
<p class="noindent">Cases involving claims of hostile environment, also known as harassment, under Title VII, particularly racial harassment, have been around since the early 1970s, but it was the explosion of litigation over sexual harassment that brought these cases to the forefront as representing a distinct theory of discrimination under Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA. Historically, the EEOC first treated sexual harassment as a separate cause of action under Title VII when it promulgated regulations on the subject in 1980. In the early 1990s, the Commission made an attempt to consolidate its treatment of harassment based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, and gender, where no overtly sexual conduct is implicated, in the form of proposed regulations entitled "Guidelines on Harassment Based on Race, Color, Religion, Gender, National Origin, Age or Disability," 29 CFR Part 1609. 58 Fed. Reg. 51,266 (October 1, 1993). However, because of the inclusion of religion as a basis in the proposed guidelines and possible intrusion on First Amendment rights, the Commission subsequently withdrew those proposed regulations, choosing instead to develop the law on a case-by-case basis. Although the proposed regulations were never adopted, they remain helpful as they set forth the basic parameters of hostile environment harassment that the Commission has subsequently adopted through its case law.</p>
<p class="noindent">The primary focus of this chapter is sexual harassment, though harassment on other Title VII bases, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA is discussed in the final section of this chapter. There is little difference in applying the theory of harassment to any basis other than sex. Sexual harassment has been chosen as the focus for three reasons. First, there are far more harassment cases filed on the basis of sex than any other basis. Most of the important developments in the law have come out of sexual harassment cases. Second, the existence of what was formerly known as <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment--where a supervisor takes a personnel action because of submission to or rejection of sexual advances--makes it distinct from the other bases of harassment. Although in <span class="Italic">Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed.2d 633 (1998), the Supreme Court questioned whether <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment was really a distinct claim under Title VII, it did acknowledge that the labels <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> and hostile environment harassment were useful in distinguishing between forms of harassment where a tangible personnel action was taken and those where the hostility of the work environment was the focus. <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and its companion case, <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed.2d 662 (1998), are discussed, in detail, below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, sexual harassment is different from hostile environment cases on other bases in terms of raising the issue of whether the conduct directed at an individual was unwelcome. Though there are undoubtedly exceptions, as a general rule, comments directed at an individual because of their race, color, national origin or religion are inherently unwelcome. Such conduct has no socially useful purpose. The same is not true of comments of a sexual nature. One study found that 38% of employees had a romantic relationship with a coworker at least once in their career; 17% had such a relationship at least twice; 30% of those relationships resulted in marriage. Not all conduct based on gender, then, is inherently unwelcome and, in the proper context, can serve a socially useful purpose. Whether the conduct is unwelcome is more frequently at issue in sexual harassment cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unlike most intentional discrimination or disparate impact cases, harassment cases, except those involving the former <span class="Italic">quid</span> <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">quo</span> sexual harassment, do not involve personnel actions. The focus in these cases is not whether the employer has taken some action because of the employee's protected status. Instead, the focus is on the work environment itself and whether it is hostile, intimidating, or abusive. The Commission has noted, "[a]lthough '<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>' and 'hostile environment' harassment give rise to distinct claims, 'the line between the two is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together.'" <span class="Italic">Crane v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924585 (1993) (quoting EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (March 19, 1990)). Although the Supreme Court has all but abolished the <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> label for cases involving tangible employment actions, it remains true that hostile environment harassment and tangible employment action harassment often occur together and it is not unusual that cases present both allegations. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Clay v. Attorney General, INS</span>, 01921236 (1992) (quoting EEOC Policy Guidance on Sexual Harassment at p. 2). In <span class="Italic">Clay</span>, the complainant alleged both types of harassment by contending that she was subjected to a hostile work environment through gestures, winks and looks, and that she was subjected to <span class="Italic">quid</span> <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">quo</span> harassment when she was terminated because she refused to succumb to her supervisor's repeated sexual advances.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because there is nearly always a personal element to sexual harassment, such claims present two quite distinct questions: (1) whether sexual harassment has, in fact, occurred; and (2) whether the employer should be held liable for the harassment. Indeed, several early cases held that employers could not be found liable under Title VII for sexual harassment because the conduct engaged in by the supervisor was purely personal and did nothing to advance the interests of the employer. For example, in <span class="Italic">Corne v. Bausch &#x0026; Lomb, Inc.</span>, 390 F. Supp. 161, 164 (D. Ariz. 1975), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 562 F.2d 55 (9th Cir. 1977), the court, after reviewing several cases in which employment practices were found to constitute sex discrimination, observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In all of the above-mentioned cases the discriminatory conduct complained of arose out of company policies. There was apparently some advantage to, or gain by, the employer from such practices. Always such discriminatory practices were employer designed and oriented. In the present case, [the supervisor's] conduct appears to be nothing more than a personal proclivity, peculiarity or mannerism. By his alleged sexual advances, [the supervisor] was satisfying a personal urge. Certainly no employer policy is here involved; rather than the company being benefitted in any way by the conduct of [the supervisor], it is obvious it can only be damaged by the very nature of the acts complained of.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem identified in <span class="Italic">Corne</span> had nothing to do with the first question. What troubled the court in <span class="Italic">Corne</span>, and continued to plague other courts well after sexual harassment was a widely-accepted cause of action, was the basis for holding the employer liable for sexual harassment: Why should an employer be liable for conduct that it did not condone, probably expressly forbade, that did not benefit the employer and may well have been detrimental to the employer's interests, particularly where the employer was reasonably unaware of the harassment?</p>
<p class="noindent">Harassment cases are extremely difficult. First, they present many practical difficulties for the representatives who must try them and the judges who must hear them. The cases are exceedingly emotional. Whether a case involves sexual propositions or ethnic or racial slurs and epithets, it involves conduct that can have a severe psychological impact on the complainant and his or her family and friends. Often, the mere act of talking about the harassment becomes an emotionally charged event. Doing so, under oath, before an administrative judge who is a stranger, subject to cross-examination, can be embarrassing and humiliating. It is not unusual for harassing conduct to occur in private, involving only the alleged perpetrator and the victim. As a result, corroborative evidence can be difficult to come by, leaving judges to decide cases based almost wholly on credibility determinations. But aside from the practical difficulties, harassment cases are legally complex. What is required to prove a violation differs depending on whether the case involves a tangible employment action or a hostile environment. Further complicating the analysis is the fact that many hostile environment cases rely, in part, on tangible employment actions that the complainant alleges are part of the hostile environment. Voluntary submission to harassing conduct must be distinguished from the unwelcome nature of the conduct. Conduct that is merely annoying must be distinguished from that which is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. Further, in sexual harassment cases, one must not lose sight of the fact that the conduct does not violate Title VII because it is sexual in nature; it violates Title VII because the conduct is based on sex. But for the gender of the victim, he or she would not be subjected to the harassing conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that sexual harassment is prohibited by Title VII not because it is sexual but because it is gender-based has played a large role in establishing a trend at the EEOC and in many federal courts to view what might look like harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity in the first instance and, therefore, outside the ambit of Title VII as harassment based on gender stereotyping which is covered by Title VII. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Hitchcock v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120051461 (2007) and <span class="Italic">Prowel v. Wise Business Forms, Inc</span>., 579 F.3d 285 (10th Cir. 2009), discussed below. Indeed, in late 2011, the EEOC found gender stereotyping that violated Title VII in two cases that appeared to involve sexual orientation discrimination finding that the complainants, who were gay, were subject to harassment for failure to adhere to traditional stereotypes--i.e., an essential part of being male is being sexually attracted to females and an essential part of being female is being sexually attracted to males. <span class="Italic">Veretto v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110873 (2011); <span class="Italic">Castello v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520110649 (2011). In 2012, the Commission carried that premise to its logical conclusion finding that discrimination on the basis of transgender status was protected under Title VII as a form of discrimination based on sex. As a result, all theories of discrimination under Title VII are applicable to a claim of discrimination based on transgender status. <span class="Italic">Macy v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt">0120120821</a> (2012). Although the Commission did not mention sexual orientation in the <span class="Italic">Macy</span> decision, there was no reasoned basis to draw a distinction between discrimination based on transgender status and discrimination based on sexual orientation. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Jennings v. Secretary of Labor,</span> 0120112716 (2013) (Noting "Title VII's prohibition of discrimination does not explicitly include sexual orientation a basis," and complainant did not allege gender stereotyping in dicta but finding complainant did not establish pretext in any event). Finally, in <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120133080.txt">0120133080</a> <span id="Page_800"></span>(2015), the Commission, applying much of the logic used in <span class="Italic">Macy</span>, held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. Of course, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia,</span> 590 US ___, Nos. 17-1618, 17-1623, 18-107 (June 2020), ended any debate about sexual orientation or transgender status as protected bases by holding that claims of transgender and/or sexual orientation discrimination are covered under Title VII as sex-based discrimination. The development of the law, including its current status, is discussed below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-21-064.html#sec12-57">Sex of Perpetrator and Victim</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The theory of harassment as a form of discrimination is far more complex than the theories of intentional discrimination or adverse impact discrimination. It is made all the more difficult because the rules for employer liability also differ depending on the type of harassment involved and on whether the harasser is a supervisor or coworker.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC, in its regulations at 29 CFR Part 1604, initially suggested rules for employer liability based on whether the conduct involved coworkers or supervisors and whether the employer knew, or should have known, of the harassment. But it was not until the Supreme Court decided the <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> case in 1998 that the rules of liability became clear for employers. It is important to bear in mind in reviewing the following sections that a determination that sexual harassment has occurred is not the equivalent of a finding that the employer is liable for the harassment, except in cases involving tangible employment actions. When sexual harassment results in a tangible employment action, the agency is strictly, or automatically, liable under Title VII. In hostile environment cases, the issues of a violation of Title VII and employer liability remain separate, and the rules are different depending on whether the harasser is a supervisor or a coworker. In cases where the hostile environment is created by a supervisor or manager, the agency is liable unless it can prevail on a two-pronged affirmative defense by showing that it exercised reasonable care in preventing and promptly correcting any harassing behavior and that the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any corrective or preventive opportunities or otherwise failed to avoid harm. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Indus.</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 2270. When a hostile environment is created by a coworker, the complainant must, as part of his or her case-in-chief, show that the agency knew or should have known of the harassing conduct and failed to take prompt and effective corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1604.11(d).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the EEOC took a liberal view of what constitutes a supervisor for liability purposes, the Supreme Court rejected that view in <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013), holding that the definition of a supervisor is limited to those individuals who have the authority to take a tangible employment action. <span class="Italic">Vance</span> is discussed below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-21-103.html#sec12-73">Definition of a Supervisor</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Cases involving the other theories of discrimination do not present situations where the liability question needs to be examined separately from the question of whether discrimination occurred. The reason is that Title VII relies on the law of agency to establish employer liability. As used in this context, the law of agency refers not to administrative agencies, but rather to the common law that governs the relationship between a principal and his agent. Under the law of agency, a principal is liable for the acts of his agent when the agent is acting within the scope of his employment. In cases that involve concrete personnel actions or the grant, denial, or application of a term, condition, privilege, or benefit of employment, the supervisor or manager charged with discrimination is acting within the scope of employment. For example, when a supervisor hires, promotes, fires, or otherwise disciplines an employee, approves or denies the use of leave, or evaluates performance, he or she is acting within the scope of employment. Because the employer authorized the supervisor to engage in these activities, it is liable as the principal for the wrongful acts of its agents in carrying out the activities. The result is that when a superior is found to have engaged in discrimination in carrying out an employment duty, there is strict or automatic liability attributed to the employer and there is no need to separately analyze the issue of liability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Hostile environment harassment as a theory can be traced to <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, 454 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1971), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 406 U.S. 957, 92 S. Ct. 2058, 32 L. Ed.2d 343 (1972). In <span class="Italic">Rogers</span>, a divided panel of the court enforced an EEOC demand for information where the complainant alleged that Title VII was violated when the employer segregated its optometry patients on the basis of national origin. The court found it was unclear whether the complainant was alleging that she was injured by the segregation of patients, standing alone, or whether she was alleging that she was allowed only to treat minority patients. The court issued three separate opinions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Judge Goldberg found that Title VII could encompass psychological injuries based on a discriminatory work environment, even if the complaint was construed to relate only to the segregation of patients and not to the employee's assignment of patients. In oft-quoted language, Goldberg wrote, "One can readily envision working environments so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers...," and that Title VII was violated by maintenance of such an environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although Judge Goldberg was not joined by his colleagues in his expansive reading of Title VII, his opinion came to be relied upon in a series of cases involving discriminatory work environments. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Waters v. Heublien, Inc.</span>, 547 F.2d 466 (9th Cir. 1976), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 433 U.S. 915, 97 S. Ct. 2988, 53 L. Ed.2d 1100 (1977) (white plaintiff alleging the right to work in an environment free from discrimination against blacks has standing under Title VII); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Greyhound Lines, East</span>, 545 F.2d 169 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (racial slurs violate Title VII); <span class="Italic">Firefighters Inst. for Racial Equality v. City of St. Louis</span>, 549 F.2d 506 (8th Cir. 1976), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 434 U.S. 819, 98 S. Ct. 60, 54 L. Ed.2d 76 (1977) (condoning segregated eating facilities for employees creates a discriminatory work environment).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is now well established that discriminatory work environments violate Title VII, as well as the Rehabilitation Act and the ADEA. But "[h]arassment, as the term is used in Title VII cases, refers to more than occasionally being bothered or subjected to stress." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01934200 (1994). The complained of conduct must be sufficiently severe or pervasive that a reasonable person, viewing the conduct from the victim's perspective, would find the environment hostile, abusive, or offensive, and the complainant must have actually viewed the conduct as such at the time it occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993). The reason for this is that Title VII extends not only to personnel actions, but the terms, conditions, benefits and privileges of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC 2000e-2. A hostile work environment violates Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act or the ADEA only when it rises to the level that submission to the conduct becomes a term and condition of employment. Although it was the last form of harassment to be recognized by courts, the Supreme Court has chosen to make its pronouncements in the area in cases involving sexual harassment. For this reason, the discussion begins with an examination of sexual harassment under Title VII. The parameters of hostile environment claims are explored in the sections following the discussion of tangible employment actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Procedurally, complaints alleging harassment are treated the same as any other complaint of discrimination. "In order to allege harassment the complainant is not required to demonstrate that the actions complained of meet the legal definition of harassment. The legal sufficiency of a harassment allegation is reserved for the final disposition of the EEO complaint." <span class="Italic">Feemster v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05931196 (1994). It should be noted, however, that dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim for relief is a final disposition of the complaint and, in that regard, the legal sufficiency of the allegations is considered. Thus, a complaint of harassment can be dismissed without investigation where the alleged conduct, taken in its totality, is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile, offensive or abusive work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although sexual harassment has received recognition as a distinct claim, it is not because Title VII in any way attempts to regulate sexual conduct. Rather, sexual harassment is a type of discrimination based on sex, and therefore violates Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, prior to 1998, there were two recognized types of sexual harassment: the "hostile or offensive work environment type" and the "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> type." In the former type, the issue is whether the agency created an environment that is so offensive or hostile as to affect the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or create an intimidating, hostile, or abusive work environment. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cox v. Department of Navy</span>, 01822334 (1983). In the <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> type, the issue was whether an employment action was taken, or threatened, as a result of rejection of, or submission to, unwelcome sexual advances. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Trammel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01871154 (1988). As discussed in more detail below, the debate over whether the former <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment, now relabeled "tangible employment action" harassment, covered only personnel actions or also included threats to take personnel actions has been resolved by treating threatened personnel actions as a form of hostile environment harassment and, thus, subject to the severe or pervasive requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC has promulgated regulations defining sexual harassment, and an employer's liability for such harassment, at 29 CFR 1604.11:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of section 703 of Title VII. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;In determining whether alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment, the Commission will look at the record as a whole and the totality of the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred. The determination of the legality of a particular action will be made from the facts, on a case by case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;[Rescinded.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 64 FR 58333 (October 29, 1999).]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;With respect to conduct between fellow employees, an employer is responsible for acts of sexual harassment in the workplace where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have <span id="Page_801"></span>known of the conduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;An employer may also be responsible for the acts of non-employees, with respect to sexual harassment of employees in the workplace, where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing these cases the Commission will consider the extent of the employer's control and any other legal responsibility which the employer may have with respect to the conduct of such non-employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;Prevention is the best tool for the elimination of sexual harassment. An employer should take all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as affirmatively raising the subject, expressing strong disapproval, developing appropriate sanctions, informing employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment under title VII, and developing methods to sensitize all concerned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(g)&#x2003;Other related practices: Where employment opportunities or benefits are granted because of an individual's submission to the employer's sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, the employer may be held liable for unlawful sex discrimination against other persons who were qualified for but denied that employment opportunity or benefit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsection (c) of the regulations was rescinded as a result of the <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> cases on employer liability for sexual harassment, discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many early cases involving sexual and racial harassment attempt to apply a <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis. However, a hostile environment claim is distinctly different and it is error for the administrative judge to apply the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis to such a claim. <span class="Italic">Lartz v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A31128 (2004). The issue in a hostile environment case is not whether the agency's explanation for the harassment is pretextual. The basic elements of a hostile environment claim are that the complainant must demonstrate: 1) that he or she was subjected to physical or verbal conduct; 2) that the conduct was unwelcome; 3) that the conduct was based on a protected category; 4) that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment; and 4) that there is a basis for imputing liability to the employer. In some cases, however, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis is useful in evaluating whether the conduct is based on a protected category. For example, if an agency instead of asserting that the conduct did not occur asserts that the conduct was not based on a protected category, the agency's explanation for the conduct would be examined to determine if it was pretextual. To illustrate, assume that a complainant alleges that she has been subjected to a hostile work environment because of her sex in that her work has been subject to greater scrutiny than her coworkers, that her leave and break usage has been monitored more closely than her coworkers, and that she has been threatened with poor performance evaluations. The agency, in its defense, admits that the complainant's work has been subject to greater scrutiny, her leave and break usage has been more closely monitored, and she has been warned about possible poor performance evaluations. The agency asserts, however, that the conduct is not based on the complainant's sex, but on her work performance and conduct. In such situations, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis is useful in determining the underlying reason for the conduct. To rebut the agency's assertion, the complainant could introduce evidence that her work met the same standards as her coworkers and her leave and break usage patterns were the same. In other words, the complainant could demonstrate that the agency's proffered reasons for its conduct were not true or not the true reasons the agency acted.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the remainder of this chapter, we explore the elements of a hostile environment claim.</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec12-2"><span class="space">I.</span> TANGIBLE EMPLOYMENT ACTION: SEXUAL HARASSMENT</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first form of sexual harassment to be recognized by the courts was <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment. The label <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment has become obsolete since the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher,</span> and these cases are now called "tangible employment action" cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). Unlike hostile environment harassment, <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment or tangible employment action harassment only exists as a form of harassment based on sex. Also, unlike hostile environment harassment, <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> or tangible employment action harassment can only be perpetrated by a supervisor. Although the label of <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment is not currently used, the term was used to distinguish a distinct form of sexual harassment for more than 20 years prior to the <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> decisions. In the case law discussed below that predates those decisions, <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> should be understood as referring to cases involving tangible employment actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Critical to cases of sexual harassment involving tangible employment actions is for the complainant to establish a nexus, or link, between the personnel action and the sexual advances. In the Commission's regulations, at 29 CFR 1604.11(a)(2), the link is expressed as requiring a showing that "submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual...." This is merely another way of saying that the complainant must show the personnel action was "because of" his or her sex. 42 USC 2000e-2.</p>
<p class="noindent">All of the focus on <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> cases over the years, and now on tangible employment action cases, has tended to obscure the fact that these cases are, at their very essence, intentional discrimination cases. The ultimate issue in these cases is whether the employer, in taking a personnel action, was motivated by the employee's gender. This means there are two methods of proof open to the complainant who alleges tangible employment action harassment. The employee can show motivation through circumstantial evidence--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, by using the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis. In its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability.</span> The Commission explains that a tangible employment action claim</p>
<p class="noindent-1">is analyzed like any other case in which a challenged employment action is alleged to be discriminatory. If the employer produces evidence of a non-discriminatory explanation for the tangible employment action, a determination must be made whether that explanation is a pretext designed to hide a discriminatory motive....</p>
<p class="noindent">Curiously, in its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance</span>, the Commission does not mention the alternative to using circumstantial evidence. The alternative is for the employee to produce direct evidence of the link between the sexual advances and the employment action. Though direct evidence cases are rare, tangible employment action cases do, with some frequency, involve direct evidence. When a supervisor explicitly propositions a subordinate with a demand for sex in exchange for a favorable employment action, there is little need to use a circumstantial evidence analysis to determine intent. If a factfinder believes a complainant's testimony that her supervisor extracted sexual favors for a promotion, it is preposterous to suggest the complainant must also establish the agency's reasons for promoting her are pretextual. Clearly, the burden of both production and persuasion should shift to the agency to demonstrate it would have promoted her even absent discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, harassment cases are legally complex. The complexity increases when the Commission, which is charged with enforcing Title VII, issues well-intended, but poorly-reasoned, guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant does prove, by whichever method, that a tangible employment action is linked to sexual harassment, the agency is strictly liable for the harassment. There are no affirmative defenses the agency can raise. In that respect, tangible employment action cases are far easier analytically than hostile environment cases. With this introduction, the discussion now proceeds to what constitutes a tangible employment action and who is considered a supervisor.</p>
