<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-45"><span class="space">1.</span> Employment References</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is not uncommon in settlement agreements to provide that all inquiries from potential employers will be directed to the agency's central personnel office and only certain agreed-upon information will be released. Such agreements, however, do not always work. Where there is a breach of such a provision, the only proper remedy is reinstatement of the complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Stabler v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01945570 (1996), the Commission reinstated the complaint when the complainant's past supervisor and several other agency employees spoke to the prospective employer. The Commission noted that no compensatory damages were available on the breach allegation. However, the Commission also ordered the agency to process the complainant's allegation that the agency's actions in speaking to the potential employer were retaliatory. Although the Commission did not specifically comment, presumably compensatory damages would be available on the retaliation allegation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the confusion engendered by the mixed case and mixed appeals scenarios, it is not surprising that there is substantial disagreement over the subject of employment references in federal sector cases. In <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 F.3d 628 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals wrote disapprovingly of settlement agreements that provide for neutral employment references. In a concurring opinion, Judge Plager wrote that such agreements pose an "inherent moral hazard." Judge Plager described the dilemma in his concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, 58 F.3d at 634:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However denominated, a "neutral" reference under these circumstances is not an honest reference. It may serve as a subtle signal to knowledgeable prospective employers that there is some undisclosed problem, in which case the employee has been misled into believing he is getting something he is not. A less knowledgeable prospective employer, on the other hand, not privy to the subtle signal, will receive a deliberately misleading statement which, if relied upon, may cause the prospective employer to be misled to its detriment. Moreover, as the court's opinion notes in footnote five, an honest official of the current employer, called upon for a reference, and recognizing that possibility, is placed in an impossible situation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, on the other hand, has held that settlement agreements with neutral reference clauses are valid. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stabler v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01945570 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies are not likely to find their way out of the morass anytime soon. In <span class="Italic">McGee v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01955062 (1996), the Commission held that a negative or neutral employment reference is actionable. The result is that the Federal Circuit considers agreements providing for a neutral reference immoral, the Commission considers them valid, and in the absence of any agreement between the Commission and the court, an agency's liability for giving a negative reference that violates a settlement agreement depends, in part, on the forum in which the agreement was reached. If the agreement is reached in an MSPB case, any provision calling for a neutral reference may be invalid. However, it should be noted that the Commission has held that it has the authority to enforce an agreement in an MSPB proceeding when that agreement, in addition to resolving the Board case, also resolves allegations of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The disagreement between the EEOC and the Federal Circuit apparently is unaffected by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.</span>, 519 U.S. 337, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed.2d 808 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, the Supreme Court held that a former employee who alleged a prospective employer was given a negative reference in retaliation for filing an EEO complaint stated a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> stands only for the proposition that an employer may be liable for actions taken after the employment relationship is terminated.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the absence of an agreement, the Commission has held that an agency did not discriminate against the complainant when it provided the reasons for his removal to prospective employers. <span class="Italic">Deas v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952985 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Deas</span>, the Commission found that prior to December 1993, Postal Service guidelines did not prohibit management from explaining the reasons for an employee's termination, and the complainant failed to present evidence of any other employees who received references that did not contain reasons for removal.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a settlement agreement does provide for a statement of the employee's duties that can be used "for future reference," it is a breach of the agreement for the agency to put that statement on a routing slip and preface its statement by adding "per settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">Greer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12044 (2001). Although the agreement did not specify the form of statement, the Commission found the intent of the agreement was that the statement would be used as an employment reference and that the agency's actions undermined that purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a settlement agreement dictates specifically what an agency will tell prospective employers about the complainant, it is not a breach of the agreement for the agency to share a copy of the agreement with an OPM benefit specialist to determine what impact, if any, the agreement had on the complainant's retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Braziel v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01995275 (2001). The agreement in that case only specified what the agency could and could not tell prospective employers and did not limit the information that could be shared with other federal agencies.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lupker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A61321 (2006), the agency agreed to allow the complainant to apply for certain positions within the agency and further agreed to give a neutral reference to any outside employment inquiries. The Commission determined that the agency did not breach the agreement when it gave the complainant a negative reference for a job he applied for with the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Trovato v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120093666 (2009), the Commission found that the agency did not breach an agreement that specified the information that would be given in employment references when an agency employee made negative comments about the complainant in a background <span id="Page_370"></span>check for another position. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Trovato</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that the agency breached provision 6 after she had been conditionally hired by the FBI, pending a background investigation. Complainant asserted that, upon completion of the investigation, she was denied the position due to derogatory comments made about someone at the agency. We find that after a careful review of the record, complainant did not put forth sufficient evidence to show that the agency breached provision 6. The portion of the background investigation submitted by complainant in support of her claim shows that the investigator interviewed a former coworker of complainant concerning complainant's allegations of sexual misconduct on his part. During the course of the questioning of the former coworker, it appears he made some negative comments concerning complainant. Under these facts, we concur with the agency that the coworker's answering questions during a background investigation is not the same as a representative of the agency providing an employment reference. <span class="Italic">See Holloman v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01911399 (July 16. 1991). We acknowledge that it is possible that someone else at the agency provided negative information about complainant during the back ground investigation. However, even if we were to accept that the background investigation was the equivalent of a job reference, there is simply no evidence to indicate that an official representative of the agency provided negative information during this process.</p>
<p class="noindent">One problem with employment reference clauses is ensuring that the request for a reference gets to the proper individual in order to comply with the agreement. In remanding the case for additional evidence, the Commission highlighted the problem in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520140168 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant appealed the Agency's decision to the Commission. On appeal, the Commission agreed with the Agency and, on December 19, 2013, issued a decision finding no breach. In so doing, the Commission suggested that Complainant's argument that "inquiries about [his] employment with [the Agency] were not referred to the [AO] or her successor" and that former supervisors in that office provided negative information about Complainant" was unpersuasive because, under the terms of the Agreement, Complainant bore the responsibility of referring employment inquiries to the AO. Based on that, the Commission found that the fact that such inquiries were referred to the wrong person or office therefore could not have constituted a breach by the Agency. The Commission further found that the Agency was not in breach because the former supervisors Complainant identified as divulging information in a manner not consistent with the Agreement were not parties to the document nor had it been shown they were even aware of it. In response, Complainant filed this request for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reopening this matter, we note that, according to information in the file, OPM contacted a Mission Support Specialist in the Office of Human Resources located in El Paso, Texas, in response to Complainant's pursuit of future employment. That person, who had no knowledge of the agreement, referred OPM to Complainant's former supervisors located in Deming, New Mexico. It is these former supervisors who divulged derogatory information to OPM about Complainant in a manner not consistent with the Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is not enough information in the evidentiary record to determine whether the Mission Support Specialist was an appropriate person who should have been contacted by prospective employers or to determine what individual, if any, referred OPM to the Mission Support Specialist in the first place. We therefore find there is insufficient information in the record to determine whether Complainant failed to refer OPM to the AO as required by the Agreement or whether there was a breach of the Agreement on the part of the Agency. For that reason, we will order the Agency to supplement the record with this information.</p>
<p class="noindent">Settlement provisions obligating the agency to provide a positive, or even neutral, employment reference to prospective employers are common in settlement agreements, particularly where the complainant agrees to resign or retire pursuant to the agreement. Agencies entering into such agreements are well advised to appoint a mutually agreed upon agency official to provide such reference, identify that person in the agreement and to provide for an alternate official should that official leave the agency or become unavailable. <span class="Italic">Humberto P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120152191 (2017), involved one such provision, which read:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;In response to appropriate inquiries about the Complainant from prospective employers, Complainant is obligated to refer prospective employers to [the then] Administrative Officer, or her successor at [her Agency address and phone number]. Complainant understands that this phone number and address may change in the future and therefore assumes responsibility for referring prospective employers to the appropriate phone number and address for [the Administrative Officer]. The information provided in the reference will be linked to dates of employment, rate of pay and position held. No additional information shall be furnished unless the Complainant authorizes the release or as required by law, court order, or government regulation. The Employee [sic] expressly acknowledges that the Agency, it [sic] agents and its current and former employees and officers are not liable for any disclosure to any inquiring employer regarding the Employee's [sic] employment with the Agency to the extent such disclosure is limited to the disclosure permitted by this paragraph.</p>
<p class="noindent">That provision was found enforceable, but breached by the agency in <span class="Italic">Humberto P</span>. when, in conformance with the agreement, the complainant referred a prospective employer to the agency's Administrative Officer, but the Administrative Officer failed to make arrangements with another agency employee to provide the agreed upon information while he was out on detail. In the Administrative Officer's absence, the prospective employer was, instead, referred to the complainant's former supervisors who provided derogatory information concerning the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another problem that arises with settlement agreements that contain employment reference clauses is enforcement of the agreement. There is no effective remedy if the agency breaches the agreement. Reinstatement of the complaint is not so much a remedy for breach as an abandonment of the agreement. In many instances, where the complainant received other benefits under the agreement, reinstatement of the complaint is not an option. The problem of an effective remedy becomes apparent in a case like <span class="Italic">Moseley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972583 (1997), where the complainant alleged breach of a settlement agreement when he was given a negative employment reference by his former supervisor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, while the agency contends that it had not "technically violated" the settlement agreement, it appears that the agency had not implemented provision 2a of the settlement agreement until appellant had alleged noncompliance with the agreement. Appellant submits evidence that Person A received an inappropriate response to an employment inquiry on October 16, 1996, and the agency acknowledges that a clerk at the Yuba City Post Office did not provide the response required by the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that the agency breached the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has requested that the terms of the settlement agreement be implemented. In its FAD, the agency stated that a copy of the settlement agreement was forwarded to the Yuba city Post Office upon receipt of appellant's notification of an alleged settlement breach, and future inquiries regarding appellant's employment would receive the response provided by the settlement agreement. We note, however, that the record does not contain a statement by Labor Relations Representative A or by the Yuba City Postmaster confirming that the agency has complied with provision 2a of the settlement agreement. Therefore, the record contains no evidence, other than the agency's statement in its FAD, that it has complied with the terms of the settlement agreement. On remand, the agency should supplement the record with evidence that it has implemented provision 2a of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that appellant also requests damages in the amount of $15,000.00 for lost employment and as compensation for humiliation and mental suffering. With respect to appellant's request for damages for lost employment, we find that appellant's request is speculative. Appellant has not shown that he was not hired by any prospective employer as the result of a response that the agency provided to an employment inquiry in breach of the settlement agreement. Appellant is also not entitled to damages for humiliation and mental suffering caused by the settlement breach. The Commission has previously held that compensatory damages are not available for allegations of a settlement breach because such allegations do not involve a determination of whether discrimination has occurred<span class="Italic">. Child v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952080 (Jan. 19, 1996); <span class="Italic">Gibbons v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952319 (Dec. 14, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">Essentially, the only remedy is to enforce the agreement in the future. However, in <span class="Italic">Akberzie v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01983230 (2001), the Commission ordered reinstatement of the complaint as a remedy for failing to expunge disciplinary records where the agency may have disclosed information from those records to potential employers. The Commission noted that "specific performance [is] an unsatisfactory solution because it fails <span id="Page_371"></span>to adequately address the harm complainant may have suffered during the one year period the agency was in breach." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Akberzie</span>, the Commission noted that as part of the settlement, the complainant was issued a check of some $1,100 in compensatory damages, but it was unclear whether the complainant cashed the check.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also ordered reinstatement of the complaint in <span class="Italic">DeLa Veccio v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120065323 (2008), where the agency breached an agreement over the information it would release to prospective employers about the complainant. In <span class="Italic">DeLa Veccio</span>, the Commission also rejected an agency argument that it was not in breach because the complainant had not properly directed the inquiries to the designated agency officials:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an attempt to disclaim responsibility for such a reference, the agency points to the language of the settlement agreement which makes it solely complainant's responsibility to direct employment reference requests to the chief human resources manager or that manager's designee. However, this clause of the agreement is modified by the preceding language which requires complainant's former supervisor to direct any requests for employment references to the appropriate personnel in human resources, and puts limitations on the information which that individual can provide about complainant when giving such a reference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is thus important to determine whether S2 was complainant's former supervisor. The record indicates that S2 was not complainant's immediate supervisor, a fact which even the complainant concedes on appeal. However, we find ample evidence on the record to support a finding that S2 previously managed complainant's work, even if on a level higher than that of immediate supervisor. For example, the record indicates that S2 oversaw many of the investigations which led to complainant's termination from the agency it 2004. Also, as noted above, the record indicates that when S1 contacted S2 for an employment reference, S2 was identified as complainant's "previous Supervisor in Nursing." We this find that S2, qualifies as complainant's "former supervisor" for the purposes of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, when S2 received an employment reference request from S1, she was obligated under the terms of the agreement to direct the request to the humor, resources chief or the chief's designee. Furthermore, even if S2 had properly referred the request to the appropriate human resources personnel, that individual would have been restricted to providing the type of information specifically enumerated in the settlement agreement, which would not have permitted a statement that complainant had "customer service issues." It is therefore clear that S2's actions on May 4, 2006 violated the settlement agreement between complainant and the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where this Commission finds that a settlement agreement has been breached, the only two remedies available are specific performance of the terms of the agreement or reinstatement of the underlying EEO complaint at the point processing ceased. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504(c). In this case, we find that reinstatement of the complaint's underlying EEO complaint is the appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">A "neutral reference" provision may not be limited to prospective employers. As the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Celinda L. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01200141120 (2016), the agency's disclosure of information to the New York Department of Labor concerning the complainant's removal, which led to a denial of unemployment benefits, violated the neutral reference provision of the settlement agreement. The agency argued that the provision was tailored to prospective employers and that the complainant had not negotiated a provision precluding disclosure of the complainant's removal to the New York Department of Labor. The Commission rejected that argument, reasoning in <span class="Italic">Celinda L</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency determined that it complied with the subject settlement agreement when it provided certain information regarding Complainant's removal during a NYDOL unemployment insurance benefits hearing. However, we find that the action constituted a breach. The Agency action was in violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the subject agreement by its action. In the instant case, Complainant and the Agency entered into a settlement agreement that essentially allowed Complainant to have a neutral record of employment. Here, the Agency determined that to NYDOL was not seeking Complainant's records for hiring purposes. Therein, the Agency deemed it appropriate to provide information that it would otherwise not provide to a potential employer. The Agency noted that Complainant and the Agency had only negotiated to cover dealings with regards to potential employers, and not with regards to unemployment insurance matters with the NYDOL. Complainant argued on appeal that the release of such information was nonetheless a violation of the settlement agreement. We are in agreement with Complainant, and determine that the agreement in essence should have not had the termination information made available in other forums, despite the Agency's assertion to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is ORDERED to take all appropriate steps to ensure that it is in full compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement as interpreted by this decision. Among other steps, the Agency shall, within thirty days of the date this decision becomes final, issue a written instruction to its relevant Human Resources department that all inquiries regarding Complainant's employment with the Agency, regardless of the source of the inquiry, shall indicate that she resigned from her position for personal reasons effective May 24, 2013, and shall not reference the proposed removal, or the circumstances surrounding it, that was pending at the time.</p>
