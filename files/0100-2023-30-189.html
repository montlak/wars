<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-178"><span class="space">26.</span> Moving and Housing Expenses and Loss on Sale of Home</h4>
<p class="noindent">Also, in <span class="Italic">Gause</span>, the Commission approved the payment of moving expenses for the complainant where she maintained that because of her termination she could no longer afford her own apartment and was forced to move in with her sister. The Commission approved $100 of the requested $150, noting that the complainant produced no documentation of the expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of damages for moving expenses is appropriate where the complainant is forced to transfer as a result of the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15376 (2002). However, the complainant must prove the moving expenses were caused by the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>. <span class="Italic">Caguiat v. Attorney General</span>, 01A52651 (2006) (no moving expenses where complainant failed to show he was forced to move out of the country as a result of agency's rescinding an offer of employment). Too be compensable, the moving expenses cannot be "too remote or speculative." <span class="italic">Debbi V. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2021000890 (2022) ("losses based on the move from Virginia to Ohio, where she did not have a prospective job awaiting her, are speculative in nature and not compensable; the additional job-search costs she combined with the move and the furniture storage costs are also denied for the same reason.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission did not approve an award of pecuniary damages for the complainant's claimed loss on the sale of a house, in <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01976921 (2000), it did intimate that such a cost would be recoverable in the appropriate circumstances. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Quinn</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the real estate agent's appraisal, in this case, without more, to be insufficient to show that, but for the discriminatory actions of the agency, complainant would have received an additional $8,400.00 for the sale of her home. Even if we could conclude that the home's true value was $8,400.00 more than the selling price, there is no evidence which shows that the discriminatory conduct of the agency caused the reduction in its value. If the record established that complainant was forced into hastily selling her home for a price less than what comparable homes were selling for at the time, then she might have been entitled to the difference. However, the record herein does not support such finding. Likewise, assuming the selling price was the correct value of the home at the time of the sale, there is no evidence in the record which indicates that the home's value would have increased over time had she been able to remain in Buffalo. Accordingly, there is no evidence in the record which supports the finding that complainant lost money by selling the home when she did. Therefore, the Commission denies complainant's claim for $8,400.00 for the lost value of her home....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Quinn</span> did approve $425 in closing costs associated with the complainant's purchase of a new home as a result of the constructive reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mack v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01983217 (2000), the Commission denied a requested pecuniary damage award in the amount of $792 for possessions the complainant lost when he was forced to move after his termination. The possessions were placed in storage and when he could no longer pay the rental fees, they were impounded and sold. The Commission found "that a reasonable person in complainant's position would have taken steps to move or sell the property, knowing that his funds were nearly depleted." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Steenson v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A13535 (2003), the Commission treated a claim for expenses associated with the sale of a house and storage as a pecuniary damage issue. The complainant claimed that the agency's failure to hire him for a job in another state created such emotional distress that he was unable to deal with the responsibilities of home ownership. The complainant contended that had the agency hired him, it would have purchased his home and paid the related expenses. The Commission held that the complainant was not entitled to the expenses related to the sale of the home because he had not submitted evidence to establish that he would not have incurred those expenses if he was hired. However, the Commission did find that the complainant's proof of the causal connection between the stress of discrimination and the sale of his home was sufficient and awarded him $900 in storage fees related to the move from his home to an apartment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Eudy v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10060 (2003), was unsuccessful in pressing a claim for loss on the sale of a vacation home where the home was purchased shortly after she was terminated. Aside from proof problems, the Commission noted that "complainant did not exercise reasonable diligence when she purchased a vacation villa at a time when she had no income." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Where a discriminatory elimination of the complainant's job caused him to relocate and take a loss on the sale of his home, the complainant could recover that loss as part of a compensatory damages award. In <span class="Italic">Bartolomeo v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090013 (2009), the complainant relocated from Washington, D.C. to Toledo, Ohio to take a new job with the agency. He purchased a home in Toledo. Subsequently, his position was eliminated and the Commission found it was discriminatory. The Commission upheld the award of more than $42,000 in past pecuniary damages for loss on the sale of the home in Toledo when the complainant found a new job in Washington and relocated. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Bartolomeo</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find that the AJ's award, of $46,424.12 plus interest, properly compensated complainant for the loss incurred in the sale of his home in order to move from Ohio to Washington, D.C. The evidence of record establishes that complainant purchased the Ohio home in August 2005, shortly after he assumed the Toledo DFSD position, for $296,000. The record further indicates that complainant listed the home for sale in July 2006, after he learned his position was being eliminated. Complainant left Toledo in August 2006 to assume a new position he obtained back in the Washington area. It appears that the Toledo home was rented to the eventual purchasers in approximately November 2006. The renters purchased the home for $266,000, with a closing date of June 6, 2007. The rental payments and a deposit from the renters were credited back to them towards the purchase price of the home. Settlement statements indicate that complainant was required to provide a cashier's check in the amount of $46,424.12 at the closing of the house sale. Based on this evidence, we find that the AJ did not err in concluding that a $46,424.12 loss in the sale of the home was incurred by complainant as a direct result of the agency's discriminatory actions which resulted in complainant having to move back to the Washington area just one year after moving to Toledo.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing to a number of prior Commission cases, the agency argues that complainant is not entitled to reimbursement for the loss in the sale of his Toledo home because the claimed losses are too speculative. However, we are persuaded by the AJ's reasoning that the instant case is distinguishable for the cases referred to by the agency. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kerschner v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Labor,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01933023 (March 15, 1994), the Commission found discrimination in a non-selection and ordered complainant placed in the position in question, which required him to move from Colorado to Washington, D.C. Complainant in that case argued that if he had sold his home at the time of the non-selection, rather than years later when he was awarded the position, he would have received a higher price because of market conditions. Therefore, he sought damages for this asserted loss of value in the home. The Commission denied the request as too speculative, noting first that complainant had yet to sell the home, and then that any calculation of loss would involve speculative analyses of the housing market over time, the availability of potential buyers and the fluctuations of interest rates. Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Kerschner,</span> in the instant case, complainant has sold his home and the record establishes the exact dollar amount he was required to provide at the closing. The value to complainant's loss here is not subject to speculation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we are unpersuaded by the agency's argument that it was not responsible for the extent of complainant's losses because he chose to hold onto his home for a year after the agency's discriminatory action resulting in his selling in a declining market. The evidence supports the AJ's finding to the contrary, indicating that complainant listed the home for sale shortly after he learned his position was being eliminated, rented it with the option to buy, and sold it to the renters six months later. The record is clear that complainant would not have had to sell the house had it not been for the discriminatory actions of the agency, and supports a finding that he made reasonable efforts to mitigate his damages.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Commission's general view is that loss on the sale of a home is too speculative for an award of damages. In denying the claimed loss in <span class="Italic">Barrington v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120101822 (2011), the Commission explained the difference between that case and <span class="Italic">Bartholomeo</span> and <span class="Italic">Fonda-Wall</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claims that she is entitled to recoup the loss incurred from selling her home and associated moving and rental expenses. The record shows that Complainant's home sold for $185,900, and a comparison home sold for $215,000. Complainant seeks the difference in value of $29,100 and moving and rental costs in the amount $1,365.61.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has generally held that loss incurred from the sale of a home is too speculative to be compensable. <span class="Italic">See Rajterowski v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01984767 (June 20, 2000): <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Social <span id="Page_1952"></span>Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01976921, 01972185 (May 18, 2000); <span class="Italic">Kerschner v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933023 (March 15, 1994). Nonetheless, there are a few cases where the Commission has reimbursed a complainant for a home's reduction in value. <span class="Italic">See Bartolomeo v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720090013 (November 9, 2009); <span class="Italic">Fonda-Wall v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060035 (July 28, 2009). In Bartolomeo and Fonda-Wall, there was an undeniable nexus between the Agency's discriminatory conduct and the loss from the home sale because the complainants sold their homes in the context of an Agency transfer or reassignment. In the instant case, the Agency did not relocate Complainant. Complainant argues that the Agency's discriminatory actions caused her to "hastily" sell her home six months after the received the termination letter. However, Complainant testified at the hearing that she "panicked" three days after the removal took effect and put her home on the market. Complainant's choice to sell her home out of fear and before she received unemployment benefits, withdrew a hardship loan, or searched for other jobs attenuates the link between the Agency's discrimination and the sale.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, every home, sale involves numerous factors, such as changes in the market, the availability of potential buyers, and the quality of the surrounding community. Thus, we are unable to determine with accuracy whether the comparison home cited by Complainant is truly a fair comparison. However, we note that the comparison home was built more recently than Complainant's house, listed at a higher original sales price, and located in a different neighborhood. Even if we assume that the homes are similar and that the true value of Complainant's home was approximately $215,000, there is no evidence to indicate that the home would have sold for the true value if Complainant had been able to wait for more than six months before selling. In sum, Complainant's alleged loss from the hasty sale of her home is too uncertain. Accordingly, we deny Complainant's claim for the lost value of her home and associated moving and rental costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to recover on the loss of a home sale, the complainant must demonstrate that the discrimination was the proximate cause of the loss. <span class="Italic">Bustamante v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120120185 (2013). The Commission noted that the complainant made the mortgage payments that he ultimately claimed a loss for when he defaulted on the mortgage not because of the agency's discrimination but in order to have a place to live.</p>
