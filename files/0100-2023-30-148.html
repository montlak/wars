<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-139"><span class="space">h.</span> $35,001-$40,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency's denial of a two-year extension resulted in the complainant being separated from his family for that period of time, the Commission awarded $37,500 in damages. <span class="Italic">Danzie v. Secretary of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A42575.txt">01A42575</a> (2004). In <span class="Italic">Danzie</span>, the Commission, relying on <span class="Italic">Holler v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01982627 (2001), found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Using <span class="Italic">Holler</span> as a guide, the Commission holds that Complainant's non-pecuniary damages warrant an award of $37,500. This figure is half the amount issued to the <span class="Italic">Holler</span> complainant because the agency in <span class="Italic">Holler</span> caused that complainant to live apart from his family for four years, whereas the Agency in the case at bar is responsible for only two years of Complainant's familial separation. Additionally, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Holler</span> lived in undesirable conditions while apart from his family, though he was able to see his wife and children every weekend, whereas Complainant was deprived of his family's company for months at a time. The <span class="Italic">Holler</span> complainant also presented extensive corroborating testimony regarding his emotional distress, which Complainant did not provide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The $37,500 award for Complainant is also comparable to the $35,000 in non-pecuniary damages given to a complainant who moved from New York to Virginia as a result of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Parvin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01976913 (June 29, 2000). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Parvin</span> lived apart from his family for 18 months, and though he was not an ocean away like Complainant, the <span class="Italic">Parvin</span> complainant provided corroborating evidence to support his allegations of mental anguish.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $38,000 in damages was considered appropriate by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Murrell v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120103507 (2013), where the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant was awarded $15,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages and seeks a higher award. Complainant asserts <span id="Page_1864"></span>that she would still be "an active, productive employee of the [Agency]," rather than retired, if the Agency had provided her accommodation (allowing her to sit on a stool while she assisted customers at the service window). Complainant stated that, for the rest of her life, she will have physical pain and be unable to participate in sports, exercise, or tend to her family and home as she had in the past. She described the Agency's denial of accommodation as "calculated." Complainant provided a letter from her podiatrist, P1, stating that the Agency's failure to follow her recommendations "exacerbated" Complainant's plantar fasciitis. P1 also stated that Complainant became depressed due to her chronic pain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C1, who is Complainant's cousin and coworker, stated that Complainant used to be "energetic" and "outgoing" but now she can no longer clean her own home, cook, or attend her children's functions. C1 stated that Complainant's condition, plantar fasciitis, changed her life drastically. Another coworker added that Complainant does not participate in church functions, has problems walking and is usually depressed due to symptoms of her condition. Finally, C2, who is Complainant's longtime friend, stated "[w]hen [Complainant] had surgery on her feet, she could not do any of the things [she] used to do." C2 added that the lack of accommodation prevented Complainant's surgery from healing properly and caused chronic pain. Complainant provided documentation that she received psychological counseling services, related to her medical condition, in Summer 2009 and Summer 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01956390 (1998), the Commission increased an agency's award of compensatory damages from $10,000 to $40,000. The complainant had been subjected to both hostile environment and <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment over an extended period. In support of her damage claim, she presented the testimony of several doctors about the degree and expected duration of her emotional injuries. The Commission also was influenced by the fact that the agency's discrimination resulted in physical pain to the complainant because, as part of its discrimination, the agency ordered the complainant to carry a heavy surveyor's pack contrary to medical lifting restrictions placed on the complainant due to a preexisting degenerative disc disease. The Commission noted the physical pain had resulted in nausea and vomiting. The case could be significant in reasonable accommodation cases where there is some likelihood that failure to accommodate a disability could result in physical pain to the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the harm caused by the discrimination spanned some four years, the Commission increased an award of $15,000 by an administrative judge to $40,000. In <span class="Italic">Tramontozzi v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120053114 (2007), the Commission found that the award increase was justified even where the complainant had preexisting conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of his claim for non-pecuniary compensatory damages, complainant submitted a personal statement describing the impact of Dr. S's discriminatory actions on his self-worth, self-confidence, and status within the facility and his lapse into former negative and destructive behaviors, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> drug and alcohol abuse. Prior to his employment under Dr. S, he stated that he was happy, confident, enjoyed his work, and believed he was on track for promotions and upward mobility; he had been drug free for 20 years and did not engage in destructive behavior. Complainant described the difficulty he had withstanding her abuse and harassment, which happened on a daily basis over a period of several years. He described his difficulty with his drug and alcohol habit and detoxification efforts, his decent into severe depression and suicide attempts, and, finally, his decision to leave the agency in order to regain his self-esteem. His wife also submitted a statement describing the change in complainant and the impact of his negative behaviors on their family life, her efforts to prevent his suicide attempts, and their several attempts at detoxification. A close friend and his brother also reported about the changes in complainant's personality, and another friend verified his wife's account of stopping a suicide attempt. In addition, there are various medical reports about his medical problems over approximately 12 years. We note, however, that complainant is a Vietnam veteran and had experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the past; in addition, he was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $40,000 was made by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bull v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A12574 (2002), where the complainant experienced a variety of emotional problems over a period of two and a half years that caused her to seek medical help, including a period of time in an assisted-living center. The Commission also awarded $40,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Woodard v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01A11604 (2002), where the complainant suffered mood swings, loss of sleep, and weight loss and took six months off from work during which time she received therapy and took medication. In making the award, the Commission noted that the major depression the complainant suffered was not fully compensable because it was based in part on actions not found to be discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant has conditions that are not causally connected to the agency's discrimination does not preclude a significant damage award. In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A14976 (2003), the Commission awarded $40,000 in damages where the complainant suffered from back problems, major depression and post traumatic stress disorder. The Commission found that "the complainant's current condition, both mental and physical, is largely attributable to factors other than the supervisor's conduct; family stressors; a long-running dispute with the Department of Labor over the appropriate treatment of her oriGINAl back injury as well as the recurrence; the miscarriage; and complainant's continuing resistance to take any action to improve her physical condition;..." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $115,000 by the administrative judge was reduced to $40,000 on appeal where the complainant's emotional injuries were of relatively short duration and spanned only several months. In <span class="Italic">Myklebust v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A20124 (2003), the Commission found the judge's award was "monstrously excessive," where the emotional distress was severe and began in May but had largely abated by the fall. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Myklebust</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that the AJ erred in awarding $115,000.00 to complainant in compensatory damages. We find this amount is "monstrously excessive" standing alone and inconsistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. We note that the duration and severity of complainant's injuries are significantly less than those in the decisions cited by the AJ in support of her award. Complainant's emotional injuries occurred during the relatively short duration during the summer and fall of 1996. Testimony from complainant's husband and psychotherapist indicated that by fall of 1996, complainant was recovering. The AJ found that from May 10, 1996 to July 11, 1996, complainant felt like a failure; spent most days at home either sleeping or crying; slept through the day and was unable to sleep at night; had nightmares; had no social interactions and left the house during the first month only for appointments with doctors; was unable to produce or concentrate; had no control of her emotions; and lost weight. The AJ also found that complainant also ceased her nightly walks and developed a hyper arousal state: she is easily startled by loud noses in an environment that would not affect a normal person. Complainant's husband also testified to complainant's feelings of hopelessness and despair. Complainant was ultimately diagnosed with PTSD and major depression by P1 and was prescribed medication. P1 testified that complainant's depression, at the time of the hearing, was in full remission and had been in partial remission since late 1996 and early 1997, however, complainant would continue to have residual symptoms of both major depressive episode and PTSD. P1 further testified that complainant would continue to require medication and see a psychiatrist for an indefinite period. Complainant's husband also testified that she had improved greatly but is no longer as resilient as in the past. P1 testified that complainant is now different psychologically and physiologically.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency award of $5,000 in damages was increased by the Commission to $40,000 in <span class="Italic">Laughlin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A31040 (2003), where the financial problems created by the complainant's removal led to depression and emotional distress. The Commission rejected agency arguments that an retroactive OWCP award ameliorated the effects of the discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Laughlin</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his affidavit, complainant states that he has suffered greatly as a result of his removal from the agency. He states that he sought counseling from the Department of Veteran's Affairs and his minister for depression due to his inability to provide financially for his family after his removal. Complainant states that at times, for periods of one or two weeks, he was unable to leave his house due to the emotional distress. He recalls that he was placed on medications and began smoking and drinking after his removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife corroborates his claims, and states that complainant was distraught after his removal, and felt as if he had let his family down. She recalls that creditors called due to inability to pay bills, and that she was forced to obtain food stamps. Their marriage suffered and in March 1994, they separated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that complainant established a causal connection between the discriminatory action and the resulting emotional distress. Both complainant and his wife credibly recalled complainant's emotional distress, discussed it within the relevant time frame, and established that the discrimination was the proximate cause of his emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency essentially argues that complainant could not have suffered financial problems because he was retroactively compensated by the OWCP during the time of his removal and the rescission of his removal. After a careful review of the record, we do not agree with the agency's contention in this regard. The prior decision determined complainant had not yet been placed into a position with the agency following the rescission of the notice of removal. The record supports complainant's testimony that he suffered financially because of the agency's actions, and the agency failed to provide sufficient evidence for the record in rebuttal. Indeed, complainant's wife recalls that complainant's depression continued after he was compensated by OWCP and began drinking at that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1865"></span>Furthermore, the agency argues that complainant cannot prove that he suffered financially after the rescission of his removal notice because he was physically unable to work. The record contains a letter dated September 21, 1999, six years after the events in question, from complainant's physician who reports that complainant cannot work for an "indefinite period of time." Accordingly there is insufficient evidence in the record that complainant suffered financial problems due to factors other than the discrimination, such as physical injury, during the relevant period of time. Rather, the record supports the notion that complainant was qualified for a sedentary position during the relevant time period. Complainant established the requisite causal connection between the discrimination and his emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's testified that he suffered anxiety, depression, relationship strain, and financial stress due to the agency's actions. He states he sought counseling and was placed on medication. His wife states that she was required to obtain food stamps in March 1993. Accordingly, we find the agency's award of $5,000 inappropriate, and award complainant $40,000.00<span class="Italic">. See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Arreola v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03342 (January 17, 2002) ($52,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where the complainant and relatives stated that complainant suffered anxiety, isolation, depression, stress, humiliation, and injury to reputation when the agency terminated him); <span class="Italic">Campos v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03368 (January 25, 2002) ($52,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where the complainant and relatives stated that complainant experienced relationship strain, isolation, stress, humiliation, depression and injury to reputation as a result of his termination); <span class="Italic">Morra-Morrison v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01976222 (May 12, 2000) ($60,000 award for non-pecuniary damages where the agency failed to reasonably accommodate complainant and terminated her more than once, which resulted in depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, low self-esteem, marital problems, and alienation).</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant was awarded $40,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 07A30045 (2004). Although the decision is short on detail, the complainant suffered from mental anguish and worry, and her own testimony was supported by a therapist. The Commission similarly upheld an award of $40,000 in <span class="Italic">Dickerson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060043 (2007), where the complainant testified to an increase in treatment and medication following the discrimination, that testimony was supported by records from her physician, and family and friends provided statements regarding the mental changes they had observed in the complainant. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Menard v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720050023 (2007), for a summary affirmance of a $40,000 damage award and <span class="Italic">Scott v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0720070018 (2007), for a summary affirmance of a $40,000 award based on the testimony of the complainant and her family and friends without medical evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency award of $25,000 was increased by the Commission to $40,000 in <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05A41247.txt">01A31075</a> (2004), where the complainant testified that because of his termination he was evicted from his home, had to live in his car and could not find a job.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $40,000 in <span class="Italic">Neal v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40059 (2005), where the complainant suffered embarrassment, increased fatigue, stress and depression. The Commission credited the complainant's testimony that depression and fatigue were common symptoms of her preexisting fibromyalgia and her nonselection exacerbated those symptoms. The Commission also awarded $40,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120061600 (2007), where the complainant established he suffered from loss of enjoyment of friends, family and work, and a loss of health demonstrated by changes in habits, personality and appearance, but did not establish that a stroke he suffered was causally connected by the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant had nightmares, migraine headaches, crying fits and suffered from depression and anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and had been hospitalized for a week as a result of her depression, the Commission found an award of $40,000 in damages was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Thorpe v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080023 (2008), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At that hearing, complainant testified that beginning with her supervisor's initial advances towards her, she began "a real dark part of [her] life." She said she began to immediately suffer from nightmares, and started having migraine headaches, anxiety and depression. She said she had crying fits, and became sad and withdrawn. Complainant's coworker and friend corroborated complainant's testimony, and reported that complainant suffered from depression and humiliation, and became fearful, not wanting to move about the facility alone. He said she started waiting for him to arrive in the mornings to enter the facility. The coworker further reported that after her emergency suspension, complainant became worse and worried about domestic matters. He stated that although she is better now, "she will always be watching her back." Complainant also submitted medical records from her physician. Complainant noted that she had been diagnosed with major depression and post traumatic stress disorder. She was hospitalized with major depression for a week. The agency called no witnesses during the damages phase of the hearing, but submitted a written statement opposing any compensatory damages based on a letter from its Associate Area Medical Director, who had never seen or spoken to complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the testimony and medical records, the AJ found complainant established a link between her being subjected to sexual harassment and being placed on emergency off-duty status after she complained to management about the sexual harassment and the resulting emotional distress. The AJ awarded complainant $40,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages to compensate her for the discrimination. Specifically, the AJ found complainant suffered from major depression, permanent diminishment in quality of her life, and physical symptoms. The AJ found that following these events, complainant suffered depression, and started seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist. The AJ noted that complainant was out of work until the end of March 2007 when she returned part-time pursuant to medical advice, and that she became full-time in September 2007. The AJ also found that during the relevant period, complainant used over 500 hours of annual leave and sick leave as well as Leave Without Pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite finding error in the administrative judge's decision on damages, the Commission ultimately upheld the award of $40,000 in <span class="Italic">Gray v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720080022 (2008). The judge based his award, in part, on physical pain that the complainant had suffered. On appeal, the Commission found that the judge erred in attributing the physical pain to the agency's failure to accommodate noting that the evidence attributed the pain to an earlier on-the-job injury. Still, the Commission found that the award of $40,000 was supported by the testimony of the complainant and five friends and relatives, as well as medical documentation, that the complainant changed "from a happy, caring person to becoming devastated, broken, and unable to get out of bed for months."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $7,500 by the administrative judge to $40,000 where the complainant suffered from severe depression over an extended period of time. In <span class="Italic">Rea v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120090934 (2009), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth here above, the AJ determined that during this period, complainant worked more than 140 days outside of his eight-hour work restriction. In determining the compensatory damages amount, the AJ noted the testimony of complainant's sister, who stated that she noticed significant personality and behavior changes in complainant, as well as physical changes. Complainant's sister further indicated that complainant lost weight, did not bathe, did not take care of himself, and was listless. Complainant provided his own detailed statement which described a significant amount of emotional distress. In addition, complainant presented detailed reports from his physicians that shows complainant's work-place stress caused him to suffer intense emotional pain and suffering, anxiety and depression. The record reflects that in a form titled "Certification of Health Provider" dated June 14, 2006 for the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, complainant's physician described complainant's medical facts as follows: "depression with anxiety--the anxiety can be overwhelming at times resulting in incapacitation." The record also contains a copy of the physician's memorandum dated August 18, 2005 in which she explained complainant's absence from work by stating that he "has severe anxiety with depression which is aggravated by pressure experienced at work."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon our review of the evidence in the record and based upon Commission precedent, we find that the award of $7,500.00 in non-pecuniary damages for the instant matter was too low. However, we are also unpersuaded by complainant's appellate argument that a $150,000.00 compensatory damages award is reasonable. The Commission determines, instead, that a $40,000.00 award is appropriate, given the nature of the discriminatory action. <span class="Italic">See Tramontozzi v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120053114 (May 10, 2007) ($40,000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where complainant was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety, attempted suicide, and experienced severe depression and destructive behavior as a result of his work environment, but the record contained evidence of other contributing factors); <span class="Italic">Chevis v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A50169 (March 31, 2005) ($40,000 in non-pecuniary damages for depression, insomnia, crying spells, change in weight after failure to accommodate); and <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01981579 (September 7, 2001) ($40,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages due to a denial of reasonable accommodation and intentional disability discrimination where complainant suffered from physical and emotional harm, and was diagnosed with major depression). An award of $40,000.00 takes into account the nature, severity, and duration of complainant's suffering, is consistent with other non-pecuniary compensatory damages awards given in similar cases, and is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone or derived from passion or prejudice.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased a damage award of $20,000 to $40,000 in <span class="Italic">Diggs v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120081650 (2009), after finding that the complainant <span id="Page_1866"></span>suffered "significant emotional and physical problem" as the result of a hostile work environment. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Diggs</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that during the period of discrimination complainant experienced headaches, depression, panic attacks, shingles, loss of appetite, mood swings, trouble sleeping, high blood pressure, crying episodes, on occasion she threw up before going to work, and she stopped cooking and taking care of her grandson. Complainant endured a discriminatory hostile work environment for approximately four years. Agency management had notice early in that period that complainant's coworker was harassing her yet it did not undertake a concerted effort to remedy the situation. It is clear that an award of $40,000.00 is appropriate since it is based on the harm experienced as a result of the agency's actions, and it takes into account the severity of the harm and the quite lengthy period of time that complainant experienced the harm.</p>
