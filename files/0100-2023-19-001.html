<p class="noindent">Any claim of discrimination must include an allegation by the complainant that he or she has been personally harmed with respect to a personnel action, term, condition, benefit or privilege of employment. In addition, the complainant must allege that the harm is based on a characteristic protected by the antidiscrimination statutes--i.e., the harm is because of the complainant's race, color, sex, national origin, religion, age, disability, or genetic information. Finally, the proper definition of a claim must include an explanation of how the protected characteristic has been used to affect a personnel action, term, condition, benefit, or privilege of employment. In other words, with regard to the final aspect of a claim of discrimination, the complainant must advance a theory or theories of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The aspect of alleging personal harm in stating a claim of discrimination is discussed in Chapter 3, in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-12-052.html#sec3-52">Standing: Failure to State a Claim</a>." The aspect of alleging that the harm is based on a protected characteristic is discussed in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-22-001.html#sec13-1">13</a>, <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec14-1">14</a> and <a href="0100-2023-25-001.html#sec16-1">16</a>. Here, the discussion turns to the theories of discrimination, or how the complainant believes the protected characteristic has been used to inflict harm in a personnel action or in the application of a term, condition, benefit, or privilege of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are four primary theories used to analyze cases involving allegations of discrimination on the basis or race, color, sex, national origin, religion, age, or disability: the intentional discrimination theory, the disparate or adverse impact theory, the harassment theory, and the failure to make reasonable accommodation theory, though the latter applies only to religion and disability. As discussed more fully in <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec15-1">Chapter 15</a>, in passing the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of genetic information, Congress expressly excluded disparate impact cases relegating the matter to further study. Each of these theories provides an analytical framework under which evidence in cases can be evaluated to determine whether discrimination occurred in a particular case. The theory of discrimination advanced by the complainant is significant because it identifies the basic elements of the claim that must be proved by the complainant in order to prevail and it identifies the defenses that can be raised by the agency in defending against the claim. The elements of a claim and the available defenses determine the governing substantive law and that, in turn, defines what facts will be material in a given case.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is, in fact, a fifth "theory" of discrimination and that is the theory of retaliation or reprisal. Here, the term theory is used in quotes because retaliation or reprisal says less about how a protected category is used in an employment decision than it does about the protected category itself. In order to state a claim of retaliation or reprisal, the complainant must allege that he or she has engaged in some form activity protected under the antidiscrimination statues--i.e., he or she must allege participation in the EEO process or opposition to a discriminatory employment practice. Whether retaliation or reprisal is regarded as a theory or basis of discrimination, is discussed separately in <a href="0100-2023-26-001.html#sec17-1">Chapter 17</a> because such a claim has unique aspects that are not present in other claims of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, the discussion focuses on what the author designated as the theory of intentional discrimination. Intentional discrimination is just what the name suggests: the primary issue in these cases is the motivation of the agency supervisor or official who took or recommended the disputed personnel action or recommended implementation or implemented the term, condition, benefit, or privilege of employment. The theory of intentional discrimination applies to all bases of discrimination, including race, color, sex, national origin, religion, age, disability, and genetic information. In addition, the theory can be applied to retaliation or reprisal cases. There are two types of intentional discrimination cases: those cases involving circumstantial evidence of motive and those cases involving direct evidence of motive. The circumstantial evidence cases often are referred to as disparate treatment cases, though the label is somewhat of a misnomer because the actual analytical framework is broader and encompasses situations not involving disparate treatment. The direct evidence cases have also been referred to as mixed motive cases. However, in <span class="Italic">Desert Palace Inc. DBA Ceasars Palace Hotel &#x0026; Casino v.

Ct. 2148 (2003), the Supreme Court held that direct evidence of discrimination is not a prerequisite to giving a jury a mixed-motive instruction in a Title VII case. <span class="Italic">Desert Palace</span> is discussed in detail below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-19-091.html#sec10-84">Direct Evidence and Mixed-Motive Cases</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Cases involving circumstantial and direct evidence do not present two separate and distinct theories of discrimination. In each instance, the theory of discrimination remains the same: the employer has intentionally used a protected characteristic in making an employment decision. The use of circumstantial and direct evidence present two methods of analyzing the issue of motive, depending on the nature of the available evidence in a given case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The importance of focusing on the employer's motive in these cases was recently underscored by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch Stores, Inc</span>., <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20150601c53">135 S. Ct. 2028</a> (2015), where the Court found that knowledge of a protected category was not a required element of an intentional discrimination case under Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Abercrombie</span>, discussed more fully below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-19-028.html#sec10-21">Knowledge of Protected Group</a>," the plaintiff, a practicing Muslim who wore a headscarf, alleged religious discrimination when the store refused to hire her because she didn't fit the company's dress code. The company argued that it could not have engaged in discrimination under Title VII because she did not disclose her religion and did not ask for an accommodation. Rejecting the company's argument, the Court, in <span class="Italic">Abercrombie</span>, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, the intentional discrimination provision prohibits certain motives, regardless of the state of the actor's knowledge. Motive and knowledge are separate concepts. An employer who has actual knowledge of the need for an accommodation does not violate Title VII by refusing to hire an applicant if avoiding that accommodation is not his motive. Conversely, an employer who acts with the motive of avoiding accommodation may violate Title VII even if he has no more than an unsubstantiated suspicion that accommodation would be needed.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Emphasis in original.)</p>
<p class="noindent">Whichever method of proof is relied upon, the complainant must establish discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. "When the evidence is at best equipoise, Complainant fails to meet that burden." <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120122434 (2014), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Lore v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120113283 (2013) (Complainant failed to establish that witnesses made false statements where he withdrew his request for a hearing and credibility determinations were unable to be made); <span class="Italic">Brand v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120102187 (2012) (Complainant failed to establish that his coworker made offensive comments in a "he said, she said" situation where Complainant requested a final decision and an Administrative Judge did not make credibility determinations).</p>
<p class="noindent">The disparate treatment analysis is used most often in individual cases of discrimination. The basic premise is that if an employer treats some employees in one protected group differently than others in a different protected group that, in the absence of another explanation, the reason for the difference in treatment must be a basis prohibited by Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The classic case of disparate treatment is presented in a case alleging that an employee, for example a black employee, had his or her employment terminated for the same conduct engaged in by similarly situated employees of a different race or color, and that those employees were not terminated. There are, of course, an almost infinite number of variations on the theme depending upon the personnel action, or term or condition of employment at issue, and the basis of discrimination alleged. But the idea remains the same; the employer used a protected characteristic in making an employment decision and that generally makes itself most evident in the form of disparate treatment of workers. However, the theory is broad enough to apply to any set of circumstances, which if left unexplained, would permit an inference of prohibited discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the theory is broad enough to encompass both adverse treatment of a complainant because of a protected characteristic and preferential treatment of another for the same reason. In <span class="Italic">Buchholtz ten Brink v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A43661 (2005), the Commission ultimately rejected the complainant's allegation of discrimination but in doing so explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant, on the other hand, argues that she was singled out by management to not receive a permanent position because of her sex and age and that management created permanent positions for male research scientists with less tenure than her. She also argues that the agency's diversity goals require that she or another woman over 40 be hired. To this, the agency responds that the diversity goals set only guidelines or ideals for the agency to reach. The agency is prohibited by law to use age or sex as a basis for hiring. Furthermore, it states that complainant failed to show any proof that management singled her out based on protected bases and misused funds to create all-male positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency. Just as it is illegal for an agency not to hire someone solely because of their sex and age, it is generally illegal for an agency to hire someone because of their sex and age.</p>
<p class="noindent">EEO cases involving disparate treatment are fact-intensive cases. The disparate treatment analysis provides a framework for analyzing the facts of a particular case. It is not at all unusual for decisions of the Commission to have several pages of factual recitation and then dispense with the legal issues in a page or less. Development of the factual record in EEO cases is extremely important. This is not to say that disparate treatment cases never involve novel legal questions. In the majority of cases, though, development of the factual record is of primary importance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The disparate treatment analysis evolved because seldom is there direct <span id="Page_682"></span>evidence of intentional discrimination. For the most part, employers are simply far too wise to admit that they took a personnel action because of an employee's race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or disabled status. Still, there are a number of cases in which there is direct evidence of the employer's intent in taking a personnel action. These cases have also been referred to as "mixed-motive" cases because, invariably when there is direct evidence of discrimination, the employer will assert that it also was motivated by legitimate reasons and would have taken the same employment action even absent discrimination. In the past, these cases were analyzed differently than disparate treatment cases. As noted above, in <span class="Italic">Desert Palace, supra</span>, the Supreme Court held that direct evidence of discrimination is not a prerequisite to giving a jury mixed-motive instructions. Although this holding affects the analysis of circumstantial and direct evidence cases, it still is important to distinguish between the two types of cases. When a complainant presents direct evidence of discrimination, an employer cannot meet its burden of proof simply by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason as it can in circumstantial evidence cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">This chapter focuses on the theory of intentional discrimination. The bulk of the chapter is devoted to disparate treatment cases simply because most intentional discrimination cases involve circumstantial evidence. "<a href="0100-2023-19-091.html#sec10-84">Direct Evidence and Mixed Motive Cases</a>" are addressed in the section below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The theory of disparate or adverse impact involves the application of a facially neutral employment criterion that has the effect of disadvantaging a certain protected class or classes under the discrimination acts. Most often, it finds its application in class action complaints but it may also be used in individual complaints. There is no requirement that a complainant alleging adverse impact must pursue his or her complaint on behalf of all class members similarly affected by the challenged practice. An example of a case involving adverse impact would be a weight-lifting requirement for a particular job or jobs that has the effect of disqualifying a disproportionate number of female applicants. In order to sustain the use of such a criterion, the employer must show that the requirement is a business necessity for that particular job. Adverse impact, as a theory, is discussed in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec11-1">Chapter 11</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The third theory for analyzing cases of discrimination is the harassment or hostile environment theory. Early case law was developed in cases involving racial and national origin discrimination, but recent emphasis has been on cases involving sexual harassment. The harassment theory of discrimination, with the exception of what was formerly known as <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment and currently labeled tangible employment action harassment, does not involve personnel actions. Instead, the theory focuses on the work environment itself. The central question in an harassment case is whether the conduct of an alleged perpetrator has the purpose or effect of creating a hostile work environment because of a person's race, color, sex, national origin, religion, age, or disability. Harassment, as a theory of discrimination, is discussed fully in <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a>, with an emphasis on sexual harassment because that is the area where most of the recent case law has developed and continues to develop.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, there is the theory of reasonable accommodation. The theory of reasonable accommodation applies in only two instances. Under Title VII, an employer must reasonably accommodate the religious beliefs and practices of an employee unless doing so would create an undue hardship. Under the Rehabilitation Act, an employer must reasonably accommodate the limitations of an employee who qualifies as an individual with a disability, unless the accommodation would create an undue hardship. Although reasonable accommodation is a separate theory for analyzing cases of discrimination, it cannot be fully understood outside the two contexts in which it applies. In part, this is because the employer's burden of reasonable accommodation is different, depending on whether accommodation is required under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act. For this reason, the theory of reasonable accommodation based on religion is discussed separately in <a href="0100-2023-22-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>, along with the other bases of discrimination under Title VII, and disability accommodation is discussed in <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec15-1">Chapter 15</a>, along with disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The disparate treatment theory was virtually unchanged by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. However, the Act specifically overruled the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 490 U.S. 642, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 104 L. Ed.2d 733 (1989), decision and reinstated its previous holding in <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971), under the adverse impact theory of discrimination. Although the theory itself did not change, the respective burdens of proof placed upon employees and the employer did change, as did the standard of evidence required to demonstrate adverse impact. The <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> and <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> decisions, as well as the 1991 Civil Rights Act, are addressed in Chapter 11 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec11-2">The Griggs Case</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-20-002.html#sec11-3">The Wards Cove Case</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The theory of disparate treatment was revisited by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993). Just how much the theory changed, or did not change, is still the subject of some debate. A deeply divided Court spent much of its opinion in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> arguing that very question. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, insisted that <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> merely restated the existing law. Justice Souter, joined by three other justices, started his lengthy dissent by lamenting the fact that the majority had brushed aside 20 years of well-established employment discrimination law. <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is discussed in detail below under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-19-057.html#sec10-50">Hicks and the Burden of Persuasion</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">A discussion of matters particular to the burdens of proof for the individual bases of discrimination is included in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-22-001.html#sec13-1">13</a>, <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec14-1">14</a>, and <a href="0100-2023-25-001.html#sec16-1">16</a>, which deal with discrimination under Title VII, discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, and discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Burden of proof matters specific to reprisal cases are discussed in Chapter 17 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-26-044.html#sec17-45">Proof in Reprisal Cases</a>."</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec10-2"><span class="space">I.</span> CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE CASES</h2>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC has adopted the analytical formula set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973)<span class="Italic">. McDonnell Douglas</span> is one of the seminal cases involving discrimination and should be read in its own right. It is probably one of the most frequently cited Supreme Court cases. As far as cases involving circumstantial evidence in general and disparate treatment in particular are concerned, they all begin with some variation of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>.</p>
