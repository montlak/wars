<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-33"><span class="space">U.</span> WHISTLEBLOWING</h3>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that the agency engaged in reprisal for whistleblowing is not within the purview of EEO. <span class="Italic">Foley v. Department of Navy</span>, 01860737 (1986). Whistleblowing, defined as exposing agency waste, mismanagement, and fraud, is covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(8) and is not within the confines of Title VII. The prohibition against reprisal in Title VII is limited to matters within the scope of Title VII and is not a prohibition against reprisal in general. But, the agency in <span class="Italic">Foley</span> erred in dismissing the portion of the complaint that alleged reprisal for filing an informal EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission analyzed the difference between pure whistleblowing activity and those that involve allegations of discrimination in <span class="italic">Jill M v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2021000550 (2021). In that case, a guidance counselor alleged that the agency discriminated against her based on race and in retaliation when she disclosed student transcript irregularities. Thereafter, her "transcript-related duties" were removed from her workload. She contacted an EEO counselor, but later withdrew the complaint in favor of a union grievance. The complainant alleged that her EEO complaint followed her for the next seven years from school to school within the agency and culminated in her suspension. The Commission in <span class="italic">Jill M</span>. found that the complainant established a <span class="italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal for one period of her employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal, Complainant must show that: (1) she engaged in protected activity, (2) the alleged discriminating official was aware of the protected activity, (3) she was adversely affected by an action of the agency contemporaneously with or subsequent to the protected activity, and (4) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <span class="italic">Hochstadt v. Worcester Found. for Experimental Biology, Inc.,</span> 425 F. Supp. 318, 324 (D. Mass.), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976), <span class="italic">see also Whitmire v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00340 (Sept. 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first prong of the <span class="italic">prima facie</span> analysis, "protected activity" refers to either participation in the EEO process or acting in a reasonable, good faith manner to oppose discriminatory practices in violation of EEO statutes. <span class="italic">See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 2, B.11, (May 12, 2000) (EEOC Directive No. 915.003), <span class="italic">citing EEOC v. Romeo Community Sch</span>., 976 F.2d 985, 989-990 (6th Cir. 1992), <span class="italic">Contra Lambert v. Genesee Hosp</span>., 10 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir. 1993), <span class="italic">cert. denied</span>, 511 U.S. 1052 (1994). Participation in the EEO process includes filing a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the applicable statute, regardless of the validity or reasonableness of the oriGINAl allegation of discrimination. <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A fair reading of the record, including the AJ's discussion of Complainant's testimony, which he deemed credible, indicates that Complainant's reprisal claim is based entirely on her whistleblowing activity. The Commission has previously held that whistleblower activities that do not involve allegations of discrimination are outside the purview of the EEO process. <span class="italic">Giannu v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Devel</span>., EEOC Request No. 05880911 (Feb. 13, 1989) (holding that appellant failed to state a claim regarding allegations of retaliation for her whistleblower activities), <span class="italic">Foley v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05860403 (July 2, 1987) (holding that whistleblowing is not within the confines of Title VII), <span class="italic">see also, e.g., Complainant v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120845 (Apr. 11, 2013) (allegation of reprisal for whistle-blowing activities regarding fraud, waste and abuse, including reporting misappropriation of congressionally mandated funds to the Inspector General, did not identify EEO activity protected under Title VI) and <span class="italic">Phillips v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120071050 (Apr. 12, 2007) (reprisal claim based <span id="Page_1485"></span>on complainant's assertion that, "throughout the years, I have uncovered much fraud, but no recognition was given, and I was retaliated against, for forwarding proof of what I had found," properly dismissed as it did not identify protected activity).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, under some circumstances, the Commission has found that whistleblower activity constitutes "protected activity." <span class="italic">See, e.g. Hood v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120111403 (Dec. 16, 2011) (complainant's whistleblower activity of frequently and vocally opposing "illegal and discriminatory personnel management practices," and referring to his prior experience as an EEO Program Manager at another agency was sufficiently protected to state a claim of retaliation), <span class="italic">see also, Hairston v. Dep't of Educ</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120071308 (Apr. 15, 2010) (whistleblower report where complainant detailed his perception of the agency's non-compliance with Commission regulations constituted protected activity, and record evidence that agency management was aware of this protected activity, and management's failure to support its proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for subsequently lowering of the complainant's performance rating, established that the complainant was subjected to retaliation). When assessing reprisal claims that allege retaliation for both EEO activity and whistleblower activity, the Commission has only accepted the reprisal claim to the extent that it was based on EEO activity, disregarding whistleblower actions that, on their own, would not constitute "protected" activity. <span class="italic">See Jones v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01985898 (July 13, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Activity 2008-2010</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's whistleblower activity constitutes "protected activity" under the first prong of the analysis to the extent that she raised it with an EEO counselor of other official in February or March 2008. It is undisputed that Complainant discussed her whistleblower activity with ECM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second prong is also satisfied because the evidence reflects that P1 became aware of Complainant's protected activity in or around March 2008, when ECM called Complainant at work and P1 answered. However, Complainant has not demonstrated that any other responsible management official was aware of her EEO activity. The AJ's assumption that there was "a strong possibility [P1] communicated this information to others within the Agency" is not supported with evidence or testimony based on direct knowledge. Complainant's ongoing "unprotected" whistleblower activity, discussed extensively in the record, has a stronger temporal nexus with the alleged retaliatory actions. Therefore, we find the record does not support a <span class="italic">prima facie</span> case for retaliation with respect to Complainant's whistleblower activity before P1 had knowledge of her EEO activity in March 2008 and after P1's retirement in 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for Prongs 3 and 4 of the <span class="italic">prima facie</span> analysis, Complainant experienced adverse treatment in the form of a poor performance appraisal and involuntary reassignment by P1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's performance appraisal and involuntary transfer occurred shortly after P1 became aware of Complainant's EEO activity, establishing a nexus between the protected activity and the adverse action. Additionally, Complainant's transfer was reversed once P1 retired. The AJ identified an additional adverse action--P1's removal of Complainant's transcript responsibilities. However, this occurred immediately upon Complainant's return to work, so it predates P1's knowledge of Complainant's protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant established a <span class="italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal for prior protected activity from March 2008 through September 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Activity 2010-2013</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that this time frame diverges from the AJ's finding that even after P1's retirement in 2010, "the continuous and sustained adverse action across schools and time, create a further deterrence [from engaging in EEO activity], given that Complainant would be unable to know who to trust." While Complainant may have experienced adverse employment actions as reprisal, she did not establish that the responsible Agency official were aware of her prior EEO activity once P1 retired, and there is no nexus between the adverse actions that occurred after P1's retirement and Complainant's prior EEO activity. Rather, Complainant makes it clear that the adverse actions by P2, P3, and DS, were related to her whistleblower activity, by emphasizing its significance and relation to Management's retaliatory response. For instance, Complainant's affidavit testimony states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It took me a short while to learn the magnitude of my reporting the transcript alterations and the politics involved. I learned that there was involvement of one of the leaders at AMHS was involved because her daughter was one of those whose transcript bad been altered for her to be able to get into the best colleges and universities after high school graduation. I considered myself doing my job when I reported the alterations. I later learned I bad uncovered something that had been kept quiet and had in the past been allowed to happen.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, the incident Complainant identifies as triggering ongoing alleged retaliatory acts by P2 does not reference EEO matters and was not raised with an EEO counselor. Rather, Complainant recounts how administrators from another school questioned P2 about the accuracy of a student's transcript, and Complainant and AP responded to the school that they could not provide sufficient documentation to verify the transcript. Afterward, Complainant felt that she was "under the microscope from then on." Although Complainant also states, "[t]he transcripts started a downward spiral and led to disparate treatment and discrimination," she does not identify specific instances of discrimination by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ repeatedly identifies Complainant's whistleblowing activities related to transcript irregularities as the basis for the Agency's alleged retaliatory actions between 2007 and 2013, but other than the claims in Complainant's 2008 informal EEO complaint, there is no evidence that Complainant's whistleblower activity is "protected" within the meaning of our statutes. Complainant continued reporting transcript irregularities well after P1's departure from the Agency, and the record reflects that that these new whistleblower incidents incited the alleged reprisal by P2, P3, and DS rather than Complainant's informal EEO complaint years earlier.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's whistleblower activities from 2010 through 2013 do not constitute "protected activity" under EEO statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Title VII does not provide protection for "whistleblowers" <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span>. However, it is possible that Title VII can provide protection to whistleblowers when the claim is that they are treated less favorably than whistleblowers of a different color. The Commission explained the distinction in <span class="Italic">Houston v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01913942 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that it properly decided to reject appellant's allegation in as much as "whistle-blowing" is not within the confines of Title VII. The agency cites <span class="Italic">Folley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Number 01860737 (August 11, 1986), in support of its contention. Appellant, on the other hand, argues that since he alleged in his complaint that the agency treated two "whistle-blowers" differently on the bases of their race and sex, his complaint is covered under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Folley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission stated that the agency properly rejected appellant's claim that he received a marGINAl performance rating in retaliation for "whistle-blowing" on his supervisor. Specifically, we stated that "[r]eprisal for whistle-blowing...is a violation of 5 USC 2202(b)(8), and under the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel of the Merit Systems Protection Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission also stated that the whistle-blowing was "not within the purview of 29 CFR 1613 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant's subsequent request to reopen this case was denied<span class="Italic">. Folley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, EEOC Request Number 05860403, (July 2, 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Giannou v. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Request Number 05880911 (February 13, 1989), the Commission decided the case in which the appellant alleged, in part, that she had been subjected to reprisal in the forms of disparate treatment and removal from the agency because she participated in "whistle-blowing" activities. In this decision, we found that appellant failed to state a claim within the purview of 29 CFR 1613.212. We also stated, however, that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[h]ad the appellant alleged that she was treated differently as a female Hispanic "whistle-blower" than were male and/or non-Hispanic "whistle-blowers," then she may have framed a separate allegation of disparate treatment. Had she alleged, for instance, that male and non-Hispanic employees who report irregularities are not disciplined or terminated, but she was, she could be found to have made out an allegation of disparate treatment based on sex and national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case currently before us, appellant stated on appeal that "[w]hile whistle-blowing<span class="Italic"> per se</span> [is] not within the purview of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of [1964], [in] my case we have a difference in treatment of me (black male) and another whistle-blower (white female)." We subsequently find that inasmuch as appellant has alleged that he is an aggrieved employee who has been discriminated against on the grounds of race and sex, that appellant has alleged disparate treatment under Title VII, despite his reference to "whistle-blowing."</p>
<p class="noindent">Providing a congressional representative with information about alleged agency violations of the ADEA is a protected activity under the opposition clause. It does not matter that the complainant characterizes this activity as "whistleblowing." An allegation that he was retaliated against for making the disclosure is within EEO purview. <span class="Italic">Hanlin v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01934695 (1993). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hood v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120111403 (2011) ("whistleblowing involved past EEO activity and opposition to employment practices he believed to be discriminatory).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar and more decisive result in <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0120071308 (2010). In that case, the complainant, an EEO specialist, was given the task of reviewing the agency's EEO programs. <span id="Page_1486"></span>The complainant recommended several changes to the program, including that the EEO director report directly to the agency head as required by MD-110. The complainant was told that his recommendations "upset" senior management. The agency argued that the complainant's activity was not protected under Title VII and that instead it constituted whistleblowing. In rejecting that argument in <span class="Italic">Hairston</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the agency argues that complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination because he was engaged in whistleblowing. Final Agency Decision at 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Adeniji v. Administration for Children Servs., NYC</span>, 43 F. Supp.2d 407, 421 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)). In <span class="Italic">Adeniji</span>, the court denied a municipal government employee relief under Title VII for whistleblowing about government waste. We easily distinguish between that situation and complainant's status as a federal employee concerned with the administration and structure of EEO programs at his agency. As such, we find that complainant was engaged in protected activity. Moreover, the agency was aware of complainant's EEO activity, which occurred close in time with an adverse performance rating. Therefore, we find that complainant satisfied his burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal. The agency responded with legitimate explanations for its conduct; namely, that complainant's detail was an advancement opportunity and that his performance rating was justified by his job performance.</p>
