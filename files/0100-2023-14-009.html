<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-9"><span class="space">3.</span> Intent of the Parties</h4>
<p class="noindent">Settlement agreements are contracts and, as with all contracts, it is the intent of the parties at the time of their signing the agreement that governs. The intent of the parties is gleaned from the language of the agreement, as well as the parties' understandings at the time of signing and the actions of the parties subsequent to signing. Although the understandings of the parties and their actions subsequent to signing can be used to interpret settlement agreements, the primary factor in determining the intent of the parties is the plain language of the settlement agreement. Where the plain language of the settlement agreement is clear and unambiguous, the language alone controls and the Commission will not look at any other factors as an aid to interpreting the agreement. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Levitz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01912174 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Settlement agreements are contracts between the complainant and the agency, and it is the intent of the parties as expressed in the contract, and not some unexpressed intention, that controls the contract's construction. <span class="Italic">McLendon Wilson v. Clarence Thomas, Chairman, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01881684 (October 13, 1989); <span class="Italic">Jenkins-Nye v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01851903 (March 4, 1987); <span class="Italic">Roberts v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01842193 (May 8, 1985).... The intention of the parties to a contract, and the meaning of the contract, are deduced from the language and contents of the contract, and, where the terms are plain and unambiguous, the contract is conclusive. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">First American National Bank of Nashville v. Automobile Ins. Co.</span>, 252 F.2d 62 (1958).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the contract is not "conclusive," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, when the precise language of a settlement agreement is subject to interpretation, the Commission will look to the intent of the parties. This does not mean the Commission will disregard the language of the agreement. Rather, the Commission will look to other factors from which the meaning of the language used can be determined. One factor the Commission will review is the actions of the parties subsequent to the signing. The subsequent actions of the parties are relevant to the extent that they reflect the parties' understanding of the agreement they entered. For example, in <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Postmaster General</span>, 05901072 (1990), the complainant and the agency entered an agreement that provided, in part, that the employee would be awarded back pay consistent with the agency's employee relations manual. Subsequent to signing the agreement, the agency made back pay calculations. However, the agency later refused to give the employee back pay, contending that she had not made reasonable efforts to secure alternative employment as required by the employee relations manual. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Carroll</span> had little difficulty in determining that the intent of the parties was to award the appellant back pay and that only the method of calculation was subject to the provisions of the employee relations manual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In interpreting a contract, one should look to the language of the contract and to the intention of the parties at the time the contract was made. (Footnote omitted.) The agency argues that under the explicit language of the settlement, the appellant is not entitled to back pay. We disagree. The disputed settlement term provided, in part, that "complete back pay will be awarded." This connotes the actual <span class="Italic">payment</span> of back pay. The term is qualified by "in accordance with Chapter 436 of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual." The plain reading of this qualifying language is that it goes to the calculation of the payment of back pay, and not to the eligibility of back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our reading of the explicit language of the settlement is supported by the evidence of the intention of the parties when the settlement was made. The appellant states that she settled her complaint in exchange for reinstatement and back pay. Moreover, soon after the settlement was signed, agency officials endeavored to calculate how much back pay should be paid. This is evidence that the agency intended to pay back pay when the settlement was signed. It was not until more than a year after the settlement was signed that agency officials in the Regional Office, who apparently did not participate in making the settlement, determined that appellant was not entitled to back pay. The intention of the parties at the time the settlement was made, however, is controlling....</p>
<p class="noindent">Settlement agreements that include references to rules, regulations, or other documents should not, as a matter of course, be signed until those rules, regulations, or documents have been fully reviewed. Review can eliminate needless enforcement actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that in <span class="Italic">Carroll</span>, although the Commission looked to the actions of the parties after signing the agreement in interpreting the terms of a settlement agreement, it is the parties intent at the time of entering the agreement and not some later point in time that controls. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LeBlanc v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05920886 (1993). In <span class="Italic">LeBlanc</span>, the agency agreed to promote the complainant to a position in a specific regional director's office. After the fact, the agency tried to interpret this to mean any component of the agency within any department of the office of director. The Commission rejected that interpretation, in part based upon possible positions that were discussed <span id="Page_343"></span>during settlement negotiations, as well as agency documents showing that at the time of negotiations, the director's office was considered to be a separate and distinct entity.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">LeBlanc</span>, the Commission found the actions of the agency after signing the agreement irrelevant to its intent at the time of signing because those actions were not consistent with the actions of the agency prior to signing the agreement. As a result, the agency's actions prior to signing the agreement revealed more of its intent at the time of signing. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Carroll</span>, the agency's actions immediately after signing the agreement did reveal its intent at the time of signing. The attempt to calculate the back pay benefits demonstrated the agency's understanding in entering the agreement that it would be liable for back pay. That attempt undermined its later efforts to repudiate the agreement by applying the mitigation provisions of the employee relations manual.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, whether the actions of one or both of the parties after signing the agreement is indicative of the intent of the agreement is a factual determination made on a case-by-case basis. For example, in <span class="Italic">Warkentin v. Postal Service</span>, 0120083774 (2009), the settlement agreement provided that the agency would offer the complainant a clerk's job in a particular post office. The complainant maintained that the agency had breached the agreement when it offered him a part-time instead of a full-time position. Looking beyond the four corners of the agreement which merely indicated that the agency would offer a clerk's position, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Warkentin</span>, admitted extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, however, complainant has provided evidence that the parties intended the "clerk position" to mean full time clerk. To that extent complainant has provided an email from the attorney for the agency--written after the agreement was signed--wherein she states "It is my understanding that [complainant] is filling a new window clerk job, and will be a regular full time employee. Please confirm." Only then does the agency indicate complainant was made a part time flexible clerk. While the Commission normally relies on the four corners of the document to interpret its terms, the Commission is convinced that complainant, his attorney, and the agency's attorney had a meeting of minds that the "clerk position" referred to therein meant a full time position at the time the document was signed. Indeed, complainant was a full time regular letter carrier prior to his reassignment. He fully understood that he would give up his seniority. Given the circumstances of this case, the Commission finds that the agreement has been breached and that complainant is entitled to having the terms implemented.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general matter, all words, whether written or spoken, require some degree of interpretation. The mere fact that some degree of interpretation is required does not mean the plain language of a settlement agreement is vague or ambiguous. For example, if a settlement agreement requires that the agency provide the complainant with vacancy announcements for specific jobs, the agency will not be found in breach because it did not refer him for other similar jobs. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 05930029 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, the Commission rejected an argument that because the terms "laborer" and "maintenance mechanic" were not capitalized in the settlement agreement they referred to general categories of jobs and not specific positions. The terms of the agreement were given their plain language meaning, regardless of punctuation.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Hanley v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01932071 (1993), the Commission found the agency had violated the plain language meaning of the agreement where a provision stated the appellant would be "placed in" a particular course and the agency only allowed the appellant to audit the course. The Commission held the plain language meaning of "placed in" was that the appellant would be allowed to earn credit for the course.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency, in a settlement agreement, consents to requesting that its employees will cease harassing a complainant, it does not suffice for the supervisor merely to inform the complainant's coworkers of the harassment allegations and to inquire if they were harassing the complainant. The supervisor must tell the employees to cease any harassment. <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05930921 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency violates the plain language meaning of an agreement that provides for placement of the complainant "effective immediately" when it delays the actual appointment for six months. <span class="Italic">See Hartman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932433 (1993). When a settlement agreement mandates that the agency will provide cultural diversity training to its work force, it does not comply by merely offering the training to employees. The intent of the agreement was not merely to make the training available, but to ensure that all staff participated in the training. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Longus v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01941038 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In entering a settlement agreement, the parties obviously must understand the clear meaning of the agreement. The parties also must understand the "unspoken but clear intent of the text of the settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">Dela Cruz v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05930717 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Dela Cruz</span>, the agency entered into an agreement whereby it consented to process an earlier allegation of discrimination in exchange for withdrawal of a later spin-off complaint. At the time of the settlement, the agency's position was that the earlier allegations of discrimination were untimely. The Commission found that in settling the spin-off complaint, the agency waived its timeliness objections to the earlier complaint. The Commission held that "any reasonable person" would have understood that the agency was waiving such objections by agreeing to process the complaint. The agency's arguments concerning the truthfulness of the complainant's assertions about his earlier contact with an EEO counselor were irrelevant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the Commission's case law, it appears that if an agreed upon transfer is for the purpose of separating the complainant from other workers or supervisors, that purpose must be expressed in the agreement in order to give the agreement full meaning. In <span class="Italic">Wynne v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01955745 (1996), the complainant alleged that the agency breached a settlement agreement where it transferred her to a new work location in accordance with the agreement, but also transferred her supervisor to that work location. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Wynne</span>, found the agency did not breach the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that the agency has breached the settlement agreement by transferring her immediate supervisor to the same location, on the same date, as appellant. In essence, appellant contends that the intended remedial effect of the transfer provision, to remove appellant from a hostile work environment, has been nullified by the concomitant transfer of appellant's immediate supervisor, one of the sources of the hostile environment appellant sought to escape. Thus, appellant argues that the agency has violated the clear intent of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission finds that the agreement has not been breached, based on both the language and the apparent intent of the agreement. Although appellant argues that the intent of the transfer provision was to remove appellant from contact with particular persons, there is no support for this interpretation in the language of the agreement. The agreement does not provide, for example, that specified persons will not be allowed to work with or supervise appellant. Indeed, the purpose of the transfer provision is nowhere specified in the agreement: appellant and the agency could have had a variety of reasons for including this provision. Interpreting the agreement according to the plain meaning of its terms, as we must, the Commission finds that appellant and the agency agreed only that appellant would be transferred out of her current position and into a specified different assignment<span class="Italic">. See Klein, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Eggleston, supra</span>. Both parties agree that this transfer has occurred. Therefore, appellant has not demonstrated any breach of the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Commission finds that appellant has not shown any breach of the intent of the agreement. Appellant appears to argue that, by transferring her immediate supervisor to her new work assignment, the agency has thwarted the intent of the parties to remove appellant from a difficult work environment. If appellant's immediate supervisor had played any role in the two complaints which this settlement agreement was intended to resolve, the Commission might find appellant's argument more persuasive. However, appellant concedes that her immediate supervisor began supervising her in January, 1994, well after the complaints which led to the settlement agreement had been filed. Therefore, we cannot agree that the settlement agreement at issue here was intended to remove appellant from the supervision of a person who was not her supervisor when she filed her complaints. Appellant has filed a subsequent complaint involving the actions of her immediate supervisor; a potential resolution of this complaint could conceivably involve separating appellant from this supervisor. However, there is no reason to assume the parties entered into the settlement agreement before us with that intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Commission therefore finds that the agency has not breached the settlement agreement, this is not to say that the Commission is not troubled by the timing of the transfer of appellant's immediate supervisor, particularly in light of the fact that appellant had filed a complaint challenging this supervisor's actions. The Commission advises appellant that allegations that subsequent acts of discrimination violate a settlement agreement must be processed as separate acts of discrimination, rather than as an alleged breach of the settlement agreement. Therefore, should appellant wish to contest the transfer of her immediate supervisor as an act of discrimination or reprisal, she must contact an EEO Counselor and file a separate complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did not give a good explanation of why it should be troubled by the transfer if not for the very same reasons that the complainant alleged the agency was in breach of the agreement. Certainly, it seems the complainant was deprived of the benefit of her bargain by the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">When language within a settlement agreement appears to be in conflict, the more specific language will take precedence over the more general language. For example, when a settlement agreement specifically enumerates the complaints it purports to settle, the Commission will not extend any contrary language in the agreement to other complaints. <span class="Italic">Sikka v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05920720 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Sikka</span>, the settlement agreement specifically identified four complaints that it resolved. A later provision stipulated that the complainant agreed to withdraw the four enumerated complaints, but also contained a clause providing "this includes all formal and informal complaints <span id="Page_344"></span>currently pending in the administrative process...." Finding the language of the agreement to be ambiguous, the Commission looked beyond on the actual language of the agreement to glean the intent of the parties. In addition to the complainant's contention that a complaint not enumerated was not included in the settlement agreement, the Commission noted that the settlement provided no "remedial allowance" for denial of a performance award which formed the basis of that complaint. However, the Commission indicated it would have reached a contrary result in the absence of a provision enumerating the complaints. In such a case, the general provision including all formal and informal complaints would have extended to the performance award complaint, even in the absence of "remedial allowance."</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless otherwise specified in an agreement, language is interpreted according to its usual meaning. This is particularly true with "terms of art" that have a well-accepted meaning in the field of employment law. When such terms are used in a settlement agreement, the Commission will presume that, had the parties intended anything other than its normal meaning, the language of the agreement would make that intent clear. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920009 (1992). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, rejecting an agency argument that the term "seniority" as used in a settlement agreement should be given a restrictive meaning:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the settlement agreement provision in question reveals that appellant was to be granted "retroactive seniority" to November 21, 1987, after the 90 day probationary period passed, and providing the APWU was in agreement. The concept of seniority generally encompasses both the allocation of benefits among competing employees (competitive seniority) and noncompetitive benefits earned under the employment agreement (benefits seniority). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Franks v. Bowman Transportation, Co., Inc.</span>, 424 U.S. 747, 767 (1976), <span class="Italic">citing</span> S. Slichter, J. Healy, &#x0026; E. Livernash, The Impact of Collective Bargaining on Management, 104-115 (1960). The settlement agreement in the present case contains no language which in any way limits or qualifies the retroactive seniority to be granted. The Commission finds that it is reasonable to interpret the term "retroactive seniority," without such qualifying language in the agreement, as encompassing seniority for both benefits purposes and competitive purposes. Accordingly, due to the failure of the agency to expressly state in the settlement agreement that retroactive seniority was being granted only for bidding purposes, the Commission concludes that appellant is entitled to retroactive seniority for all purposes, including the competitive status seniority which he was previously granted (seniority for bidding purposes), and benefits seniority, such as seniority for the purposes of wage step increases, leave, and pension benefits. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted below in the section on Terms of Art, the Commission has had considerable difficulty deciding whether "seniority" as used in a settlement agreement is truly a term of art.</p>
<p class="noindent">In gleaning the intent of the parties, the Commission may look to the underlying allegations of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Ayers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01920775 (1992), the agency agreed that it would notify the Office of Workers' Compensation that inaccurate information had been submitted by the agency in connection with the complainant's workers' compensation claim. Thereafter, on two occasions, the agency wrote to OWCP regarding information that was "incorrectly submitted." The Commission determined that the agency was in breach of the settlement, based in part upon its review of the underlying allegation of discrimination in which the complainant contended her supervisor had intentionally placed inaccurate information in her OWCP file.</p>
<p class="noindent">The language of the settlement agreement and surrounding circumstances not only can be used to determine the intent of the parties as an aid to interpreting the terms and conditions of settlement; they can be used to determine the intent of the parties as to whether an actual agreement ever existed. For example, as previously noted, the Commission generally will not enforce oral settlement agreements. In <span class="Italic">Bers v. Environmental Protection Administrator</span>, 01912719 (1991), the Commission explained why:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The alleged settlement agreement in the present case has not been reduced to writing and its terms are therefore unclear and unenforceable. The Commission cannot determine whether either party knows and agrees to the alleged conditions. If either party is unaware of or mistaken as to an essential term, the contract could be voided. If there were any future disputes as to the terms, enforcement would not be practicable. (Footnote omitted.) Since there is no evidence of a contract, the Commission will not force the parties to comply with its alleged terms.</p>
<p class="noindent">Essentially, the Commission held that it cannot determine the intent of the parties where there is no discernible evidence of their respective intentions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission acknowledged one exception to its prohibition against oral agreements. Where the parties enter an oral agreement before an EEOC administrative judge, and the terms of the agreement are entered into the hearing transcript, the Commission will acknowledge the existence of an oral agreement. <span class="Italic">Acree v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05900784 (1990); see section above on "<a href="0100-2023-14-007.html#sec5-7">Oral Agreements</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when an agreement is reached before an administrative judge and entered into the hearing transcript, the terms and conditions must be knowingly and voluntarily accepted by both parties for the agreement to be binding. No binding oral agreement was reached where the administrative judge, after reading the terms into the record, indicated the agreement was tentative and the parties would be given several days to put the terms of the agreement in writing<span class="Italic">. Gelin v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05930307 (1993). The case was specifically distinguished from <span class="Italic">Acree</span> based on the qualifying language. In other words, the language used in <span class="Italic">Gelin</span> did not exhibit an intent to enter a binding agreement; it only exhibited an intent to continue negotiating the specific terms and conditions of settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the other hand, the indication of the administrative judge that the terms of the settlement agreement entered into the hearing transcript will subsequently be reduced to writing does not mean the parties did not reach a binding oral agreement. The agreement is binding where the administrative judge asked both parties, on the record, if they agreed to the terms as entered into the record and they responded in the affirmative. <span class="Italic">Kusel v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01932844 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Neither party can unilaterally impose settlement on the other party, except for in cases where an agency makes an offer of full relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> discussion, below. A case cannot be settled through a memorandum signed solely by the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Defense, DLA</span>, 05940628 (1994), the complainant contended that a memorandum he signed constituted an agreement to settle his case. Even though the memorandum stated he was withdrawing his complaint based on the assurances outlined in the memo and he produced corroborative testimony to that effect, the Commission determined there was no meeting of the minds and, therefore, no settlement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we consider this information, we still find that the previous decision properly affirmed the agency's rejection of the first settlement breach allegation. The only writing manifesting the parties intent is a memorandum signed by appellant. As noted in the previous decision, a binding settlement agreement requires a contemporaneous meeting of the minds<span class="Italic">. See Mullen v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890349 (May 18, 1989). Appellant's memorandum acknowledges that he is withdrawing his complaint based on certain assurances and a committee appointment. The agency did not sign this writing. While the Captain's personal commitment may have encouraged appellant to withdraw his complaint, this is not the same thing as a binding, bargained for exchange of promises. The former Coordinator's statement was drafted seven years after the fact. His recollections could easily pertain to appellant's withdrawal and are not sufficient to overcome the factors militating against finding that a formal settlement agreement was executed. Moreover, as a practical matter, it appears that appellant received everything that was purportedly agreed to.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not clear that the outcome of the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> case would have been the same had the complainant raised some substantial issue about compliance. Although the Commission likely would have still concluded that no settlement agreement existed, it may have taken a different view of the withdrawal of the complaint under the circumstances. When a complainant premises the withdrawal of his complaint upon the agency meeting certain conditions, the complaint should not be deemed withdrawn unless those conditions are met.</p>
