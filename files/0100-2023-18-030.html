<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-30"><span class="space">2.</span> Standard for Disqualification and Suspension</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although usually invoked for repeated misconduct, disqualification or suspension can be invoked for a single incident of flagrant misconduct. Furthermore, disqualification or suspension is not limited to contumacious conduct in the hearing process; it can be a sanction for contumacious conduct at any stage of the complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110 at 7-32 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disqualification of a Representative from Future Hearings</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standard for suspension and disqualification</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the case of repeated or flagrant improper conduct by a representative, the Administrative Judge or the Commission may take further action. Section 1614.109(e) provides that the Commission, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, may suspend or disqualify from representing complainants or agencies in future EEOC hearings any representative who refuses to follow the Administrative Judge's orders or otherwise engages in improper conduct. These provisions apply not only to conduct at the hearing stage of the case but also to all other actions taken by a representative in the course of an EEO proceeding, including the appeal. A disqualification applies to future representation of a party before the EEOC, at both the hearing and appellate stages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Quinones</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> the Commission reversed the sanction of disqualification of the complainant's counsel and held that no sanctionable conduct had in fact occurred. Counsel for the complainant in <span class="Italic">Quinones</span>, in the context of responding to a motion for summary judgment, attached an EEOC response to a Freedom of Information Act request reflecting a breakdown of the decisions issued by the presiding judge. In less than a half page of a 15 page response:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The attorney wrote that the complainant "hurls himself, in hopes of being one of the few, but knowing he has little or no chance of a positive finding," in light of the AJ's "stark" low rate of positive findings for employees and "overwhelming" rate of cases decided without a hearing. The response predicted that given this record, the "AJ. . .will actually do the agency's work and find obscure evidentiary data, which will support the negative finding she will most surely make."</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge issued a show cause order in the case, by facsimile, which also referenced an alleged incident some years earlier in which counsel had accused the judge of being biased against Hispanics and gave counsel 24 hours to respond. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Quinones</span> had little trouble deciding the conduct, while disrespectful, was not contumacious and warranted no sanction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We wish to take this opportunity to discuss the merits of the disqualification. We find that the conduct of the attorney was insufficient to support any sanction, let alone disqualification. In one motion, the attorney briefly cited the AJ's prior record of decisions in support of the argument that the complainant did not expect to be fairly heard, and attached the response to a FOIA request. While this is disrespectful, it does not rise to the level of contumacious conduct warranting sanction. The conduct was not repetitive, did not occur in the presence of the AJ, and was not so egregious that no warning by the AJ should be given. Moreover, the FOIA response was a document generated by the Commission, so attaching it to a motion and referring to it was not contumacious. Further, the AJ's reliance on a four year old case where the attorney allegedly accused the AJ of being prejudiced against Hispanics does not support a sanction in the current case. This isolated incident occurred too long ago to be relevant. Moreover, the attorney denied that the comment was made. Given this, it was incumbent on the AJ to describe when the incident occurred, what was said, and the attorney's role in it, but the AJ did not do so.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Arredondo</span>, <span class="Italic">supra.</span> the Commission found that the complainant's counsel did engage in contumacious conduct, but also found that the sanction of disqualification was too harsh. Once again, the dispute started with a motion for summary judgment that was served on the complainant's counsel, at a previous address. Counsel for the complainant had not specifically entered a notice of change of address, but his new location was reflected on his letterhead. Ultimately, the agency was able to serve the motion by telefax and complainant's counsel requested an extension of time to respond. The motion was denied and the judge, demonstrating that no one is above ill considered behavior, sent the denial to counsel's former address and also served it by telefax.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not to be out done, counsel responded with a motion to reconsider the extension of time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The contumacious conduct cited by the AJ occurred in counsel's request that the AJ reconsider her extension denial. After arguing that the agency previously had his current address, and hence had an obligation to serve him there, counsel stated the AJ's conclusions were "totally tainted and distorted," "corrupt," and that the AJ appeared to be ignoring the regulatory obligation of service to "fit her excuse" not to grant an extension. In reaction to the AJ's finding that counsel did not give the EEOC proper notice of his updated address and the denial of extension being sent to his former East Travis Street location, counsel also argued that the AJ "refuses to read the signature block of the undersigned's. . .motions," "intentionally posted her last order to the undersigned's former address," that the AJ's conclusion is "asinine as best," and she attempts to "shirk any responsibility." In an apparent reference to the AJ's statement that the Commission had to learn of the representative' s updated address from the agency's representative, counsel contended that it appeared that the AJ engaged in an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. The AJ asked the Hearings Technician to notify the parties that a pre-hearing conference scheduled for October 26, 2004 had been canceled, but prior notification did not occur. In reaction to the pre-hearing conference being canceled without notification, counsel continued that it was "ironic" that the AJ would fault him, and asked "how thoughtless and prejudicial can an AJ get."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, the AJ sent counsel an order to show cause why he should <span id="Page_667"></span>not be sanctioned. The order identified many of the written remarks considered to be contumacious, and listed possible sanctions, including counsel being removed as the representative in this case. In response to the show cause order, counsel repeated many of the remarks he made before by reprinting large sections of his reconsideration of extension request, and added that the "AJ. . ., a GS-14 civil service employee, has no right to attack [counsel's] integrity by stating he did not serve notice upon the EEOC or the agency that he had [relocated]."</p>
<p class="noindent">In an ensuing show cause order, the judge identified the contumacious conduct and listed the possible sanctions, including removal from the case. Responding to the show cause order, counsel repeated many of his earlier statements. Even though the judge, by that time, had disposed of the case on the merits, he issued an order disqualifying counsel from any further participation in the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Arredondo</span>, the Commission found that counsel's conduct warranted the imposition of a sanction, but that disqualification was too severe:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that counsel's conduct was contumacious. While counsel's motion to the AJ to reconsider her denial of his extension request addressed the AJ's rulings in denying the request and contended an extension should be granted, it did so in a way that contained personal insults against the AJ that were very disrespectful. The representative's correspondence was copied to the complainant and the agency. Examples of personal insults included that the AJ appeared to ignore the regulatory obligation of service to "fit her excuse" not to grant an extension, that the AJ "'shirks any responsibility,'" that the AJ conclusions were "corrupt" and "asinine at best," and so forth. When asked to explain his conduct in the show cause order, counsel reprinted much of his prior motion which contained the insults, and added that the AJ was a GS-14 civil service employee with no right to make the ruling she did regarding the address of record. While counsel has the right and obligation to vigorously represent his client by making argument explaining why certain rulings should be overturned, the personal insults were contumacious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that disqualifying counsel from the case was too severe a sanction. First, the AJ issued a notice to show cause why he should not be removed as counsel after the first offending written correspondence by counsel. The AJ did not give any warning telling counsel to stop his contumacious conduct before issuing the notice to show cause. Given the level of the offense committed by counsel,<span class="Italic"> i.e</span>., personal insults of moderate severity in one written motion aimed at an AJ's rulings, we find that the AJ should have given some warning before the notice to show cause on why counsel should not be removed from the case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Snowden v. Department of State,</span> 11 M.S.P.B. 119,12 M.S.P.R. 487 (1982) (presiding official did not abuse her discretion in ejecting the complainant's attorney toward the end of the hearing for repeated disruptive and disrespectful conduct therein after the attorney stated in no uncertain terms that he would not alter his conduct);<span class="Italic"> Blanton et al. v. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 15 M.S.P.R. 605 (the complainant's representative continually disrupted the hearing with rude and arrogant behavior showing disrespect and contempt for both the presiding official and the Merit Systems Protection Board. The presiding official repeatedly warned counsel that his behavior was unacceptable and this would occur if his misconduct continued. When the misconduct continued, the presiding official canceled the hearing); <span class="Italic">Macdraw, Inc. v. The Cit Group Equipment Financing, Inc., et al,</span> 994 F. Supp. 447 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (two of the plaintiffs attorneys <span class="Italic">pro hac</span> vice admission to the court was revoked where after an adverse ruling they sent a letter to the judge asking for his immediate attention to whether he knew two prominent Asian Clinton appointees and to identify any personal, business or political relationship, business, political, or personal dealings with them or persons related in any way to the Clinton Administration. They also asked whether the judge read certain media articles. After the judge summoned them to appear, one spoke on their behalf and acknowledged that the questions were asked in part because of the judge's race (Asian). The attorneys had no basis for asking such questions, and when they appeared one advised the judge of the canons of judicial ethics, suggesting he "search his. . .soul").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The contumacious conduct here was not as severe as that described in <span class="Italic">Macdraw</span>, <span class="Italic">Snowden</span> and <span class="Italic">Blanton</span>. The contumacious insults by counsel were rooted in making relevant arguments against the judge's rulings, i.e., that the agency and AJ knew or should have known of his address, not in a wholly unrelated attack based on the judge's race. Unlike <span class="Italic">Snowden</span> and <span class="Italic">Blanton</span>, prior to the notice to show cause, counsel's conduct occurred in one motion, and it never happened in the presence of the AJ. Much of the contumacious language in counsel's response to the show cause order occurred in reprinted language from his prior motion. Unlike <span class="Italic">Blanton</span>, counsel did not get repeated warnings. Unlike <span class="Italic">Snowden</span>, the record does not show at this point that counsel refuses to stop his misconduct. Counsel's motion to the EEOC's San Antonio District Office arguing for a lifting of the sanction against him contains no contumacious language. While the sanction made in the instant case by the AJ was less severe than the sanctions in <span class="Italic">Macdraw</span> and <span class="Italic">Blanton</span>, the later cases illustrate situations where sanctions were considered for misconduct by representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that the AJ did not abuse her discretion in finding counsel's conduct warranted a sanction. The question is what sanction is appropriate. The court in <span class="Italic">Kelley et al. v. Same,</span> 82 F. 794 (8th Cir. 1897) provides some guidance. Here, an attorney filed an amended bill which contained "scandalous matter" and "offensive criticisms" in trial court. The trial court ruled that the amended bill would be removed from the court filings and sealed, and the attorney had 30 calendar days to submit a new bill. A similar sanction would have been useful here, i.e., decline to consider the oriGINAl motion for reconsideration of the AJ's extension denial unless a new motion absent personally insulting language was submitted. Such a sanction could be made under the AJ' s inherent authority to maintain decorum, and would not require a show cause order. An additional sanction could have included that counsel not charge his client for fees and costs associated with submitting the new motion. This would shift the fees and costs associated with contumacious conduct on counsel, a disincentive for continuing such conduct. If contumacious conduct worsened or continued, further sanction could be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At this stage, we find the appropriate sanction is that should the complainant ultimately prevail on the merits of her removal claim, the agency will not be required to pay fees or costs associated with the counsel's filings containing the insulting remarks to the AJ, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>., the motion to the AJ to reconsider her extension denial and the response to the show cause order. This sanction is appropriate in any event under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e), which authorizes the payment of attorney fees by the defendant agency to the prevailing complainant. Attorney fees for the duplicate work of resubmitting a motion without contumacious language as well as responding to a show cause order caused by his contumacious conduct are not reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted.) The Commission also found that counsel was not required to file a formal notice of change of address and that his correspondence with the EEOC hearings unit which included his new address was sufficient notice.</p>
<p class="noindent"> A sanction of payment of $312.50 in court reporter costs and a 60--day suspension from representing anyone in a case pending before the EEOC's New York District Office was upheld against a nonattorney representative. <span class="Italic">In the Matter of Debby Szeredy</span>, 11A60001 (2006), the administrative judge denied the complainant's request to postpone the hearing filed just four days before its scheduled date. Subsequently, the agency and complainant arrived for the scheduled hearing, but the complainant's representative did not. After giving the complainant's representative an opportunity to respond, the administrative judge proposed the above sanctions and certified the matter to OFO. If the complainant's representative did not comply with the sanction of payment of court reporter costs, the judge proposed that the suspension be extended to 90 days.</p>
<p class="noindent">In upholding the sanctions in <span class="Italic">Szeredy, the Commission wrote:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e) provides that an AJ may, upon reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, suspend or disqualify a representative from representing complainants or agencies in EEOC hearings who refuses to follow the AJ's orders or otherwise engages in improper conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEO MD 110, Chapter 7, Section V (pages 7-23 through 7-29) governs the exclusion, disqualification, and suspension of representatives. Exclusion by an AJ applies to the hearing process on the current case on which a representative is representing a complainant. Disqualification or suspension of a representative by an AJ applies to barring a representative in the future from representing complainants or agencies in future EEOC hearings or all other actions taken by a representative in the course of an EEO proceeding, including the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at section V.B.1. (page 7-28). Disqualification or suspension is a more severe sanction than exclusion, and is used for repeated or flagrant improper conduct by a representative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The AJ's proposed sanction did not exclude the respondent. Rather, it suspended her from serving as a representative for a time in any case not presently pending before the EEOC's New York District Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an individual engages in repetitive misconduct or conduct justifying exclusion, disqualification or suspension may be considered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at section V.A.4. (page 7-26). An individual may be excluded by an AJ for refusal to obey orders of the AJ. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at section V.A. (page 7-23).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The general standard for exclusion of a representative is contumacious conduct, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>., willfully stubborn and disobedient. Contumacious behavior or disruptive conduct warranting exclusion may include any unprofessional or disruptive behavior; degrading, insulting or threatening verbal remarks or conduct; the use of profanity; or conduct engaged in for the purpose of improperly delaying the hearing. Willful failure to appear for a hearing is also considered contumacious conduct. <span class="Italic">Bates v. Baez</span>, N.Y.S.2d 424, 299 A.D.2d 382, 749 (2002). Normally, any pattern should be manifest within a single case, but the AJ may consider other improper conduct engaged in by the individual on any previous occasion before that judge, a different AJ, or the Commission. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at V.A.3. (pages 7-25 &#x0026; 7-26). Unless the improper conduct is so egregious as to <span id="Page_668"></span>compromise the order required for a fair and orderly proceeding, the AJ normally should first warn the offending person to stop the conduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at V.A.5. (page 7-26).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sanctions should be proportional to the nature and degree of the improper conduct. With respect to sanctions against a representative, the AJ should be mindful that a party to the EEO process is entitled to be represented by an individual of that party's choice, and the representative is expected to be an advocate for the party's interests. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at page 7-24.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before a representative is disqualified or suspended for misconduct by an AJ, the AJ must give notice of the specific conduct that is the basis for the proposed disqualification or suspension, describe the proposed sanction, and give an opportunity to be heard, which is accomplished by a show cause order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Chapter 7, Section V.B.2. (pages 7-28, 7-29). Where a show cause order is issued by an AJ on why a representative should not be disqualified or suspended for improper conduct or a refusal to follow orders at the hearing stage, the AJ will certify the matter to the EEOC, Director, Office of Federal Operations, for a determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at page 7-29.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While not precisely on point, there are court cases that provide some guidance on the appropriate action to be taken by a judge faced with situations similar to the instant matter. <span class="Italic">In the Matter of McAlevy</span>, 94 N.J. 201, 463 A.2d 315 (1983), an attorney's right to practice law was suspended for three months for failure to appear at a series of criminal trials before one judge scheduled to occur on the same day, and engaging in disrupting and insulting conduct during a criminal trial. Regarding the failure to appear, the court did not accept the defendant's excuse that he had a scheduling conflict with another court because he made no effort to resolve the conflict and did not notify the court where he failed to appear of the conflict. In <span class="Italic">The Florida Bar v. Ossinsky</span>, 255 So.2d 526 (Sup. Ct. Fl. 1971), the defendant was suspended from the practice of law for six months after he failed to notify his client of his scheduled criminal trial and did not appear at it, resulting in his client's forfeiture of $400 worth of bail bonds and issuance of a writ for his client's arrest. The defendant then failed to notify his client of the forfeiture. When his client was arrested and jailed, the defendant did not respond to his client's calls for help, left his client to resolve the matter on his own, and made no restitution. While these cases involve attorneys, the respondent, by virtue of her practice before the EEOC's New York District Office, owes it a duty to follow the orders of the AJ and not engage in contumacious conduct. Also, while not owing the type and level of professional duty to her clients as an attorney, by agreeing to represent them she owes them a duty to act in their interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to Show Cause Orders 1 and 2, the respondent was warned by the AJ, through actions and words, that her conduct of failing to appear and not complying with orders to take certain actions was unacceptable. Her previous failure, along with her client in <span class="Italic">Areno</span> to appear at a hearing resulted in the action of denial of her client's request for a hearing. In <span class="Italic">Braue</span>, the AJ warned the respondent that she should not rely on personal presumptions that administrative requirements or formalities can be ignored.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the finding in Show Cause Order 2, for the reasons stated therein, that the respondent acted in bad faith when she failed to appear at the hearing of July 15, 2005. This finding was based on a well-developed record, including transcribed questioning by the, AJ of <span class="Italic">Youmans</span>. The respondent's reasons for her failure to appear are incredible. Moreover, by her own admission, the respondent advised her client, the complainant, not to appear, compounding her bad faith. The failure to appear was both contumacious and did not comply with the AJ's scheduling order setting forth the hearing date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Less than a year before, the respondent and her client failed to appear at a hearing in Areno. While the respondent and Areno claim that they notified the AJ they could not appear, they provide no documentation of this, and the respondent's writings suggest she is referring to the notice in her postponement request. Given that the postponement request was denied, some form of further notice was required. The AJ's arrival at the scheduled hearing site is evidence that the respondent did not notify the AJ that she and her client were not going forward.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding her failure to comply with AJ's orders in Braue and Youmans to take certain actions, such as starting discovery and submitting witness lists, the respondent explained that because she was not granted official time by the agency, she did not have time to do $6. The respondent contends that in July 2003, the official time she was granted to work on EEO matters was limited to eight hours a week, and starting in September 2005, she was denied all such official time. However, in not complying with the orders of the AJ, she only raised the lack of official time with the AJ after failing to comply. Hence, this is not grounds to reverse the proposed sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The respondent's misconduct harmed her clients and the EEOC's New York District Office's ability to properly and effectively adjudicate cases. In both hearings where the respondent failed to appear, the AJ came to the hearing site, a postal facility located in Newburgh, NY, where the respondent works, resulting in loss of time for the AJ and the opposing party. The loss of time for the opposing party in <span class="Italic">Youmans</span> was significant. Further, not complying with the AJ's orders to start discovery and submit witness lists was harmful to the interests of her clients and the adjudication of justice. Moreover, the respondent was warned prior to her misconduct in <span class="Italic">Youmans</span>. This conduct warrants sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the respondent's misconduct was not as severe as in the cases of <span class="Italic">In the Matter of McAlevy</span> and In <span class="Italic">The Florida Bar v. Ossinsky</span>, the proposed sanction she was given was proportionate to the misconduct in which she engaged. The sanctions in the above cases were broad, suspending all legal practice throughout the applicable states. The proposed sanction against the respondent was narrowly tailored to apply only to her practice before the EEOC's New York District Office (where the misconduct occurred) on cases not already pending there. Hence, the respondent's clients with pending cases before the EEOC's New York District Office would not lose their choice of representative, nor clients whose cases are at the pre-hearing or post-hearing stage. Given that the respondent claims that she is unable to follow AJ's orders due to lack of time, this temporary sanction is fitting while the respondent and her clients make efforts to resolve the official time matter. The lengths of the proposed sanction are also proportional to the respondent's misconduct, and are upheld.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the proposed sanction to charge the respondent court reporter costs for failure to appear is intertwined with the proposed sanction to suspend her, and both proposed sanctions were certified to OFO, we will also rule on the costs matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has assessed costs against a party who in bad faith failed to appear. In <span class="Italic">Comer v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950649 (May 31, 1996), the Commission ordered that the agency pay costs to a complainant incurred as a result of its bad faith failure to notify the complainant that it would not appear at a deposition. Courts have required representatives to personally pay costs for their bad faith conduct caused the opposing party.<span class="Italic"> See Coston v. Detroit Edison</span> <span class="Italic"> Company</span>, 789 F.2d 377, 379 (6th Cir. 1986) (failures to appear); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Groner</span>, 124 F.R.D. 605 (D. Virgin Islands 1986) (filing multiple irrational and irrelevant motions grounded in a bad faith refusal to accept rulings of court).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Show Cause Order 2 proposed that as a sanction for the respondent's conduct, the respondent was personally liable to pay $312.50 in court reporter costs paid for by the agency which was caused by the respondent's bad faith non-appearance at the July 15, 2005 scheduled hearing, and a sixty-day suspension (expandable to ninety days for non-payment of costs) of serving as a representative in any case not presently pending before the EEOC's New York District Office. This assessment of costs is consistent with the above case law. To the extent that it can be argued that two above-cited court cases involved more severe misconduct, we note the costs assessed in the instant matter against the respondent were more measured. For instance, in all the above-cited cases, the sanctioned party or individual was made liable for attorney fees incurred by the opposing party as a result of the sanctioned misconduct, not just a small amount of costs. Further, the respondent was given the choice of not paying in exchange for a 30 day expansion of her suspension. The costs assessed against the respondent personally were reasonable, and are upheld.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the Commission considered the conduct of the complainant's representative in two previous cases even though she was not actually sanctioned for that previous conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, <span class="Italic">In the Matter of Lamar W. Sessions, Jr.</span>, 1120060003 (2008), the Commission upheld a suspension of 120 days and costs of $267.30 for the travel of four witnesses who traveled to a hearing that had to be postponed when the complainant failed to appear. The complainant's lay representative had not communicated with his clients since shortly after the issuance of the acknowledgment order in the case. The Commission found that the failure to communicate resulted in several misrepresentations to the administrative judge and the agency during the course of discovery, motions, and prehearing submissions. The 120 suspension could be extended to 180 days for nonpayment of the costs assessed.</p>
