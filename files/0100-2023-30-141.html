<p class="noindent">There is no presumption of entitlement to compensatory damages and it is possible for a complainant to prevail on a complaint and not receive a damage award. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gunther v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110103 (2012), the Commission found that the complainant was not entitled to an award of damages explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of her claim for non-pecuniary damages, Complainant's husband testified that Complainant became socially withdrawn beginning in April 2006 and her preoccupation with work-related issues became a contributing factor to their separation in August 2006. The Commission notes that the harm alleged occurred prior to S2's January 2007 comments. Further, when asked specifically what affect S2's request to drop her EEO complaint had on her, Complainant simply stated that S2 did not know the nature of S1's comments and attitude towards her. Thus, the AJ determined that Complainant had presented no evidence showing she suffered any harm from S2's encouragement to drop her EEO complaint. The Commission concurs with the AJ that based on Complainant's testimony and the lack of evidence of any harm suffered as a result of the conversation with S2, Complainant has not shown that she is entitled to pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Godbolt v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120110169 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $500 was considered adequate in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs,</span> 0120122266 (2012), where the complainant's damages evidence was only her own testimony that her health was impacted by an increased stress level causing migraine headaches. She also testified that she suffered from insomnia, hair loss and extreme paranoia of the workplace. Similarly, the Commission rejected, on appeal, complainant's contention that he was entitled to $80,000 in damages and affirmed an agency award of $500 where he claimed retaliation dating back to 2001, but only proved retaliation on two days when he was not allowed to wear a coat. In <span class="Italic">Celine D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120150178 (2017), the Commission awarded $500 for <span class="Italic">per se</span> reprisal committed on one day. In <span class="Italic">Celine D</span>., the complainant testified that she "felt like a little rat in a room full of snakes when PM did it. I was like, okay, and I didn't know what to think or what was going to be next."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Degbeh v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03387 (2002), the Commission awarded $600 in damages where the complainant's only evidence of damages was her own testimony. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Jojola-Jemison v. Postmaster General</span>, 01970027 (1998), was awarded only $500 in damages where her claim of emotional distress was supported only by her own testimony and did not include any corroborating testimony. The Commission also noted that the complainant did not seek medical treatment until some 18 months after the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Citing the <span class="Italic">Jojola-Jemison</span> case, the Commission awarded $500 in <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A02120 (2002), where much of the claimed stress occurred prior to the discrimination or was unrelated to the discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Rastogi v. Broadcasting Board of Governors</span>, 01A03707 (2003), the Commission awarded $500 where the complainant's only evidence of damages was that he went home depressed on the day he received his performance appraisal. An award of $250 was made by the Commission in a similar case in <span class="Italic">Price v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01995310 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $750 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120130053 (2015), where "the AJ found that Complainant suffered only minimal amount of emotional distress that was attributable to the <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation, which was only short lasting. The AJ in this case awarded Complainant $750.00 because she found the bulk of Complainant's emotional distress was caused by personal problems which were unrelated to her employment, the processing of her EEO complaint, and her belief that she was subjected to sex discrimination."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Weatherspoon v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01966395 (1999), the Commission awarded $1,000 in nonpecuniary damages where the complainant suffered from headaches and stomach upset, but did not seek treatment, discuss her distress with any coworkers, or present any corroborating evidence in support of her damage claim. In <span class="Italic">Vereb v. Attorney General</span>, 01990136 (1999), the Commission issued a $1,000 damage award, noting that the complainant submitted only limited evidence of damages related to the actual discrimination. Similarly, a $1,000 damage award was warranted in <span class="Italic">Mozell v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01981521 (1999), where the complainant's testimony was not specific about the nature and duration of the harm suffered. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15177 (2002), the Commission awarded $1,000 in damages where the complainant maintained he suffered an increased level of stress but made no attempt to further define the symptoms or their duration. An award of $1,000 was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Galos v. <span id="Page_1831"></span>Postmaster General</span>, 01A04409 (2002), where the distress was of short duration and only partially caused by agency discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02246 (2002), the Commission awarded $1,000 in damages where the complainant experienced a sense of worthlessness and loss of self-esteem as the result of not being hired, but could not establish a causal connection relative to dropping out of school or having a stroke a few years after the nonselection. In <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03636 (2002), the Commission awarded $1,000 in a case where the complainant testified that she suffered shame, embarrassment and headaches whenever she was with the coworker who engaged in harassment and that the discrimination also contributed to the breakup of her marriage.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $1,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Baum v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A24091 (2003), where the complainant testified that she experienced stress, frustration and marital difficulties as the result of discrimination. She also testified that she began seeing a counselor and was on prescribed medication for emotional distress. In awarding only a $1,000, the Commission noted that none of the complainant's testimony was corroborated by family or friends, and her physician's notes provided only that she was in counseling during the relevant time period without any indication of why the complainant sought counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where most of the complainant's damage evidence focused on events not found to be discriminatory, the Commission found an award of $1,000 in damages was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Goode v. Social Security Administration</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a31901.txt">01A31901</a> (2004), the Commission found that the complainant did not establish that most of her evidence of harm was causally connected to the discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Capers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A43600 (2004), the Commission awarded $1,000 in damages where the complainant testified she felt embarrassed and suffered a loss of self-esteem from being escorted out of the building. In <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A53500 (2005), the Commission awarded $1,000 in damages where most of the complainant's evidence related to her stress at being placed on an oxygen tank 24 hours a day, but the discriminatory event was the agency's delay in giving the complainant a handicapped parking space.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the only discrimination found involved a charge of .25 hours of AWOL, the Commission awarded $1,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Pina v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a53196.txt">01A53196</a> (2006), the Commission noted that much of the claimed distress occurred over a period years due to an alleged hostile environment, but the complainant did not prevail on that claim. In <span class="Italic">Young v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A60006 (2006), the Commission upheld an award of damages where the complainant was harassed by a male coworker who intimidated her. The complainant testified that she suffered from headaches, stress and humiliation and had her ex--husband move back in with her because she felt threatened. Similarly, the Commission awarded $900 in damages in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51956 (2006), where the complainant testified that a denial of leave caused him to suffer from headaches, sleeplessness, and exhaustion, but there was no evidence that the complainant sought medical treatment. The Commission also deemed an award of $1,000 appropriate in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060062 (2007), where the complainant suffered loss of sleep, anxiety and depression.</p>
<p class="noindent">General claims of mental anguish without supporting detail or evidence supported only a $1,000 damage award in <span class="Italic">Degnan v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120065106 (2008). The Commission also noted that although the complainant sought counseling, he did not do so until five months after the discrimination. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Foster v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120121598 (2013), the Commission awarded $1,000 noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated generally that she has suffered anxiety attacks, has been prescribed medication, and no longer feels safe as a result of M1's actions. Although Complainant failed to isolate damages that she incurred related to the posting of her letter to her congresswoman from damages she may have incurred due to her unsuccessful claims, the Commission finds that Complainant has sufficiently established an entitlement to non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $1,300 in <span class="Italic">Sabir v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01993859 (2002), where the emotional distress was only partially caused by the agency's discrimination. An award of $1,250 was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Cole v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03115 (2002), where most of the complainant's evidence of emotional distress concerned what she viewed as a career-long pattern of harassment and not the notice of removal and 10-day suspension that were found discriminatory. The Commission noted this evidence weakened but did not break the causal connection between the actual discrimination and harm suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DeMeuse v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950324 (1997), the Commission awarded $1,500 in compensatory damages where a mentally disabled employee was frisked by a supervisor for no apparent reason other than his disability. The employee had several preexisting mental conditions and his evidence of pain and suffering was only general in nature. A $1,500 award of compensatory damages also was upheld in <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01975022 (1999), where the only evidence of damages was the complainant's testimony that he suffered from stress at work and at home and a general loss of enjoyment of life. In <span class="Italic">Schrahl v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01961614 (1999), the Commission awarded $1,500 for a single, severe incident of sexual harassment based, in part, on the short duration of the emotional distress. The Commission specifically contrasted <span class="Italic">Schrahl</span> with <span class="Italic">Lawrence, supra</span>, where it awarded $3,000 because the distress claim was coupled with a defamation claim. In <span class="Italic">Mathes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00093 (2001), the Commission affirmed a $1,500 damage award where the complainant credibly testified that his nonselection made him angry, frustrated, and depressed. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bagwell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04047 (2002) ($1,500 was appropriate where the complainant submitted "sparse" evidence of his emotional distress). In <span class="Italic">Greene v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A33907_r.txt">01A33907</a> (2004), the Commission upheld an award of $1,500 in damages where the only evidence was an affidavit by the complainant and her testimony failed to differentiate between the harm caused by the discrimination and harm caused by other agency actions that were not found to be discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Martinelli v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120072930 (2008), the Commission upheld an award of $1,500 where the complainant where the complainant presented only limited evidence of the amount of time she suffered as a result of the agency's discrimination. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Eason v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120062715 (2008), the Commission approved an agency award of $1,500 where the complainant's only evidence of harm consisted of a report of elevated blood pressure after denial of five days of overtime in a light duty assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $1,500 by the agency was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Goblirsch-Erickson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113463 (2013), where the complainant said she did not suffer any emotional distress from the discrimination and did not seek counseling or other medical treatment but still demanded $125,000. Similarly, the Commission upheld an award of $1,500 by the administrative judge where the complainant testified that the stress and anxiety were caused in part by actions that the judge found were not discriminatory and other work-related matters that were not the subject of the complaint. <span class="Italic">Struppler v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120111119 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $1,500 was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120113303 (2013), where:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant explained that the incident that occurred was embarrassing and that she was humiliated in front of her co-workers. Complainant also stated that her reputation and credibility were damaged; that she was not able to enjoy life or sleep well; and that her weight was going up and down. She also stated that she underwent a lot of emotional distress, and pain and suffering. She stated that she was scared because her paycheck was going to be short and she would not be able to take care of her family. She also stated that she experienced unnecessary stress which caused her health to fail.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01964759 (1998), the Commission awarded $2,000 for emotional distress and its physical manifestations, including lower back and neck pain, headaches, and weight loss. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Turner</span> took into consideration the complainant's testimony that he visited a therapist a few times, despite the fact that he provided no documentation of these visits. <span id="Page_1832"></span>An award of $2,000 was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Trevizo v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10003 (2001), where the complainant testified that she suffered sleeplessness, crying spells, and a reluctance to report to work after a coworker exposed himself to her. The agency's disclosure of the complainant's confidential medical information resulted in a $2,000 award in <span class="Italic">Merilyn W. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140433 (2016). In that case, complainant's alleged emotional distress when her supervisor disclosed to a union steward that complainant was pregnant and had suffered a miscarriage.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $2,000 in nonpecuniary damages in <span class="Italic">Robison-Mathison v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01961574 (1998), despite the fact that the complainant's medical report entirely failed to link the harm suffered to discrimination. The Commission also noted that the only testimony the complainant provided regarding the effects of the discrimination was that she was taking medication for depression. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994200 (2002) (awarding $2,000 where complainant suffered distress, vomiting, and depression); <span class="Italic">Troupe v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01985836 (2001) (awarding $2,000 based on "scant" evidence); <span class="Italic">Orosko v. Attorney General</span>, 01996365 (2001) (awarding $2,000 where the majority of emotional distress was related to actions that were not found to be discriminatory); <span class="Italic">Erving v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01961314 (1999) (basing a $2,000 award on a "scant" amount of evidence).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Acha v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A00011 (2000), the Commission reduced an award of $10,000 in damages by an administrative judge to $2,000 where some of the claimed harm was caused by events that happened after the discrimination. The Commission awarded $2,000 in <span class="Italic">Ambrose v. Broadcasting Board of Governors</span>, 01994324 (2001), where the complainant suffered from depression and gastrointestinal problems. A failure to provide reasonable accommodation over a five-month period resulted in a damage award of $2,000 where the complainant had one panic attack, and several visits to EAP and her physician. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lauzon v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A13141 (2002). In part, the Commission's award in <span class="Italic">Lauzon</span> was based on the fact that some of the complainant's visits to her physician occurred after she had left agency employment and were not shown to be related to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $2,000 was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Allen v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990101 (2002), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant exacerbated a longstanding condition that contributed to the complainant's stress, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive behavior for approximately one year. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01538 (2003), the Commission upheld a $2,000 damage award, noting the complainant was upset and had feelings of disappointment, and the agency representative also recalled that the complainant was quite upset.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that would appear to be an outright abomination for the facts presented, the Commission awarded $2,000 in damages where a supervisor grabbed the complainant's breasts and tried to force her back to table to have sex. The decision does not describe the complainant's distress in any detail, but it is hard to imagine that such an incident would not cause substantial emotional distress. <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20081 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not unusual that a complainant has more than one complaint in the system. When those complaints are not consolidated, it can cause difficulties in determining damages. For example, in <span class="Italic">Resnick v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A20040 (2003), the Commission reduced an award of $50,000 in damages by the administrative judge to $2,000 because the judge relied on distress caused by agency actions that were still under adjudication.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $2,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Ried v. Attorney General</span>, 0720070003 (2008), where the complainant testified that she was upset and sad about having to relocate because of a discriminatory reassignment. In making the award, the Commission noted that in her investigatory affidavit the complainant requested as relief that she be given a different assignment at the new location. From this, the Commission gleaned that the complainant was no longer seeking a return to her previous location and, thus, the harm had abated.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Grey v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120131060 (2013), the Commission increased an agency award of $500 to $2,000 where the complainant demonstrated that the disclosure of confidential medical information resulted in an increase in counseling. The <span class="Italic">Grey</span> case also provides a good example of how the Commission uses its own case law in determining a damage award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant says that the event aggravated her anxiety disorder. Complainant's counselor wrote that the resulting treatment includes approximately four to six months of biweekly sessions, of which Complainant has completed at least two months. On November 11, 2011, the counselor indicated that Complainant is making progress. Moreover, in its final decision, the Agency concedes that Complainant suffered some harm. However, we disagree with the Agency's decision to award $500 in non-pecuniary damages. The four cases cited by the Agency concern facts that are largely dissimilar to the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091289 (June 8, 2009), we affirmed the Agency's decision not to award non-pecuniary damages where the complainant was unable to show harm resulting from a performance rating that was lower than warranted. Here, by demonstrating a need for counseling so soon after discovering her confidential information was left unsecured. Complainant demonstrated tangible harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Zofia v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120101454 (December 16, 2010), awarded $500 to a complainant who suffered reprisal when a supervisor referenced EEO activity by saying, "what goes around comes around." In this case, Complainant did not suffer reprisal, but suffered a loss of privacy and a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third case, <span class="Italic">Wittren v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073308 (December 11, 2007) concerned a management official's threat to terminate the complainant if he pursued EEO activity. There, we affirmed an administrative judge's (AJ) finding that the complainant was entitled to $500 in non-pecuniary damages for "pain and suffering." In this case, Complainant has demonstrated harm beyond simple "pain and suffering."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the fourth case, more than ten years ago, the Commission awarded $500 to a complainant who suffered discrimination based on disability and reprisal when the agency granted the complainant three hours of sick leave instead of three days to attend his father's funeral. <span class="Italic">Price v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995310 (May 9, 2002). In so awarding, we noted that Complainant did not "provid[e] any supporting documentation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this case, Complainant has submitted evidence of tangible harm and an effort to recover from that harm. Shortly after discovering that her confidential medical information was left unprotected for five years, Complainant contacted EAP and engaged a counselor for several months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have awarded greater sums where a complainant's confidential medical information was disclosed. In <span class="Italic">Grazier v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112711 (September 30, 2010), we affirmed an AJ's award of $2,500 in non-pecuniary damages when a supervisor disclosed confidential medical information to a union representative who was not authorized by the complainant to receive that information. And in <span class="Italic">Philbert v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090041 (May 5, 2010), we affirmed an AJ's award of $15,000 to a complainant who proved two claims of discrimination, one of which involved a supervisor's improper access of the complainant's confidential medical information.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120131546 (2015) ("Complainant only states that he was unhappy with the treatment he received by the Agency and as a result, his health and welfare were affected.").</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $2,161.61 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12832 (2002), where the complainant suffered stress and anxiety, but most of it was in response to the manner in which the agency processed her complaint. Although the decision is unclear, presumably the odd amount included a sum for pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pailin v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01954350 (1998), the Commission awarded $2,500 in damages for emotional distress consisting of weight loss, fatigue, lack of motivation, sadness, and diminished self-esteem. The Commission found the complainant's symptoms were related to the supervisor's lack of attention to her on-the-job training. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Feser v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01974440 (2000), awarding $2,500 based on testimony of the complainant and her husband. In <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01985379 (2001), the Commission awarded $2,500 in damages where the complainant was a probationary employee who had only been employed for six months at the time of her termination. An award of $2,500 in damages was also deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Prince v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01994896 (2001), where the complainant submitted evidence that her emotional distress lasted approximately 21 months, but submitted little evidence on the severity of that distress.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A02306 (2002), the Commission awarded $2,500 in damages after discounting much of the complainant's damage evidence. In that case, the Commission found there was no causal connection between the discriminatory harassment and a heart attack suffered two and a half years later and also found, contrary to the complainant's assertion, that she had not resigned as a result of the harassment but in order to take advantage of $25,000 early retirement buyout. In <span class="Italic">Allen v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30089.txt">07A30089</a> (2004), the Commission found an award of $2,500 in damages was adequate where the complainant suffered from headaches, stomach problems and sleeplessness.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Loving v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01965789 (1997), the complainant was awarded $3,000 in damages for emotional distress where she suffered six acts of harassment during a one-year period of time. In calculating the award, the Commission noted the acts of harassment were not severe and the complainant submitted little in the way of specific evidence about the harm suffered. In <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952288 (1996), the Commission awarded $3,000 where the emotional distress for sexual harassment was of short duration and the complainant also claimed to suffer defamation. Without providing any significant detail, the Commission upheld an agency award of $3,000 in <span class="Italic">Woolsey v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05990634 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pruette v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951567 (1998), the Commission awarded $3,000 for emotional distress damages that flowed from a single EEO counseling session where the counselor attempted to discourage the employee from filing a complaint. Although the employee presented medical evidence that she suffered from major depression, much of the evidence attributed her condition to other factors in the work environment that were not the basis of the discrimination finding. Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Onie R. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120141870 (2016), increased the agency's $500 award to $3,000 where, on one occasion during a conference, an agency superintendent made comments including "EEOs are crap" and "EEO people are crazy people. Don't be afraid of EEOs. They'll go away." The complainant provided evidence that the retaliatory comments resulted in "anxiety, feelings of intimidation and disrespect, despondency, sleep loss, fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, hypersensitivity, feelings of guilt, fear that her EEO complaint would result in a total loss of opportunities for promotion and credibility as a manager, impairment of relationships, reduced social interaction, and a loss of confidence." In <span class="Italic">Tate v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01986429 (2000), the Commission awarded $3,000 in damages where the complainant was handcuffed by agency security guards while a white employee was not similarly handcuffed. In making the award, the Commission noted the complainant suffered humiliation, embarrassment, and stress and the grabbing of complainant's arm constituted an unwarranted assault. However, the complainant presented no evidence that he sought medical treatment as a result of the incident. An award of $3,000 was deemed appropriate where the complainant was diagnosed with depression and on medication for two months. <span class="Italic">See Altman v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A1691 (2002). In <span class="Italic">Harris v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12447 (2002), an award of $3,000 in damages was upheld without any significant description of the harm suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McClellan v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A2900 (2002), the Commission found an award of $3,000 was appropriate where the testimony established that the complainant's symptoms were the same before and after the discrimination. The Commission also held that the fact that there were three discriminatory events did not mean the complainant could recover three times for the distress she experienced.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although medical evidence is not required to support a claim of damages, lack of medical evidence can affect the amount of damages awarded. For example, in <span class="Italic">Rizzitelli v. Attorney General</span>, 01A03145 (2002), the Commission <span id="Page_1833"></span>awarded $3,000 in damages, noting the lack of medical evidence in support of the complainant's claims. Where the complainant's emotional distress, anxiety, and depression lasted approximately one year, the Commission found an award of $3,000 in damages was appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A10040 (2003). The Commission also awarded $3,000 in damages in a case where the complainant was scared and frightened that her supervisor would attack her after the harassment and her fear and anxiety lasted at least four months. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Minjarez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01779 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Myers v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A21575 (2003), the Commission awarded $3,000 in damages for emotional distress as the result of a denial and delay of an extension of his tour of duty. In making the award, the Commission noted that some of the complainant's emotional distress was attributed to claims pursued in U.S. district court on which he did not prevail. "We note that complainant does not distinguish between the harm suffered as a result of the agency's discriminatory reprisal and harm that he believes stemmed from other claims in which findings of no discrimination were ultimately found in a U.S. District Court. Nevertheless, we are mindful that it may not be practical to expect complainant to neatly compartmentalize the harm...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $3,000 in damages was deemed sufficient by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A30147.txt">01A30147</a> (2004). In that case, the administrative judge found that a lower performance evaluation had caused the complainant to suffer from stress, depression, and difficulties with relationships, but also found some of the harm was caused by actions other than the appraisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge's award of $30,000 in damages was reduced to $3,000 in <span class="Italic">Sylvain v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40079_r.txt">07A40079</a> (2004), where the judge cited no Commission precedent in support of the award. Noting that the Commission strives to award similar damages for similar harm, it found the complainant's distress, which consisted of discomfort in the workplace, loss of self-esteem, sleep disturbances and nightmares, similar to cases with damages ranging between $1,500 and $5,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 07A40029 (2005), the Commission awarded $3,000 in damages where the agency's efforts to dissuade the complaint from pursuing her complaint led to fainting spells and her missing a day of work. The Commission also awarded $3,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Lee v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51982 (2006), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 05A60971 (2006), where the complainant experienced stress in the form of inability to show love and attention to her infant, loss of sleep, helplessness and humiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission adjusted an agency award of $1,000 in damages to $3,000 while at the same time rejecting the complainant's appeal for $6,500 in <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120081910 (2008). In that case, the Commission found that much of the claimed harm was the result of alleged harassing conduct that was not found to be discriminatory. The Commission also noted that a report from the complainant's psychiatrist that attributed 80% of the harm to a retaliatory performance appraisal was written some 18 months after the injury.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission approved an award of $3,000 in damages where the complainant submitted an affidavit testifying to the harm, but submitted no other supporting evidence. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. General Services Administration</span>, 0120110397 (2014).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $3,500 in damages was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Waldrop v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A05538 (2002), where the complainant became introverted and withdrawn, would barely eat, and experienced a exacerbation of existing health problems. In <span class="Italic">Young v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A24503 (2003), the Commission awarded $3,500 in damages where the complainant's emotional symptoms were relatively severe but of a short duration. According to the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Young</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted evidence, through his own statement and that of his wife, of the emotional distress caused by the agency's action. Complainant stated that he was unemployed for three months until he obtained employment earning four dollars less per hour than he earned as a Housekeeping Aide with the agency. Complainant stated that his termination caused him great stress because he had a family of five, which included a new-born baby, so he had to find an alternative way to make a living. Further, complainant stated that he was humiliated when, after his termination, he had to borrow money from relatives, obtain personal loans, and collect aluminum cans to sell, to provide for his family. Complainant stated that he was stressed because he was uncertain if and when he would be able to repay his loans because he was financially strained. In addition, complainant stated that he suffered marital strain for approximately a month and that it pained him greatly to <span class="Italic">see</span> his family's disappointment with his termination. Also, complainant stated that he experienced a lack of concentration and an inability to think correctly. Complainant acknowledged that he did not consult a physician regarding his stress, he did not suffer any physical manifestations of his stress, and he suffered very little stress once he was reinstated to his position in October 1999. Complainant's wife corroborated his statements and added that complainant suffered a lack of self esteem.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency award of $2,000 in damages was increased to $3,500 in <span class="Italic">Amaro v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A30313 (2003). In that case, the complainant and his wife testified that he suffered from "anxiety, depression, nausea, weight gain and loss, diarrhea, tachycardia chest pain, insomnia, lack of concentration, irritability, loss of enjoyment in life, an injured reputation and that he was prescribed anti-depressants that he will require for the rest of his life. Complainant's wife corroborated his statements. She added that complainant withdrew socially and that they experienced marital strain. Complainant's physician assistant agreed that complainant would remain on an anti-depressant for his lifetime." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In a decision that really defies explanation, the Commission awarded $3,500 in nonpecuniary damages. Because the author cannot explain the decision, the Commission's findings in <span class="Italic">Clay v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A44246 (2005), will have to speak for themselves:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The undisputed evidence shows that complainant suffers with depression and has been on anti-depressant medication since 2000. The record also shows that in July 2002, complainant was dealing with spousal abuse, separation from her husband and eviction from her home for non-payment of rent. In August 2002, the dosage of her anti-depressant medication doubled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the distress caused by the retaliatory termination, the undisputed evidence shows that because she was terminated, complainant was unable to meet an "agreement" with the State of Ohio which resulted in her incarceration for 20 days. Complainant testified that the incarceration was devastating. She stated "there are no words to describe how badly that hurt. Being in jail, seeing your kids through a glass, begging your daughter for money to bail you out. My three-year-old grandchild, can't even touch her through a glass. My two children, 7 and 8, seeing me in jail." Complainant further testified, "my love has always been carrying mail, and its very important to me. I waited for this job for almost eleven to twelve years to be full time...I cannot award my daughter...with presents that normal parents give their...children....All I wanted was a full time job with the [agency], full time benefits, so that I could be a decent parent to give what any parent wants to give their child. I can't even do that."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Benson v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952854 (June 27, 1996), the Commission affirmed the agency's award of $5,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where the complainant, his relatives, and his colleagues offered testimony regarding the embarrassment and humiliation that the employee suffered at work as a result of the denial of promotional opportunities, a suspension, and other adverse actions. In <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956059 (September 2, 1998), the Commission found the AJ's award of $5,000 to be reasonable based on the employee's testimony that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment and suffered moderately severe psychological stress as a result. In addition to her own testimony, the employee submitted reports from a psychologist. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Androvich v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950531 (July 12, 1996), the Commission awarded $5,000 to the aggrieved employee on the basis of testimony from herself, her sister, and her ex-spouse, as well as statements from four clinical psychologists, that she suffered from anxiety attacks, depression, and insomnia, as a result of the agency's aggravation of a pre-existing mental condition caused by its discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the evidence, taking into consideration the duration, severity and limited evidence presented of the harm, as well as awards of non-pecuniary damages in similar cases, it is the decision of the Commission to AFFIRM the final agency action and conclude that complainant is entitled to $3,500 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $3,500 in damages was deemed appropriate by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Padron v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072520 (2008), where the complainant, in addition to her own testimony, provided statements from a boyfriend, her daughter, and coworkers that she suffered from depression, embarrassment and humiliation, loss of self-esteem and stress and anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $3,500 in damages in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0120122955 (2014), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ considered the facts asserted by Complainant that: the termination caused her stress, anxiety and depression; her finances were unstable; she was taking care of two special needs children; she gained weight, felt humiliated, and embarrassed; and she began to isolate herself. The AJ noted that although Complainant submitted affidavits from her husband, daughter, sister, and friend indicating her stress and anxiety, much of the stress described therein related to her time working at the Agency and the alleged hostile work environment for which there was no finding of discrimination. Furthermore, the AJ considered the facts that Complainant was terminated from a temporary appointment (not a long term position) and she documented no financial difficulties or any medical assistance for any of the stress or depression she claims to have experienced.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gause v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01972427 (2000), the Commission awarded $4,000 in emotional distress damages based on statements by the complainant and family members. In making the award, the Commission noted there was no medical evidence but the agency also offered no evidence <span id="Page_1834"></span>to rebut her claim of emotional distress. In <span class="Italic">Adams v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10061 (2003), the Commission upheld an award of $4,000 in damages where the complainant, her husband, and daughter testified that she suffered from disorderly and sporadic eating habits, a change in sleep patterns, and a change in her relationship with her husband.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant and her husband testified that the complainant suffered mental anguish and depression that led to bouts of crying and family problems, the Commission awarded $4,000 in damages. In upholding the award of the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40039 (2004), the Commission noted that there were other stressful events in the complainant's life and that she had suffered from depression and insomnia prior to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A33965.txt">01A33965</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $4,000 in damages where the complainant testified she suffered mental anguish and loss of self-esteem as the result of religious harassment. A coworker testified that anytime the complainant came near the protagonist, there was a heated verbal exchange and the protagonist seemed to be on a personal mission to convert the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission deemed an award of $4,000 appropriate where the complainant established that a flare-up of his hypertension and intestinal problems resulted in his missing work for four weeks, but other harm such as loss of self esteem, health problems, depression and social withdrawal were not caused by the agency's discrimination. <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120120891 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Androvich v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01950531 (1996), the Commission reduced the nonpecuniary damage award by 80% of the complainant's request. In deciding in <span class="Italic">Androvich</span> to award the complainant $5,000 instead of her $25,000 request, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant seeks nonpecuniary damages for the emotional damages and invasion of privacy that the agency's actions caused. The Commission notes that, as with pecuniary damages, the agency is liable only for those damages directly or proximately caused by the two incidents resolved by the April 1994 settlement,<span class="Italic"> see</span> EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 11, and is not responsible for damages relating to the settlement of this matter<span class="Italic">. See Rountree; Appleby</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, appellant's claim for compensatory damages is supported by the statements from her, her sister, ex-husband, and psychologist. The agency denied appellant's claim for $25,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages, finding that she failed to establish the length and severity of the harm. Although the agency concedes that appellant "may have suffered a period of stress from the time she received the Form 1099 in late January 1994 until she was advised that she did not have to pay taxes on the previous amount of compensatory damages, in February 1994" any such stress "should reasonably have been reduced, and perhaps eliminated by the Agency's actions." Similarly, the agency stated that Official A's apology should have eliminated the stress appellant experienced following his statement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency improperly denied appellant's request for nonpecuniary damages. The statements appellant submitted identify the type of harm she suffered and tie that harm directly to the agency's actions. The Commission finds that these statements were sufficiently detailed and specific to establish appellant's entitlement to nonpecuniary damages. These statements also provide some indication as to the duration of the harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are no "hard and fast" rules governing the amount to be awarded. Nonpecuniary damages must be limited, however, to the sums necessary to compensate the injured party for actual harm, even where the harm is intangible, <span class="Italic">see Carter v. Duncan-Higgins, Ltd.</span>, 727 F.2d 1225 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and should take into account the severity of the harm and the length of time that the injured party has suffered from the harm<span class="Italic">. Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995); EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 14. The Commission notes that for a proper award of nonpecuniary damages, the amount of the award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. AIC Security Investigations, Ltd.</span>, 823 F. Supp. 573, 574 (N.D. Ill. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the amount of nonpecuniary damages to which appellant is entitled, the Commission has considered that the agency's actions caused appellant significant distress because of her pre-existing mental condition. Although the two incidents in this case may seem, in an absolute sense, not particularly egregious, for appellant, as indicated by the statements in the record, they had actual consequences. Accordingly, we find that appellant is entitled to nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $5,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many of the Commission's awards for nonpecuniary damages have been for $5,000 or less. For example, in <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01950342 (1997), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages for emotional distress where the employee testified he nearly suffered a nervous breakdown because of his supervisor's sexual harassment. The appellant's psychologist reported that he suffered from anxiety, depression, emotional fatigue, occasional nightmares, and insomnia. In making the award, the Commission noted that the appellant's damage testimony was short and the written reports of his psychologist were even shorter. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Leperi v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01964107 (1998), the Commission awarded $5,000 in emotional distress damages where the complainant submitted medical evidence of treatment by seven different doctors, but no evidence linking that treatment to the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Alena C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120152806 (2017) (awarding $5,000 where the complainant suffered stress from the agency's improper disclosure of her medical information that led to a preemployment physical). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Cletus W. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720160008 (2016) (awarding $5,000 where the complainant testified that he "felt hurt" by the discriminatory nonselection). In <span class="Italic">Rose v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01950521 (1998), the Commission awarded $5,000 in emotional distress damages where the distress was moderate. In making the award, the Commission noted that the complainant had not missed any work due to the distress, nor had her ability to perform her job suffered. In <span class="Italic">Damiano v. Postmaster General</span>, 05980311 (1999), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages where the complainant experienced insomnia, chest pains, and acne and his general practitioner physician could find no physical cause and attributed the symptoms to stress.</p>
<p class="noindent">The length of time that the complainant suffers emotional distress will inform the Commission's award. The complainant and her family members in <span class="Italic">Eve E. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120161392 (2016), provided statements that due to the agency's retaliatory actions the complainant felt anxious, humiliated, and lost sleep. Based on that evidence, the Commission upheld the agency's $5,000 award, noting that the complainant failed to indicate how long her depression and change in her usual "happy-go-lucky" outlook lasted. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Levi P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120142758 (2016) (increasing a $1,500 award to $5,000 where the complainant alleged six years of stress and having to put his "life on hold" in order to pursue his complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01956059 (1998), the Commission awarded $5,000 for "moderately severe physiological suffering and moderately severe psychological pain and suffering" as a result of discriminatory reassignment. The complainant presented testimony and psychologists reports that indicated she suffered distress and significant anger. The award took into account a finding of the administrative judge that 65% of the complainant's injury was caused by factors other than the discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01982301 (2000), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages based on uncontroverted evidence of embarrassment and humiliation. The Commission rejected agency arguments that the complainant's suffering was minimal because the position involved was temporary and the complainant did not suffer a significant loss of income. The award was affirmed on reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05A00981 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $5,000 in compensatory damages was made by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Wolfe v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01971417 (2000), based on the complainant's testimony, which was corroborated by contemporaneous notes and the testimony of a coworker. The notes of a treating psychologist also made mention of the harassment as a factor in the complainant's condition. In <span class="Italic">Hamaker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01980128 (2001), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages where the complainant presented unrebutted testimony of emotional distress, but failed to establish that her emotional distress lessened the effect of medications she was taking for physical ailments. In <span class="Italic">Apodaca v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01990542 (2002), the Commission reduced the award of an administrative judge from $15,000 to $5,000 in damages, where the award was based solely on the complainant's testimony and contained little in the way of specifics about the effects of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission developed its own body of damages law, it has relied to a greater degree on that law for purposes of comparison in making damage awards. For example, in <span class="Italic">McCurdy v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A10659 (2001), the Commission used the following comparisons in awarding $5,000 in damages and in doing so, indirectly gives agencies and complainants substantial guidance on what should be included in their respective damage analyses of a case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requests $175,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. At the outset, it must be emphasized that the assessment of compensatory damages must be based on the damage to complainant, not from the misconduct of the agency. Complainant appears to stress the breadth of misconduct by the agency. However, punitive damages are inappropriate in federal sector discrimination cases<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 USC 1981a(b)1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, complainant submits that over the course of 14 months he suffered physical pain from writing and typing as well as emotional pain from depression, despondency, and withdrawal. Complainant also indicates he had problems sleeping and gained weight. Complainant especially notes that he was afraid for his future in terms of being fired from his job, although there is no indication that any performance evaluation, involving complainant, was negative, or that he was otherwise advised that he might be terminated from his job for performance deficiencies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1835"></span>Additionally, as the agency emphasized, complainant did not submit any testimony to corroborate his assertion that his condition was exacerbated by the agency's actions. Although not required, complainant did not present medical evidence to support his claim for damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A number of Commission decisions have awarded non-pecuniary compensatory damages in cases which we compare to complainant's<span class="Italic">. Lawrence v. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996) ($3,000 in damages where complainant presented primarily non-medical evidence that she was irritable, experienced anxiety attacks, and was shunned by her co-workers); <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01941906 (July 7, 1995) ($8,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant received a low performance appraisal and was denied bonus pay because of race and reprisal, medical testimony provided regarding complainant's emotional distress, but the majority of complainant's emotional problems were caused by factors other than the discrimination); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01973551 (April 14, 2000)($9,000 in non-pecuniary damages based on complainant's statements regarding interference with family and marital relations, digestive problems, headaches, anxiety, sleeplessness, and exhaustion resulting from agency's discrimination); <span class="Italic">Baptieste v. Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01974616 (May 26, 2000) ($12,000 in non-pecuniary damages based on complainant's and others' statements of emotional distress due to agency's discriminatory termination, felt worthless and depressed, negative attitude about herself and outside world, isolated from coworkers, nausea and insomnia, intense feelings of anxiety, irritable, had to declare bankruptcy); <span class="Italic">Bever v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01953949 (October 31, 1996) ($15,000 where situational anxiety linked to ongoing harassment, medication required, and symptoms included uncontrolled crying, weight gain, and depression); <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996) ($25,000 in non-pecuniary damages based on "quite serious" emotional harm, lasting upwards of two years, frequent crying, introversion, disruptions in relationships with family and friends, suicidal thoughts, depression, sleep problems, marital (separation from wife ensued) and financial difficulties exacerbated, although majority problems not shown caused by discrimination); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997)($100,000 in non-pecuniary damages for severe psychological injury over four years which was expected to continue for an indeterminate time, including ongoing depression, frequent crying, concern for physical safety, loss of charm, lethargy, social withdrawal, concern for physical safety, recurring <span id="Page_1836"></span>nightmares and memories of harassment, a damaged marriage, stomach distress, and headaches).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant relies on the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Carpenter,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>. However, as complainant acknowledges, in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> that complainant's condition was exacerbated such that it caused him to be absent from work for two months, and he left his employment with the agency soon thereafter. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> presented evidence from his physicians that the agency's actions exacerbated his impairment, whereas in the present case there is no such evidence. The Commission found the record supported the <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> complainant's claim for compensatory damages, including his request for damages attendant to embarrassment, humiliation, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of health, loss of consortium, and for losses associated with other disruptions of his marital and family relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also relies on a federal district court decision, <span class="Italic">Shea,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The plaintiff's award in that case was reduced from $175,000 to $75,000. 925 F. Supp. at 1029. The court indicated that this was the maximum recovery that would not "deviate materially" from awards in cases with similar characteristics<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Shea</span>, the plaintiff's health rapidly declined following his demotion and he required hospitalization due to a heart condition linked to the stressful situation at work. There was medical evidence from his physicians that the employer's actions exacerbated his impairment. It was also pointed out that the plaintiff experienced mental anguish from the fact that he was required to inform over three hundred of his regular customers of his demotion and give them his new business card indicating his diminished position. In sum, the record was found to have substantiated the plaintiff's physical and mental pain and suffering due to the employer's conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing evidence, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $5,000. We find that the agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">White,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Bensen,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, to be reasonable. We also note that complainant's request was presumably based on a finding that he was subject to a hostile work environment over the course of fourteen months. As previously indicated, there has been no finding of a violation involving a hostile work environment, although some incidents involved in complainant's reasonable accommodation claim relate also to the hostile work environment claim. The $5,000 amount takes into account the severity and duration of the harm sustained by complainant by the agency's actions and consideration of damage awards reached in comparable cases. The Commission further notes that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar</span>, 865 F.2d at 848; <span class="Italic">AIC Security Investigations</span>, 823 F. Supp. at 574.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case in which the agency's failure to make a restroom facility accessible caused a paraplegic complainant to occasionally have to urinate in the agency's parking lot and at times soil himself, the Commission awarded only $5,000 in damages. With the observation that those who made the decision should be made to suffer the same humiliations, the author lets the Commission speak for itself in <span class="Italic">Conner v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01996212 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in support of his request for compensatory damages, complainant argues that he was continually frustrated, aggravated, embarrassed, and humiliated because he had to rely upon visitors and coworkers to open the restroom door. He points out that on many occasions, when he needed to use the restroom, there were only female visitors or coworkers in the area and many of them felt uncomfortable and made nervous jokes about the situation. Complainant raised allegations of curtailing of water intake, of humiliation from having to urinate outside the building after normal work hours, and of accidents resulting in urinating in his pants. He also raised allegations of serious medical problems such as dehydration and urinary tract and bladder infections. In sum, complainant argues that the workplace had become hostile, the discrimination affected his emotional health, and that he felt degraded by the agency's inaction. In support, complainant also submitted statements by his mother and sister, who lived with him in the same house.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that complainant's non-pecuniary claims are both exaggerated and unsupported and should be rejected. The agency points out that complainant alleges he was damaged by a lack of independent access to the Building 5 men's room over a period of 20 months, but that complainant was not at the worksite from May 21, 1996 through January 1997. Thus, complainant was at the worksite approximately 12 months. The agency also argues that complainant alleged that he had injured himself on the job and was incapable of doing any work after May 21, 1996. Thus, in the agency's view, even if the agency were found liable to complainant, he should not be compensated for lack of access to a restroom when he could not work at the building that contained the restroom. Additionally, the agency argues that complainant's non-pecuniary damage claim should also fail because it is unsupported by objective, credible evidence, including appropriate evidence of agency causation. In the agency's view, complainant, in light of the Flexiplace agreement, was not required to come to the office and work. It is further emphasized that the statements complainant has offered, both his own and his relatives,' do not meet the objective evidence standard, pointing out that there are no physician reports or medical bills. Furthermore, the agency argues that while complainant's own statements can be a part of a body of objective evidence, it is clear that corroboration and specific, detailed information on such things as the physical or behavioral manifestations, duration, and day-to-day impact both on and off the job caused by any such alleged non-pecuniary injury are the types of evidence that should be presented so that the allegations can be properly assessed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A number of Commission decisions have awarded non-pecuniary compensatory damages in cases which we <span class="Italic">compare</span> to complainant's<span class="Italic">. Lawrence v. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996) ($3,000 in damages where complainant presented primarily non-medical evidence that she was irritable, experienced anxiety attacks, and was shunned by her co-workers); <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Veteran's Affairs,</span> EEOC No, 01950342 (June 13, 1997) ($5,000 awarded for emotional distress which included depression, emotional fatigue, nightmares, and insomnia that were related to hostile environment lasting approximately a year and a half); <span class="Italic">Bensen v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC No. 01952854 (June 26, 1994) ($5,000 awarded complainant; his relatives and colleagues offered testimony regarding embarrassment and humiliation complainant suffered at work as a result of denial of promotional opportunities, suspension, and other adverse actions)<span class="Italic">. Bever v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01953949 (October 31, 1996) ($15,000 where situational anxiety linked to ongoing harassment, medication required, and symptoms included uncontrolled crying, weight gain, and depression); <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996) ($25,000 in non-pecuniary damages based on "quite serious" emotional harm, lasting upwards of two years, frequent crying, introversion, disruptions in relationships with family and friends, suicidal thoughts, depression, sleep problems, marital (separation from wife ensued) and financial difficulties exacerbated, although majority problems not shown caused by discrimination); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997)($100,000 in non-pecuniary damages for severe psychological injury over four years which was expected to continue for an indeterminate time, including ongoing depression, frequent crying, concern for physical safety, loss of charm, lethargy, social withdrawal, concern for physical safety, recurring nightmares and memories of harassment, a damaged marriage, stomach distress, and headaches).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We give little weight to the statements of complainant's mother and sister because they are identical in wording except for the name and relationship to complainant. The evidence, based on complainant's statements alone, does not establish the frequency and severity of injury, which he has alleged in support of the damages he requests. Indeed, complainant's statements are general with little specificity or evidence to support his statements. The evidence is thus insufficient to support complainant's position in terms of the frequency and severity of his alleged damages. We are nevertheless persuaded that complainant incurred problems that very well could have resulted in some frustration, aggravation, embarrassment, and humiliation due to the agency's failure to effectively accommodate his need for a readily accessible men's restroom. We note that the agency concedes complainant was working at the office for approximately 12 months, albeit not every day. Accordingly, and with due consideration to the comparable cases discussed above, we award $5,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Trevino v. Attorney General</span>, 01995963 (2002), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages where the complainant testified that he experienced stress after being placed under more stringent standards than his colleagues as retaliation for filing an EEO complaint. The complainant also testified and his wife corroborated that the stress made his immune system weaker, he had difficulty sleeping and used alcohol to help him sleep. The emotional distress lasted for at least one year. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A06042 (2002), the Commission awarded $5,000 where the complainant's doctor provided an affidavit that she had treated the complainant's stress-related illnesses due to her employment and the testimony was supported by affidavits from the complainant's mother, daughter, and a friend.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $5,000 was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Bell v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A13150 (2002), where the complainant and his former wife testified that the emotional stress from the discrimination contributed to the breakup of their marriage. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Purl v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A23399 (2003) (awarding $5,000 in damages based on conclusory testimony about the complainant's emotional distress and the breakup of his marriage).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where rumors of an affair with a previous supervisor spread to the work area of the complainant's husband, causing strains in the marriage, the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Stapp v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A05634 (2002), the Commission noted the evidence of distress was scant and that treatment appeared to end after a two-month period. In <span class="Italic">Gaskins-Bryant v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05099 (2002), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages where the complainant was treated several times for depression, anxiety and stress within a year of the discrimination and there was no evidence of a preexisting condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A22509 (2003), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages where much of the complainant's evidence focused on the stress caused by litigating her complaint. An award of $40,000 was reduced to $5,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A10035 (2003), where the complainant testified he felt dejected and suffered stress and emotional pain, but offered little in the way of detailed evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mar v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24879 (2003), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages where, in addition to the complainant's testimony, she presented evidence that she went to an EAP counselor who diagnosed her as having a mood adjustment disorder. The Commission distinguished the <span class="Italic">Mar</span> case from cases with somewhat lower awards because of the medical evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reduced an award of $20,000 in damages by the administrative judge to $5,000 where, in part, the judge based her damage determination on the "overall circumstances of the case." <span class="Italic">Arteaga v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20086 (2003). Noting that compensatory damages are intended to remedy harm and not punish wrongdoing, the Commission found it was error for the administrative judge to consider the circumstances of the case outside of any emotional distress actually suffered by the complainant as a result of the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission approved an award of $5,000 in damages by the administrative judge where the complainant testified that he was disappointed and discouraged by his nonselection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ko v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A20134 (2003). In <span class="Italic">Cushman v. Secretary of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A30063.txt">01A30063</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages where the discrimination exacerbated an existing irritable bowel syndrome.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered from PTSD, a sleep disorder, headaches and marital difficulties before the discrimination, the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages for the aggravation of those conditions. <span class="Italic">Varnado v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30101.txt">07A30101</a> (2004). Even though the complainant sought treatment for those conditions prior to the discrimination, the Commission found that his nonselection retarded the progress he was making in that treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40098_07A40108.txt">07A40098</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $5,000 to a victim of racial harassment where he experienced decreased enjoyment in life, recurring headaches, an inability to sleep and feelings of isolation. The complainant also testified that he sought counseling and was taking anti-depressants. Where the discrimination affected the ability of the complainant to concentrate at work and she felt like she was "walking on egg shells" when around her supervisor, the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Varela v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A30002 (2004), the Commission also noted that the complainant had trouble sleeping and that her testimony about the affect on her in the workplace was corroborated by her use of sick and annual leave. An award of $5,000 in damages also was upheld in <span class="Italic">Endermuhle v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05A50078_05A50117.txt">01A41056</a> (2004), where the complainant testified that being stripped of his duties resulted in isolation at work, loss of professional standing, loss of enjoyment of life, mental anguish and sleeplessness.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission determined that an award of $5,000 in damages was appropriate in <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A46059 (2006), where the complainant experience stress, physical and emotional pain, and adverse effect on his family and social life as the result of an improper preemployment inquiry. An award of $5,000 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Pleasant v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01A52841 (2006), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant's back condition led to 18 months of physical pain that required additional physical therapy and she also felt humiliated.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $500 in damages by the agency was increased to $5,000 in <span class="Italic">Greenidge v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52997 (2006), where most of the medical documentation submitted by the complainant was dated a year after the discriminatory event. However, the complainant did present his own testimony of mental distress, which was supported by family members who also testified.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Runnels v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 07A50086 (2006), the Commission reduced an award of $15,000 in damages by the administrative judge to $5,000 where the complainant suffered from depression and stress prior to receiving the discriminatory letter of counseling and also had several causes of emotional distress other than the discrimination. The Commission noted that the complainant went through a divorce unrelated to the discrimination and had also brought claims of discrimination on which he did not prevail. However, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A61316 (2006), the Commission increased an award of $500 by the administrative judge to $5,000 where complainant expressed feelings of upset, embarrassment and humiliation, and distraction for her family for a two--year period.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant testified that he suffered depression and anger and presented progress notes for his psychologist, the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages. However, in <span class="Italic">Paras v. Social Security Administration</span>, 07200600491 (2006), the award was low because the Commission noted that the complainant submitted little evidence that his depression and anger were caused by the agency's discrimination and not by other stressors. An award of $5,000 was also deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120053035 (2006), where the complainant, his relatives, and his coworkers testified that he suffered humiliation and embarrassment from the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the administrative judge discounted some of the complainant's testimony about physical problems because it was not sufficiently detailed or specific and where some of the problems predated the discrimination, the Commission upheld the judge's award of $5,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Drummond-Irving v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720060051 (2007), the judge still found evidence that the complainant was deeply disturbed and distressed by her nonselection.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Tucker v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064576 (2008), the Commission awarded $5,000 in damages where the agency's failure to accommodate led to an incident where the complainant's foot became swollen causing her pain, she cried uncontrollably in the presence of the agency nurse and testified that she was humiliated by being taken from the workroom floor to the nurse's office in front of her coworkers. The Commission also found that the complainant was depressed and upset in the days following the incident. However, the Commission rejected the complainant's argument for a larger damage award because of other causes for her distress, including the death of her grandmother, marital problems, and financial problems. The Commission further noted that she had preexisting physical and mental conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite reports from several mental health professionals, the Commission upheld an award of $5,000 in <span class="Italic">McDaniel v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120065054 (2008), The Commission noted that the reports only tied the complainant's depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders to events generally in the workplace without mention of specific triggering events, such as the discriminatory suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission deemed an award of $5,000 in damages appropriate where the complainant was subjected to minor incidents of retaliation and factors other than discrimination, such as a car accident, other health problems and the litigation itself, contributed to the complainant's emotional distress. <span class="Italic">Schofield v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120120076 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0120103308 (2013), the Commission increased an agency award of $2,500 to $5,000 for a retaliatory performance evaluation. The complainant suffered from disruption of sleeping patterns, headaches, numbness in his extremities and impacted relationships with <span id="Page_1837"></span>family, friends and coworkers. In making the award, the Commission noted that the effects of the retaliation were not severe and short in duration.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $5,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0720130002 (2014), where the complainant was asked an impermissible question about having a disability on a USAJOBS application:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant and his wife asserted that after he learned of the non-selection, he believed it was due in part to the disability-related question. Complainant wept for the first time in decades, suffered from headaches, anxiety, sleeplessness, irritability, and restlessness. A friend attested that Complainant appeared gloomy, less energetic, less confident, and less outgoing. He withdrew from social interactions and was prescribed an anti-depressant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency challenges the AJ reliance upon the affidavits submitted by Complainant's spouse and friend in ascertaining the damages suffered by him. It argues that it was denied the opportunity to assess their credibility and conduct cross-examination. The Commission, however, is not persuaded. In many appeals finding discrimination, the matter is remanded to the Agency for a supplemental investigation regarding compensatory damages. In such instances, as here, affidavits are submitted and witnesses are not subjected to cross-examination. We do not find that AJ's reliance on the affidavits was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $5,000 in damages was approved by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132114 (2015), where the complainant "suffered from insomnia, headaches and mood swings. These mood swings have caused marital problems. He states that he has suffered from an exacerbation of physical symptoms, as well." Although his wife submitted corroborating testimony, the Commission noted that the only medical evidence preceded the discrimination.</p>
