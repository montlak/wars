<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-127"><span class="space">F.</span> PSYCHOTHERAPIST PRIVILEGE</h3>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jaffee v. Redmond</span>, 116 S. Ct. 1923 (1996), the Supreme Court recognized what all 50 states and the District of Columbia had previously recognized: communications between a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist and a patient are privileged. The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span> also extended the privilege to licensed social workers. Although there is now no doubt that, in federal litigation, such a privilege exists, the lower courts have split on the scope of the privilege. Specifically, the lower courts now are in disagreement on whether a plaintiff waives the privilege by asserting a right to damages for emotional distress. The Commission has yet to express any opinion on the parameters of <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span> as it applies to compensatory damages cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, a police officer shot and killed a suspect during a disturbance at an apartment building. Accounts of the incident varied, with the officer contending that the suspect was brandishing a butcher knife and ignoring repeated warnings to drop the weapon, while other witnesses insisted the suspect was unarmed. The suspect's estate administrator brought suit in federal court against the officer and the city police force, seeking damages for the use of excessive force during the encounter.</p>
<p class="noindent">During discovery, the plaintiff learned that the officer had undergone extensive counseling with a licensed social worker following the shooting and sought access to the social worker's clinical notes. The district court ordered production of the notes and when the defendant and the social worker refused to produce them or answer questions about the counseling sessions at trial, the judge instructed the jury that it could presume the contents of the counseling notes would have been unfavorable to the defendants. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal, the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. <span class="Italic">See</span> 51 F.3d 1346 (7th Cir. 1995). The appeals court held that there was a psychotherapist privilege that extended to the counseling sessions. However, the court found the privilege was not ironclad and would not apply if in the "interests of justice, the evidentiary need for the disclosure of the contents of a patient's counseling sessions outweighs that patient's privacy interests." 51 F.3d at 1357. In <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, the Seventh Circuit found the need for the evidence was slight because of the many eyewitnesses to the shooting, and that the officer's privacy interests were substantial because of her need to work through the mental anguish of shooting and killing another human being.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to resolve a split in the circuits over the existence of the psychotherapist privilege. In an opinion written by Justice Stevens, the Court, in <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, 116 S. Ct. at 1927-32, recognized such a privilege, but rejected the Seventh Circuit's balancing test, and instead made the privilege absolute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence authorizes federal courts to define new privileges by interpreting "common law principles...in the light of reason and experience." The authors of the Rule borrowed this phrase from our opinion in <span class="Italic">Wolfe v. United States</span>, 291 U.S. 7, 12, 54 S. Ct. 279, 280, 78 L. Ed. 617 (1934), which in turn referred to the oft-repeated observation that "the common law is not immutable but flexible, and by its own principles adapts itself to varying conditions." <span class="Italic">Funk v. United States</span>, 290 U.S. 371, 383, 54 S. Ct. 212, 216, 78 L. Ed. 369 (1933). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. United States</span>, 358 U.S. 74, 79, 79 S. Ct. 136, 139, 3 L. Ed.2d 125 (1958) (changes in privileges may be "dictated by 'reason and experience'"). The Senate Report accompanying Rule 501 "should be understood as reflecting the view that the recognition of a privilege based on a confidential relationship...should be determined on a case-by-case basis." S. Rep. No. 93-1277, p. 12 (1974) U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1974, pp. 7051, 7059. The Rule this did not freeze the law governing the privileges of witnesses in federal trials at a particular point in our history, but rather directed federal courts "to continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges." <span class="Italic">Trammel v. United States</span>, 445 U.S. 40, 47, 100 S. Ct. 906, 910, 63 L. Ed.2d 186 (1980); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC</span>, 493 U.S. 182, 189, 110 S. Ct. 577, 582, 107 L. Ed.2d 571 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The common-law principles underlying the recognition of testimonial privileges can be stated simply. "'For more than three centuries it has now been recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public...has a right to every man's evidence. When we come to examine the various claims of exemption, we start with the primary assumption that there is a general duty to give what testimony one is capable of giving, and that any exemptions which may exist are derogations from a positive, general rule.'" <span class="Italic">United States v. Bryan</span>, 339 U.S. 323, 331, 70 S. Ct. 724, 730, 94 L. Ed. 884 (1950) (quoting 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence &#x00A7; 2192, p. 64 (3d ed. 1940)). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Nixon</span>, 418 U.S. 683, 709; 94 S. Ct. 3090, 3108, 41 L. Ed.2d 1039 (1974). Exceptions from the general rule disfavoring testimonial privileges may be justified, however, by a "'public good <span id="Page_511"></span>transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining the truth.'" <span class="Italic">Trammel</span>, 445 U.S., at 50, 100 S. Ct., at 912, quoting <span class="Italic">Elkins v. United States</span>, 364 U.S. 206, 234, 80 S. Ct. 1437, 1454, 4 L. Ed.2d 1688 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Guided by these principles, the question we address today is whether a privilege protecting confidential communications between a psychotherapist and her patient "promotes sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for probative evidence...." 445 U.S., at 51, 100 S. Ct., at 912. Both "reason and experience" persuade that it does.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the spousal and attorney-client privileges, the psychotherapist-patient privilege is "rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust." <span class="Italic">Trammel</span>, 445 U.S., at 51, 100 S. Ct., at 913. Treatment by a physician for physical ailments can often proceed successfully on the basis of a physical examination, objective information supplied by the patient, and the results of diagnostic tests. Effective psychotherapy, by contrast, depends upon an atmosphere of confidence and trust in which the patient is willing to make a frank and complete disclosure of facts, emotions, memories, and fears. Because of the sensitive nature of the problems for which individuals consult psychotherapists, disclosure of confidential communications made during counseling sessions may cause embarrassment or disgrace. For this reason, the mere possibility of disclosure may impede development of the confidential relationship necessary for successful treatment. As the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee observed in 1972 when it recommended that Congress recognize a psychotherapist privilege as past of the Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence, a psychiatrist's ability to help her patients</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"is completely dependent upon [the patient's] willingness and ability to talk freely. This makes it difficult if not impossible for [a psychiatrist] to function without being able to assure...patients of confidentiality and, indeed, privileged communication. Where there may be exceptions to this general rule..., there is wide agreement that confidentiality is a <span class="Italic">sine qua non</span> for successful psychiatric treatment." Advisory Committee's Notes to Proposed Rules, 56 F.R.D. 183, 242 (1972) (quoting Group for Advancement of Psychiatry, Report No. 45, Confidentiality and Privileged Communication in the Practice of Psychiatry 92 (June 1960)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By protecting confidential communications between a psychotherapist and her patient from involuntary disclosure, the proposed privilege thus serves important private interests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our cases make clear that an asserted privilege must also "serv[e] public ends." <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S. Ct. 677, 682, 66 L. Ed.2d 584 (1981). Thus, the purpose of the attorney client privilege is to "encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> And the spousal privilege, as modified in <span class="Italic">Trammel</span>, is justified because it "furthers the important public interest in marital harmony," 445 U.S., at 53, 100 S. Ct., at 914. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Nixon</span>, 418 U.S., at 705, 94 S. Ct., at 3106; <span class="Italic">Wolfe v. United States</span>, 291 U.S., at 14, 54 S. Ct., at 280. The psychotherapist privilege serves the public interest by facilitating the provision of appropriate treatment for individuals suffering the effects of a mental or emotional problem. The mental health of our citizenry, no less than its physical health, is a public good of transcendent importance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the significant public and private interests supporting recognition of the privilege, the likely evidentiary benefit that would result from the denial of the privilege is modest. If the privilege were rejected, confidential conversations between psychotherapists and their patients would surely be chilled, particularly when it is obvious that the circumstances that gave rise to the need for treatment will probably result in litigation. Without a privilege, much of the desirable evidence to which litigants such as petitioner seek access--for example, admissions against interest by a party--is unlikely to come into being. This unspoken "evidence" will therefore serve no greater truth-seeking function than if it had been spoken and privileged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That it is appropriate for the federal courts to recognize a psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501 is confirmed by the fact that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted into law some form of psychotherapist privilege....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All agree that a psychotherapist privilege covers confidential communications made to licensed psychiatrists and psychologists. We have no hesitation in concluding in this case that the federal privilege should also extend to confidential communications made to licensed social workers in the course of psychotherapy. The reasons for recognizing such a privilege for treatment by psychiatrists and psychologists apply with equal force to treatment by a clinical social worker.... Today, social workers provide a significant amount of mental health treatment. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for Mental Health Services, Mental Health, United States, 1994, pp. 85-87, 107-114; Brief for National Association of Social Workers <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 5-7 (citing authorities). Their clients often include the poor and those of modest means who could not afford the assistance of a psychiatrist or psychologist,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 6-7 (citing authorities), but whose counseling sessions serve the same goals. Perhaps in recognition of these circumstances, the vast majority of States explicitly extend a testimonial privilege to licensed social workers. We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that "[d]rawing a distinction between the counseling provided by costly psychotherapists and the counseling provided by more readily accessible social workers serves no discernible public purpose." 51 F.3d, at 1358, n.19.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We part company with the Court of Appeals on a separate point. We reject the balancing component of the privilege implemented by that court and a small number of States. Making the promise of confidentiality contingent upon a trial judge's later evaluation of the relative importance of the patient's interest in privacy and the evidentiary need for disclosure would eviscerate the effectiveness of the privilege. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Upjohn</span>, if the purpose of the privilege is to be served, the participants in the confidential conversation "must be able to predict with some degree of certainty whether particular discussions will be protected. An uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege at all." 449 U.S., at 393, 101 S. Ct., at 684.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span> acknowledged the existence of the psychotherapist privilege, it is axiomatic that any privilege can be waived. Although, as discussed below, the lower courts have split on precisely when the privilege will be deemed waived, some general agreement exists. The employee waives the privilege when extensive and ongoing damages are requested, and when the employee plans to have the psychotherapist testify at the hearing regarding damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Vann v. Lone Star Steakhouse &#x0026; Saloon of Springfield, Inc.</span>, 967 F. Supp. 346 (C.D. Ill. 1997), the district court held that when a Title VII plaintiff places her mental condition at issue by claiming damages and listing her treating psychotherapist as an expert witness the privilege is waived. In a decision upholding the order of a magistrate judge to produce psychiatric records, the court in <span class="Italic">Vann</span>, at 349-50, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court agrees with the Defendants. Because the instant case is a federal question case, and not one of diversity, the federal common law of privileges applies. Fed. R. Evid. 501. A psychotherapist-patient privilege exists under the federal common law. <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 1923. Consequently, Plaintiff's reliance on the Illinois Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act is to no avail. While the Court may look to the state law for guidance, the ultimate scope of the privilege is governed by federal law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question in this case boils down to whether Plaintiff has waived the privilege. The most analogous Seventh Circuit case is <span class="Italic">In re Pebsworth</span>, 705 F.2d 261 (7th Cir. 1983). In that case, the court held that "any arguable psychotherapist-patient privilege as to these specific kinds of billing and administrative records was intentionally and knowingly relinquished through the patient's assent to the publicizing aspect of the reimbursement and claims procedure." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 262. In light of that case, this Court concludes that the Seventh Circuit would recognize waiver of the psychotherapist-patient privilege when the patient-litigant puts her mental condition into issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Court finds decisions in other courts to be extremely persuasive. In <span class="Italic">Sarko v. Penn-Del Directory Co.</span>, 170 F.R.D. 127, 130 (E.D. Pa. 1997), the court set forth its rationale for finding that a party waives the privilege by placing her mental condition at issue. First, the court had previously held that a litigant may waive the privilege by placing her mental condition at issue<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Second, the Supreme Court, in <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, analogized the policy considerations supporting recognition of a psychotherapist-patient privilege to those underlying the attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege is waived when the advice of counsel is placed at issue in the litigation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Third, the court held that "allowing a plaintiff 'to hide...behind a claim of privilege when that condition is placed directly at issue in a case would simply be contrary to the most basic sense of fairness and justice.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Premack v. J.C.J. Ogar, Inc.</span>, 148 F.R.D. 140, 145 (E.D. Pa. 1993). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Topol v. Trustees of University of Pennsylvania</span>, 160 F.R.D. 476, 477 (E.D. Pa. 1995) ("Having placed her mental state in issue, plaintiff waived any applicable psychotherapist-patient privilege."); <span class="Italic">Price v. County of San Diego</span>, 165 F.R.D. 614, 622 (S.D. Cal. 1996) ("Where patient-litigant has raised an issue as to his or her psychological state, the privilege will be waived.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, however, came to the opposite conclusion in <span class="Italic">Vanderbilt v. Town of Chilmark</span>, 174 F.R.D. 225 (D. Mass. 1997). Relying upon the Supreme Court's rejection of a balancing test in <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, the court found there was no waiver of the privilege. The court in <span class="Italic">Vanderbilt</span> specifically rejected the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Sarko v. Penn-Del Directory Company</span>, 170 F.R.D. 127 (E.D. Pa. 1997), which the <span class="Italic">Vann</span> court had relied upon. The court in <span class="Italic">Vanderbilt</span> did, however, find the privilege could be waived where the plaintiff planned to rely on the testimony of the psychotherapist:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_512"></span>First, the <span class="Italic">Sarko</span> court noted that, in <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, the Supreme Court did not explicitly address waiver or the scope of the privilege, and that cases pre-dating <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span> found waiver when a patient placed her "mental condition at issue." <span class="Italic">Sarko</span>, 170 F.R.D. at 130. But, when deciding cases prior to <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, courts did not have <span class="Italic">Jaffee's</span> mandate against balancing the need for the evidence against the patient's interest in the privilege.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Jaffee's</span> "no balancing" instruction drastically changes the waiver formula. When a patient pleads emotional injury, she has not explicitly waived the privilege. All she has done is make her communication with her psychotherapist potentially relevant. That evidence may be harmful, or helpful, to her case<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Sax v. Sax</span>, 136 F.R.D. 541, 542 (D. Mass. 1991) (stating that in attorney-client privilege, "[t]he test is not whether the information which is the subject of the privilege is 'relevant,' the information is usually highly relevant.") After <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, a court cannot force disclosure of that evidence solely because it may be extremely useful to the finder of fact. Giving weight to the usefulness of the evidence as a factor in a decision regarding the scope of the privilege would be a balancing exercise that was barred by <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Sarko</span> court may have read <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span> to stand for the proposition that bright-line certainty is required when delineating the scope of the privilege. But, <span class="Italic">Sarko's</span> "mental-state-at-issue" test does not provide that certainty. Indeed, different courts have come to very different conclusions as to when and under what circumstances a patient actually places her mental or emotional state at issue. <span class="Italic">Compare Sabree</span>, 126 F.R.D. at 426 (holding that plaintiff does not put mental state at issue by "making a 'garden-variety' claim of emotional distress") with <span class="Italic">Topol v. Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania</span>, 160 F.R.D. 476, 477 (E.D. Pa. 1995) (holding that plaintiff places mental state at issue simply by "seeking damages for mental and emotional distress).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the "mental-state-at-issue" test, therefore, a patient would not know with certainty, at the time of her psychotherapy, whether the communication would be privileged at a later date. This uncertainty could "eviscerate the effectiveness of the privilege." <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, 116 S. Ct. at 1932.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the <span class="Italic">Sarko</span> court, following the example of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, analogized the privilege to the attorney-client privilege. <span class="Italic">Sarko</span>, 170 F.R.D. at 130. The court recognized that the attorney-client privilege "is waived when the advice of counsel is placed at issue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (cites omitted). As a result, the court found that a patient waives the privilege when she places her "mental condition at issue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This court agrees with the process of analogy found in <span class="Italic">Sarko</span>, but disagrees with the result. The attorney-client privilege and the psychotherapist-patient privilege are both "rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust." <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span>, 116 S. Ct. at 1928 (quoting <span class="Italic">Trammel v. United States</span>, 445 U.S. 40, 47 (1980). It is reasonable, therefore, to suggest that the scope of the two privileges should be similar.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The attorney-client privilege is undoubtedly waived if the privileged communication is placed at issue by the client. That is, when the client uses the substance of the attorney-client relationship to further her own cause, she cannot claim that the communication is privileged. For example, if a client uses her reliance on her attorney's advice as a defense, she waives the privilege. Also, if a client sues her attorney for malpractice, she waives the privilege. In contrast, a client does not waive the privilege solely by seeking attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, this court reasons that the privilege is waived if the communication between a psychotherapist and a patient is, itself, put at issue by the patient. A patient whose cause of action relies on the advice or findings of her psychotherapist cannot claim the privilege. If a patient were to sue her psychotherapist for malpractice, the privilege would obviously be waived.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The act of seeking damages for emotional distress is analogous to seeking attorney's fees. The fact that a privileged communication has taken place may be relevant. But, the fact that a communication has taken place does not necessarily put is content at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, the court in <span class="Italic">Sarko</span> found "that allowing a plaintiff 'to hide...behind a claim of privilege when that condition is placed directly at issue in a case would simply be contrary to the most basic sense of fairness and justice.'" <span class="Italic">Sarko</span>, 170 F.R.D. at 130 (quoting <span class="Italic">Premack v. J.C.J. Ogar, Inc.</span>, 148 F.R.D. 140, 145 (E.D. Pa. 1993). This argument harkens back to the understanding that a privilege "cannot and should not at once be used as a shield and a sword." <span class="Italic">Inserra v. Hamblett &#x0026; Kerrigan, P.A.</span>, 1995 WL 54402 (D.N.H. 1995) (citations omitted) (commenting on attorney-client privilege). Once again, this court agrees with the premise, but not its application.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiff, here, is not using the privileged communication as a sword. Were she to introduce evidence regarding the substance of her conversations with her psychotherapist in order to further her claim of emotional damage, this court would agree that she could not shield the communication from others. She has, however, done no such thing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This court recognizes that it would be possible for Plaintiff to waive the privilege. Should she use the substance of her communication, by calling her psychotherapist as a witness, for example, or by testifying to the substance of the communication herself, then she would waive the privilege. These would be situations where Plaintiff puts the privileged communication itself at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To clarify the scope of the privilege, it is also important to note what it does not protect. Facts regarding the very occurrence of psychotherapy, such as the dates of treatment, are not privileged. And so, for example, if Plaintiff was seeing a psychotherapist before any actionable emotional injury allegedly occurred, the dates of such pre-existing treatment would be available to Defendants. The substance of the psychotherapist-patient communication is privileged. The fact that such communication took place is not.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Vasconcellos v. Cybex International, Inc.</span>, 962 F. Supp. 701 (D. Md. 1997), the court quashed a subpoena for all of the plaintiff's psychiatric records. However, the court gave the defendant an opportunity to craft a subpoena that was more narrowly drawn if it was accompanied by a showing that there was no other less intrusive way to obtain relevant information. The court in <span class="Italic">Vasconcellos</span>, 962 F. Supp. at 708-09, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Ms. Vasconcellos states that she sustained "emotional injuries" as a result of the wrongful conduct alleged in the Complaint. Complaint at &#x00B6; 49. She states that the sexual harassment she experienced caused her "severe emotional distress." Complaint at &#x00B6; 68. Plaintiffs have further placed Ms. Vasconcellos's mental state in issue in this lawsuit by including a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress which has as an element of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress. Complaint at &#x00B6; 135. Moreover, Plaintiffs' complaint makes clear that a large portion of the requested damages arise out of Ms. Vasconcellos's claims that she suffered emotional distress as a result of the challenged actions. Complaint at 37-39.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, Ms. Vasconcellos has raised serious concerns that the disclosures will adversely affect her psychiatric treatment by destroying the confidentiality of her relationship with Dr. Wadman. Affidavit of Ms. Vasconcellos, attached to Paper No. 4. In light of the important public policy behind the existence of the psychotherapist privilege, this is still an important consideration to the Court, even if Ms. Vasconcellos has placed her mental state at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Ms. Vasconcellos has a right to have discovery limited to information that is directly relevant to the lawsuit. The request for documents contained in the current subpoena is too broad.<span class="Italic"> See Bridges v. Eastman Kodak Co.</span>, 850 F. Supp. 216, 223 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) ("although the defendants will be permitted to inquire into plaintiff's personal histories, it must be emphasized that defendants may not engage in a fishing expedition by inquiring into matters totally irrelevant to the issue of emotional distress. In other words, the scope of the inquiry must be limited to whether, and to what extent, the alleged harassment caused plaintiffs to suffer emotional harm.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the motion to quash will be granted. Ms. Vasconcellos has the option of filing an amended complaint that withdraws the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as the requested damages for emotional distress in the other counts.<span class="Italic"> See Covell v. CNG Transmission Corp.</span>, 863 F. Supp. 202, 206 (M.D. Pa. 1994) (defendants claim that privilege was waived when mental state was placed in issue was rendered moot by plaintiff's withdrawal of claims for emotional pain and mental anguish). Defendants also have other, less intrusive means by which they may obtain much of the information they seek. For example, Ms. Vasconcellos has volunteered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation under appropriate circumstances. Ms. Vasconcellos's Affidavit at &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Court finds that Ms. Vasconcellos has placed her mental condition at issue, however, Defendants may also bring a new subpoena, if they can show cause as to why such an intrusion into the therapeutic relationship is the only possible means to obtain relevant information. Such a new subpoena must be much more narrowly-tailored in order to avoid any greater infringement than is necessary on Ms. Vasconcellos's confidential relationship with Dr. Wadman.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court in <span class="Italic">Schoffstall v. Henderson</span>, 223 F.3d 818, 823 (8th Cir. 2000), found that by placing her medical condition at issue, the plaintiff waived the psychotherapist privilege:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, Schoffstall claims the information sought from Krumm and Wangler is protected from discovery by psychotherapist-patient privilege. The USPS counters that the information is discoverable because Schoffstall has placed her medical condition at issue. The Supreme Court has recognized the psychotherapist-patient privilege in federal question cases, <span class="Italic">see Jaffee v. Redmond</span>, 518 U.S. 1, 15 (1996), but has not addressed whether the privilege is waived by a plaintiff who places his or her medical condition at issue. Numerous courts since <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span> have concluded that, similar to attorney-client privilege that can be waived when the client places the attorney's representation at issue, a plaintiff waives the psychotherapist-patient privilege by placing his or her medical condition at issue<span class="Italic">. See Sarko v. Penn-Del Directory Co.</span>, 170 F.R.D. 127, 130 (E.D. Pa. 1997); <span class="Italic">Vann v. Lone Star Steakhouse &#x0026; Saloon, Inc.</span>, 967 F. Supp. 346, 349-50 (C.D. Ill. 1997); <span class="Italic">EEOC <span id="Page_513"></span>v. Danka</span> <span class="Italic">Indus., Inc.</span>, 990 F. Supp. 1138, 1142 (E.D. Mo. 1997); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Chubb Corp.</span>, 193 F.R.D. 216, 225 (D. N.J. 2000); <span class="Italic">but see Vanderbilt v. Town of Chilmark</span>, 174 F.R.D. 225, 225-30 (D. Mass. 1997) (declining to find waiver where plaintiff sought emotional distress damages).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finding these cases persuasive, we agree that by placing her medical condition at issue, Schoffstall waived the psychotherapist-patient privilege.</p>
<p class="noindent">Much of the dispute about the precise meaning of <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span> might be academic. While courts are split on whether a claim for damages for emotional distress waives the psychotherapist privilege, the courts seem to universally agree that a decision by the plaintiff to place the therapist on the stand is a waiver of any privilege. To the extent that most complainants will want to rely on the testimony of their therapist to establish the existence and the nature of the emotional distress, the Commission will likely consider this a waiver of the therapist privilege.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also, as discussed above, the Commission's administrative judges have no subpoena authority and, therefore, cannot directly compel the production of a psychotherapist's medical records on a complainant. Indirectly, though, an administrative judge can compel such production simply by imposing the sanction of not allowing the psychotherapist to testify if the records are not produced.</p>
