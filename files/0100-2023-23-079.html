<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-77"><span class="space">1.</span> Reasonable Medical Documentation</h4>
<p class="noindent">A difficulty often encountered in cases under the Rehabilitation Act is providing medical information in the form the agency desires. The problem can be two-fold: employees do not understand what is required of them, and doctors are reluctant to provide information in a form to which they are unaccustomed. When the employee fails to provide information in the required form, "this factor is unrelated to appellant's handicap and the issue of accommodation. In this regard, the dispositive issue is whether appellant's handicap prevented him from complying with the documentation requirement." <span class="Italic">Fox v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880481 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">Disputes also commonly arise over the adequacy of medical documentation provided by employees in support of accommodation requests. In the past, the Commission has been less than clear in establishing firm guidelines for what constitutes adequate medical evidence. However, it is clear that an agency is not justified in refusing accommodation on the basis of insufficient medical evidence where the complainant provides a statement from his psychiatrist identifying the condition and linking its exacerbation to specific job assignments, as well as a supporting "note" from the complainant's physician. <span class="Italic">Thompkins v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01872684 (1988). From this information, the agency could adequately determine whether an accommodation such as job restructuring would impose an undue burden.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies and employees engage in continual battles over the extent of medical documentation needed to establish that an employee is a qualified person with a disability and to request accommodation. There is ample evidence of both sides using a lack of common sense and cooperation in this area. Certainly, the employee must provide at least a medical diagnosis that demonstrates the existence of a medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity. If the agency determines that the initial documentation is inadequate, it may request additional information, but the agency should put the employee on notice as to the specific medical information it needs. But agencies should be aware that the ADA places very specific restrictions on preemployment and postappointment medical inquiries and examinations. Those restrictions have been incorporated into the Rehabilitation Act. Violation of those restrictions is a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act and requires no showing of intent by the complainant. See the "<a href="0100-2023-23-128.html#sec14-126">Medical Inquiries and Examinations</a>" section, below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ADAAA did not directly change the requirement for the individual to establish that he or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity and, as a result, likely does not change the Commission's definition of what constitutes reasonable medical documentation. However, because the ADA does contain provisions restricting disability-related inquiries, agencies need to be mindful that it should, as a general rule, take less medical evidence to establish a substantial limitation under the ADAAA than was required before its passage. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Nancy D. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120172931 (2019), found the complainant's medical documentation requesting a reduced workload was "inherently subjective" and insufficient to trigger the agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Rehabilitation Act and the Commission's regulations, an agency is required to make reasonable accommodation of the known physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(o), 1630.2(p). Reasonable accommodation includes job restructuring and reassignment to a vacant position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The accommodation Complainant sought was to lessen her workload. To do this, she suggested being reassigned, her COTR functions being moved to another employee, and/or a detail. In opposition to the appeal, the Agency argues that while Complainant's oncologist's letter opined she would benefit from less stressful working conditions, the letter was written in March 2017, about three years after she filed her EEO complaint. It further argues that a medical opinion that someone would benefit from accommodation is a far cry from sufficient medical evidence to trigger an Agency's duty to accommodate by indicating that Complainant had specific limitations that warranted the accommodations she seeks. It also argues that the COTR function is an essential function of Complainant's job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant argues that while she offered to submit medical documentation in support of her request for reasonable accommodation, S2 did not request it. She also argues, as she contended before, that the COTR function was not an essential function of her position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record confirms that S2 did not request Complainant submit medical documentation to support her accommodation request for a lesser workload to reduce her stress because S2 believed, based on her own life experience with cancer, she understood Complainant's need. The record shows she asked FEMA's Human Capital office to search for a new job for Complainant. Complainant stated that she was denied the names of the people conducting the search, and S2 was the gatekeeper. Complainant stated that no one from Human Capital ever contacted her to discuss her limitations or qualifications. But nothing stopped Complainant from providing this information to S2 or contacting leadership in FEMA's Human Capital office to ask that it be provided to the people conducting the search.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Agency that Complainant's request for the reasonable accommodation of a GS-14 job with a "smaller workload" was inherently subjective. We also agree with the Agency that Complainant's reassignment request was insufficient to trigger the requirement that the Agency reassign or detail her, especially as there was no indication that Complainant's medical condition limited her ability to perform the essential functions of her current position. In fact, the evidence of record shows that her performance in her position of record exceeded expectations. We also find that Complainant has not shown she was <span id="Page_1187"></span>disparately treated regarding the Agency's actions or lack thereof on her reassignment and detail requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that being a COTR was not an essential function of her position. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n) provides the term essential function means the fundamental job duties of the position in question, and that essential functions do not include marGINAl functions. Under the regulation, a job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including but not limited to a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed. Further, evidence of whether a function is essential includes, but is not limited to the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential, written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, and the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant avers that while being the primary Project Officer to all Office of Equal Rights investigative contractors is identified as a major duty in her position description, the COTR function is different. Sample letters appointing Complainant as COTR for various investigations indicate that the COTR inspects deliverables and monitors services for conformance with performance standards, accepting or rejecting them, which fits within what a Project Officer does. Even if some COTR functions are distinguishable from being a Project Officer, such as reviewing contractor requests for travel, overtime, and payment vouchers, and doing other administrative work, we find that being a COTR was nevertheless an essential function of her job. Complainant joined FEMA in 2008, managing the Formal Complaints Unit since then, first as a team lead, and then after a reorganization in 2012, as a supervisor. She served as a COTR since 2009 and conceded that when she asked in 2014 if it was possible to have her COTR duties reassigned in 2014, S2 responded that Complainant was the only person in the office with Department of Homeland Security Contract Officer Representative certification. The COTR function regarding contract investigators was critical, the EEO investigative function was part of Complainant's program, and there were no or a limited number of people with the required certification to perform the COTR function for contract EEO investigators. Complainant stated that it was the combination of performing as COTR and her other functions that made her work excessive and disputed S1's statement that the COTR function was at most 20% of her work. While S2 explored S1 taking over this function as COTR and the FEMA Office of Equal Rights Administrative Officer, GS-13, around the fall of 2016 became the alternate COTR for EEO investigations, this does not change that serving as COTR was an essential function of Complainant's job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the COTR function was an essential function of Complainant's job, the Agency was not required to eliminate this function for her as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Further, a list of medications, a Veterans' Affairs letter indicating the complainant's disability rating, and the complainant's "own list of diagnoses/impairments and their impact" did not "clearly establish" that an accommodation was needed in <span class="Italic">Taylor G. v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 2021001612 (2022). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Taylor G</span>. specifically noted that "Complainant submitted no documentation from a health care provider explaining why he needed the reasonable accommodation of telework, and not a lessor accommodation, such as, for example, a heater or limited exposure to cold to accommodate his Raynaud's syndrome." </p>
<p class="noindent">To assist agencies and complainants in determining what constitutes reasonable documentation, the EEOC addressed the issue in its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (March 1999). Published in its <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination," the guidance makes clear that in some instances, where the disability and its limitations on the job are obvious, no documentation may be necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">In most cases, an agency's individualized inquiry will include a request to the individual for documentation from a physician or other health care professional. An agency may not ask for documentation in all cases, however. Nor may the agency continue to ask for documentation once it has the information it needs to make a reasonable accommodation. The Commission's <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination," at pp. 777-78, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the <span class="Italic">disability and/or the need for accommodation is not obvious</span>, the employer may ask the individual for <span class="Italic">reasonable documentation</span> about his/her disability and functional limitations. The employer is entitled to know that the individual has a covered disability for which s/he needs a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted, emphasis in oriGINAl.) <span class="Italic">See also Enforcement Guidance: Psychiatric Disabilities</span>, at p. 22. A request for medical documentation is only appropriate when the disability is not obvious.</p>
<p class="noindent">The enforcement guidance uses the term "reasonable documentation." The accommodation process does not give the agency <span class="Italic">carte blanche</span> to learn everything there is to know about an employee's medical condition. The <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination," at p. 778, defines reasonable documentation as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reasonable documentation means that the employer may require only the documentation that is needed to establish that a person has an ADA disability, and that the disability necessitates a reasonable accommodation. Thus, an employer, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation, cannot ask for documentation that is unrelated to determining the existence of a disability and the necessity for an accommodation. This means that in most situations an employer cannot request a person's complete medical records because they are likely to contain information unrelated to the disability at issue and the need for accommodation. If an individual has more than one disability, an employer can request information pertaining only to the disability that requires a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination," at pp. 779-80, provides some further examples of requests for reasonable documentation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example A</span>: An employee says to an employer, "I'm having trouble reaching tools because of my shoulder injury." The employer may ask the employee for documentation describing the impairment; the nature, severity, and duration of the impairment; the activity or activities that the impairment limits; and the extent to which the impairment limits the employee's ability to perform the activity or activities (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the employer is seeking information as to whether the employee has an ADA disability).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example B</span>: A marketing employee has a severe learning disability. He attends numerous meetings to plan marketing strategies. In order to remember what is discussed at these meetings he must take detailed notes but, due to his disability, he has great difficulty writing. The employee tells his supervisor about his disability and requests a laptop computer to use in the meetings. Since neither the disability nor the need for accommodation are obvious, the supervisor may ask the employee for reasonable documentation about his impairment; the nature, severity, and duration of the impairment; the activity or activities that the impairment limits; and the extent to which the impairment limits the employee's ability to perform the activity or activities. The employer also may ask why the disability necessitates use of a laptop computer (or any other type of reasonable accommodation, such as a tape recorder) to help the employee retain the information from the meetings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example C</span>: An employee's spouse phones the employee's supervisor on Monday morning to inform her that the employee had a medical emergency due to multiple sclerosis, needed to be hospitalized, and thus requires time off. The supervisor can ask the spouse to send in documentation from the employee's treating physician that confirms that the hospitalization was related to the multiple sclerosis and provides information on how long an absence may be required from work.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no actual requirement that an agency obtain medical documentation as a prerequisite to providing a reasonable accommodation. As noted by the Commission:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an alternative to requesting documentation, an employer may simply discuss with the person the nature of his/her disability and functional limitations. It would be useful for the employer to make clear to the individual why it is requesting information, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, to verify the existence of an ADA disability and the need for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 779.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Stander v. Postmaster General</span>, 01930152 (1994), the employee provided her supervisor with a letter from her doctor indicating that she was incapacitated because of major depression. The supervisor accepted the letter as adequate to justify leave. Approximately six weeks later, the physician provided another letter which again indicated the employee was suffering from major depression, was extremely disorganized in her thinking and cognitive abilities, and was unable to work. The doctor indicated that he did not expect her to recover before January. The supervisor rejected the letter as inadequate and the employee was removed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, after noting the first letter was deemed acceptable, found the supervisor was unreasonable in rejecting the second letter. The Commission held that the letter was sufficient to establish that the employee suffered from a disability which limited a major life activity. It further held the doctor's indication that she would not recover put the agency on notice as to the requested accommodation; <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, extended leave for recovery. Noting the employee made a good faith effort to comply with the agency's requests for medical documentation, the Commission found that if the agency believed it needed additional information, it should have explained why the information was needed, and specifically what it needed.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0120100436 (2013), the Commission found that the agency's request for supplemental medical information was warranted, particularly where the agency had granted informal temporary accommodations while awaiting the additional information. The complainant in that case suffered from a respiratory ailment <span id="Page_1188"></span>that was triggered when the agency opened a new building. The complainant was initially granted a temporary accommodation of teleworking pending receipt of additional medical information on what triggered her allergic reaction. The telework accommodation was rescinded after an agencywide decision to suspend teleworking following a security breach. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span>, found that the agency did not deny the complainant reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, Complainant was informally accommodated, but when the Agency requested medical documentation to support her claim, specifically documentation which would show what the "trigger" was to her condition, Complainant failed to provide acceptable documentation. In fact, the record shows that the Agency informed Complainant about the tests needed and still she did not provide the requested medical information. We find that the break down in the process was caused by Complainant failing to provide the requested medical documentation. The record shows that the Agency had the building tested, and had two physicians review Complainant's submitted data in relation to the documentation compiled about the building. As Complainant failed to provide the medical information requested, we find that she has not demonstrated that the Agency failed to provide her with an accommodation or subjected her to disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120130653 (2015), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant submitted two medical documents to support her request for a reasonable accommodation. The first document dated March 8, 2011, simply stated that Complainant had been seen by a physician for cervicalgia. This document did not list any of Complainant's medical restrictions or that she needs a reasonable accommodation. The second document was dated March 30, 2009, and listed Complainant's medical restrictions but did not state what Complainant's medical condition was or why she needed these restrictions. We note that this second document was two years old and did not reflect Complainant's current medical condition when she requested an accommodation in March 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency requested updated medical documentation from Complainant numerous times, and Complainant did not provide the documentation. When an individual's disability or need for reasonable accommodation is not obvious, and the individual fails to provide reasonable documentation requested by the employer, the employer will not be held liable for failure to provide the requested accommodation. Guidance, Question 6. Accordingly, the Commission finds that Complainant has not demonstrated that she was denied a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is justified in requesting medical information where the employee presents conflicting information about her medical condition. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120122255 (2015), the Commission found that the agency did not deny an accommodation of light duty where the medical evidence submitted by the employee had different restrictions and one designated the condition as permanent while another indicated it was temporary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, assuming, without finding, that Complainant is an individual with a disability, we find that Complainant failed to show that she was denied a reasonable accommodation or discriminatorily denied light duty. The record reflects that on February 14, 2011, Complainant provided medical documentation from her personal physician indicating permanent restrictions of lifting no more than 10 pounds and no repetitive grasping/gripping with either hand. Upon receipt of this medical documentation, Complainant's supervisor informed her that there was no work available commensurate with her medical restrictions. Additionally, Complainant's Manager (M1) stated that this initial request for temporary light duty was disapproved because it did not provide a time frame for her return to full duty and that the accompanying medical documentation from her personal physician indicated that her restrictions were permanent. Additionally, M1 stated that because the submitted documentation indicated that her restrictions were permanent, temporary light duty was not appropriate. Complainant would have to request permanent light duty in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement which requires all requests for permanent light duty be accompanied by a medical certificate from a physician designated by the installation head and not an employee's personal physician.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two days later, on February 16, 2011, Complainant provided revised restrictions from the same physician specifying no lifting over 17 pounds and no using the mail processing machine for more than 2 hours. This second document stated that these restrictions were no longer permanent but were instead in place for only 60 days at which point they would be reevaluated. Further, although the documentation indicated that Complainant's restrictions were related to an accepted work-related injury claim through the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), the record shows that management was unable to verify this as Complainant had not updated her claim or filed a notice of recurrence with OWCP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, by letter dated February 24, 2011, management informed Complainant that because of the significant differences between the restrictions listed in the two medical forms she had provided, she was scheduled to attend a fitness-for-duty examination for an independent evaluation of her restrictions on March 10, 2011. The physician who conducted the fitness-for-duty exam determined that Complainant had no restrictions and could resume full duties. However, following Complainant's updating of her OWCP documentation, by letter dated March 21, 2011, OWCP notified the Agency that Complainant's work-related injury claims had been accepted, at which point the Agency provided her with a limited duty job offer commensurate with her medical restrictions. We find that Complainant failed to show that she was denied a reasonable accommodation, given the conflicting medical documentation she submitted and the lack of any available duties commensurate with restrictions which were, for a time, considered to be permanent. We also find that Complainant failed to show that the Agency's articulated reasons for denying her light duty were a pretext for unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once an agency receives <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> medical documentation that an employee suffers from a disability, if it believes that documentation to be insufficient, it has an affirmative obligation to secure additional information. In <span class="Italic">Randel v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03960070 (1996), the agency removed the complainant for being AWOL after rejecting his medical documentation as insufficient to support his request for leave. The agency officials testified that they never considered complainant to be disabled and that they therefore never attempted to accommodate his medical condition. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Randel</span> reversed the agency finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although agency officials concluded that petitioner's medical documentation was inadequate to support his leave requests, the Commission finds that the documentation was sufficient to put them on notice that petitioner had a mental disability. Petitioner presented the agency with <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> medical documentation from a physician indicating a diagnosis of major depression for which he was taking medication and receiving psychotherapy. Record evidence makes clear, however, that agency officials rejected the physician's diagnosis of major depression and substituted their own "diagnosis" instead, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, petitioner had a personality conflict with his supervisor; he absented himself from work for that reason; and, he attempted to justify his absence by asserting that he had a medical condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency officials may not have liked the reasons that gave rise to petitioner's mental condition, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, conflicts in the workplace, but those reasons do not negate its legitimacy. If agency officials questioned the validity of the physician's diagnosis, they then had an affirmative obligation to obtain additional information either by speaking directly to petitioner's physician and/or referring petitioner for a fitness-for-duty examination. Record evidence showed that agency officials did neither.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, employees have an affirmative obligation to cooperate with the agency's efforts to obtain additional medical information. The failure to provide additional medical evidence can prove fatal to a claim that the employee was terminated because of his disability. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lovell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03960061 (1996), the Commission found the evidence presented to the agency prior to removal was insufficient for it to determine that the employee's medical condition substantially limited a major life activity. In <span class="Italic">Lovell</span>, the Commission determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record showed that in her July 1994 report, the psychologist had diagnosed petitioner as having major depression and generalized anxiety. The Commission finds that the information contained therein is sufficient to establish that petitioner's impairment substantially limited one or more of his major life activities and that he therefore was an individual with a disability. Nonetheless, the Commission finds that the medical information provided to the agency prior to petitioner's removal was insufficient for it to determine that petitioner's mental impairments rose to the level of a disability and that the agency made adequate efforts to secure additional information once it learned of petitioner's mental impairments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Record evidence showed that the agency requested additional medical documentation from petitioner in its June 24, 1994 letter. Rather than provide the requested medical documentation, however, petitioner instead submitted a letter to the agency himself. Record evidence further showed that when the requested medical information was not forthcoming, petitioner's second-line supervisor contacted the psychologist and arranged a meeting with her to discuss petitioner's mental impairments. Although the psychologist finally disclosed petitioner's diagnoses to the second-line supervisor at the August 1994 meeting, a review of the hearing transcript failed to show that she apprised the second-line supervisor of how these impairments affected petitioner. The psychologist testified that she "may have shared some of the symptoms involved in depression and anxiety." On cross-examination, when asked if--in addition to the diagnosis--she addressed other aspects of petitioner's incapacitation for duty, the psychologist responded, "I believe I may have. I don't recall specifically." Significantly, the psychologist admitted that she did not reveal to the second-line <span id="Page_1189"></span>supervisor "the severity of the problems [petitioner] was having, of the fearfulness he was having, of the paranoid feelings he was having...." The psychologist said that as a result, the second-line supervisor had some difficulty understanding why petitioner was unable to perform his job. Hearing testimony also established that neither petitioner nor the psychologist ever provided the agency with a copy of the July 1994 report prior to petitioner's removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing facts, the Commission finds that the medical information provided to the agency prior to petitioner's removal was insufficient to allow the conclusion that petitioner's mental impairments substantially limited one or more of his major life activities, thereby rendering him an individual with a disability under the regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the agency cannot use a request for accommodation to go on a wide-ranging quest for medical documentation. The request for medical documentation must be narrowly tailored to seek information regarding the nature of the complainant's alleged disabilities and its effect on the performance of essential job functions. In <span class="Italic">Yuni v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01990458 (1999), the Commission held that the agency overstepped these limits:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that the agency failed to meet its obligation under the Rehabilitation Act to engage in the interactive dialogue necessary to adequately address accommodation requests and to explain in any meaningful way why it needed medical documentation from appellant. The AJ also found that management officials threatened to charge appellant leave if he again visited the nurses station. The AJ further found that the agency's conduct ultimately forced appellant to assume the burden of providing his own accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the AJ, the evidence established the following. PO drafted a memorandum seeking from appellant broad medical information and extensive documentation. S2 did not initially give appellant PO's memorandum and requested that appellant simply provide an updated medical certificate. After appellant provided an updated medical certificate, PO and S3 seemed to badger appellant about providing more medical documentation and he was warned that he would be charged leave whenever he visited the nurse. At no time did any agency official explain to appellant the accommodation process and his obligations to provide medical documentation so that the agency might accommodate him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found the first two requests posed by PO in her memorandum unlawfully broad. The first two requests included the history of appellant's medical condition and clinical findings of the most recent medical evaluation, including diagnosis, prognosis and plans for future treatment. The AJ noted that lawful medical questions are limited to the nature of the employee's medical condition and how that condition limits the employee's abilities to perform the essential functions of his job. The AJ also found that the updated medical certificate adequately addressed the necessary and relevant issues pertinent to a request for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the AJ found the tone of PO's memorandum and testimony at the hearing hostile and contemptuous; demonstrating a lack of understanding of the agency's obligations toward disabled employees and the accommodation process. The AJ also noted that appellant strongly objected to taking sick leave when he went to the nurse's station, however, there were no discussions of alternatives to taking sick leave, such as a flexible schedule, between appellant and his supervisors. Accordingly, the AJ found that the agency discriminated against appellant when it failed to accommodate him and forced him to provide his own accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency does not make a legitimate request for adequate medical documentation, it will not be found in violation of the Rehabilitation Act where it promptly provides reasonable accommodation after receiving the documentation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Longey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A03848 (2002), the Commission found the agency had not failed to provide the complainant with reasonable accommodation where the oriGINAl documentation from the complainant's physician only indicated he should avoid prolonged standing and walking. The agency requested a more specific definition of the restrictions. "Here, without more information about the meaning of the phrase 'prolonged standing or walking,' the agency could not determine what accommodations were necessary." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Because the agency promptly provided accommodation upon receipt of the additional documentation, it did not discriminate against the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency grants the complainant's request for accommodation and is then advised that the accommodations have not proven effective, it is justified in requesting further medical information. In <span class="Italic">Weston v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A45675 (2005), the complainant requested a change in cleaning agents and her work schedule to avoid cleaning hours as an accommodation for her chemical sensitivity. Later, she requested a change in work location because of her reaction to colognes and deodorizers. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Weston</span> found that the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act in requesting additional medical information:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act due to its actions in February of 2003. we note that the agency only had an obligation to provide the accommodation in response to complainant's known limitations, and only if she had a disability. While the agency may have been willing to grant the requested accommodation to complainant, unless her disability was obvious or sufficient documentation had been provided earlier, the limitations associated with complainant's allergic condition were not known to agency management in February of 2003. As such, when complainant informed agency management that the accommodation it was providing for her was not effective, the agency was within its right to discontinue the accommodation and request further, more specific information from complainant's physician. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Number 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002) (Enforcement Guidance). The Commission has held that the Americans with Disabilities Act allows an employer to ask an individual for documentation when the individual requests a reasonable accommodation, when the disability and/or the need for accommodation is not obvious. Enforcement Guidance at 12. As such, we find that the agency was allowed to request more specific information from complainant regarding the nature of her allergic condition and the accommodations which would best allow her to work at the facility. In addition, as complainant informed agency management that the accommodation was not effective, we cannot find that the agency erred in terminating at least part of the accommodation which had been provided for her, until more specific information could be provided by complainant's allergist regarding the locations she could safely work in and chemicals she was not allergic to. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies are required to keep medical information confidential and to segregate such information from other information about the employee. However, the failure to do so does not constitute an actionable violation of the Rehabilitation Act where the complainant does not meet the requirements of being a person with a disability. In <span class="Italic">Daniels v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932648 (1994), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we do not consider further the propriety of the Station Manager's recommendation comments because appellant does not meet the jurisdictional requirement of being a person with a disability, we remind the agency that EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(e)(4), previously codified at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.706(d), requires that information regarding the medical condition and history of an individual with a disability be kept confidential except for the situations specified in the Regulation. Furthermore, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12112(d)(3)(B) and 12112(d)(4)(C), requires employers to maintain information regarding the medical condition and history of individuals with disabilities in separate medical files and to treat such information as confidential except in specified situations<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.14(b)(1), c(1) and (d)(1). These ADA requirements are applicable to cases brought under &#x00A7; 501 of the Rehabilitation Act pursuant to Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, P.L. 102-569 (October 29, 1992). We further remind the agency that it must ensure that its managers and supervisors understand the requirements of EEO law. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not under an obligation to seek medical information in support of a reasonable accommodation request from the Office of Workers Compensation when the employee fails to provide it. In <span class="Italic">Friel v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120081128 (2011), the Commission rejected an argument by the complainant that the agency could have requested his medical information from OWCP and that he was not denied reasonable accommodation where he had otherwise submitted no evidence to substantiate his request to given only limited overtime as an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant does fail to provide necessary medical information in support of a reasonable accommodation request, the Commission often looks at it as a failure of the complainant to engage in the interactive process, something that is fatal to the complaint. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Akbar v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120081202 (2011).</p>
