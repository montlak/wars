<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-69"><span class="space">o.</span> Supervisor's Change in Behavior</h5>
<p class="noindent">A simple change in behavior by a supervisor may support a claim of reprisal. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Michelle N. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120162415 (2018), where the Commission found that the totality of the circumstances supported a conclusion that the supervisor's behavior toward the complainant changed after the complainant made a request for accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find sufficient evidence in the record to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal. The record shows that Complainant engaged in protected EEO activity prior to S1's decision to lower her performance rating from Outstanding to Fully Successful. Starting in April 2014, Complainant formally requested a reasonable accommodation and engaged in the reasonable accommodation process, which is a protected EEO activity. On June 3, 2014, the Agency granted Complainant an accommodation to remain on the day shift from June 15, 2014 until September 21, 2014 when Complainant would have to resubmit additional medical documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that S1's behavior drastically changed after she requested an accommodation and that S1 downgraded her performance rating because she requested a reasonable accommodation to be placed on the day shift without rotation. While Complainant's testimony indicates that she was confused as to the timing of various incidents, we find that the totality of the record supports the conclusion that S1's behavior toward Complainant changed sometime after June 2014. The testimonial and documentary record supports Complainant's assertion that S1 started to require that she use leave instead of permitting the voluntary switching of shifts with her co-workers. The record also shows that on August 20, 2014, Complainant requested mediation regarding a dispute with S1 pertaining to an allegation of hostile work environment following her reasonable accommodation request. The record shows that S1 made the decision to lower Complainant's performance rating on or before September 18, 2014 (i.e., the date S1 sent Complainant's performance rating to S2 for approval). We note that S1 testified that she was aware of Complainant's prior EEO activity before making the performance rating decision without specifying the EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also establishes that S1 articulated legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for lowering Complainant's performance rating. Specifically, the record shows that S1 gave the performance review to Complainant on October 29, 2014 and explained that the rating had been downgraded because Complainant had not gone above and beyond and did not perform the Gains and Losses (GL) Report which occurred on the night shift.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 testified that maintaining a rating higher than Fully Successful requires doing something outside of the service, such as being involved in an outreach program. S1 further states that "above and beyond," means stepping out of a normal routine and daily job. S1 notes by way of example, that an inpatient unit clerk went over and above her normal duties as assigned and wrote new standard operating procedures for the good of the service. S1 also states that everybody has an opportunity to step out of the box. S1 explains that Complainant had, in years prior, been involved with Stand Down, a homeless project, and two years prior Complainant went through leadership training and completed Emerging Leaders. S1 also states that Complainant assisted with the New Patient Orientation Committee, and that is considered personal mastery in education, for which she was rated exceptional, and which is outside of her normal business and elements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 added that Complainant needed to build a stronger rapport with her internal staff. S1 testified that she received complaints about Complainant from her co-workers. S1 describes one written complaint from a co-worker (C1) dated September 8, 2014, where she complains that Complainant had interrogated her about who reported to management that she was late to work. C1 also complained that Complainant left her alone on her shift for an extended period, which she has done previously. S1 also testified that in May 2014, a unit clerk (C2), with less than a year experience, wrote to S1 that she was upset that she overheard a conversation that Complainant had with a Nurse Manager and an AOD where Complainant indicated that C2 did not have enough experience and was not qualified to assist the AODs yet. Lastly, S1 noted that Complainant had a number of mistakes or inconsistencies in her GL Reports.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the record supports the conclusion that S1's decision to lower Complainant's annual performance rating was a pretext for retaliation. Complainant asserts that when she received her rating, S1 could not explain what changed in her work ethic or performance. We find that the record supports Complainant's assertion that she received no indication, written or otherwise, that her performance level was at risk of dropping at all, let alone so drastically. We do not find credible S1's uncorroborated testimony that she verbally advised Complainant at her mid-year rating that she needed to be more conscientious when registering patients and more mindful of how she talked with fellow colleagues. However, even if S1 did make this statement to Complainant at her midterm review, there is no indication from such comments that Complainant's high performance rating from the prior year was at risk of dropping so drastically, if at all. It belies common sense that S1 would reduce Complainant's prior Outstanding rating by two levels to Fully Successful without prior notification which was documented in some form.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testifies that the main reason S1 gave for lowering her performance rating was the fact that she did not generate any GL Reports. Complainant concedes that she did not generate any GL Reports because she did not work the night shift during the relevant time-frame. However, Complainant asserts that the GL Reports are prepared on the evening shift. Specifically, Complainant asserts that during the evening shift, she regularly compiled information regarding all patients who were brought in, discharged, and/or passed away in the preceding 24-hour period. In addition, Complainant explains that the GL Report is then sent to the AOD on the night shift who reviews it and signs off on it. Complainant asserts that while she did not get credit for signing off on the GL Report, she essentially still performed the work of the GL Report.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to S1's assertion that she needed to "go above and beyond," Complainant states that the way she performs her job has not changed at all from the years prior. Complainant asserts that she is constantly going the extra mile to perform tasks that go above and beyond the expectations of an AOD. Complainant also asserts that at every town hall meeting, she is the AOD who always receives patient comment card acknowledgments saying that she did a great job and went above and beyond. In addition, one of Complainant's co-workers (C3) testified that she was surprised that Complainant did not get an Outstanding on her 2013-2014 performance rating. C3 also recalled that Complainant was on a special project in October 2013 (i.e., the first month of the relevant rating period) through at least November of 2013, if not all of 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to another co-worker (C4):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I know that [S1] would single [Complainant] out for every little thing, i.e. not dotting an "i," or not putting parentheses on the area code of a patient's phone number. [S1] would not say anything to me or any of my other coworkers about something so petty, but with [Complainant], [S1] would make a big deal out of every little thing. It was as though [Complainant] could never do enough, although she worked her hardest. Most people cannot work evenings by themselves, because of the simultaneous multitasking that is required, and [Complainant] did it. [Complainant] still managed to have everything ready to roll, for the midnight shift to complete the nightly gains and losses and 24 hour reports. I know this because I came in at night behind [Complainant] and she would have the 24-hour report and G&#x0026;L info as updated as possible. Part of [Complainant s] appraisal was based on the G&#x0026;L and 24-hour report which I understand was part of her down grade. Granted she did not work the midnight shift but she did and does know how to do the nightly reports, but [S1] would still pick [Complainant] apart and [Complainant] could never do enough.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the similarly-situated AODs' performance ratings (in the record) shows that S1 did not consistently apply the above and beyond <span id="Page_1520"></span>performance guidelines when completing the ratings during the relevant period. Among the performance ratings in the record, there were several Outstanding and Exceptional performance ratings without any reference to the performance of extracurricular (i.e. above and beyond) workplace activity by the employee during the relevant rating period. Accordingly, we do not find credible, S1's assertion that she followed the "above and beyond" criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find the evidence presented regarding two employee complaints insufficient to justify a reduction of Complainant's performance rating by two levels to Fully Successful. The May 2014 complaint was not so much of a complaint as it was an employee sharing with S1 a conversation that was overheard regarding a difference of opinion among the staff pertaining to the best way to maintain a high quality of patient care and perhaps her feelings were hurt by the suggestion that she was not qualified to assist. With respect to the September 2014 complaint, the record shows that Complainant denies that it occurred and the record is devoid of any action taken by S1 to investigate or question the individuals regarding the circumstances surrounding the alleged incident. There is no indication that Complainant was even informed of the complaint at the time it was made. Moreover, C1 did not provide a statement or testimony to explain the circumstances of her September 2014 complaint. Under these circumstances, especially given the fact that Complainant's performance was considered outstanding by her co-workers, we do not find such a Co-worker complaint is sufficient to form the basis for the reduction of Complainant's performance rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, S1 testified that there were numerous mistakes made by Complainant during the 2013-2014 rating period which she took into consideration when rating Complainant's performance. However, the documentary evidence does not support S1's testimony. As of the date S1 made the decision to rate Complainant at the Fully Successful level, there was a total of two minor inconsistencies discovered in the GL Report that Complainant was asked to rectify. We do not find two minor mistakes sufficient to form a credible basis for reducing an outstanding employee's rating two full levels.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find the evidence establishes that S1's non-retaliatory reasons articulated for rating Complainant Fully Successful were a pretext for retaliatory animus based upon the following but not limited to, facts: (1) the inexplicable change in S1's behavior toward Complainant around the time of her prior EEO activity; (2) S1's lack of credibility with respect to the bases for the dramatic reduction of Complainant's performance rating; (3) the evidence establishing that Complainant is an outstanding employee who consistently performs well beyond what is expected; (4) the fact that S1's change in behavior occurred shortly after Complainant engaged in EEO protected activity; and (5) the fact that S1's performance rating decision occurred less than a month after Complainant complained about the EEO related hostile work environment by requesting mediation with S1.</p>
