<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-150"><span class="space">s.</span> $200,001 and Above</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $210,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720120027 (2014), where the racial harassment led to severe emotional distress over an extended period of harm. In sustaining the award in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, the Commission also explained the correlation between the egregiousness of the agency's discriminatory actions and the likelihood of harm:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is substantial evidence in the testimony of Complainant's husband, psychologist, coach, and Complainant herself, about the mental and physical harm that Complainant has endured. While there is no evidence that Complainant's miscarriage was the result of the discrimination, testimony reflects that Complainant became deeply troubled, anxious, depressed, lonely, vulnerable, suspicious, mentally unfocused, highly emotional and volatile, with reduced self esteem, weight loss, hair loss, difficulty in sleeping and bouts of tearfulness, crying, dizziness, suicidal thoughts, and chest pains. Testimony reflects that Complainant experienced this harm at least until September 2010 and beyond. Further, testimony reflects that Complainant became dispassionate in competing as a runner due to the mental anguish she suffered at her workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the Agency's contentions, we determine that the AJ's award is consistent with amounts awarded in similar cases....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that management's behavior and actions in this case were particularly egregious. Specially, Complainant notified management that she was being subjected to severe racial harassment and assault from coworkers, but no action was taken. It was also well known by management and other employees that S1 was assaulting and harassing Complainant and other African-American employees, yet no action was taken for some time. Further, management improperly made employees aware of Complainant's discrimination and harassment allegations against S1, even after the Agency's Labor Relations told management to keep the matter confidential. Management most defiantly subjected Complainant to continued ridicule and embarrassment by reporting Complainant's allegations to many employees. Management failed to discourage S1's continued harassment and reprisal towards Complainant, including the petition against Complainant's EEO complaint initiated by S1 and other employees. As a result, Complainant suffered continued harassment and discrimination from not only S1, but also from coworkers. Also, the Agency only issued S1 a 7-day suspension for horseplay even though it was aware of S1's assault and harassment towards Complainant and other African-American employees. We note that the more egregious the agency's actions are, the more likely it is that a complainant will suffer significant emotional harm. <span class="Italic">See Marta Fonda-Wall v. Dept of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060035 (July 28, 2009) (awarding $200,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages for a complainant where the Agency's retaliatory conduct was severely egregious, and Complainant's harm was significant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the AJ, who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, considered the severity of the harm caused by the Agency's actions and determined that $210,000 was a reasonable amount to compensate Complainant. Considering the severity of the harm caused by the Agency's actions together with comparable Commission cases, we find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's award of $210,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Munno v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A01734 (2001), the Commission upheld a final agency decision that awarded the complainant $250,000 in compensatory damages. Because the appeal involved other issues and did not challenge the award, the decision provides no specific information on the basis of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1935"></span>An award by the administrative judge of $250,000 in compensatory damages was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Augustine S. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720110018 (2015), where agency's failure to accommodate eventually led to his retirement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the evidence and Commission precedent, the AJ in this case awarded Complainant $250,000 in non-pecuniary damages for both the emotional and physical harm he suffered as a result of the Agency's actions. In calculating this award, the AJ found that Complainant suffered both psychologically and physically due to the Agency's inaction, which lasted almost an entire decade. The AJ found that, as a result of the Agency's failure to accommodate, Complainant was diagnosed with depression, which was then aggravated by the Agency's continued inaction. Complainant ultimately began taking prescription medication to ameliorate the effects of his depression. The discriminatory treatment continued when the Agency repeatedly requested medical documentation from Complainant, and then ignored it. The AJ found Complainant also suffered from sleep disturbances, was withdrawn and became fearful of others. The AJ found that Complainant offered "compelling and credible" testimony, which was not rebutted by the Agency. AJ Decision at p. 34.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the physical harm, the AJ found that Complainant suffered from excruciating joint pain and swelling caused by the Agency's failure to excuse him from Oath Ceremonies, which required hours of standing and walking. Complainant testified that, over time, his pain increased because his accommodation needs were not met, and his "flare ups" became more consistent. Further, over time, the pain caused by the lack of accommodations aggravated Complainant's spine, cervical disc, and heart. As a result of both the physical and emotional harm, Complainant became unable to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record and prior Commission decisions, we find that the AJ's award is well-supported, given the emotional and physical distress suffered as a result of a decade-long failure by the Agency to engage in any meaningful interactive process with Complainant, or provide reasonable accommodation for his disability. There is no evidence that the amount is "monstrous" or the result of passion or prejudice. The Commission has awarded comparable amounts in other cases where the discrimination caused depression and other adverse emotional and physical conditions. <span class="Italic">Blount</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 ($200,000 for depression caused by failure to accommodate); <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720100040 (Nov. 23, 2011) ($200,000 for emotional and physical damage caused by Agency's egregious discrimination and failure to accommodate).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of the cap--$300,000--in <span class="italic">Miquel G. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 2019002129 (2021), where the complainant, who was in excellent health prior to the discriminatory nonselection, suffered, among other things, significant cardiovascular episodes, bouts of crying and anxiety and had to retire from the agency. The Administrative Judge, in that case, found that the complainant was subjected to age discrimination and harassment when the agency selected a demonstrably less qualified person over the complainant for the at-issue position. In addition, it was found that a female official manipulated the selection process to ensure that the complainant did not get the job and subsequently she and the selectee "launched a campaign" to get the complainant and three other coworkers his age fired. The amount of the award in <span class="italic">Miquel G</span>. makes the facts and the analysis especially significant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When asked why he believed that his age, sex, and participation in CW1's EEO complaint were factors in his nonselection and RMO1's subsequent efforts to get him fired, Complainant gave a number of reasons. First, he testified that RMO1 allowed PA and AA to bully him, CW1 and CW2 by withholding administrative support. Second, he testified that RMO1 attempted to justify the Selectee's selection on the basis of the Selectee's experience in unmanned aerial systems which was not a core requirement or otherwise mentioned in the vacancy announcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, he testified that the Selectee had revealed to him that RMO1 had expressed a desire to get rid of him, CW1, and CW2. Fourth, he testified that he, CW1 and CW2 had met with RMO2 and had sent him two letters documenting RMO1's conduct toward them. Fifth, he testified that RMO2 had put RMO1 on the selection panel knowing that RMO1 had harbored hostility toward him, CW1 and CW2, and that when he told the EEO Director that RMO2 had appointed RMO1 to the panel, the EEO Director advised him to go ahead and file a complaint and ask for a nonsupervisory GS-15 because RMO1 should not have been appointed to the panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her sworn statement dated November 3, 2014, and in her hearing testimony, RMO1 denied suggesting to Complainant that he retire because of his age. She denied having subjected Complainant, CW1, and CW2 to a hostile work environment because of their age, sex, and prior EEO complaint from CW1. She denied that CW1 had filed complaints against her but contradicted herself by admitting that CW1's EEO Complaint was against the Agency and that she was a witness. RMO1 testified that she did not see the climate survey and that she could not recall the purpose of the survey. Likewise, when asked about the all-hands meeting that she and the acting ASD Manager had convened on October 30, 2013, ostensibly in response to the results of that same climate survey, RMO1 again replied that she could not recall. LHT 232. But RMO1 was able to recall the all-hands meeting with RMO2 that was held on October 31, 2013. In addition, RMO1 denied knowing anything about CW1's reactivation of his EEO complaint against her on November 19, 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the nonselection, when RMO1 was asked if she had weighted the interview questions heavily toward FAA experience, she replied that she did not recall. LHT 254. However, the email correspondence between her and the HR Specialist clearly establish that she had effectively added experience with the FAA as a primary selection criterion despite it not having been a requirement previously. RMO1 did this knowing full well that neither Complainant, CW1, or CW2 possessed that experience. RMO1 herself admitted that Complainant had more experience in the two subject matter areas required by the position than any other candidate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">RMO1's statements that she could not recall the events that led to the filing of this complaint are riddled with inconsistencies. They also contradict the sworn statements given by the HR Specialist and the Selectee. We find that Complainant's affidavit and hearing testimony, together with the testimony of the HR Specialist, and the Selectee is more than sufficient to establish the existence of a discriminatory motivation on the part of RMO1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidentiary record likewise establishes that RMO1 engaged in conduct so severe and pervasive that anyone in Complainant's position would have found that conduct to be abusive. Primarily, RMO1 sabotaged Complainant's bid for promotion to ASD Manager by inserting the unnecessary selection criteria of experience with the FAA into the position description knowing full well that Complainant lacked that particular experience.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather than question RMO1's moves, RMO2 acquiesced to both RMO1's self-insertion onto the selection panel and her addition of the FAA-experience selection criterion to the vacancy announcement. That FAA experience was never a legitimate requirement for the position is further supported by the fact that after the Selectee departed and the ASD Manager position once again left vacant, CW1 was selected for the position despite not having FAA experience and RMO1 was not on the selection panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Beyond thwarting Complainant's promotion, RMO1, either directly or through her female subordinates repeatedly berated Complainant for minor matters, tried to get Complainant into trouble, and tried to force the Selectee to discipline him. The severity and pervasiveness of RMO1's conduct is made apparent by Complainant's retirement which, as noted above, the Selectee tried to talk him out of without success.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer is subject to vicarious liability for harassment when it is created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. <span class="italic">Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 765 (1998); <span class="italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 807 (1998). When the conduct complained of results in a tangible employment action, such as a failure to promote, the Agency is strictly liable for harassment and no affirmative defense is available. <span class="italic">Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 &#x00A7; IV (June 18, 1999). That is exactly what happened in this case. Starting in Spring 2013, RMO1 fostered an atmosphere of hostility between the sexes, with Complainant, CW1and CW2 on one side being pitted against RMO1, the PA, and the AA on the other. This "battle of the sexes" was the motivation for RMO1 including herself on the review panel for the ASD Manager selection so that she could manipulate the selection criteria in order to ensure that none of the three men in the ASD would be selected as that division's manager. In view of RMO2 allowing RMO1 to serve on the panel knowing about the animosity between RMO1 and Complainant, and essentially letting the discriminatory nonselection happen, we agree with the AJ that the Agency is liable for the Spring 2014 nonpromotion as a tangible employment action on the bases of sex and reprisal against Complainant for having been a witness in CW1's previous EEO complaint against RMO1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The harassment did not end there, however. RMO1, either directly or her female subordinates, continued to subject Complainant to a hostile work environment until he retired in January 2015. Where harassment by a supervisor creates an unlawful hostile environment, the Agency can raise an affirmative defense where the conduct complained of is not a tangible employment action by showing that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassment and that Complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the Agency or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="italic">See Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Mar. 8, 1994); <span class="italic">Marielle L. v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120162299 (Mar. 29, 2018); <span class="italic">Joel P. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC <span id="Page_1936"></span>Appeal No. 0120162383 (Mar. 5, 2018). The same is true for harassment by a coworker or other non-supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether the Agency's corrective action is appropriate depends upon "the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps." <span class="italic">Taylor v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992); <span class="italic">Owens v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0590824 (Sept. 5, 1996). Appropriate agency corrective action is that which is reasonably calculated to stop the harassment. <span class="italic">Parker v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100303 (Jul. 20, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidentiary record substantially supports the AJ's findings and conclusions that Complainant was indeed subjected to a hostile work environment. The problems began in March 2013 and worsened for Complainant, CW1 and CW2 after CW1 had initially filed his complaint against RMO1. RMO1 would encourage and back the PA and the AA when they would do things like deny or delay Complainant's CW1's and CW2's reimbursements for travel expenses. RMO1 used an all-hands meeting to publicly berate Complainant and the others for causing the climate survey to be initiated. RMO1's hostility toward Complainant only increased after the Selectee became Complainant's supervisor in May 2014, and much of the evidence corroborating Complainant's allegations came from the Selectee. We find particularly compelling the hearing testimony from the Selectee that RMO1 had openly expressed the desire to run "the three amigos," meaning Complainant, CW1, and CW2 out of TSI, that RMO1 had repeatedly tried to force the Selectee to discipline Complainant for minor infractions like using his personal travel card for government business when he forgot his wallet, that RMO1 kept looking through Complainant's time, attendance and travel records in order to find a justification for disciplining Complainant, and that RMO1 repeatedly took sides with PA and AA in their disputes with Complainant without even bothering to get Complainant's side of the story. We also note RMO1's attempts to disadvantage Complainant in the use of maxi-flex, compensatory time, and credit hours. According to Complainant, RMO1's conduct toward him over the previous two years was the reason he retired in January 2015 despite the Selectee's pleas for him to stay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with the AJ that the record fails to support the Agency's attempt to invoke an affirmative defense with respect to RMO1's acts against Complainant before and after the nonselection that did not rise to the level of a tangible employment action. RMO2 had been made aware of the situation as far back as the Summer and Fall of 2013, when Complainant, CW1, and CW2 met with him, the Civil Rights Director and the ASRT. Discrimination aside, despite the fact that the climate survey identified RMO1 as the source of the dysfunctionality within the TSI, RMO2 allowed her to remain in a position where she could still create problems for the three male members of the ASD and undermine the Selectee's leadership of that division. Ultimately, the AJ was correct in finding that Complainant took advantage of every avenue available to try and resolve the problems, and that the Agency essentially did nothing after being made aware of situation in TSI. While the Agency disputes the AJ's findings and conclusions on the merits, it has not presented testimonial or documentary evidence sufficient to contradict those findings and conclusions or which cause us to question the AJ's credibility determinations regarding Complainant and the other witnesses who testified on his behalf. Ultimately, we find that the AJ's determination of the Agency's liability for a discriminatory hostile work environment against Complainant is supported by substantial evidence of record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that he had been experiencing a hostile work environment starting in March 2013, continuing through his nonselection and ending when he retired in January 2015. He further testified that prior to 2013, he had been an avid runner, having participated ten marathons and fifteen half-marathons over the years. He also testified that he engaged in yardwork and other activities around the house requiring physical exertion. When asked on cross-examination whether he had experienced any symptoms prior to October 2013. Complainant replied that he was asymptomatic, pointing out that he did not have high blood pressure prior to that time, and "did not even take aspirin."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that he began training for a half-marathon in May 2013 but began to experience shortness of breath and a rapid heartbeat, that he could not complete eight miles, and that he would have to stop and rest before finishing the course. Complainant visited his personal physician in October 2013, who referred him to a Cardiologist. IR 69-70. The cardiologist saw Complainant for an initial consultation on November 26, 2013. On December 5, 17, and 18, 2013, Complainant underwent electrocardiogram stress tests which required him to run on a treadmill. He described running on the treadmill as "almost killing him." Complainant underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure and put on blood thinners on January 17, 2014. The Cardiologist noted in a follow-up report dated June 9, 2014, that Complainant was still experiencing work-related stress. Complainant testified that he had a heart attack while on his way to work on November 26, 2014. He was sent immediately to the emergency room and was ultimately diagnosed with coronary artery disease. He has been under the Cardiologist's care since.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that he experienced another cardiac event on January 10, 2017, two years after his retirement. He testified that he felt tightness in his chest and shortness of breath while moving furniture. He went to the hospital and had another catheterization procedure done the following day and that even after having the stents put in, he did not feel better. He testified that the stress he had been experiencing since the discriminatory incidents "never went away," and caused him "many sleepless nights." He testified that since he retired, he was afraid to run or otherwise engage in any physical activity for fear that he might have another heart attack. Beyond his physical symptoms, Complainant testified that he was "a wreck" emotionally, that he lost interest in his family life to the point at snapping at his grandchildren, that he could no longer enjoy intimacy with his wife, and that he was "grumpy and lethargic" most of the time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also testified about the damage done to his reputation and his sense of self-worth. Prior to the harassment, he had been considered a "national resource" by the FAA due to his expertise in aircraft accident investigations and aviation safety. But afterwards, particularly after being passed over for promotion, he could no longer find work beyond intermittent consulting gigs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Cardiologist testified extensively that he had been treating Complainant for heart disease since November 2013, that Complainant had experienced a serious coronary episode in November 2014, and that the stress Complainant had been experiencing at work was a significant factor in his condition. On cross-examination, the Cardiologist acknowledged Complainant's family history of heart disease, but maintained that Complainant was asymptomatic prior to experiencing work-related stress starting in 2013. A note written by the Physician's Assistant dated November 26, 2014 confirms that he had called the Cardiologist who "strongly suggested that Complainant go to the ER immediately." The Cardiologist noted that he had seen Complainant on June 13, 2016, December 22, 2016, and January 10, 2017, and that the latter appointment concerned chest pains that Complainant had been experiencing after he tried to move some furniture.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an assessment dated August 1, 2017, the Cardiologist noted, "cardiovascular disease, chronic combined systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and aortic root dilation." The Cardiologist noted that as of Complainant's last visit, he continued to experience lack of energy and stamina. In a letter dated February 6, 2018, the Cardiologist opined that the high level of stress associated with work played a major role in causing his chest pains which led to multiple medical visits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's spouse testified that Complainant would come home from work a "nervous wreck" and would often break down crying about what was going on at work. She also testified that Complainant became "really depressed," that he suffered from insomnia and acid reflux, that he would often become grouchy and irritable, that he was unable to run marathons anymore, that he lost interest in his hobbies and outside interests, especially woodworking, and that they no longer had intimacy together as husband and wife. DHT 39-41. She also testified that Complainant frequently experienced shortness of breath and tightness in the chest and had continued to experience those symptoms, which she maintained were due entirely to Complainant's work-related stress. In addition, she testified that Complainant had suffered from anxiety and depression in connection with the loss of his professional reputation. When asked if she believed that Complainant was physically, mentally, and emotionally the same person he was before early 2013, she replied, "no way."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CW1 testified as to how what he characterized as RMO1's "assaults" on the three investigators had taken a physical and emotional toll upon Complainant. He described how Complainant would have to leave work in the middle of the day to see a doctor about his heart condition. He testified that Complainant often became physically sick and had to quit running marathons. He also testified to Complainant's ongoing anxiety about the loss of his professional reputation. CW2 testified that the work environment that he, CW1 and Complainant had experienced since early 2013 was a climate of fear and harassment, "the likes of which [he] had never seen before," and that the three of them were being targeted by RMO1. He testified that Complainant's physical appearance had deteriorated as a result of all the work-related stress that the three of them had been experiencing. Finally, the Physician's Assistant from the Agency's health clinic who had seen Complainant on November 26, 2014 testified that upon examining Complainant that day, he ordered him to go directly to the emergency room, and that he called Complainant's cardiologist who authorized the trip to the ER.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taken together, the hearing testimony of Complainant, the testimony and medical documentation from the Cardiologist, and the testimony <span id="Page_1937"></span>of Complainant's spouse, CW1, CW2, and the Physician's Assistant conclusively establishes that Complainant had suffered severe and extensive physical, psychological, and emotional harm which began in the Fall of 2013, continued for several years after his retirement, and will more likely than not continue into the future. The AJ's findings on the issue of harm suffered by Complainant are thoroughly documented and entirely consistent with the evidentiary record. <span class="italic">See</span> AJ Decision, pp. 58-60.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Causation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found credible the Cardiologist's testimony that the stress suffered by Complainant in the workplace had caused his cardiovascular symptoms. AJ Decision, p. 60. Nevertheless, the Agency challenges the AJ's causation findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency argues that Complainant's heart problems arose in the Fall of 2013, well before he learned that he was not selected for the position on April 28, 2014. Appeal Brief, p. 29. That is true. However, the nonselection was part of the harassment by RMO1 against Complainant, CW1, and CW2 which began during the Spring of 2013, well before Complainant's symptoms became apparent. There is no question that Complainant was asymptomatic before Spring 2013, when RMO1's bullying of himself, CW1 and CW2 at the hands of RMO1 had started. According to the Cardiologist, Complainant experienced multiple episodes of heart racing when he was in the midst of EEO dealings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency contends that Complainant had a pre-existing heart condition, as evidenced by his family history of coronary artery disease. Appeal Brief, pp. 28-30. Complainant had testified on cross-examination that his father had died of a heart aneurysm at age 41 and that his mother had died of congestive heart failure at age 83. He further testified that his mother's entire cardiovascular system had been failing and that she had lung issues, but that she had no prior heart conditions that he could recall. In addition, Complainant stated that his parents' conditions were different than what he had and reiterated that he did not have any symptoms prior to 2013. DHT 104-07. The Agency characterizes this testimony as evidence of a pre-existing heart condition, but in doing so, it confuses that concept with genetic predisposition. There may be some evidence that Complainant and his parents share a genetic predisposition toward heart disease. However, not only was Complainant asymptomatic before the bullying started, but his condition was qualitatively distinct from those of his parents. There are no indications in the medical record that Complainant was ever at risk for an aneurysm. His mother lived well into her eighties, and the Agency did not present any evidence suggesting that her congestive heart failure resulted from conditions other than those associated with aging. While Complainant may have had a genetic predisposition toward either condition, there is no evidence tending to establish that he had a preexisting heart condition. The Agency therefore failed to refute the Cardiologist's testimony and the AJ's findings on the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the record contains extensive documentation regarding the nature, severity and permanent duration of the harm suffered by Complainant, the strength of the causal connection between that harm and RMO1's conduct, and the documentation of that harm by the testimony of himself, his wife, the Cardiologist, CW1, CW2 and the Physician's Assistant as well as the various medical notes included among the hearing exhibits. The AJ awarded Complainant $290,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages on the basis of these determinations. AJ Decision, p. 66. The Agency argues, however, that the $290,000 award was excessive and should be reduced to around $100,000 if the finding of discrimination is upheld. Appeal Brief. p. 31. We will now assess whether the size of the award is consistent with awards made in cases that present similar factual circumstances with respect to harm and causation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="italic">Taunya P. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720180022 (Sept. 27, 2019), the Commission upheld and AJ's non-pecuniary damages award of $250,000. The AJ assigned to that case found that the agency had subjected the employee to a hostile work environment, failed to reasonably accommodate her disability, and failed to honor her work restrictions. Complainant showed that as a result of the agency's discriminatory acts, she suffered nerve damage and exacerbated pain in her back and legs so severe that she did not respond to pain-killing medications. The employee's doctor testified the agency's failure to accommodate her disability resulted in an accident that ultimately rendered her incapable of carrying a pregnancy to term. Since that injury, the employee had continued to suffer pain, spasms, numbness, tingling, burning sensations and urinary difficulties. <span class="italic">See also, Geraldine B. v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720180025 (June 5, 2019) (upheld AJ award of $250,000 where discrimination caused, the employee to suffer a severe setback in her mental and emotional health and major depression, reputational damage, exacerbation of PTSD);</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="italic">Augustine S. v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110018 (October 22, 2015) (the Commission based an award of $250,000 on the AJ's finding that the employee had suffered psychological as well as physical harm due to the agency's ten-year-long failure to reasonably accommodate his disability, which caused depression, continuous physical pain</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We may consider the present-day value of older comparable awards, taking into consideration the age of the comparable awards and adjusting the current award accordingly. <span class="italic">Lara G. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520130618 (June 9, 2017). The Agency agreed with and endorsed this approach, noting that an award in the amount of $75,000 in 2001 would be worth $106,000 in 2018, when the AJ's decision was issued. Appeal Brief, p. 35. Using the CPI Inflation Calculator, we find that the $250,000 award from February 2001 would be equivalent to $356,294 today.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing this extensive evidentiary record in light of Commission precedent, we are persuaded that Complainant is entitled to the maximum statutory award of $300,000, which includes compensation for his future pecuniary losses as well as for his non-pecuniary losses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld another $300,000 award in <span class="italic">Doyle T. v. Secretary of the Air Force</span>, 2022004281 (2022), where the complainant continued to suffer harm and had for more than eight years after the agency's discriminatory conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted affidavits from himself, his wife, his step-daughter, a life-long friend, and his primary care provider. Complainant asserted that prior to the Agency's discriminatory actions, he was an outgoing, happy, and self-motivated man who was physically active and enjoyed close, loving relationships with his wife, his four biological daughters, and his step-daughter. <span class="italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief on Damages, Ex. 1. After the Agency withdrew its offer and thereby caused him to lose not only what he had described as the "perfect" job opportunity for him but also depriving him of his ability to support his family financially, he became depressed and anxious, suffering feelings of anger, humiliation, and low self-esteem. <span class="italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief on Damages, Ex. 1. As a result, he became withdrawn, irritable, and short-tempered, suffered from insomnia and persistent nightmares, and began drinking to excess. <span class="italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief on Damages, Exs. 1 and 2. He also stated that he suffered intense headaches and has been diagnosed with high blood pressure, both of which have sent him to the emergency room more than once, which his doctors told him were all caused by stress. <span class="italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief on Damages, Ex. 1. His wife stated that their relationship is now "broken." <span class="italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief on Damages, Ex. 2. He has also become estranged from his biological daughters due to his inability to pay his child support payments and his withdrawal from his family so that he was not invited to two of his daughters' weddings and has not been allowed to meet his new granddaughter. <span class="italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief on Damages, Exs. 1, 2, and 3. Complainant stated that losing his relationship with his daughters has "broken [his] heart." <span class="italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief on Damages, Ex. 1. Complainant and his wife both attested to the financial difficulties they have suffered, stating that the loss of Complainant's livelihood has required him to file for bankruptcy five times between 2015 and 2021, which has destroyed his credit rating and resulted in the withdrawal of several offers of employment from different federal agencies on the grounds of his poor credit and financial delinquencies, which has exacerbated his inability to find a job. <span class="italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief on Damages, Exs. 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the award of $300,000 is more appropriate considering the severity of the emotional harms he has suffered, the lasting damage to his relationship with his family, the loss of his credit standing and professional reputation, and loss of enjoyment of life, compounded by the duration of time that has passed since the Agency's discriminatory actions more than eight years ago and which remain unresolved to this day due to the protracted nature of the litigation. We find that this award is not monstrously excessive, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="italic">See Miquel G. v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2019002129 (Sept. 23, 2021) (awarding complainant $300,000 where the Agency's discriminatory conduct caused the complainant to suffer a severe deterioration in his physical health as well as severe psychological and emotional distress and the loss of his professional reputation since 2013 and continuing); <span class="italic">Taunya P. v.

Using the CPI Inflation Calculator, we find that an award of $250,000 award in June 2019 would <span id="Page_1938"></span>be equivalent to approximately $290,000 today. After review of the record and in light of Commission precedent, we are persuaded that Complainant is entitled to the maximum statutory award of $300,000 in compensatory, nonpecuniary damages.</p>
