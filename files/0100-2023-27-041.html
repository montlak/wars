<h4 class="h4" id="sec18-41"><span class="space">9.</span> Selection Panels and Recommending Officials</h4>
<p class="noindent">Because of the selection processes used by many agencies, questions can arise legitimately as to who was actually the selecting official in a particular promotion or hiring case. Often, agencies use screening panels to interview and rank the best qualified candidates. The screening panel then makes a <span id="Page_1576"></span>recommendation that is approved or disapproved by a selecting official or officials.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a screening panel is used and the selecting official testifies that he followed the recommendation of the panel and always does so, the appropriate focus is on the deliberations of the screening panel. <span class="Italic">See Crawford v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01870101 (1988). If a selecting official defers to the recommendation of a foreman, "it is more relevant to consider whether the retired foreman held discriminatory animus toward appellant and whether this fatally tainted the manager's action." <span class="Italic">See Joseph v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920750 (1993). Reliance on a recommendation which is discriminatory "impermissibly taints the selection with [discriminatory] animus without regard for [the selecting official's] own motivation." <span class="Italic">See Nicholson v. U.S. Air Force</span>, 01880085 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">The composition of the panel can call into question the legitimacy of the decision and serve as evidence of pretext for discrimination. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Sandy E. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 2020001148 (2020), the Commission found age discrimination in a nonselection case, in part, because it found that the agency improperly placed an unqualified individual to serve on the selection panel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant successfully established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for age discrimination under the ADEA. He and C1 were "similarly situated" as they were both state level directors within the same region, reported to the same first and second level supervisors, and applied for the same DRA position. As he was nearly 20 years younger than Complainant, C1 is considered "substantially younger," which created an inference of age discrimination when he was selected over Complainant for the DRA position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the Agency, as the employer, has broad discretion to determine how best to manage its operations and may make decisions, including personnel decisions, on any basis except a basis that is unlawful under the discrimination statutes. <span class="Italic">See Burdine; Furnco</span>. Where, as here, the alleged discriminatory action is non-selection, pretext may be found where the complainant's qualifications are demonstrably superior to those of the selectee. <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Bailar</span>, 647 F.2d 1037, 1048 (10th Cir. 1981). Otherwise, the Agency may choose among qualified candidates based on its discretion, provided that the decision is not based upon unlawful criteria. <span class="Italic">See Burdine</span> at 259; <span class="Italic">Vanek v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940906 (Jan. 16, 1997); <span class="Italic">see also Canham v. Oberlin College</span>, 666 F.2d 1057, 1061 (6th Cir. 1981) (finding that an employer has the discretion to choose among equally qualified candidates).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's proffered legitimate non-discriminatory reason for selecting C1 over Complainant for the GS-14 DRA position was that C1 received the highest combined score from the panel interview, and it is standard practice for VETS selecting officials is to fill vacancies with the highest scoring candidate. However, the AJ found that SO improperly placed P3 on the panel to help ensure someone other than Complainant was selected, with P3's very low score resulting in Complainant receiving the lowest combined score out of the candidates. Along with the circumstances of P3's participation on the panel, the AJ cites Complainant's "demonstrably superior qualifications" than those of the selectee, C1, as evidence that the Agency's legitimate non-discriminatory reason was pretext for discrimination. The AJ also pointed to testimony suggesting SO's bias against older employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case turns, therefore, on whether the AJ correctly concluded Complainant was able to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the proffered reason for his non-selection (interview panel score) was designed to mask the role age bias played in the decision-making.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency argues that the AJ improperly substituted her judgement for that of Agency management on a matters of Agency operations with respect to P3's presence on the interview panel, and when, despite his lower scores, she found Complainant to be more qualified than C1 for the position of ADR.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that its inclusion of P3 on the interview panel was consistent with its guidelines. The Agency's Recruitment &#x0026; Selection Best Practices Guide (June 2014) required that "[t]hose conducting the interview[s] or serving on a panel should be at the grade level being filled or higher, with knowledge of the position being filled." P3 met the grade requirement, and, according to the Agency, he also met the knowledge requirement, explaining that P3 was familiar with VETS and, as a DRA in a related Agency office, he understood what managerial attributes were necessary for a successful DRA, regardless of program. The Agency also disputes the AJ's characterization of P3 as having a "wholesale lack of [VETS] program knowledge," and the AJ's conclusion that P3's significantly lower score for Complainant was the reason for Complainant's non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, multiple witnesses, deemed credible by the AJ, established in their testimony that it was not typical or appropriate for an individual, such as P3, who did not work at VETS and lacked military experience, to participate in filling a senior-level VETS position. The Agency offers no satisfactory explanation for P3's presence on the panel other than SO wanted him there. Complainant aptly points out that it was not for lack of nearby VETS GS-14s to conduct the interview in person, as P3 conducted interviews by phone. P1 testified that he did not believe it was appropriate to include P3, and he only did so at SO's insistence. Moreover, the Agency's assertion that P1 was responsible for including P3 on the panel (as opposed to SO) is based on SO's testimony, which the AJ found was not credible. The AJ determined that the evidence strongly suggested that P3 was placed on the panel by SO in order to ensure Complainant was not selected. While this deviation from standard practice is not dispositive of discrimination, it does provide some evidence in support of a finding of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Complainant's score, P1 and P2 both testified that they asked P3 about the significantly lower score he gave Complainant after the interview, and learned it was P3's frustration with Complainant when he asked questions about Complainant's achievements in the past 5 years. Instead, he said Complainant would respond with details about his former 23-year military career.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to his answer to P3's questions, Complainant explained that his supervisory experience as a Director at VETS involved overseeing a staff of three with no budget, so he mentioned his military supervisory experience in his interview. Specifically, he said he attempted to explain to the panel that as a Battalion Commander, he was essentially the equivalent of a VETS Regional Administrator, as he "had a staff of over 150 and a budget of over $3 million." Complainant notes that the DRA position he sought oversaw 25 to 30 people. While P3's own testimony supports that P3 actively disregarded this information when scoring Complainant's interview, it shows that he did credit C1's far shorter military experience. From his testimony, it appears P3 was not aware of the implications when Complainant recounted that he had been a Battalion Commander, whereas a VETS employee would likely have understood that such a title entailed extensive supervisory experience.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency vigorously disputes the AJ's finding that Complainant's qualifications were demonstrably superior to those of C1, aptly citing the Commission's long held position that a person's length of experience does not necessarily mean they are better qualified. <span class="Italic">Macready v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01991433 (Apr. 4, 2002). The Agency states, and the panelists confirm, that upon being certified as qualified for the position by HR, Complainant, C1, and C2 were considered "equally qualified." The panel interview was designed to determine the candidate's "communication, leadership, and management skills, the critical qualities VETS was seeking in a DRA."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the AJ improperly focused on Complainant's extensive technical knowledge relating to various VETS programs compared with C1, as opposed to the skills the Agency was seeking related to communication, leadership, and management. The Agency points out that none of the interview questions concerned VETS programs specifically. However, setting aside Complainant's subject matter expertise, it should have been clear to the panel that Complainant's supervisory experience as a Battalion Commander and at VETS far exceeded that of C1. Complainant, who served in the military for 23 years, credibly testified that his "whole life in the military was supervisory...as an officer, as a platoon leader, company command and battalion commander...[all Complainant did was] supervise and manage soldiers." As the VETS State Director for Massachusetts, Complainant managed three employees, while taking on additional regional responsibilities, whereas C1 managed 1 employee as VETS State Director for Rhode Island. Although C1's military experience included leadership roles, having served for about three years, C1 would not have advanced to a position with management responsibilities as extensive as that of a Battalion Commander.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that the SO's testimony that "subject matter expertise" was unnecessary as the DRA was purely a leadership position was not credible. She pointed to evidence that C1, after his selection, was still relying on mentors and other State Directors to perform his job duties. Based on testimony at the hearing, the AJ pointed out that the DRA "must be knowledgeable about what the VETS program does, including investigations, which the selectee was not even equipped to do as he would not have training in this until approximately a year in his position."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to selecting a candidate "substantially younger" than Complainant, the AJ pointed to credible testimony suggesting that, in other contexts, SO favored younger employees. The VETS Director for the New Jersey office ("W1"), who was in her early 60s, testified that she was one of the oldest VETS employees and directors. W1 testified that over the past 15 years or so, "there seemed to be more of a tendency to bring in younger people" based on the people she saw hired in SO's region. Complainant recounted participating in a regional director's call led by SO where he admonished the directors (6 of 8 were age 55 and older) to "think outside the box." Complainant testified that, in context, SO meant that Complainant and the other directors were "set in [their] ways" and that "younger people will look outside the box where older people will not."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1577"></span>The AJ also considered credible testimony from Complainant and his wife regarding off-putting comments SO made to them during a work- related dinner, stating that it must be exhausting to raise a four-year-old daughter "at your age" and mentally calculating, then exclaiming, that Complainant would be 70 when his daughter graduated high school. SO also asked Complainant when he was retiring, and Complainant responded that he intended to work for at least ten years or more. The Agency argues that SO's age-related comments to Complainant do not indicate pretext, as they were "stray remarks" made in a social setting a year before the hiring decision. The Agency discusses our decision in <span class="Italic">Ottaviano v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01900462; 01900463, (Mar. 20, 1990), finding the complainant's proffered evidence of age discrimination in a non-selection case constituted "stray remarks" unrelated to the alleged discriminatory action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the facts in <span class="Italic">Ottaviano</span> are distinguishable from the instant complaint. The "stray remarks" in <span class="Italic">Ottaviano</span> consisted of an instance where the selecting official referred to the employees in one of the Agency's offices as "a bunch of old duffers," and where the selecting official asked the complainant why he applied for the position when he had talked about retirement and an "early out." While the selecting official in <span class="Italic">Ottaviano</span> asked about the complainant's retirement because the complainant made comments indicating he planned to retire soon, here, SO specifically asked Complainant when he was going to retire, even though Complainant had not raised the topic of retirement with SO before. SO's inquiry is further distinguishable because it was specifically directed at Complainant and made direct comments about his age. In <span class="Italic">Ottaviano</span>, the "old duffer" comment was not directed at the complainant. The AJ also specifically found SO's denials on the matter were not credible, and concluded SO's remarks about Complainant's age and retirement were suggestive of age bias.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, based on the combination of evidence concerning the unusual participation of P3 in the selection panel, that participation occurring solely at the insistence of SO, the significantly lowered scores given by P3 for Complainant than those awarded by the two other panel members, and evidence of Complainant's superior qualifications for the job, as well as some previous comments made by SO suggesting age bias, we conclude that the AJ's finding of age discrimination was supported by substantial evidence of record.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission also has held that an official's authority to reject a recommended candidate is compelling evidence that he is the selecting official. In <span class="Italic">Lall v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01964642 (1997), the agency asserted that appellant incorrectly identified the associate general counsel as the selecting official because he was the final approval authority for every competitive promotion action for grades 14 and 15 in the Office of General Counsel. The agency argued that the officials who review applications, interview candidates, and make their recommendation of the best qualified candidate to the associate general counsel are the proper selecting officials. The Commission disagreed, noting that the agency clearly acknowledged that the associate general counsel was the final approving authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is nothing inherently inappropriate about a selecting official consulting the supervisor of the position when that supervisor is familiar with the qualifications of the candidates. The complainant must show that any recommendation was based on discriminatory animus. <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01880280 (1988).</p>
