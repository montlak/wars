<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-86"><span class="space">12.</span> Law Enforcement and Security Contractors</h4>
<p class="noindent">Contract law enforcement and security personnel can present a problem for agencies because there is a need for a high degree of control of such contractors. However, it is that very degree of control that can convert contractors into employees for purposes of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Balderas, et al. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120063771 (2007), the complainants were contract Aviation Security Officers for the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System, who claimed they were subjected to several forms of discrimination based on national origin and sex and in reprisal for protected activity. The agency, relying on previous cases involving ASO's, found that the complainants were contractors and not employees. In reversing in <span class="Italic">Balderas</span>, the Commission focused on the high degree of control that the agency exercised over the contractors:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each complainant entered into separate one on one direct personal services contracts with the agency. Each contract is identically worded. In finding that complainants were independent contractors, the FADs in nearly identical language focused on the wording of the personal services contracts and the financial arrangements between the parties. The FADs emphasized that the contracts explicitly state complainants are independent contractors, not employees. They further observed that the contracts indicated complainants are not entitled to pension, health, or other federal benefits, that the agency only withholds federal and state taxes, and it does not pay social security taxes. The FADs observed that to receive payment under their contracts, complainants must submit vouchers, including a time and attendance form approved by an agency supervisor, and that the travel expenses for their frequent travel are reimbursed under joint federal travel regulations, not an established GTA (presumably government travel account). Finally, the FADs observed that complainants are only paid for hours worked, and they agreed to provide service on an on-call basis for any location at any time of the day or night.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FADs cited to three Commission decisions in support of their finding that complainants were independent contractors, not employees. The decisions were <span class="Italic">Carlton v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A50853 (December 20, 2005); <span class="Italic">Garrity v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01 A31430 (March 12, 2004); and <span class="Italic">Fowler v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A23529 (September 19, 2002). All three decisions found that ASOs were independent contractors, not employees of the agency, and two of the decisions specifically stated the ASOs worked for JPATS. The decisions emphasized the financial arrangements between the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant Balderas disputes aspects of the financial arrangement claimed by her FAD. Contradicting the FAD claim that she does not receive federal benefits, complainant Balderas submitted documentation showing otherwise. She submits a May 6, 2002 letter by agency general counsel acknowledging that contract ASOs are entitled to U.S. Department of Labor Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits since, in part, they are under the direct supervision and control of the agency in the performance of their duties. She submits other documentation showing OWCP accepted her claim for compensation in May 2002. Complainant also submits an April 2006 agency pay record showing that the agency withheld her Social Security and Medicare taxes, in addition to federal and state income taxes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">International Union v. Clark,</span> 2006 WL 2598046 (D.D.C. 2006), the court ruled that contrary to the contention of the United States Marshals Service, Court Security Officers (CSOs) were employees of the agency, not independent contractors. The agency contended that CSOs were employees of companies with which it contracted to provide court security services. The contract companies hired and paid the salaries and benefits of the CSOs, withheld taxes on their behalf, maintained time and attendance records, and had the power to terminate a CSO. Moreover, the contract companies provided site supervisors to provide supervision of day to day operations of CSOs. Applying a joint employment test, which asks whether the agency maintained for itself "sufficient control of the terms and conditions of employment" of the CSOs, the Court ruled the agency jointly employed the CSOs, i.e., the CSOs were employees of the agency and their contract company. Similarly, the test applied herein to determine employment status turns on whether the employer controls the means and manner of the worker's work performance. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 2: Threshold Issues, 2-III.A.l, page 2-25. In finding that the agency had sufficient control of the terms and conditions of employment to be a joint CSO employer, the Court noted that the agency had input into the selection process, noting for example, that representatives sit on selection panels that interview prospective CSOs. In this case, the agency directly hired all the complainants, with no intervening employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making its employee determination, the Court factored in that the agency sets the medical, physical and weapons proficiency standards CSOs must meet, and provides training and certain essential equipment, such as firearms, ammunition, handcuffs, pepper spray, and radios.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While complainants personal services contract refers to United States <span id="Page_198"></span>Marshals Service (USMS) directives regulating minimum requirements for ASOs, use of force, code of professional responsibility, and firearms which are not in the record, information in the contract and record shows that the agency sets medical, physical and weapons requirements for ASOs. Complainant Balderas writes on appeal that the agency provided her a duty weapon, she was trained by an agency employee in the use of firearms, and the agency provided her mechanical restraints, handcuffs and leg irons for use with prisoners. Under complainants' contracts, where firearms are used, they are issued by the agency and training in an agency firearms qualifications and/or shotgun familiarization course is required. Complainants Trejo and Ramirez-Rake referred in their complaints to being scheduled for firearms training instructed by an agency employee, and complainant Trejo wrote that an agency official assigned her to perimeter duty where she had a shotgun. Complainants Ramirez-Rake and Trejo write on appeal that the agency gives them work supplies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainants Balderas, Trejo and Ramirez-Rake write that the agency provides ASOs frequent training. Complainant Balderas submits certificates showing completion of some training and the syllabus of a three day course in 2005 entitled Aviation Enforcement and Security Officer Training (for JPATS) which covered aircraft medical issues, EEO, sexual harassment, code of professional responsibility, use of force and restraint, and firearms. A number of the listed instructors were named as agency employees in complainant Trejo and Ramirez complaints. Moreover, under their contracts, all the complainants are required to pass a fitness for duty physical by private physicians, suggesting required agency fitness standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant Balderas writes on appeal that the patch on her uniform states "United States Marshals Service, Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System, Air Operations Division Air Crew," and the badge on the front of my uniform states, "United States Marshal." She writes her uniform was provided by the agency. The complainants' contracts state that upon termination of the contract, the ASO is required to return all government issued uniforms, corroborating what complainant Balderas wrote. Complainant Balderas also writes on appeal that she worked exclusively for the agency since March 1, 2001. Complainants Trejo and Ramirez-Rake write on appeal that some ASOs provide long term service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In ruling that the agency was a joint employer of CSOs, the Court found that while much of the day-to-day supervision of CSOs falls to the contract employers, the agency retained virtually exclusive control over what work CSOs must perform, the time, place, and manner in which it must be performed, and the number of individuals performing it at any given time. In the instant case, there is no intervening employer. On appeal, complainant Balderas writes that she was supervised by an agency employee who told her how and what she must do, and her work schedule and assignments were prepared by an agency employee. Complainants Trejo and Ramirez-Rake wrote in their EEO complaints that agency officials were unfairly scheduling them. In finding that the agency controlled the work of CSOs, the Court noted that the agency had numerous performance standards for them, such as abiding by all agency ethical standards regarding conflict of interest, outside activities, use of federal property; reporting violations of prescribed rules and regulations to an appropriate supervisor or manager, prohibiting them from discussing duty assignments and delaying or refusing to carry out a proper order of a supervisor or other official having responsibility for their work, engaging in any activity that would adversely affect the reputation of the agency, and so forth. The complainants' contracts have strikingly similar extensive provisions. In addition, the contracts have many other rules prescribing conduct and behavior on and off the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the agency jointly employed CSOs, the Court factored in that the agency's power to decide whether a particular CSO could be removed from the contract for failure to meet the qualifications of the job was tantamount with removal power since an adverse agency determination in most cases of a CSO resulted in termination by the contractor. The Court noted that this was a rare case where the contract workers performed the critical mission of the agency, i.e., security, and such individuals would rarely be qualified to assume other roles, such as secretarial or support job, at the contractor's headquarters. Here, there is no intervening employer and the agency has the direct power of termination. Moreover, the ASOs perform the critical mission of the agency, i.e., security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set for herein, we find that the agency exercised sufficient control over complainants' positions to qualify as their employer for the purpose of the EEO complaint process. The weight of the evidence shows that the agency had the right to control when, where, and how complainants performed their jobs. In addition to the factors pointing to an employment relationship analyzed in conjunction with the above discussion of <span class="Italic">International Union v. Clark,</span> other factors point to an employment relationship. Complainant Balderas had a continuing relationship with the agency, and the record suggests the agency used some ASOs year after year. The agency sets the hours of work and duration of the job. Under their contracts, complainants were paid hourly, rather than an agreed cost of performing a particular job. Complainants personally provide the ASO service and do not hire or pay assistants to do so. Complainants function was part of the agency's central mission. The agency provides complainants workers compensation benefits, withholds their federal and state income taxes, and the pay stub of complainant Balderas shows it also withholds their social security taxes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the factual information in the record, we distinguish the cases of <span class="Italic">Carlton v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A50853 (December 20, 2005); <span class="Italic">Garrity v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01 A31430 (March 12, 2004); and <span class="Italic">Fowler v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A23529 (September 19, 2002). We note that while some of the factual information came from statements on appeal, much of the statements were supported by the record, and the agency did not controvert complainants' statements.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was achieved in <span class="Italic">Grosshans v. Attorney General</span>, 0120072517 (2007), where the Commission found that court security officers provided by a contractor were agency employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120120861 (2014), the Commission found that the contract employee was an agency employee for EEO purposes even where the contractor exercised a high degree of control over some aspects of employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Contractor set Complainant's hours of work, paid Complainant's salary, withheld taxes, provided health benefits and annual leave, and provided Complainant with a firearm, uniform clothing, and personal gear. In addition, Complainant's first- and second-level supervisors were employees of the Contractor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other factors, however, indicate that the Agency was a joint employer of Complainant. Complainant performed work in the Federal Building, the work did not require a high level of skill or expertise, and the Agency provided the x-ray machine and other equipment that Complainant used on the job. Complainant's work was an integral part of the Agency's mission to provide a safe environment in federal buildings. Moreover, the Agency exercised such control over Complainant's job performance that FPS-1 monitored Complainant's performance and required him to undergo one-one-one training. Complainant was removed from his post upon FPS-l's recommendation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth herein, we find that the Agency exercised sufficient control over Complainant's position to qualify as a joint employer for the purpose of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process.</p>
