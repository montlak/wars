<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-36"><span class="space">22.</span> Postmarks</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's policy on postmarks is treated in several sections of this book. Because it is an issue that is repeatedly raised and because the Commission's policy is consistent, it is treated here in the hope that if it is mentioned enough times, the message will get through. The Commission deems a document filed on the date of postmark. In the absence of a postmark, it is deemed filed as of the date of receipt. If the postmark is not legible, the Commission will presume the filing is timely if it is received within five days of expiration of the time period.</p>
<p class="noindent">Postmark refers to the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service and not a franked postmark from a private postage meter. The Commission has noted that private postage meters allow for the "potential of self-serving alteration" and "their concomitant unreliability." <span class="Italic">Bunch v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05880687 (1988)<span class="Italic">; see also</span> <span class="Italic">Vernita L. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020001124 (2021) (proof of postage purchase is not enough); <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a50453.txt">01A50453</a> (2005) (rejecting private postmark as date of filing); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A35368 (2004) (complaint untimely where private postage meter stamped the envelope on the last day of the filing period, but the Postal Service meter stamped the envelope the day after); <span class="Italic">Corbin v. Postmaster General</span>, 05990836 (2001) (a later Postal Service postmark was accepted over an earlier meter date). However, the regulations do not require that the postmark be by machine or postal meter stamp; a manually-stamped postmark meets the requirement. <span class="Italic">See Daniels v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921257 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">There has been some inconsistency in the manner in which the Commission has treated private postmarks. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hauhn v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120123036 (2012), the Commission specifically stated that private postage meters are an acceptable means of proving time of mailing. In <span class="Italic">Hauhn</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case indicates that complainant's attorney received the notice of the right to file a formal discrimination complaint on March 29, 2012. The envelope containing Complainant's formal complaint contained a date stamp from a private postage meter dated March 29, 2012. The Agency asserts that this mailing date must be inaccurate because Complainant's formal complaint was dated April 13, 2012. However, we disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's attorney, in her brief in support of Complainant's appeal, asserts the following chronology of events:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[b]ecause Complainant's counsel had a long meeting scheduled for later that day and did not expect to complete preparation of the formal complaint on that day, she dated the documents April 13, 2012, which was the deadline for filing the complaint. However, the meeting scheduled for that day was canceled and Complainant's counsel was, unexpectedly, able to finish preparation of the complaint and file it, by first class mail, that same day. Complainant's counsel acknowledges that, in her haste, she neglected [to] change the date on the formal complaint from April 13, 2012 to the actual date March 29, 2012, prior to filing the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the Commission has held that a private postage meter strip is an acceptable postmark in the absence of other proof of date of mailing. <span class="Italic">See Rubin v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05890783 (Sept. 28, 1989) (finding that the private meter stamp (which was dated within the filing period) used by Complainant was an acceptable form of a postmark and reversed the Agency's final decision dismissing the complaint as untimely filed, even though the Agency alleged that it received the formal complaint outside the filing period). In the instant matter, the envelope did not bear a United States Postal Service postmark.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that we should not accept the private meter postmark pursuant to <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A50453 (Mar. 23, 2005) (affirming Agency's dismissal for untimely filing of the formal complaint when envelope contained a private postage meter date stamp which was prior to the time limit but the complaint was received more than five days past the expiration of the filing period). However, we disagree. We noted in <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span> that there was not adequate justification to warrant an extension of the time limit; however, in the instant matter we find that Complainant's attorney expressly set forth that she mailed the complaint on March 29, 2012, and provided an explanation, as set forth above, as to why Complainant's formal complaint was dated April 13, 2012. Based on the foregoing, we find that Complainant timely filed her formal complaint on March 29, 2012, within the applicable time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has also noted that manually-stamped postmarks are more susceptible to fraud. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bryson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984430 (1999). However, a later, machine-stamped postmark is not controlling where the complainant submits other evidence supporting the earlier mailing date. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bryson</span>, the complainant submitted a certified mail receipt that reflected the same date as the manually-stamped postmark.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Perla v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120082931 (2008), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that only a postmark from the U.S. Postal Service can serve as proof of mailing. In that case, the complainant mailed her formal complaint via UPS. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Perla</span>, distinguished the case from previous cases involving private postmarks:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the UPS parcel did not have a postmark from the United States Postal Service showing the place and date of posting, the tandem of the UPS shipment label, which lists the tracking number, and the corresponding UPS shipment receipt matching the tracking number, which lists the transaction date and proper mailing address of the agency, provides the same type of information as a postmark from the United States Postal Service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that a document is considered to be "postmarked" only if it bears the official postmark of the United States Postal Service rather than a "franked" postmark from a private postage meter or company. For support, the agency cites <span class="Italic">Bunch v. Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880687 (September 12, 1988), <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A50453 (March 23, 2005), and <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A35368 (January 9, 2004). These cases are not on point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In<span class="Italic"> Bunch</span> and <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> the parcels in question each had two stamps with conflicting dates. One stamp was either a metered stamp from a business franking machine or a private postage meter strip, and the other stamp was a postmark by the United States Postal Service. In <span class="Italic">Bunch</span> and <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Commission held that for purposes of determining whether a document was filed in a timely manner, the date of a postmark by the United States Postal Service superseded the date of a stamp from a business franking machine or a private postage meter strip when the dates on the parcel conflicted. In this case, complainant mailed a parcel that contained only one shipping label from UPS; the parcel did not have an additional postmark from the United States Postal Service with a conflicting date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, complainant mailed an envelope that had only a private postage meter. The Commission held that the envelope was not officially postmarked. The rationale for allowing an official postmark from the United States Postal Service to serve as evidence of timeliness rather than a private meter postmark is because a private user can change the date on a private postage meter; therefore, such a date lacks the inherent reliability of the date on an official U.S. postmark.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, neither complainant nor her attorney affixed a date to the UPS parcel using a private postage meter. Rather, complainant mailed her complaint using UPS, an independent delivery service, in which the shipping date could be ascertained by the shipment label and receipt generated by UPS. Complainant's UPS shipment label and receipt satisfy the concerns about the reliability of the shipping date.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a postmark is open to interpretation, the Commission will look to the letter's place of origin to assist in interpretation. <span class="Italic">Buckley v. Department of Defense Dependent Schools</span>, 05890638 (1989). In that case, local custom in the State of Bahrain is to list the day first when using numerical postmarks. Therefore, "12-11-88" was November 12, 1988 and not December 11. Appellant's complaint was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complaint bears two postmarks, the earlier one controls. In <span class="Italic">Koch v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 01965642 (1997), the complaint envelope contained a U.S. Postal Service postage meter stamp as well as a hand-stamped postmark. The Commission found the complaint was timely using the first postmark.</p>
<p class="noindent">The U.S. Postal Service does not postmark its own official business envelopes. This led to an interesting result in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920260 (1992), where the EEO counselor provided the complainant with an official agency envelope for filing his EEO complaint. The Commission found that the formal complaint would be considered timely based on the testimony of the employee that he had mailed it within the 15-day period. The Commission found it credible that the employee--a janitor--would not know of the agency's practice of not postmarking its own mail.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_164"></span>Postmarks of the U.S. Postal Service are not infallible. In <span class="Italic">Halloran v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12632 (2001), the agency dismissed the complaint as untimely filed because it bore a postmark from Tampa, Florida, six days after the filing deadline. However, the complainant produced a certified mail receipt from St. Petersburg showing her complaint was timely filed and arguing that the envelope should have had a postmark from that city. The Commission held the complaint was timely. However, as in <span class="Italic">Halloran</span>, the complainant needs some evidence to demonstrate the postmark is errant. A mere assertion will not overcome the presumption that the postmark accurately represents the date of mailing. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Tomaskovic v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120073146 (2007), the Commission extended the time limit for filing the formal complaint where it was due on May 24th, but was postmarked on May 25th. The complainant's attorney submitted an affidavit stating that he had placed it in a mailbox prior to the last pickup time on May 24th. Based on that statement, the Commission concluded the complaint was filed on the 24th and, thus, timely. The Commission's rationale in <span class="Italic">Tomaskovic</span> is a little sloppy since there was no need for it to "extend" the time frame based on its finding that the complaint had, in fact, been timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The five-day rule only applies in situations where the complaint envelope has no postmark or an illegible postmark. It does not apply in cases where the agency discards the complaint envelope and, as a result, has no proof of date of mailing. In <span class="Italic">Bregstone v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01951423 (1996), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find appellant received the NOFI on August 27, 1994. To be timely filed via the mails, his complaint had to be postmarked not later than September 12, 1994<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.604 ("Filing and computation of time"). Date of receipt is determinative, for timeliness purposes, when the filed document lacks a legible postmark. A document will then be deemed timely when it is received within five (5) days of the expiration of the applicable time period<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.604(b). In this case, appellant's complaint was dated September 4, 1994, well within the 15-day period. However, we find no evidence as to date of filing. The agency claims, proffering an ambiguous date stamp, that it received the complaint on September 20, 1994, which is beyond the five-day extension period which would have been applicable if the issue concerned an illegible postmark. Here, in the absence of a copy of the mailing envelope, there is no evidence of any postmark.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that where, as here, there is an issue of timeliness, "[a]n agency always bears the burden of obtaining sufficient information to support a reasoned determination as to timeliness." <span class="Italic">Paul E. Guy, Jr. v. Department of Energy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930703 (January 4, 1994) (quoting <span class="Italic">Homer Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920506 (August 25, 1992)). In addition, in <span class="Italic">Ericson v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920623 (January 14, 1993), the Commission stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency has the burden of providing evidence and/or proof to support its final decisions<span class="Italic">. See Gens v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910837 (January 31, 1992). Here, the agency apparently did not retain the envelope in which appellant mailed her complaint. Thus, there is no way to determine whether there was a postmark and, if so, the date thereof. Consequently, the agency cannot invoke the five day rule.... The rule was intended to apply in cases in which a mailing envelope bears an illegible postmark or is without any postmark whatsoever, not in cases in which the agency has failed to retain the envelope.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find that the agency has not met its burden, noting again that the agency did not satisfy our request for a copy of the envelope, with the postmark, used by appellant to mail his formal complaint. Accordingly, we find the agency improperly dismissed appellant's complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">In the absence of a postmark, the agency bears the burden of submitting evidence of when the complaint was received. For example, in <span class="Italic">Nathan v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01984898 (2001), the agency demonstrated that the complainant received the notice of final interview on March 20, 1998, but submitted no evidence to support its assertion that the formal complaint was received on April 14. The complaint itself was dated March 30. The Commission, in the absence of any evidence submitted by the agency to show that April 14 was the correct date of receipt, found the complaint was timely filed. A similar result was obtained in <span class="Italic">Jackson-Bostic v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A13948 (2002), where the postmark was not legible. The Commission found the complaint was timely filed because the agency failed to produce evidence of the date on which the complainant had received the notice of final interview.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the envelope contained no clear postmark, but did contain a notation by the Postal Service that the envelope was "found in supposedly empty equipment," the Commission considered the appeal timely. <span class="Italic">Keesee v. Postmaster General</span>, 05970318 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a postmark is illegible, the Commission will presume the complaint was mailed within five days of its being received. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064319 (2006), resulted in essentially two extensions for the complainant. The final day for filing the formal complaint fell on a Sunday. As a result, the complainant had until close of business Monday to mail the complaint. The complaint, however, did not arrive in the EEO office until the following Monday. Given that the postmark was illegible, the Commission determined that the complaint was timely as it arrived on the fifth business day after expiration of the filing period.</p>
