<h4 class="h4" id="sec22-63"><span class="space">24.</span> Time Records</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the fact estimates of the time spent in representing employees in EEO matters are insufficient to support a fee award. <span class="Italic">See Cole v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910450 (1991) (holding that the hours expended on a matter must be supported by contemporaneous time records); s<span class="Italic">ee also</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of Army</span>, 01831806 (1985). However, the failure to keep contemporaneous records will not result in an outright rejection of the fee award. The Commission will simply do its best to determine the number of hours reasonably expended on the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to provide the agency with an opportunity to determine whether the time claimed was reasonably expended, time records must describe the tasks performed in sufficient detail. Although "great detail" is not required, at a minimum, the time records should give some indication of the nature of the work performed. In <span class="Italic">McClendon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01883431 (1989), the Commission explained this requirement in more detail:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the number of hours reasonably expended, the Commission recognizes that the attorney "is not required to record in great detail how each minute of his time was expended." <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 437 n.12 (1983). However, the attorney does have the burden of identifying the subject matters on which he spent <span id="Page_2014"></span>his time, which can be documented by submitting sufficiently detailed contemporaneous time records to ensure that the time spent was accurately recorded. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mary B. O'Hara v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01894035 (December 14, 1989). "Casual after-the-fact estimates of time expended on a case are insufficient to support an award of attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency, in its final decision, rejected forty-nine (49) hours requested by [Attorney] #2 for alleged "office visits" with appellant from April 20, 1988 to August 18, 1989. The agency reasoned that [Attorney] #2's fee petition failed to specify the exact service performed. In the fee petition, [Attorney] #2 indicated that these billable hours were expended for services characterized as "office visits." The burden of establishing entitlement to an award of attorney's fees, including documentation that an appropriate number of hours was expended and an appropriate hourly fee charged, is upon the claimant. <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983). EEOC Regulations provides that the attorney seeking an award of fees shall submit to the agency a verified statement of costs and fees with an accompanying affidavit itemizing the charges for legal services. 29 CFR 1613.271(d)(2). A fee application must "contain sufficiently detailed information regarding the hours logged and the work done" to permit the determination of a correct award. <span class="Italic">National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon a careful review of the fee petition submitted by [Attorney] #1, we find that the forty-nine (49) billable hours disallowed by the agency is reasonable due to the unsubstantiated general descriptions set forth by [Attorney] #1 for the rejected hours. General descriptions of services such as "Office Visits" are too vague without support from contemporaneous records to substantiate a claim for attorney's fees. We should note that our review as to whether the agency's rejection of such hours was reasonable is based on the information which was available to the agency when the fee request was submitted for consideration. We find that, although the agency afforded [Attorney] #1 an opportunity to provide additional documentation to support the billable hours designated for "office visits," [Attorney] #1 failed to submit any additional documentation to substantiate his claim. Therefore, after reviewing the fee petition submitted by [Attorney] #1, we find that agency reasonably disallowed forty-nine (49) billable hours for vague or general descriptions of services. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the agency's decision was proper on this point.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">McGraw v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A34005 (2004) (holding that entries such as "telephone call with opposing counsel" and "telephone call with client" were to vague to permit review); <span class="Italic">Childs v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01994951 (2002) (holding that entries such as "interviewing witnesses, outlining deposition/trial preparation/law research and review/hearing preparation" were too vague to permit analysis of the individual tasks involved).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the time entry decisions were vague and contained acronyms and abbreviations that did not readily permit review of the entries for reasonableness, the Commission found it was appropriate to deduct those hours from the fee award. In <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vashi v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120081943 (2011), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to reasonable hours expended, the Commission finds that the hours claimed by Complainant's attorney are, in certain instances, unsupported and vague. We find that many entries in the fee petition lack adequate descriptions of work performed. Many entries contain abbreviations "t/c t" and "t/c f." Also, other entries use the acronyms "UIAB" and "EED" without explanation. We find it difficult to ascertain the reasonableness of work performed under such general descriptions. <span class="Italic">See Stapp v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A05634 (Sept. 9, 2002); <span class="Italic">McGraw v. Dep't of Veteran's Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A53107 (Jan. 12, 2006). As such, we find that 8.25 hours billed under the abbreviations and acronyms, as noted above, are excludable on the grounds that the hours claimed by Complainant's attorney are vague. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120054278 (Mar. 20, 2007) (excluding entries there were vague, finding it difficult to ascertain the reasonableness of work performed under general descriptions). Further, another entry on October 5, 2005, which billed for .10 hours, merely states, "Received payment for appeal fees," and provides no explanation as to what legal work was performed. Also, the entry for December 22, 2007, which billed for .35 hours, only states, "Research into [Complainant's] case and compliance" and provides no details as to the specific nature of the research. As a result, we find that 8.5 hours billed are excludable on the grounds that the hours claimed by Complainant's attorney are vague. Moreover, we find that that Complainant's Attorney's Law Clerk's December 11, 2005, entry, which billed for .20 hours, is also excludable due to its general description.</p>
<p class="noindent">In documenting time spent on a case, a balance must be achieved between describing tasks in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of whether the tasks were necessary and any privilege that may be involved. An attorney is not required to violate privilege to document time but, on the other hand, privilege cannot be used to bar an inquiry into whether the time spent was reasonable. In <span class="Italic">Tan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A46030 (2006), the Commission rejected an argument that more detail was not required in documenting conversations between the complainant's attorney and his licensed clinical social worker, who was also an expert witness at the hearing. To the extent that privilege was involved, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Tan</span> held that the complainant was required to waive privilege in order to provide sufficient detail on how the time was spent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency cut 35.75 of the requested hours because the fee petition provided insufficient explanation to make a determination on what the work regarded and whether it was related to the litigation. Most of these hours regarded telephone calls with the complainant's treating licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), who also served as his expert witness. Prior to cutting the call hours, the agency repeatedly advised the complainant's attorney that he needed to describe them. He declined to do this, citing confidentiality, attorney/client and health care provider/patient privilege, and privacy. These objections are not persuasive. To the extent privilege was a barrier, it was incumbent on the complainant to waive it to allow a sufficient explanation of fees. A description need not go into great detail of what was discussed. A few words describing the nature of the conversation would normally suffice. By providing no detail, we cannot discern whether these hours were reasonably expended. On appeal, the complainant's attorney gives no additional specific information on 35.75 hours. Accordingly, the agency properly cut them.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Meachum and Abbott v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720120003 (2013), the Commission explained the balance between summarizing tasks and providing sufficient detail for review of the tasks to determine the reasonableness of the number of hours expended:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency argues that Complainants' fee petition contains insufficient detail, requests impermissible fees, and includes work for matters unrelated to the accepted issues. For example, the Agency contends that Complainants seeks compensation for clerical services such as "entering dates on calendar" and "scheduling depositions." According to the Agency, Complainants requested fees for "status of statement in companion case," "terminology list for court report," and "phone call with witness regarding concerns about testifying." The Agency argues that descriptions such as "review second proposed document" and "read depositions" are inadequate for it to determine whether the time spent on each task was reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, Complainants contend that their counsel submitted over 200 entries which included the date, attorney name, hours and summary of tasks performed. Addressing some of the Agency's specific examples, Complainants asserts that the entry for April 14 and 15, 2008 for "entering dates in a calendar" was for .10 hours (6 minutes) and included leaving a phone message for Complainant regarding discovery requests. Similarly, in disputing the Agency's assertion that a June 16, 2008, entry was simply for "scheduling a deposition," Complainants state that the .33 hour (20 minutes) entry also included: reviewing the AJ's order, speaking with opposing counsel, and modifying a proposed protective order. These tasks, argues Complainants, are clearly not simply clerical in nature. While the Agency argued that phone calls with witnesses regarding their testimony is not compensable, Complainants state that these individuals testified at the hearing and their hearing preparation was reasonable. Lastly, regarding the Agency's contention that the law firm inappropriately utilized "block billing," Complainants argues that a review of those entries in context reveals that sufficient detail was included. For example, an entry for 8 hours on August 13, 2008 explains that the time was spent in defense of Complainant's deposition and in meeting with Complainants. According to Complainants, each entry appropriately describes the tasks performed and there is no prohibition against an entry including more than one task. In fact, to require each task to be a separate time entry would be "incredibly burdensome."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the instant record reflects that the AJ did not make a mistake as a matter of law or abuse her discretion in her award of attorney's fees. The AJ's determinations are sufficiently supported by the documentation provided by Complainants, including over eleven pages of billing entries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's argument that the AJ failed to reduce the majority of fees related to clerical services, we note that the Commission has held that clerical expenses are generally viewed as part of the attorney's overhead and as such these expenses are not reimbursable. <span class="Italic">Cole v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910450 (August 5, 1991). In the instant case, as noted above, the Agency contends that the Complainant improperly requested fees for clerical work. However, a review of the billing entries reflect that any clerical tasks included were completed and recorded in combination with non-clerical tasks. We agree with Complainants that it is unnecessary to provide separate entries for several tasks performed over, for example, twenty minutes making calendar entries, while also calling opposing counsel and leaving a message with the client).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the Commission determines that time sheet entries are too vague to permit an analysis, it simply determines the total number of hours that it believes is reasonable for the case and cuts the fee across-the-board, <span id="Page_2015"></span>accordingly. The Commission is not required to do a detailed analysis to determine the appropriate number of hours in such cases. <span class="Italic">Harley v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 07A30077 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that there is not activity in the case record that corresponds to time entries is not, standing alone, a sufficient basis for denying fees for those services. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Coard v. Attorney General</span>, 01A02439 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency disallowed numerous entries in the fee petition on the ground that the services described did not "correspond to any case activity of record." This is not a proper basis for disallowing reimbursement. If the services were rendered in furtherance of the ultimate goal of proving complainant's case, and are reasonable in amount, they are properly reimbursable. The authority upon which the agency relies, <span class="Italic">Safford v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952348 is distinguishable. In that case, the Commission approved disallowance of certain services rendered during the pendency of an appeal to the Commission because the matter had been briefed and there was no occasion for the attorney to render any legal services. Here, the agency seeks to disallow reimbursement for services rendered in advance of the convening of the AJ hearing. We have no basis for concluding that the services rendered by counsel were not reasonably related to the prosecution of the complainant's complaints. The fact that the services did not "correspond" to "case activities" of which the agency was aware does not preclude reimbursement.</p>
<p class="noindent">When considering an across-the-board reduction of fees where the time records do not separate the matters litigated adequately, the Commission can review the hearing transcripts in an attempt to allocate time. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01924488 (1993) (determining that a one-third reduction in a fee was appropriate based on a review of hearing transcripts).</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, the Commission found a general description that counsel "prepared for hearing" to be too vague without further support to justify an accounting of over 30 hours. The Commission reduced the hours expended by 30%. <span class="Italic">See Park v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01933482 (1993).</p>
