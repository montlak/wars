<h4 class="h4" id="sec19-29"><span class="space">3.</span> Adequacy of Representation</h4>
<p class="noindent">The adequacy of representation requirement has two elements: "(1) that the attorney for the class be qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the litigation; and (2) that the class agent's interests do not conflict with those of the remainder of the class." <span class="Italic">Knopf v. Department of Interior</span>, 01871538 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Eisen v. Carlisle Jacquelin</span>, 391 F.2d 555, 562 (2d Cir. 1968)). The administrative judge may certify a class conditionally to allow the complainant a "reasonable period of time" to secure adequate representation. <span class="Italic">See</span> MD-110 at 8-6.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge is required to make specific findings on the adequacy of representation. In <span class="Italic">Brant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01891559 (1989), a case decided under Part 1613, the Commission found that when there is insufficient evidence of the representative's ability, the judge must give class members the opportunity to present evidence on the issue of qualifications prior to issuing a decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Adequacy of representation in a class action is perhaps the most crucial requirement because the judgment will determine the rights of the absent class members. <span class="Italic">Hansberry v. Lee</span>, 311 U.S. 32, 41 (1940)...The AJ in this case found that appellant's representative may not possess sufficient qualifications to adequately represent the class. The representative, according to the record, has a law degree and class action experience. No supporting information regarding that class action experience was provided. RD at 7. The AJ recommended the complaint be accepted, subject to appellant demonstrating that the representative possessed sufficient qualifications or otherwise securing adequate representation. The AJ did not specifically make a finding as to whether the representative was qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When appellant failed to provide sufficient detail to enable the AJ to determine the representative's qualifications and experience with class actions, the AJ should have afforded appellant fifteen (15) days to provide evidence as to the representative's experience and qualifications. After this supplemental submission the AJ should have issued a decision specifically finding that the representative was or was not qualified. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1613.604(d)....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Juli Z. v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 2019003557 (2020), affirmed the AJ's finding that the class agents did not have the necessary knowledge or skills to represent the class. In addition, in the more than five years since the filing of the complaint, the class agents and counsel were unable to obtain the funds needed to represent the class. The Commission also noted the significant delay in the discovery process because of the class counsel in <span class="Italic">Juli Z</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 31, 2011, the Agency sent class counsel a letter, stating that it would soon be noticing the depositions of CA1 and CA2. The Agency stated that class counsel could use the Agency's video conference equipment to participate from Washington, D.C. but that the expenses would likely be in excess of $200 per hour. The Agency alternately proposed exploring the feasibility of allowing class counsel to participate remotely using a private video teleconference service. On February 11, 2011, the Agency noticed the depositions of CA1 and CA2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 10, 2011, the AJ granted the class 30 days to arrange for the substitution of new class agents, citing a letter from CA1 that stated that she and CA2 wished to withdraw as class agents. On April 18, 2011, class counsel filed a motion to substitute two new proposed class agents, CA3 and CA4, for CA1 and CA2. On May 18, 2011, the AJ reopened discovery for 60 days for the purposes of responding to the class's motion to substitute. On June 10, 2011, the Agency noticed the depositions of CA3 and CA4 for later that month. On June 22, 2011, the Agency issued amended depositions, noticing the depositions of CA3 and CA4 for July 7 and 8, 2011, respectively, at the Agency's Region 7 facility in Kansas City, Kansas.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 23, 2011, the AJ issued an order, which stated that it had been brought to her attention that class counsel had attempted to circumvent her previous order by contacting the Director of Commission's Kansas City Area Office without the AJ's knowledge, in an apparent attempt to procure free use of EEOC video conference equipment to participate in the depositions from EEOC Headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ warned that further attempts to circumvent her orders would subject the class to sanctions and ordered that class counsel could use EEOC video conference equipment if he arranged such use through the AJ and the class paid the reasonable expenses associated with the use of <span id="Page_1636"></span>the EEOC equipment. The associated cost of using the EEOC equipment was $55 per hour. The depositions did not occur in July 2011, and class counsel filed a motion for a protective order regarding the depositions, in which he requested no-cost access to Commission video conferencing equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 13, 2011, the AJ ordered the parties to discuss scheduling the depositions of CA3 and CA4 for February 2012. The AJ's order indicated that she would arrange for the availability of EEO video conferencing equipment in the Commission's Kansas City and Headquarters offices and that class counsel would need to arrange to pay the Commission $55 per hour for the use of the equipment. The depositions did not take place in February 2012. On March 27, 2012, the case was transferred to a different AJ. The Agency filed a motion to decertify the class and for sanctions. According to the record, there was no case activity until July 2015.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 1, 2016, the AJ held a status conference with a court reporter. During the status conference, the AJ ordered the parties to brief various outstanding issues, including providing class counsel 90 days from the date he received the transcript to report back to the AJ on efforts to find additional counsel to represent the class. On September 1, 2016, class counsel filed a motion for a 30-day stay because CA3 had indicated that she was no longer interested in serving as a class agent and because CA4, who was willing to serve as a class agent, had recently had a stroke. On September 6, 2016, the AJ denied the motion for the stay, but extended the briefing schedule by 10 days and extending the deadline to produce CA4 for a deposition by 21 days. In the order, the AJ advised class counsel that he should seek substitute class agents in the meantime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 21, 2016, the Agency noticed the deposition of CA4 for October 28, 2016, at the Agency's Region 7 facility in Lenexa, Kansas. The Agency deposed CA4 as scheduled, and class counsel participated remotely using Skype. After receiving the transcript of the deposition, the Agency filed its opposition to the class's motion to substitute the class agent. The Agency argued that CA4's claims were not typical of the class and that CA4 could not adequately serve as class agent because of his lack of understanding of the class action, his lack of communication with class counsel, and his lack of financial resources to prosecute the case on behalf of the class. The Agency also filed a motion to decertify the class, citing the lack of adequate representation by class counsel and CA4, as well as the lack of commonality and typicality. On March 15, 2017, the AJ found that CA4 was not an adequate class agent because he would have a conflict of interest as both the class agent and the sub-class agent, because of his limited understanding of the case, and because of his lack of resources. However, the AJ denied the Agency's motion to decertify the class and granted the class 60 days to find substitute class agents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 15, 2017, the class filed a motion to substitute two new class agents (CA5 for the class and CA6 for the sub-class). On June 30, 2017, the AJ reopened discovery for 60 days for the limited purpose of responding to the class's motion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 21, 2017, the Agency noticed the depositions of CA5 and CA6. The Agency deposed CA6 on August 24, 2017, and the Agency deposed CA5 on August 25, 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 10, 2017, the Agency filed its opposition to the class motion to substitute CA5 and CA6 as class agents. The Agency argued that, during his deposition, CA6 had demonstrated little familiarity with the class action or the responsibilities of a class agent and was reluctant to commit more than $4,000 towards the case. Although the Agency admitted that CA5 seemed to understand that class agents were responsible for financing the expenses of the case, the Agency noted that CA5 also was unwilling to commit more than $15,000 towards the case and suggested that she might create a Go Fund Me page to raise additional funds. Class counsel replied in support of the motion to substitute, but class counsel noted in the reply that CA5 was no longer willing to serve as class agent. Class counsel stated that CA4 and CA6 were willing to serve as class agents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 15, 2018, the AJ denied the class's motion to substitute class agents. The AJ found that, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that CA4 and CA6 had sufficient knowledge of the case to act as class agents, CA4, CA6, and class counsel had not demonstrated that they individually or collectively had the resources to vigorously prosecute the case on behalf of the class. The AJ stated that he would entertain a motion to decertify the class based on adequacy of representation. The Agency submitted a motion to decertify the class on August 27, 2018, which the class did not oppose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 28, 2019, the AJ granted the Agency's motion to decertify the class and recommended that the class be decertified due to the lack of adequate class agents and that the case be dismissed. On April 11, 2019, the Agency issued its final order fully implementing the AJ's decision to decertify the class. In the final order, the Agency stated that, because CA1 and CA2 had requested dismissal of the complaint in 2011 and because no other EEO complaints had been subsumed in the class action, no individual complaint would be processed. On May 30, 2019, the AJ approved the Agency's proposed notice of class decertification and proposed distribution plan, and he ordered the Agency to provide a copy of the notice to class members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Adequacy of representation" means simply that the class agent has demonstrated that she, or a designated representative, will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.204(a)(2)(iv). The class agent must show that she is qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct proposed litigation. <span class="Italic">See Drummond v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01940520 (Aug. 19, 1994). A putative class agent who is unable to procure sufficient funding is unlikely to adequately represent the interests of the class. <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A34535 (Sep. 23, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we concur with the AJ that the record does not establish that CA4 and CA6 have the necessary knowledge or skills to represent the interests of the class as class agents. Moreover, we agree that there is no evidence that CA4, CA6, or class counsel will be able to obtain the funds needed to represent the class. Class counsel was retained in November 2004, and since then he has been unable to obtain funding or associate himself with co-counsel possessing the needed resources.2 Moreover, the record reflects that a significant amount of the delay during the discovery process was attributable to class counsel's refusal to cover the minimal expenses associated with using the Agency's or the Commission's video conferencing equipment. Therefore, the class has not established the existence of class agents or a class representative who can fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. We note that there are no individual complaints from CA4 or CA6 regarding this matter to process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that an attorney is a member of more than one state bar and has taken courses in class actions, does not equate with adequate experience. <span class="Italic">See Knopf</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The attorney must make a demonstration of actual litigation experience. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Woods v. Secretary of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 01961033 (1998) (being an attorney does not mean the class agent is an adequate representative, particularly where no class action experience is claimed and the agent already demonstrated problems). The Commission also found in <span class="Italic">Woods</span> that a conflict of interest exists when the class agent tries to act as the class legal representative. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, (citing <span class="Italic">Bachman v. Pertschuk</span>, 437 F. Supp. 973, 976 (D.D.C. 1977); "The attorney must view the interests of the named plaintiff <span class="Italic">in the context of the interests of the entire class</span>. This is difficult when there are varying interests of the class, but it is especially difficult when one's own interest is involved." (emphasis in original)). However, specific experience in trying class action employment discrimination cases is not required. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jeffries v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A02227 (2003) (attorney who had previous class action experience but lacked EEO experience deemed competent to represent class).</p>
<p class="noindent">Formerly, a class action complaint could be dismissed when the complainant fails to demonstrate that his representative can adequately represent the proposed class. A class complaint was properly dismissed on a representational basis where the attorney already displayed problems conducting discovery. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Leonard v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01822213 (1982). But, an attorney who achieved a million dollar settlement in a consolidated complaint involving 16 employees is qualified to adequately represent a class. <span class="Italic">See Lee v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01990384 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the current class representative may not satisfy the requirement of adequate representation for the class as a whole, it is appropriate to conditionally certify the class where the representative indicates he is currently seeking such representation. If the representative later fails to secure adequate representation, the class can later be decertified. <span class="Italic">Southerland v. Postmaster General</span>, 01200342001 (2006); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Epps v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05A00627 (2002) (judge can revisit the issue of certification if, after a reasonable period of time, the class representative does not secure adequate representation); <span class="Italic">Hines v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01931776 (1994); MD-110 at 8-5. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kessinger v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080042 (2009) (no sign of effort to retain adequate representation some 16 months after conditional certification decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">In lieu of conditional certification, the administrative judge can give the class time to find a qualified representative and then issue a new decision on class certification. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ponce v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120073347 (2010), the Commission found that the class representative was not adequate despite significant federal sector experience in individual cases, but that denial of class certification was premature where the class otherwise met the criteria:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to satisfy the adequacy of representation criterion, the class representative should have no conflicts with the class and should have sufficient legal training and experience to pursue the claim. <span class="Italic">See Byrd v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900291 (May 30, 1990). This prerequisite requires that the representative will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. <span class="Italic">Clopton, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A62246 (October 12, 2006), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520070139 (January 9, 2007). It is necessary that the class representative demonstrate sufficient <span id="Page_1637"></span>ability to protect the interests of the class so that the claims of the class members do not fail for reasons other than their merits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We consider the lengthy resume of Robert M. Cook, Sr. We further consider that in addition to the instant case, Commission records show that during the pendency of the underlying complaint, The Law Offices of Robert M. Cook, represented several federal sector employees with individual complaints, some of whom are identified as class agents in the instant complaint. Among those cases, a few have proceeded through the EEO complaints process to the appellate level where appeals are currently pending or have been decided by the Office of Federal Operations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. None of these cases reached the merits of the underlying complaint and none of these cases involved class claims. We find that complainant has the burden of demonstrating that his selection of representative possesses the requisite skill and we find that he has not met that burden. We agree with the AJ that complainant has failed to show that Robert M. Cook, Sr. has sufficient federal sector EEO experience, other EEO legal experience, or class litigation experience in order to adequately represent the instant class.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, we find that denial of class certification based on inadequate representation and for no other failure, was premature and that the case should be remanded to the AJ to afford complainant an opportunity to secure adequate representation for the class. <span class="Italic">Mohamed v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A33869 (December 16, 2004), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520050455 (February 16, 2005). After complainant has been given an opportunity to obtain representation and conduct adequate discovery, then the AJ shall issue a new decision determining whether certification of the class is appropriate pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.204.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is unlikely that the Commission will accept the complainant, a layperson, as an adequate representative in the absence of a qualified attorney to assist in representation of the class<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wirkler v. Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 01882883 (1988). But in <span class="Italic">Yovan v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01955786 (1997), the Commission upheld the decision of an administrative judge to approve a layperson as the class representative:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the AJ's finding of adequacy of representation, we note that, as a general rule, the Commission is reluctant to allow a<span class="Italic"> pro se</span> complainant to represent a class. <span class="Italic">Sonia Byrd v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900291 (May 30, 1990). However, in this case, the AJ carefully considered appellant's qualifications to serve as representative, including his commitment to secure the services of an expert witness, and has decided that appellant is able to provide adequate class representation. The Commission finds no reason to disturb this finding at this time. However, class certifications are always tentative and can be modified as the case progresses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at n.16. If later events indicate that appellant is not, in fact, able to provide adequate class representation, he can be required to hire an attorney in order to maintain this class action.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Van De Car v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01971656 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the class agent otherwise satisfies the requirements for a class action but the class does not have adequate representation, the class should be conditionally certified and the class agent should be given an opportunity to obtain adequate representation. In <span class="Italic">Hill v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A45646 (2006), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant appears to possess no interests that conflict with those of the class. However, he has not established that he has legal training and experience to pursue the class action. Complainant does have notable experience advocating for the rights of disabled veterans, but prosecuting a class action, particularly one as large and potentially complicated as this one requires a substantial amount of legal experience and training. <span class="Italic">See Sedillo v. Dep't. of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A20071 (Aug. 7, 2002) (noting that "the Commission has previously held on numerous occasions that a lack of experience in class action litigation can be fatal to meeting the adequacy of representation requirement for class certification."). Furthermore, complainant has yet to offer the name of a qualified class representative, i.e. a representative experienced in the prosecution of class actions. Thus, complainant has not satisfied the factors which are used to determine the competence of the class representative, namely, experience in handling class complaints, professional competence, and the possession of adequate resources to pursue the class complaint. S<span class="Italic">ee Hight v. Dep't. of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942377 (Feb. 13, 1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Shreveport Garment Co.,</span> 422 F. Supp. 526, 534-41 W.D. La. 1976), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 577 F.2d 1132 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, complainant correctly pointed out that where a class agent has satisfied the commonality, typicality and numerosity requirements, but not the adequacy of representation requirement, the class may be conditionally certified to give the class agent time to obtain qualified counsel. EEOC Management Directive 110 (EEO MD-110), Chapter 8, Section IV(A) (November 9, 1999). Complainant has indicated in his statement on appeal that he is willing to obtain an attorney or some other qualified representative to handle this class complaint. Therefore, based on our determination herein that complainant established the elements of commonality, typicality, and numerosity, we reverse the dismissal and remand, with instructions to the agency to forward the case to the Atlanta District Office, where the AJ should conditionally certify the class for a reasonable period of time so that complainant, as class agent, may secure adequate representation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A class representative who has no previous experience with either Title VII or class action litigation cannot adequately protect the interests of the class. As noted by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01830646 (1983), quoting <span class="Italic">Miller v. U.S.</span>, 24 FEP 696, 697 (D.D.C. 1980):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The adequacy of representation requirements mandates that "the party's attorney be qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.</span>, 471 F.2d 1125, 2 FEP Cases 231, 233 (5th Cir. 1969).... Moreover, attorneys in class actions are held to higher standards of competence and diligence than counsel in other lawsuits because class action counsel represent not only the named clients but also all of the other members of the class, named and unnamed.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, if the administrative judge finds that the class otherwise satisfies the prerequisites for a class action but that adequate representation does not exist, one option is to order the complainants' counsel to associate with counsel with more class action experience. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Social Security Administration</span>, 07A50060 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">Experience gained as a government litigator of federal sector EEO complaints can qualify a representative as adequate for purposes of representing the class. In <span class="Italic">Clopton v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0520070139.txt">01A62246</a> (2006), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 0520070139 (2007), the Commission reversed the order of the administrative judge denying certification due to failure to satisfy the adequacy of representation criterion for a former government attorney. In finding the representative satisfied the criterion, the Commission also rejected the agency's argument that the representative was a poor performer with the agency, noting his termination was being challenged on based on reprisal. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Clopton</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, although the class agent's attorney has filed individual EEO complaints against the agency, there does not appear to be a conflict of interest with the claims of the putative class. Moreover, the record confirms that the attorney, while employed by the agency, acquired many years of experience with complex federal sector litigation, involving large dollar amounts and multiple parties. The agency characterizes complainant's performance as poor, and cites it as the reason for his termination. However, the Commission is not persuaded by the agency's contention that complainant lacks competence as a litigator for this reason. Specifically, we find that the record reflects that his termination for alleged poor performance is challenged as retaliatory, and the subject of current litigation. Moreover, the record also reflects that the attorney received many awards and "Outstanding" evaluations while employed by the agency, which belies the agency's claim that he is an incompetent litigator. Likewise, we find that the statement procured by the agency from the affiant at the Department of Justice must be viewed as given by an official who complainant named in an EEO complaint. Similarly, we are unpersuaded by the agency's argument that the attorney's EEO experience in representing himself in EEO complaints should be disregarded. Self-representation requires the same level of knowledge of the law and the complaint process as does the representation of a client. Therefore, we find that the class agent's attorney has demonstrated that he has adequate experience and competence as a litigator, and adequate knowledge and experience of the EEO law and complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, while the class agent's attorney has not been able to demonstrate that he has experience representing a class of complainants in an EEO class action complaint, we find that he successfully represented the instant class when the agency challenged the Commission's decision to provisionally certify the class. <span class="Italic">Clopton, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A50178 (March 17, 2005). Moreover, we note that the attorney attests that as of May 2006, he has been retained as counsel on a billion dollar private sector class complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that because the class agent's attorney demonstrates experience in conducting complex federal sector litigation, knowledge and experience of EEO complaint process, and has limited, but relevant and successful, experience with EEO class action complaints, as evidenced by his successful representation of the instant class in the above referenced request for reconsideration, we find that the adequacy of representation requirement is satisfied, hi reaching this conclusion, we also take into account the high level of legal advocacy reflected in the attorney's submissions to the Commission on appeal, and the fact that he has once again successfully represented the class before the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">The experience of the attorney need not be in class action employment discrimination cases, however, for him to be considered adequate to represent the class. In <span class="Italic">Ables et al. v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984749 (2000), the agency expressed concern over adequacy of representation, citing shortcomings in the class complaint filed by the class's attorney. The Commission remanded <span id="Page_1638"></span>the case for a determination on adequacy of representation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ables</span> noted, however, the attorney's experience in litigating individual employment cases, and large class action suits in non-employment related matters:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission observes that the Ables complaint's counsel has had experience in individual EEO cases and has litigated multiple nationwide class action cases in non-EEO matters. The Commission also observes that, unlike class litigation in Federal District Court, counsel has not had the opportunity for discovery and, thus, lacked necessary class complaint information. On remand, counsel will have the opportunity to discover the needed information, to redraft the Ables class complaint, and to provide an affidavit on the conflict of interest issue. The Administrative Judge will then be in a better position address the agency's concerns regarding adequacy of representation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A decision to decertify a class based on inadequate representation does not act to the detriment of the individual class members when the agency permits them to proceed with individual complaints. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Carton v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01975226 (1998), the Commission held that it is not a <span class="Italic">per se</span> conflict of interest for a class attorney to represent the complainants in more than one class action before the same agency. The Commission noted that if a conflict developed, the class could be required to seek new representation at that time.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to the qualifications of the attorney or attorneys representing the class, adequacy of representation requires that the class agent's interest not conflict with the remainder of the class. The mere fact that a class agent files an individual complaint in court does not automatically disqualify the agent in the administrative class action. The act of filing an individual complaint does not, standing alone, make the agent's interest antagonistic to that of the class. Moreover, even assuming the agent should be disqualified, it does not stand to reason that the class complaint should be dismissed. In <span class="Italic">Welch v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05901079 (1990), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts have held that when a named representative is found to be inadequate during the course of a class action, the appropriate step is the appointment of a new representative from the existing class. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Stephen Austin University</span>, 706 F.2d 608 (5th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Green v. U.S.X. Corp.</span>, 46 FEP Cases 720, 737 (3d Cir. 1988). In the instant case, it is questionable whether appellant became inadequate to represent the class by the mere filing of her individual civil complaint. In any event, the Commission finds that despite any disabilities the appellant may have acquired as a result of the filing of her individual complaint, the other members of the class retained claims that were entirely separate from appellant's which were deserving of further processing. Therefore, the agency should not have canceled the class complaint that served as a conduit for those claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this respect, we note that the specific factual claims made by appellant in her civil action were essentially the same as those raised in the class complaint. Therefore, the filing of appellant's civil action did not make her atypical of the other class members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Commission finds that 29 CFR 1613.604(i) does not mandate the cancellation of a class complaint based on the individual actions of the class agent. To construe 1613.604(i) in such a manner would make it inconsistent with judicial and previous Commission decisions aimed at preserving class certification, irrespective of any disability of the class agent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Washington</span>; <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Reading the EEOC Regulations dealing with the processing of class complaints as a whole, we find that 1613.604(i) allows for the cancellation of class complaints only in instances when the class agent files a civil action based on the same allegations on behalf of the class. If the class agent files a civil action in her individual capacity, the class complaint should survive such action and the agency should continue to process it. (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;There is no showing in this case that by filing her individual claim, appellant's interest became antagonistic to the interest of other class members, thus, disqualifying her as an agent for the class. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chisolm v. United States Postal Service</span>, 665 F.2d 482, 492-3 (4th Cir. 1981). In <span class="Italic">Patricia Washington v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890052 (May 19, 1989), the Commission found that a class agent who had accepted individual relief for the claims she raised in the class complaint, prior to its resolution, was not disqualified from further acting as class agent.</p>
<p class="noindent">An affirmative obligation has been placed on agencies to demonstrate that the class representative's interests conflict with those of the remaining class. Even when the agency meets that burden, it must allow for the substitution of a new representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Tarrats v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span>, 01960433 (1998), the Commission found that a class agent's interests do not conflict with those of the class simply because he also has filed a complaint, alleging different bases of discrimination, over some of the same matters involved in the class complaint. The fact that the agent filed a complaint does not necessarily make the representative's interests "antagonistic" to those of the class. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Tarrats</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the AJ's dismissal of Appellant Rivera as class agent, the Commission notes that Appellant Rivera has not raised his sex and age claims in the class complaint. Rather, on June 24, 1995, he filed an individual complaint alleging national origin, sex and age discrimination with regard to some of the same incidents as those raised in the class complaint. The Commission concludes that the mere existence of this individual complaint, without more, does not establish that Appellant Rivera's interests are antagonistic to those of the class. Rather, his individual complaint can be bifurcated, with his national origin claim <span id="Page_1639"></span>being subsumed within the class complaint, and his age and sex claims processed as an individual complaint. The Commission notes that it has previously adopted the holding of several courts that an individual award of relief to a class representative, prior to the disposition of a class complaint, does not disqualify the class representative as long as his/her interest does not become antagonistic to the interest of the other class members<span class="Italic">. See Washington v. United States Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Request No. 05890052 (May 12, 1989)<span class="Italic">. See also, Chisholm v. United States Postal Service</span>, 665 F.2d 482, 492-93 (4th Cir. 1981) (the court noted that an employee who was awarded a promotion and front pay did not become disqualified from representing the class where there was no evidence to show that his interest became antagonistic to the interest of other class members); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. United Gas Co.</span>, 400 F.2d 28 (5th Cir. 1968) (acceptance by class representative of promotion subsequent to the filing of a class complaint does not render the suit moot as to the representative individually or to the class he represents); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Jim Dandy Co.</span>, 638 F.2d 1330 (5th Cir. 1981) (it is inappropriate for the Court to dismiss a class claim simply because an individual claim by the class representative was previously adjudicated). Moreover, the fact that Appellant Tarrats is also serving as co-agent should further safeguard the interests of the class.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Tarrats</span> also upheld the use of the complainants as the class representatives because both named complainants were attorneys, and they could be required to obtain other legal representation later in the proceedings if their representation proved inadequate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to be a proper class agent, the individual or individuals initiating the complaint must be aggrieved in the same manner as the prospective class members. <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 05900861 (1990). The agency errs when it bifurcates the class complaint from the agent's complaint. The allegation that the individual agent is aggrieved and allegations of class-wide discrimination does not constitute separate complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of adequacy of representation, with respect to the class agent's interests in the case, is closely related to the issue of typicality. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bowen</span> found that the class agent did not adequately represent the class because there were potential conflicts of interest between the class agent as a Caucasian, and the minorities he sought to represent. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Crazythunder v. Secretary of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 01986510 (2000), the Commission found that the class agent, a Native American, could not represent non-Native-American women without creating a conflict of interest. The Commission noted that one of the class agent's claims involved the agency's failure to adequately implement the Indian Preference Act, and some of the potential class members indicated that the Indian Preference Act hindered their promotional opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Van De Car</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the putative class agents were three complainants who had previously prevailed on individual consolidated complaints over the same policy at issue in the class complaint, and had been granted relief for their individual claims. Because the agency had never acted upon the complainants' request that the complaint be processed as a class action, the administrative judge did not order class relief, but did order relief for the three complainants. The Commission provisionally certified the class, but "left open" for the administrative judge to consider whether the complainants adequately represent the interests of the class, given that they had already been granted relief.</p>
