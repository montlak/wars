<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-19"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Bostock v. Clayton</span></span>: Recognizing Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Under Title VII</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since <span class="Italic">Macy</span>, <span class="Italic">Day,</span> and <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, the Commission has litigated these issues through the courts in private sector cases to the Supreme Court. And on October 8, 2019, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on three LGBTQ related cases: <span class="Italic">Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc</span>., 883 F.3d 100 (2nd Cir. 2018) (sexual orientation); <span class="Italic">Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia</span>, No. 17-13801 (11th Cir. 2018) (sexual orientation); and <span class="Italic">EEOC v. R.G. &#x0026; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc</span>., 884 F.3d 560 (6th Cir. 2018) (sexual identification). In a six to three decision, the Supreme Court simply, but definitively held that "[a]n employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender violates Title VII." <span class="Italic">Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia</span>, 590 US ___, Nos. 17-1618, 17-1623, 18-107 (June 2020). <span class="Italic">Bostock</span> involved a child welfare advocate who, after a decade of work for the county, was fired when he began participating in a gay recreational softball league. The charge for termination was "conduct 'unbecoming' a county employee." Zarda, a skydiving instructor, was terminated after a female client alleged that he touched her inappropriately and excused the touch by disclosing that he was gay. Aimee Stephens worked at R.G. &#x0026; G. R. Harris Funeral Homes presenting as a man for six years. After writing a letter to her employer explaining that she planned to "live and work full-time as a woman," <span id="Page_982"></span>she was fired from the funeral home. The majority opinion is lengthy, but definitive. It begins:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sometimes small gestures can have unexpected consequences. Major initiatives practically guarantee them. In our time, few pieces of federal legislation rank in significance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There, in Title VII, Congress outlawed discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Today, we must decide whether an employer can fire someone simply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer is clear. An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result. Likely, they weren't thinking about many of the Act's consequences that have become apparent over the years, including its prohibition against discrimination on the basis of motherhood or its ban on the sexual harassment of male employees. But the limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it's no contest. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The majority in <span class="Italic">Bostock</span> then set out to determine whether the "ordinary public meaning" of the statutorily protected basis of "sex" could fairly be said to include sexual orientation and transgender status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e orient ourselves to the time of the statute's adoption, here 1964, and begin by examining the key statutory terms in turn before assessing their impact on the cases at hand and then confirming our work against this Court's precedents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only statutorily protected characteristic at issue in today's cases is "sex"--and that is also the primary term in Title VII whose meaning the parties dispute. Appealing to roughly contemporaneous dictionaries, the employers say that, as used here, the term "sex" in 1964 referred to "status as either male or female [as] determined by reproductive biology." The employees counter by submitting that, even in 1964, the term bore a broader scope, capturing more than anatomy and reaching at least some norms concerning gender identity and sexual orientation. But because nothing in our approach to these cases turns on the outcome of the parties' debate, and because the employees concede the point for argument's sake, we proceed on the assumption that "sex" signified what the employers suggest, referring only to biological distinctions between male and female.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Still, that's just a starting point. The question isn't just what "sex" meant, but what Title VII says about it. Most notably, the statute prohibits employers from taking certain actions "because of" sex. And, as this Court has previously explained, "the ordinary meaning of 'because of ' is 'by reason of ' or 'on account of.'" <span class="Italic">University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</span>, 570 U.S. 338, 350 (2013) (citing <span class="Italic">Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc</span>., 557 U.S. 167, 176 (2009); quotation altered). In the language of law, this means that Title VII's "because of" test incorporates the "'simple'" and "traditional" standard of but-for causation. <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, 570 U.S., at 346, 360. That form of causation is established whenever a particular outcome would not have happened "but for" the purported cause. <span class="Italic">See Gross</span>, 557 U.S., at 176. In other words, a but-for test directs us to change one thing at a time and see if the outcome changes. If it does, we have found a but-for cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This can be a sweeping standard. Often, events have multiple but-for causes. So, for example, if a car accident occurred both because the defendant ran a red light and because the plaintiff failed to signal his turn at the intersection, we might call each a but-for cause of the collision. <span class="Italic">Cf. Burrage v. United States</span>, 571 U.S. 204, 211-212 (2014). When it comes to Title VII, the adoption of the traditional but-for causation standard means a defendant cannot avoid liability just by citing some other factor that contributed to its challenged employment decision. So long as the plaintiff 's sex was one but-for cause of that decision, that is enough to trigger the law. <span class="Italic">See ibid</span>.; <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, 570 U.S., at 350.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Employers may not "fail or refuse to hire or...discharge any individual, or otherwise...discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's...sex." &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). And the meaning of "individual" was as uncontroversial in 1964 as it is today: "A particular being as distinguished from a class, species, or collection." Webster's New International Dictionary, at 1267. Here, again, Congress could have written the law differently. It might have said that "it shall be an unlawful employment practice to prefer one sex to the other in hiring, firing, or the terms or conditions of employment." It might have said that there should be no "sex discrimination," perhaps implying a focus on differential treatment between the two sexes as groups. More narrowly still, it could have forbidden only "sexist policies" against women as a class. But, once again, that is not the law we have.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The consequences of the law's focus on individuals rather than groups are anything but academic. Suppose an employer fires a woman for refusing his sexual advances. It's no defense for the employer to note that, while he treated that individual woman worse than he would have treated a man, he gives preferential treatment to female employees overall. The employer is liable for treating this woman worse in part because of her sex. Nor is it a defense for an employer to say it discriminates against both men and women because of sex. This statute works to protect individuals of both sexes from discrimination, and does so equally. So an employer who fires a woman, Hannah, because she is insufficiently feminine and also fires a man, Bob, for being insufficiently masculine may treat men and women as groups more or less equally. But in both cases the employer fires an individual in part because of sex. Instead of avoiding Title VII exposure, this employer doubles it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From the ordinary public meaning of the statute's language at the time of the law's adoption, a straightforward rule emerges: An employer violates Title VII when it intentionally fires an individual employee based in part on sex. It doesn't matter if other factors besides the plaintiff 's sex contributed to the decision. And it doesn't matter if the employer treated women as a group the same when compared to men as a group. If the employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee's sex when deciding to discharge the employee--put differently, if changing the employee's sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer--a statutory violation has occurred. Title VII's message is "simple but momentous": An individual employee's sex is "not relevant to the selection, evaluation, or compensation of employees." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 239 (1989) (plurality opinion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute's message for our cases is equally simple and momentous: An individual's homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions. That's because it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer's mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer intentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee's sex, and the affected employee's sex is a but-for cause of his discharge. Or take an employer who fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth. Again, the individual employee's sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That distinguishes these cases from countless others where Title VII has nothing to say. Take an employer who fires a female employee for tardiness or incompetence or simply supporting the wrong sports team. Assuming the employer would not have tolerated the same trait in a man, Title VII stands silent. But unlike any of these other traits or actions, homosexuality and transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex. Not because homosexuality or transgender status are related to sex in some vague sense or because discrimination on these bases has some disparate impact on one sex or another, but because to discriminate on these grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex. Nor does it matter that, when an employer treats one employee worse because of that individual's sex, other factors may contribute to the decision. Consider an employer with a policy of firing any woman he discovers to be a Yankees fan. Carrying out that rule because an employee is a woman and a fan of the Yankees is a firing "because of sex" if the employer would have tolerated the same allegiance in a male employee. Likewise here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employer fires an employee because she is homosexual or transgender, two causal factors may be in play--both the individual's sex and something else (the sex to which the individual is attracted or with which the individual identifies). But Title VII doesn't care. If an employer would not have discharged an employee but for that individual's sex, the statute's causation standard is met, and liability may attach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reframing the additional causes in today's cases as additional intentions can do no more to insulate the employers from liability. Intentionally burning down a neighbor's house is arson, even if the perpetrator's ultimate intention (or motivation) is only to improve the view. No less, intentional discrimination based on sex violates Title VII, even if it is intended only as a means to achieving the employer's ultimate goal of discriminating against homosexual or transgender employees. There is simply no escaping the role intent plays here: Just as sex is necessarily <span id="Page_983"></span>a but-for cause when an employer discriminates against homosexual or transgender employees, an employer who discriminates on these grounds inescapably intends to rely on sex in its decisionmaking. Imagine an employer who has a policy of firing any employee known to be homosexual. The employer hosts an office holiday party and invites employees to bring their spouses. A model employee arrives and introduces a manager to Susan, the employee's wife. Will that employee be fired? If the policy works as the employer intends, the answer depends entirely on whether the model employee is a man or a woman. To be sure, that employer's ultimate goal might be to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. But to achieve that purpose the employer must, along the way, intentionally treat an employee worse based in part on that individual's sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer musters no better a defense by responding that it is equally happy to fire male and female employees who are homosexual or transgender. Title VII liability is not limited to employers who, through the sum of all of their employment actions, treat the class of men differently than the class of women. Instead, the law makes each instance of discriminating against an individual employee because of that individual's sex an independent violation of Title VII. So just as an employer who fires both Hannah and Bob for failing to fulfill traditional sex stereotypes doubles rather than eliminates Title VII liability, an employer who fires both Hannah and Bob for being gay or transgender does the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At bottom, these cases involve no more than the straightforward application of legal terms with plain and settled meanings. For an employer to discriminate against employees for being homosexual or transgender, the employer must intentionally discriminate against individual men and women in part because of sex. That has always been prohibited by Title VII's plain terms--and that "should be the end of the analysis." 883 F. 3d, at 135 (Cabranes, J., concurring in judgment).</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Bostock</span> Court went on the support its conclusions with legal precedence such as <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp</span>., 400 U.S. 542 (1971), where the Court held "that an employer discriminates intentionally against an individual only in part because of sex supplies no defense to Title VII," <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702 (1978), where it found an employer's policy requiring women to make larger pension fund contributions than men because women tended to live longer violated Title VII, and <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</span> 523 U.S. 75 (1998), where the Court recognized same-sex harassment as violative of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next, the Court addressed the employer's reasons advanced as to why discrimination on the basis of homosexuality or transgender status doesn't involve discrimination because of sex. The employer's noted that if asked why they were terminated their former employees would answer "because there were gay or transgender, not because of sex" and argued that this "conversational answer" should "guide [the Court's] thinking and suffice to defeat any suggestion the employees now before us were fired because of sex." Rejecting this argument, the Court wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But this submission rests on a mistaken understanding of what kind of cause the law is looking for in a Title VII case. In conversation, a speaker is likely to focus on what seems most relevant or informative to the listener. So an employee who has just been fired is likely to identify the primary or most direct cause rather than list literally every but-for cause. To do otherwise would be tiring at best. But these conversational conventions do not control Title VII's legal analysis, which asks simply whether sex was a but-for cause.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employers then argued that discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status is not intentional sex-based discrimination. The Court disagreed noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer that announces it will not employ anyone who is homosexual, for example, intends to penalize male employees for being attracted to men and female employees for being attracted to women.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Suppose an employer asked homosexual or transgender applicants to tick a box on its application form. The employer then had someone else redact any information that could be used to discern sex. The resulting applications would disclose which individuals are homosexual or transgender without revealing whether they also happen to be men or women. Doesn't that possibility indicate that the employer's discrimination against homosexual or transgender persons cannot be sex discrimination?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No, it doesn't. Even in this example, the individual applicant's sex still weighs as a factor in the employer's decision. Change the hypothetical ever so slightly and its flaws become apparent. Suppose an employer's application form offered a single box to check if the applicant is either black or Catholic. If the employer refuses to hire anyone who checks that box, would we conclude the employer has complied with Title VII, so long as it studiously avoids learning any particular applicant's race or religion? Of course not: By intentionally setting out a rule that makes hiring turn on race or religion, the employer violates the law, whatever he might know or not know about individual applicants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same holds here. There is no way for an applicant to decide whether to check the homosexual or transgender box without considering sex. To see why, imagine an applicant doesn't know what the words homosexual or transgender mean. Then try writing out instructions for who should check the box without using the words man, woman, or sex (or some synonym). It can't be done. Likewise, there is no way an employer can discriminate against those who check the homosexual or transgender box without discriminating in part because of an applicant's sex. By discriminating against homosexuals, the employer intentionally penalizes men for being attracted to men and women for being attracted to women. By discriminating against transgender persons, the employer unavoidably discriminates against persons with one sex identified at birth and another today. Any way you slice it, the employer intentionally refuses to hire applicants in part because of the affected individuals' sex, even if it never learns any applicant's sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">To the employer's protests that Congress did not include sexual orientation or gender identity in Title VII, the Court replied:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that homosexuality and transgender status are distinct concepts from sex. But, as we've seen, discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex; the first cannot happen without the second. Nor is there any such thing as a "canon of donut holes," in which Congress's failure to speak directly to a specific case that falls within a more general statutory rule creates a tacit exception. Instead, when Congress chooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, courts apply the broad rule. And that is exactly how this Court has always approached Title VII. "Sexual harassment" is conceptually distinct from sex discrimination, but it can fall within Title VII's sweep. <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, 523 U.S., at 79-80. Same with "motherhood discrimination." <span class="Italic">See Phillips</span>, 400 U.S., at 544. Would the employers have us reverse those cases on the theory that Congress could have spoken to those problems more specifically? Of course not. As enacted, Title VII prohibits all forms of discrimination because of sex, however they may manifest themselves or whatever other labels might attach to them.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Alito's dissent made much of the above argument, noting that the statutory interpretation of words is limited to "mean what they conveyed to reasonable people at the time they were written." He further noted that despite recent efforts to write sexual orientation and transgender status into Title VII Congress has yet to do so. Justice Kavanaugh's separate dissent reads similarly. "Our role is not to make or amend the law. As written, Title VII does not prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation."</p>
<p class="noindent">As to Title VII drafter's intent, the majority Court wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Still, while legislative history can never defeat unambiguous statutory text, historical sources can be useful for a different purpose: Because the law's ordinary meaning at the time of enactment usually governs, we must be sensitive to the possibility a statutory term that means one thing today or in one context might have meant something else at the time of its adoption or might mean something different in another context. And we must be attuned to the possibility that a statutory phrase ordinarily bears a different meaning than the terms do when viewed individually or literally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather than suggesting that the statutory language bears some other meaning, the employers and dissents merely suggest that, because few in 1964 expected today's result, we should not dare to admit that it follows ineluctably from the statutory text. When a new application emerges that is both unexpected and important, they would seemingly have us merely point out the question, refer the subject back to Congress, and decline to enforce the plain terms of the law in the meantime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That is exactly the sort of reasoning this Court has long rejected. Admittedly, the employers take pains to couch their argument in terms of seeking to honor the statute's "expected applications" rather than vindicate its "legislative intent." But the concepts are closely related. One could easily contend that legislators only intended expected applications or that a statute's purpose is limited to achieving applications foreseen at the time of enactment. However framed, the employer's logic impermissibly seeks to displace the plain meaning of the law in favor of something lying beyond it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If anything, the employers' new framing may only add new problems. The employers assert that "no one" in 1964 or for some time after would have anticipated today's result. But is that really true? Not long after the law's passage, gay and transgender employees began filing Title VII complaints, so at least some people foresaw this potential application. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co</span>., 395 F. Supp. 1098, 1099 (ND Ga. 1975) (addressing claim from 1969); <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Arthur Andersen &#x0026; Co</span>., 566 F. 2d 659, 661 (CA9 1977) (addressing claim from 1974). And less than a decade after Title VII's passage, during debates over the Equal Rights Amendment, others counseled that its language--which was strikingly similar to Title <span id="Page_984"></span>VII's--might also protect homosexuals from discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Note, The Legality of Homosexual Marriage, 82 Yale L. J. 573, 583-584 (1973).</p>
<p class="noindent">In his dissent Justice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, called the majority's opinion "preposterous." With lots of footnotes to dictionary definitions, Alito wrote that "[e]ven as understood today, the concept of discrimination because of "sex" is different from discrimination because of "sexual orientation" or "gender identity."</p>
