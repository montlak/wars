<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-34"><span class="space">3.</span> Disparate Treatment</h4>
<p class="noindent">Mere inconsistent treatment of both employees who are pregnant and employees with temporary disabilities will not suffice to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on pregnancy. The fact that the agency granted restricted duty assignments to other pregnant employees and to some temporarily disabled employees, and denied such assignments to complainant and other temporarily disabled employees, only indicated that the agency had no consistent policy. It did not indicate that the agency had any discriminatory motive. <span class="Italic">Herbers</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The employee must show that her pregnancy is the reason for the difference in treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a pregnant employee is entitled to be treated the same as nonpregnant employees in the terms and conditions of employment, the Act does not entitle her to quit over perceived differences and then demand her job back through the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fritsch v. USPS</span>, 01840292 (1985). When an employee is terminated because of a temporary disability due to lack of available leave, the termination violates Title VII if it has a disparate impact on one sex and is not justified by some business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1604.10(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">At 29 CFR Part 1604, Appendix, the Commission describes the purpose of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The basic principle of the Act is that women affected by pregnancy and related conditions must be treated the same as other applicants and employees on the basis of their ability or inability to work. A woman is therefore protected against such practices as being fired, or refusal of a job or promotion, merely because she is pregnant or has had an abortion. She usually cannot be forced to go on leave as long as she can still work. If other employees who take disability leave are entitled to get their jobs back when they are able to work again, so are women who have been unable to work because of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent">As further explanation, the Appendix provides the following dialogue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Q.&#x2003;If, for pregnancy-related reasons, an employee is unable to perform the functions of her job, does the employer have to provide her with an alternative job?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;An employer is required to treat an employee temporarily unable to perform the functions of her position because of her pregnancy-related condition in the same manner as it treats other temporarily disabled employees, whether by providing modified tasks, alternative assignments, disability leaves, leaves without pay, etc. For example, a woman's primary job function may be the operation of a machine, and, incidental to that function, she may carry materials to and from the machine. If other employees temporarily unable to lift are relieved of these functions, pregnant employees also unable to lift must be temporarily relieved of the function.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with all protected categories under Title VII, the basic principle is one of equal treatment. An agency is not required to provide special treatment for pregnant employees, nor may it treat them less favorably than other employees suffering from temporary disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Lakeshore Hospital</span>, 30 F.3d 1380 (11th Cir. 1994), the court found it was unnecessary for a pregnant worker to demonstrate that she was treated <span id="Page_1011"></span>differently than similarly situated nonpregnant workers who were temporarily disabled. In that case, the employer terminated the plaintiff for use of sick leave related to pregnancy even though her use did not exceed the permitted sick leave. The court found that, in the absence of specific evidence, "the only logical inference to be drawn in this case is that the Lakeshore policy customarily was followed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court found that if other employees were terminated in similar circumstances "then the burden was on Lakeshore to prove this unusual scenario." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the agency engaged in pregnancy discrimination in <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956011 (1998). The agency in <span class="Italic">Robertson</span> failed to show that it treated the complainant's pregnancy-related absences in the same manner as it treated the absences of other employees with temporary medical conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time this matter arose, appellant was serving a one-year appointment with the agency as a transitional letter carrier at the Lakewood, Ohio post office. On September 3, 1993, she was advised that she would not be reappointed to her position. Agency officials testified that appellant was not reappointed because she had a poor attendance record. The evidence establishes that, in March 1993, appellant informed agency officials that she was pregnant with twins. Appellant claims her 204-B supervisor advised her to have an abortion or she would be fired. Due to the "high risk" nature of her pregnancy, appellant had weekly medical appointments which required her absence from work, as well as other days when she was medically incapacitated from working. Appellant provided the agency with medical documentation substantiating these absences. Management witnesses testified that appellant had good attendance prior to her pregnancy, and continued to have good work performance, and would have been reappointed if she had not had the pregnancy-related absences. Appellant testified that the superintendent expressly told her she was losing her job because she was pregnant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that appellant was the only transitional employee who was not reappointed for attendance reasons. However, other transitional employees (both white and black, male and female) were not reappointed for other reasons such as poor work performance and bad driving records. Appellant asserted that another transitional employee had attendance problems due to a medical problem with her foot, but was nevertheless reappointed. Appellant claimed this supported her contention that she was not reappointed solely because she was pregnant and not because of her absences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that appellant filed a formal EEO complaint with the agency on April 21, 1994, alleging that the agency had discriminated against her as referenced above. The agency accepted the complaint and conducted an investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, appellant requested an administrative hearing before an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) administrative judge (AJ).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 3, 1995, following a hearing at which five witnesses testified, the AJ issued a recommended decision concluding that the evidence of record supported a finding that appellant had been discriminated against on the basis of her sex when she was not reappointed for a second term as a transitional employee. Specifically, the AJ found that appellant had met, her burden of establishing that the failure of the agency to reappoint her was motivated by unlawful bias because of her pregnancy in violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act clarified that the prohibition against sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 included discrimination in employment based on pregnancy, child birth or related medical conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a final decision dated July 5, 1995, the agency rejected these findings and conclusions of the AJ, and entered a finding of no discrimination. It is from this decision that appellant now appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record in its entirety, including the statements submitted on appeal, the Commission finds that, the AJ's recommended decision sets forth the relevant facts and properly analyzes the appropriate regulations, policies and laws. Nothing proffered by the agency in its final decision or on appeal differs significantly from the arguments presented at the hearing and given full consideration by the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the AJ correctly noted, appellant's complaint constitutes a claim of pregnancy-related discrimination in violation of Title VII. The basic principle of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is that women affected by pregnancy and related conditions must be treated the same as other employees on the basis of their ability or inability to work. "A woman is therefore protected against such practices as being fired...merely because she is pregnant." 29 CFR Part 1604, Appendix. In the instant matter, appellant has alleged that another transitional employee, who experienced attendance difficulties due to a foot problem, was nevertheless reappointed. At the hearing, the agency had an ample opportunity to defend itself against appellants charge of discrimination by producing evidence that it treated appellant's pregnancy-related absences in the same manner as it treated the absences of similarly situated employees with temporary medical conditions. However, it produced no such evidence The agency's silence on this issue, in combination with the direct evidence detailed in the AJ's decision of pregnancy bias, is sufficient to uphold the AJ's finding of pretext in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Disparate treatment between the complainant and males with temporary medical restrictions was key evidence in a finding of discrimination in <span class="Italic">Kiolbassa v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A44221 (2006). In that case, the complainant was a female firefighter. Upon disclosing her pregnancy, the complainant was transferred to a 40--hour per week position and deprived of 72--hour pay that firefighters received for working three 24--hour shifts three days per week. The Commission found that the agency failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its reassignment of the complainant where there was evidence that males with temporary medical restrictions were not reassigned to 40--hour per week positions and deprived of 72--hour pay. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Cardenas v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51763 (2006), the Commission found no pregnancy discrimination where there was no light--duty work available at the complainant's facility, the complainant's supervisor had contacted other facilities to see if work within the complainant's medical restrictions was available, and had previously approved light--duty assignments for three pregnant workers.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, the failure to establish disparate treatment between a pregnant applicant for employment and male applicants with temporary medical conditions was a critical factor in a finding of no discrimination in <span class="Italic">Synog v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093812 (2010). In that case, the complainant received a conditional appointment as a Mail Handler. As part of a medical assessment required of all conditional appointees, the complainant produced medical information from her physician that she was four months pregnant, doing well, but subject to a 20-pound lifting restriction, eight-hour shifts and 40-hour weeks. The agency determined she was not currently fit for duty and advised her to contact the agency after delivery. In upholding the administrative judge's finding of no discrimination in <span class="Italic">Synog</span>, the Commission observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the AJ's finding of no discrimination was proper. There is substantial evidence in the record that complainant's employment was delayed due to the agency's belief, based on restrictions imposed by complainant's own physician, that she could not currently perform the essential functions of the Mail Handler position. The Commission is not persuaded by complainant's arguments on appeal. The agency is correct in noting that complainant's cited comparators are incorrect and ineffectual. Pregnant employees are not similarly situated, in that they have started their positions while complainant had not. Further, pregnant individuals are within complainant's protected class, so the agency's preferred treatment would not show discrimination against pregnant individuals. Significantly, there is no evidence of record that males who were unable to perform the essential functions due to a temporary impairment were also not allowed to start work until their doctor said that could do so without restrictions. Finally, complainant has failed to establish that the agency's reasons were pretext for discriminatory animus. While the agency uses the term "pregnancy" in some documents, the medical assessment sent to Human Resources clearly states "moderate risk/restrictions" due to the temporary restriction of her pregnancy and her inability to lift more than 20 lbs., work more than 40 hrs./wk., and work more than 8 hrs./day. The record also shows that when the agency was informed that complainant's restrictions were lifted, she began her employment with the agency.</p>

<p class="noindent">In its <span class="Italic">PDA Enforcement Guidance</span>, Sec. IB1, the Commission gives several examples of evidence of disparate treatment based on pregnancy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence indicating disparate treatment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions includes the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An explicit policy or a statement by a decision maker or someone who influenced the challenged decision that on its face demonstrates pregnancy bias and is linked to the challenged action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Deneen v. Northwest Airlines, Inc</span>., a manager stated the plaintiff would not be rehired "because of her pregnancy complication." This statement directly proved pregnancy discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Close timing between the challenged action and the employer's knowledge of the employee's pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Asmo v. Keane, Inc</span>., a two-month period between the time the employer learned of the plaintiff's pregnancy and the time it decided to discharge her raised an inference that the plaintiff's pregnancy and discharge were causally linked.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More favorable treatment of employees of either sex who are not affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions but are similar in their ability or inability to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Methodist Hospital System</span>, the employer asserted that it discharged the plaintiff, a pregnant nurse, in part because she performed <span id="Page_1012"></span>a medical procedure without a physician's knowledge or consent. The plaintiff produced evidence that this reason was pretextual by showing that the employer merely reprimanded a non-pregnant worker for nearly identical misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence casting doubt on the credibility of the employer's explanation for the challenged action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Wittern Group</span>, the defendant asserted it fired the plaintiff not because of her pregnancy but because overstaffing required elimination of her position. The court found a reasonable jury could conclude this reason was pretextual where there was evidence that the plaintiff and her co-workers had plenty of work to do, and the plaintiff's supervisor assured her prior to her parental leave that she would not need to worry about having a job when she got back.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence that the employer violated or misapplied its own policy in undertaking the challenged action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico</span>, the court affirmed a finding of pregnancy discrimination where there was evidence that the employer did not enforce the conduct policy on which it relied to justify the discharge until the plaintiff became pregnant.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with other cases of intentional discrimination, disparate treatment is not a required proof element. A complainant can prevail by demonstrating that the reasons for the agency's action are a pretext for discrimination even in the absence of disparate treatment. A good example is provided by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of the Air Force</span>, 0520140092 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To ultimately prevail, Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation is pretextual. <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at 14; <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 519. We find that Complainant has clearly done so in the present case, and that the AJ erred in finding otherwise. In this respect, we find that the AJ did not consider Complainant's evidence that was offered to establish that the Agency's articulated reason is unworthy of belief. We note that the Supreme Court has held that the fact-finder may find pretext where he or she determines that the Agency's articulated reason is unworthy of belief. <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, at 133. In this regard, we find that Complainant has presented credible evidence to establish that the Agency's nondiscriminatory reasons are unworthy of belief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, we find that Complainant has sufficiently established that S1's explanation that she was terminated due to her adversarial behavior and her failure to safeguard sensitive information on April 19, 2006, is unworthy of belief. In finding so, we note that the record clearly reflects that S1 was aware that Complainant did not misuse the CSU program as alleged. Specifically, we note Complainant's job duties gave her access to the CSU program, and that S1 had instructed Complainant to become familiar with it. The record reflects that on April 19, 2006, the Budget Technician asked Complainant if she could view her own personnel file and Complainant complied. The Budget Technician's personnel file was blank and Complainant did not show other employees' records. Although the Budget Technician reported the matter to S1 and her co-supervisor, her concern was not that Complainant did something wrong or engaged in misconduct, but that the CSU program could easily show employees' information without typing their social security numbers. We note that the Budget Technician averred that she felt that S1 forced her to write the statement against Complainant about the matter. The Budget Technician stated that she felt "set up" and was upset because the April 19, 2006, incident was no "big deal." The Budget Technician testified:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After I talked to [S1], I didn't feel comfortable because I think they were making more out of it than it really was. And I think they took a lot of stuff out of context....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After S1 accused Complainant of wrongdoing, he disabled her government e-mail account without any form of progressive discipline or warning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As S1 says himself, he was unhappy with Complainant's use of leave, but we note that much of this leave was used for pre-natal sickness and appointments. We note that S1 stated that every time he denied her leave, Complainant went over his head to seek approval for the leave. As S1 also stated, he did not agree with management's approval of her leave requests. We note that S1's initial draft of Complainant's Termination letter referenced Complainant's use of leave. Therein, S1's wrote, "[Complainant's] excessive leave usage, while approved, reflects an unacceptable pattern of attendance."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, on Complainant's first day in her position, after telling S1 she was pregnant with her second child, S1 told her that he "knew how to fire people and had no problem doing it." We note that the Personnel System Manager averred that Complainant told him the next day about these comments. Further, the Chief of Civilian Personnel told S1 that he had no case on Complainant and advised him not to terminate her, but S1 went forward anyway. Further, although S1 disagreed, management decided to rescind the termination based on the recommendation of the Agency's labor attorney and out of concern that Complainant had filed an EEO complaint. We lastly note that the Budget Technician testified that S1 did not treat women as well as men, and a former female employee also opined that S1 had issues working with women.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that S1's dubious reasons for Complainant's termination are clearly not supported by the evidence in the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pregnancy Guidance, at I.B.1 (noting that evidence indicating disparate treatment based on pregnancy can include evidence casting doubt on the credibility of the employer's explanation for the challenged action). We note that the AJ found that S1 testified credibly based on his demeanor and consistency of statements. Normally, the Commission defers to the AJ on questions of credibility where it is based on a witness's demeanor and conduct. However, we do not defer to the AJ's credibility determination here because the objective evidence in the record described above so contradicts the testimony of S1. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO MD-110 at Ch. 9, &#x00A7; VI.B.; <span class="Italic">see also Gathers v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05890894 (Nov. 9, 1989) (noting that "deference is not automatic, and when there is sufficient evidence on record which suggests the credibility determination to be erroneous, deference will not be given."). Therefore, based on the above, we that Complainant has established that the Agency's reasons were pretext for discrimination based on sex. We find that the Agency's reasons are unsupported by the record and unworthy of belief. As such, we find that Complainant has established that she was subjected to disparate treatment based on her sex when she was terminated from her position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that even though the Commission uses the term "disparate treatment" in its final summation of its findings, nowhere in the record is there actual evidence of disparate treatment. Instead, there is ample evidence that the reasons offered by the supervisor were pretextual, combined with statements that would indicate animus against pregnant employees.</p>
