<p class="noindent">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352 (July 2, 1964) and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166 (November 21, 1991), prohibit discrimination in federal employment on the bases of race, color, sex, religion, and national origin. Restated, to qualify as discrimination actions must be based on one of those protected statuses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. City of Killeen</span>, 654 F.2d 1181, 1186 (5th Cir. 1981) ("Title VII is not a shield against harsh treatment at the workplace; it protects only in instances of harshness disparately distributed. The essence of the action is, of course discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Tyree B. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2020002800 (2021) (though the complained of conduct may have been "unprofessional, boorish" and offensive, the complainant presented no evidence that it was based on the complainant's sex or disability; "the discrimination statutes prohibit only harassing behavior that is directed at an employee because of his or her protected basis (in this case, Complainant's sex). Here, the preponderance of the evidence does not establish that S1, even assuming the allegations are true, was motivated by Complainant's sex."); <span class="Italic">Bouche v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 01990799 (2002) (statutes under the Commission's jurisdiction do not protect an employee against adverse treatment due simply to a supervisor's personality quirks or autocratic attitude). Still, agencies are well advised to carefully examine all inappropriate behavior, regardless of motivation, to ensure that it does not escalate into actionable discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tyree B. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2020002800 (2021) ("While concluding that Complainant has not proven S1's actions occurred because of his sex, disability or retaliatory animus, we caution the Agency to more closely examine S1's conduct in general. If he is, in fact, engaging in a pattern of using offensive language, the Agency has a duty to take proactive steps to prevent S1, as a supervisor, from engaging in escalating offensive behavior such that it eventually creates a hostile work environment for his employees.").</p>
<p class="noindent">General mistreatment or even favoritism, if not based on a protected status, is not actionable under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jaleesa P. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020003940 (2021) (finding an established culture of favoritism, without more, does not violate Title VII; "It is well established that favoritism, although unfair, does not necessarily establish a violation of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment." <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940284 (Mar. 3, 1995), <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>. <span class="Italic">Riley G. v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120182738, (Oct. 4, 2019) (complainant's argument that another employee received favorable treatment by the supervisor because that employee "is extremely liked by [Supervisor] and she chooses not to discipline him for his many latenesses" alleged favoritism, and did constitute evidence that complainant received less favorable treatment because of his protected classes). <span class="Italic">Markey v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081150 (Jul. 22, 2009) (reporting and voicing opposition to favoritism in decision-making by supervisors and management, is not protected under the EEO statutes).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, equal opportunity harassers/discriminators do not violate Title VII. For instance, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Reita M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021004866 (2022), noted that the alleged harasser mistreated both women and men:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, even accepting Complainant's version of events as true with regard to CW's bullying, we find that she has failed to prove the third element necessary to establish a hostile work environment claim, because she has not sufficiently proven a link between CW's unwelcome conduct and her protected bases. While we acknowledge that CW's behavior, if accurately described by Complainant (including the incident in claim 2), would create a hostile work environment, there is nothing in the content of what Complainant alleges CW did or said that indicates his conduct was race, sex, or age based. We note that among the complained of incidents, Complainant alleges CW called her a "bitch." However, Complainant stated in the record that a former male employee was also called a "bitch" by CW, so there is no indication in the instant matter that CW's verbal abuse was sex-based or that he used the word frequently, as Complainant does not specify the number of times CW called her a "bitch." Her hostile work environment claim must therefore fail.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 1964 Act did not, at the outset, apply to the federal government. In 1972, the Act was amended by Pub. L. No. 92-261 marking the first time that discrimination on the bases of race, color, sex, religion, and national origin in the federal government was prohibited by statute. Prior to that time, Executive Order 11478 prohibited discrimination in federal employment. Responsibility for enforcement was delegated to the now-defunct Civil Service Commission. The 1972 amendment, codified at 42 USC 2000e-16(a), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;All personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment (except with regard to aliens employed outside the limits of the United States) in military departments as defined in section 102 of Title 5, in executive departments as defined in section 105 of Title 5 (including employees and applicants for employment who are paid from nonappropriated funds), in the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission, in those units of the Government of the District of Columbia having positions in the competitive service, and in those units of the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government having positions in the competitive service, and in the Library of Congress shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1979, with the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act, the EEOC was given enforcement responsibility along with the authority to adopt the necessary rules and regulations for administration of the Act, as well as to provide the appropriate remedies for violations. The EEOC borrowed liberally from both the CSC and its own private sector cases while putting its own imprint on federal sector discrimination law.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Title VII bases of discrimination are status-related; that is, no conduct or action by an individual is required to be a member of a protected category. We are born with the attributes of race, color, sex, and national origin. Religion may seem out of place, since a conscious decision can be made about one's religion. However, religion has always held a preferred place in our history as evidenced by the First Amendment. Moreover, the proscription against religious discrimination protects the mere status of one's religious heritage as well as the active practice of or adherence to religious beliefs. Its inclusion is, therefore, consistent with the other protected categories. Religion does differ from the other protected categories under Title VII in that an agency has an affirmative obligation to accommodate the religious practices of an employee if the accommodation would not place an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is not confined to demonstrating that an agency action was based solely on a particular prohibited ground under Title VII. The complainant may, in effect, combine a Title VII basis with one outside of Title VII and demonstrate that, as a person who possesses more than one protected characteristic, she has been the victim of discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">McCrary v. USPS</span>, 01830695 (1983), the Commission held that when the employee alleges she was nonselected due to age and sex, it is not a defense for the agency that a younger female was selected. The younger female is not in the same protected category. In the alternative, a complainant may allege more than one independent basis of discrimination. For example, an appellant may allege discrimination on the basis of race or sex. When a complainant raises more than one independent basis of discrimination, he bears the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> burden of proof with respect to each basis. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01842812 (1986). Of course, the complainant is entitled to a remedy if he prevails on either basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant can also combine Title VII categories and allege discrimination on the basis of the newly created subclass. The complainant must clearly make that allegation. However, in <span class="Italic">Booker v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01940894 (1994), the Commission held that a complainant cannot allege he was discriminated against on the basis of race and then attempt to establish that he was discriminated against because he is a black male:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant further asserts that he, as a black male, was treated differently than the selectee, a black female. Several courts have held that a plaintiff may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination against a specific subclass, such as "black males." In <span class="Italic">Jefferies v. Harris County Community Action Assoc.</span>, 615 F.2d 1025 (5th Cir. 1980), the court held that the plaintiff, a black female, would be permitted to pursue her claim of discrimination even though the evidence did not support her claim that the employer discriminated against either women or blacks. The court stated that where a "Title VII plaintiff alleges that an employer discriminates against black females, the fact that black males and white females are not subject to discrimination is irrelevant and must not form any part of the basis for a finding that the employer did not discriminate against the black female plaintiff." <span class="Italic">Accord Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co.</span>, 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">but</span> <span class="Italic">see Floyd v. New Jersey</span>, 56 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1833, 1836 (D.N.J. 1991) (court rejects separate protection for subclass of "black males," stating that "there is no protection afforded combinations of classes under the [fair employment] statutes or in prior case law"). In both <span class="Italic">Jefferies</span> and <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the plaintiffs alleged discrimination on the bases of race and sex. In this case, however, appellant asserted that the agency discriminated against him only on the basis of race. For this reason, we find that he failed properly to allege discrimination against him as a "black male."</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC refers to this as "intersectional discrimination." In the <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Race &#x0026; Color Discrimination," at pp. 29-30, the Commission explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Intersectional discrimination is discrimination based on a combination of two or more prohibited bases. In intersectional cases, the discrimination adversely affects individuals who are members of two or more protected categories precisely because they belong to the two categories (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, race and gender, color and gender, color and disability, race and age, gender <span id="Page_968"></span>and age, <span class="Italic">etc</span>.). The discrimination is premised on the combination of protected characteristics rather than any one of them alone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Take the example of a race and gender claim brought by an Asian-American woman. The woman alleges that she was not hired for a sales position. The claim is not defeated by showing that the employer does not discriminate against women and/or Asian-Americans generally. Rather, the question is whether the employer discriminates against those who are both female and Asian-American. Using the example, the Asian-American woman may have been subjected to stereotypes and targeted for discrimination not because she's a woman or Asian-American, but rather, because she's an Asian-American woman who was perceived as too meek for the sales position. Intersectional discrimination often arises out of stereotyping specific to particular intersected groups, such as women of color, African-American men and racial minorities with disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is important to keep in mind that intersectional discrimination is different from discrimination based on multiple prohibited factors. Multiple discrimination involves the allegation of independent claims of discrimination on each of two or more prohibited bases. For example, an employer may have a promotion policy which disproportionately excludes both women (of all races) and African-Americans. In such a scenario, an African-American woman could bring multiple claims of discrimination alleging both race and gender discrimination independently. This differs from the intersectional discrimination claim where the individual asserts a single claim that the employer has taken some adverse action based on the combination of prohibited characteristics.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant does allege a combined bases of discrimination, it is error to analyze the case under each prohibited basis independently. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Wade v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120070491 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the AJ's decision improperly addressed complainant's sex and race claims separately. We have recognized that when a complainant claims race and sex bias, it is necessary to determine whether the agency discriminated based on the combination of factors, not just whether it discriminated against persons of the same sex or the same race. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Nat'l Aeronautical Space Admin.,</span> Request No. 05950292 (January 20, 1996) (<span class="Italic">citing Lam v. Univ. of Hawaii,</span> 40 F.3d 1551 (9th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Jeffries v. Harris Cty. Comm. Act. Ass'n.,</span> 615 F.2d 1025 (5th Cir. 1980) (discrimination can exist against a Black female even if it does not exist against Black males or White females). The Commission finds that complainant has argued, in essence, a case of "sex plus" discrimination; that is, the agency treated complainant, an African-American female, less favorably that it treated Caucasian females and all males.</p>
<p class="noindent">For the most part, the analyses and burdens of proof discussed in <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 10</a> do not vary depending on the basis of discrimination alleged. The gravamen of a complaint under Title VII is that there is a linkage between a personnel action, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment and race, color, sex, national origin, or religion. There are some exceptions to the general rule that the analyses and burdens of proof do not vary depending on the bases of discrimination alleged. For example, as discussed below, cases of discrimination based on religion can involve issues of reasonable accommodation that are not addressed under either the intentional discrimination or adverse impact analysis. In addition, cases of discrimination that allege harassment or hostile environment, also discussed below, are subject to an entirely different analysis and, particularly in complaints alleging sexual harassment, there are special considerations. In the following sections on race, color, sex, and national origin discrimination, the emphasis is on the special considerations that are entailed in those cases. For a discussion of the analyses and burdens of proof that are applicable across-the-board to those cases, the reader is referred to Chapters <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec10-1">10</a>-<a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">12</a>.</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec13-2"><span class="space">I.</span> RACE AND COLOR DISCRIMINATION</h2>
<p class="noindent">The very mention of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in general, or Title VII, in particular, conjures images of the black civil rights movement. It seems somewhat surprising, then, that the Commission published regulatory guidance on discrimination based on sex, national origin, and religion under Title VII, but no such guidance on discrimination based on race or color. It has, however, dedicated a volume of its <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span> to "Race &#x0026; Color Discrimination," though the volume is slender in comparison to its companions on other bases of discrimination. Perhaps it is because the early development of case law under Title VII largely involved cases with underlying allegations of race and/or color discrimination, so the Commission feels such guidance is not necessary. Or perhaps it is because there are virtually no reasonable distinctions that can be drawn on the basis of race or color that would occasion special consideration in the Title VII context. For example, there are limited circumstances in which an employer can advance sex as a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational requirement, discussed below. But it is difficult to envision advancing a comparable requirement on the basis of race or color. Whatever the reason, the Commission has not chosen to publish guidance on discrimination based on race or color.</p>
<p class="noindent">What follows is a discussion of those areas where questions may arise in handling discrimination cases based on race or color. Other than the specific items mentioned below, cases of race or color discrimination based on intentional discrimination should be analyzed following the guidance of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), and its progeny, and cases involving disparate impact should be analyzed along the lines of the cases discussed in that section. See Chapters <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec10-1">10</a> and <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec11-1">11</a>.</p>
