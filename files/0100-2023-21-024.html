<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-23"><span class="space">A.</span> NATURE OF CONDUCT--PROTECTED BASIS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Sexual harassment is a label. As such, it often is misleading. The principle that must be kept in mind in dealing with sexual harassment cases is that Title VII does not deal with sexual conduct. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on a person's gender. Sexual harassment is merely a subcategory of sex discrimination. Sexual harassment is illegal not because of the sexual nature of the conduct; it is illegal because it constitutes discrimination because of a person's gender. It is, however, the sexual nature of the conduct that distinguishes sexual harassment from gender-based harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">From a legal perspective, there is no difference between gender-based harassment and sexual harassment. The difference is purely factual in that the latter involves conduct that is sexual in nature. The burdens of proof, the standards by which the conduct is judged, and the remedies are the same whether the harassment is gender-based, sexual, or a combination of the two. For societal purposes, however, the label continues to be useful mainly because it defines a type of conduct that invades the most personal of spheres. When a supervisor refers to a female subordinate as "only a woman" or "a dumb broad," this is no doubt most unpleasant. But most of us would agree that an entirely different line is crossed when the comments take on a decidedly sexual nature. It is a line that, when crossed, can have two practical results from the legal perspective. First, although the standard remains the same, when the conduct is sexual in nature it may be regarded as more severe than gender-based conduct and, thus, less pervasive conduct may establish a hostile environment. Second, because sexual conduct is more personally intrusive, it may result in a higher compensatory damage award than gender-based conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">As developed in more detail below, even an employee who complains of sexual harassment need not show that all of the offending conduct was sexual in nature. Conduct which is sexual in nature can be combined with other gender-based conduct to establish a hostile environment. Indeed, it is not unusual that both types of conduct appear in a case. And even if none of the conduct is sexual, a violation of Title VII still occurs if all of the conduct is gender-based. Too often, agencies confuse an argument that the conduct alleged is not sexual and therefore no sexual harassment occurred with an argument that the conduct alleged is not sexual and therefore no Title VII violation occurred. Although there is language in many cases supporting the first argument, it has been rejected by the Commission and by every court to seriously consider it.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Ayers v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01970359 (2000), the complainant alleged that a hostile environment existed based on conduct that was overtly sexual in nature, followed by conduct that was not sexual in nature. The Commission found that both types of conduct were proper to consider in determining whether a hostile environment existed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the pattern of harassment in this matter contains both overtly sexual conduct, as well as, sex-based conduct (i.e., conduct not involving sexual activity or language but directed at complainant because of her sex)<span class="Italic">. See Owens v. DOT</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940824 (September 5, 1996); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Gus Construction Co.</span>, 842 F.2d 1010, 1014 (8th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment</span> N-915-050, p. 19 (March 19, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant has shown that she was repeatedly asked out on dates over the course of several weeks, despite advising CW1 that she was not interested in him. CW1 asked other co-workers if complainant was dating anyone and inquired about her personal life. In addition, the record reflects that over the course of the next few months, CW1 began greeting and touching complainant in an offensive sexual manner. Complainant placed CW1 on notice that she would file a grievance if he did not stop. Following this notification, CW1's conduct changed from explicitly sexual in nature to overtly hostile, disruptive and intimidating. The next day, CW1 grabbed complainant's arm and stated: "you don't like it when I grab you, do you?" Also in the months following this incident when complainant was in CW1's presence, he exhibited hostility toward complainant. He criticized complainant's work and protested his disagreement with complainant's positions on various matters in a manner that appeared to co-workers as obsessive and unprofessional. Yet, CW1 had no reason to be involved with any portion of complainant's work. Although CW1 acted hostile and critical of complainant, he, nevertheless, attempted to get close to complainant during staff meetings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the clear pattern of conduct set forth above indicates harassment based upon sex. While the AJ and agency find that the 1993 conduct indicated a professional conflict, we find that the conduct by CW1 was harassing, intimidating and hostile and there is no evidence that any other employee was treated the same way by CA1. For example, TL disagreed with CW1's view on how to approach the IRSU project, yet had a good professional relationship with CW1 TL disagreed with CW1's approach and endorsed complainant's approach to the IRSU project. In addition, TL made the decision to remove CW1 from the IRSU project altogether. Yet, there is no record that CW1 ever spoke negatively about TL nor engaged in any verbal or physical confrontations with him. Based on the totality of the evidence, we find that complainant's allegations of sexual harassment are credible and sufficiently gender related to fall under the protection of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is significant to note that the Commission in<span class="Italic"> Ayers</span> found the conduct that was not sexual in nature was nonetheless gender-related, based primarily on the fact that the latter conduct seemed to flow out of the conduct that was overtly sexual. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Brookey v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01986339 (2001), the Commission found the complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of gender and reprisal-based harassment because there was no evidence that any of the alleged conduct was based on the complainant's gender or her EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120113866 (2014) (no evidence that alleged harassment was based on sex or reprisal instead of personal animosity); <span class="Italic">Hackenberg v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A40260 (2005) (no showing of hostile environment where evidence demonstrated that supervisor was "'abrasive and hostile towards everyone that she dealt with, regardless of their sex, age, disability or any other protected factor.'"); <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A40026 (2005) (evidence showed alleged harasser had "poor supervisory skills" and treated white males rudely as well); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A13242 (2003) (supervisor treated all employees the same); <span class="Italic">Sakoda v. Postmaster General</span>, 01983910 (2001) (no evidence that incidents of alleged harassment were based on complainant's sex).</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example is provided by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120133041 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the alleged conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment, there is no persuasive evidence in the record that discriminatory or retaliatory animus played a role in any of the Agency's actions. For example, M1 explained that she canvassed for vacation selections in December 2011 for 2012, and she believed that Complainant was still a reserve carrier at the time vacation was scheduled. ROI, at 341. M1 denied removing Complainant's name from the overtime desired list and noted that only an employee can volunteer to be taken off the list. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 342. M1 explained that she issued the June 1, 2012 Notice of Removal after Complainant was observed operating his postal vehicle without seatbelt in violation of the Agency's safe driving rules and expectations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 325. Management later agreed to hold the removal notice in abeyance after Complainant filed a grievance. M1 stated that Complainant was issued a second Notice of Removal in July 2012 for failure to follow instructions when he was observed casing/collating DPS mail. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 328. Management agreed again to hold the removal action in abeyance to settle a grievance. Finally, M1 affirmed that she prepared a third Notice of Removal after Complainant used unauthorized overtime on multiple occasions from June 2012 through August 2012. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 351. The Commission finds that Complainant has not shown that the Agency's reasons for its actions were a pretext for unlawful discrimination. Finally, as to Complainant's claim that M1 subjected him to sexual advances and treated him more harshly after he rejected her advances, the Commission finds that Complainant has not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was subjected to sexual harassment. M1 denied that she ever made any advances or comments to Complainant, and there is no corroboration that M1 actually made any sexual advances. The Commission finds that Complainant's claims that M1 wore seductive clothes, "sexually manipulated [him] to take the bait," "wanted sex so bad you could feel it," and "implied" that employment decisions were based on how he responded to her sexual advances are insufficient to establish that he was subjected to sexual harassment. Complainant failed to offer any corroborating evidence to support his contentions that M1 subjected him to any such behavior. In addition, there is no evidence that Complainant reported the alleged conduct to any management official. The Commission finds that Complainant did not establish that he was subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct. As a result, the Commission finds that Complainant has not established that he was subjected to discrimination or a hostile work environment as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">The same rule that applies in sexual harassment cases applies when a complainant asserts that allegedly harassing conduct is based on some other protected characteristic. The complainant must produce some evidence that there is a link between the alleged harassment and the protected characteristic. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ortega v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995243 (2001) (no evidence that conduct was based on the complainant's sex, national origin, or disability as contended). Another example is provided in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A60163 (2006). In that case, the complainant alleged that he <span id="Page_817"></span>was harassed based on his race and sex by comments concerning his height and weight. The Commission found that the complainant had produced no evidence to indicate the comments were motivated by the complainant's race or sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">In many cases, the conduct itself provides the necessary link to a protected characteristic. This is true in sexual harassment cases. It is also true in cases where racial or ethnic epithets are used. The use of terms like "nigger" or "spic" is directly related to the race or ethnicity of the victim. However, other conduct is more ambiguous and not inherently linked to a protected characteristic. Assume, for example, that a female complainant alleges that she is subjected to a hostile environment because her supervisor singles her work out for scrutiny, berates her in front of coworkers by calling her an "idiot" or a "moron," and insists she provide a medical certificate with all sick leave requests. Setting aside the issue of whether the conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment, the complainant has another problem: how to link that conduct to her gender. Nothing in the conduct itself suggests that it is motivated by the complainant's gender. One of the most common ways for a complainant to make such a showing is by introducing evidence that similarly situated males are not subjected to the same types of conduct by the supervisor. This is one way in which the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis gets infused into the hostile environment analysis. The problem in determining the motivation for the conduct is the same as it is in intentional discrimination cases--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, intent must be inferred from circumstantial evidence because the supervisor is unlikely to admit the conduct is gender-based. When an agency introduces legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for each of the actions that constitute the alleged harassment, the complainant must introduce some evidence to demonstrate that the incidents were based on sex. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Fowler v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02804 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">A good example of the use of comparative evidence to demonstrate that the conduct was based on a protected basis--race--is <span class="Italic">O'Keefe v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130848 (2013). <span class="Italic">O'Keefe</span> also demonstrates that hazard of supervisors being nonresponsive during the investigation stage:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful review of the evidence of record, we conclude that Complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim of a racially motivated hostile work environment. Based on her own affidavit and the supporting affidavits of several coworkers, she has provided evidence that she was the frequent victim of badgering, berating, nitpicking, criticism in front of her coworkers and excessive monitoring at the hands of her Supervisor. She has also submitted testimony that unlike other employees not of her race, the Supervisor made her perform overtime work, goaded her to file an EEO complaint, issued her three disciplinary suspensions between January and May 2010 (all reversed in the grievance process), and subjected her to ten pre-disciplinary interviews during the period of July 8 to 21, 2011. Complainant also presented evidence that Supervisor engages in similar negative behavior toward two other Caucasian employees, Employees 1 and 2, and treats Employee 3, an African-American, more favorably. As a result, Complainant's contended her ability to function in the workplace suffered. Complainant also asserts that she turned to the Postmaster for assistance with the situation, but nothing was done.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claimed that Complainant's allegations were too vague to merit a response. However, a close examination of Complainant's affidavit demonstrates that Complainant has provided sufficient detail and definitive dates for many of her allegations, including dates on which Supervisor subjected Employees 1 and 2 to similar conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The responsible Supervisor's affidavit was largely nonresponsive to the questions posed by the investigator. When asked her working organizational relationship to the Complainant, Supervisor responded, "N/A." In response to every substantive question posed, Supervisor said, "I don't recall." For example, she did not recall whether she had "received training on anti-harassment/hostile work environment while employed by the agency" or whether she forced Complainant to work overtime on July 8, 2011. Supervisor also did not recall whether she had given Complainant any pre-disciplinary investigative interviews or whether she treated Employee 1, 2, or 3, in the same way she treats Complainant. Supervisor could not recall whether Complainant's protected bases were a factor as to any of the allegations. Last, but not least, Supervisor indicated that her own race, age, color, and religion were all "N/A." We note that the Postmaster also averred that he did not recall anything about the situation, stating his office was not located in the unit. He indicated that the on-site Manager would have more information. The investigator tried to obtain an affidavit from the Manager, but apparently received no response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such an affidavit, given the particularity with which Complainant articulated her allegations, are blatantly unresponsive and do not serve to meet the Agency's evidentiary burden to rebut Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discriminatory harassment. Because the responsible management witnesses failed to respond to Complainant's allegations, and those of her supporting witnesses, in any clear or specific way, we find that the Agency has failed to rebut the initial inference of discrimination created by Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and, accordingly, Complainant has proven she was discriminated against based on her race/color as alleged. <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100344 (December 14, 2011); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120032050 (January 7, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even in cases where the facial nature of verbal conduct may implicate a protected characteristic, the complainant still retains the burden of proving a connection between the conduct and that characteristic. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a41028.txt">01A41028</a> (2005), the Commission found that the complainant failed to carry this burden:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also claimed that a number of employees did "girl things" together on a social basis, excluding him based on discrimination. Complainant indicated that they isolated him, would not speak to him, and did not invite him to work-related functions. The AJ determined that it appeared that some employees at the station did not like complainant, but there was no evidence that their dislike was based on discrimination. Rather, witnesses testified that complainant called an employee "punk" and "bitch" and he called another employee "faggot." If complainant became isolated from some of his coworkers and supervisors, it was more likely that his own behavior at work created that result than did unlawful discrimination or retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">For this reason, the discussion of sexual conduct begins with distinguishing between sexual harassment and gender-based harassment.</p>
