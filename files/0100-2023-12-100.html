<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-99"><span class="space">25.</span> Volunteers</h4>
<p class="noindent">Agencies use volunteers and, generally, volunteers are not covered by Title VII. However, the question becomes much more difficult when the "volunteer" is performing services for the agency as part of an educational program and receives remuneration for the services.</p>
<p class="noindent">Commission Compliance Manuel Section 2-III.c, "Threshold Issues," discusses volunteers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Volunteers usually are not protected "employees." However, an individual may be considered an employee of a particular entity if, as a result of volunteer service, s/he receives benefits such as a pension, group life insurance, workers' compensation, and access to professional certification, even if the benefits are provided by a third party. [E.g., <span class="Italic">Pietras v. Board of Fire Comm'rs</span>, 180 F.3d 468, 473 (2d Cir. 1999). Benefits may be provided by a third party, such as a state agency, as long as they are provided as a consequence of the volunteer service.] The benefits constitute "significant remuneration" rather than merely the "inconsequential incidents of an otherwise gratuitous relationship." [<span class="Italic">Haavistola v. Community Fire Co. of Rising Sun, Inc</span>., 6 F.3d 211, 222 (4th Cir. 1993).]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example--CP was terminated from her position as a probationary volunteer firefighter after she failed an agility test. She alleges that the test has a disparate impact on women. Respondent claims that CP was not an employee, and, therefore, not protected by Title VII. State X provides volunteer firefighters up to $400/month in state retirement benefits (after five years of service); death and survivors benefits; group life insurance; disability and rehabilitation benefits; health care benefits; and tuition reimbursement for courses in emergency medical and fire service techniques. These benefits are "significant remuneration" sufficient to create an employment relationship between CP and Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent">A volunteer may also be covered by the EEO statutes if the volunteer work is required for regular employment or regularly leads to regular employment with the same entity. In such situations, discrimination by the respondent operates to deny the charging party an employment opportunity. [See <span class="Italic">Charlton v. Paramus Bd. of Educ</span>., 25 F.3d 194, 198 n.4 (3d Cir.) (Title VII reaches discrimination by any covered employer that has "the ability to directly affect a plaintiff's employment opportunities"), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 513 U.S. 1022 (1994).]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example--CP is a volunteer counselor with the Respondent, a public interest organization, and alleges that she was subjected to sexual harassment by her supervisor and coworkers. Respondent maintains that CP is not its employee, and, therefore, not covered by Title VII. While volunteer service is not a prerequisite to employment, former volunteers are given preferential treatment when competing for vacancies against applicants who have not volunteered with Respondent. Most of Respondent s regular, paid counselors initially performed volunteer work for Respondent. In this case, volunteer service regularly leads to employment with Respondent. Therefore, CP is protected by the EEO statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission addressed that situation in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01893011 (1989). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> was a sociology student who was required to complete 4000 hours of volunteer service as a substance abuse counselor in order to receive state certification as a counselor. The complainant worked as a "volunteer" counselor for the agency under a series of separate contracts and received remuneration. The Commission held that the <span class="Italic">Sprides</span> control test was not applicable. Instead, the Commission held that the proper test to apply is whether the volunteer work regularly leads to employment. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon reexamination of this case, the Commission has come to the conclusion that the contractor/employee <span class="Italic">Sprides</span> analysis is not applicable in this case. The appellant was neither an employee or contractor with the agency, but a volunteer. The facts in <span class="Italic">Pollack v. Rice University</span>, 28 FEP Cases 1273 (S.D. Texas 1982) are analogous to this case. In <span class="Italic">Pollack</span>, the plaintiff alleged that he was discriminated against in violation of Title VII when he was denied admission to a scholastic program that entailed performance of services for remuneration. The plaintiff wanted to serve as a research chemist or instructor in chemistry. The court found that because the service for remuneration was completely incidental to the scholastic program, the plaintiff was a student, and not an employee. Similarly, the appellant's service for remuneration was completely incidental to the Veteran-Student Services Program. Note that participants in the program must be full time students in a school and are paid relatively nominal wages. Moreover, the record reflects that the appellant provided volunteer time apart from the work study program. The appellant was a volunteer, not an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the appellant was a volunteer, Section 605.17(c) of the EEOC Compliance Manual (CCH) is directly applicable to this case. EEOC Comp. Man. &#x00A7; 607.17(c) (CCH) provides that volunteer work is within the scope of Title VII where it regularly leads to regular employment with the defendant. Because EEOC Compl. Man. &#x00A7; 607.17(c) is directly on point and provides and explains Commission policy on volunteer workers, we will liberally quote from the manual. The manual illustrates the relevant policy with the following example:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example</span>--CP is a volunteer firefighter with the auxiliary unit for R, a municipal fire department. The municipal fire department is a Title VII employer. She alleges widespread discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment because of her sex. R's defense to the charge is that CP is not its employee and therefore the Commission does not have jurisdiction over her charge. An investigation of this jurisdictional defense reveals that a clear majority of R's regular firefighters had initially performed volunteer work in the auxiliary fire department. Volunteer work with the auxiliary department is not a prerequisite to employment with the regular fire department, but former volunteers are given preferential treatment when competing for vacancies with applicants who have no experience as a volunteer. Because volunteer service leads to regular employment and applicants who have experience as volunteers are given preference over other applicants, volunteers for the auxiliary department are entitled to the protection accorded employees by Title VII. Discrimination by the respondent for whom the charging party does volunteer work operates to deny the charging party an employment opportunity, allegedly on a basis prohibited by &#x00A7; 703 of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">A volunteer who worked at an agency spinal cord injury recreation sport clinic <span id="Page_206"></span>between two to six hours per week was not an "employee" in <span class="Italic">Tera B. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 20200005079 (2021). The Commission concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant volunteered one to two days a week for approximately two hours at the gym, and one to two days a month for 4-6 hours when assisting on trips. We find that the compensation to which Complainant refers is the inconsequential incident of an otherwise gratuitous relationship. The type of volunteer work Complainant did was not a prerequisite to regular employment, and there was no evidence that the volunteers receive preferential treatment when they applied for regular employment. Accordingly, we find Complainant's complaint fails to state a claim because she was a volunteer, not an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">A black volunteer who alleges that white volunteers are made permanent employees has stated a claim within Title VII. The Commission remanded the case to the agency to address specific questions regarding the agency's work force, volunteer work force, and how many volunteers become regular employees. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01903150 (1990) (applying the same test to a female volunteer who alleged that she did not obtain permanent employment because she advocated fair treatment for women and disabled patients).</p>
<p class="noindent">On a subsequent appeal, the Commission determined that there is no requirement that volunteer work unilaterally result in employment for a complainant to be deemed an employee within the meaning of Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01913651 (1991), the complainant demonstrated that of the last 25 positions filled, 10 had been filled with former volunteers. The Commission determined that this was sufficient to show that there is a linkage between volunteer work and regular employment with the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">A student who was performing an observation portion of a tutorial clinic at an agency facility was deemed not to be a volunteer for the purposes of coverage under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Koshy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01923689 (1992). The complainant was observing clinic procedures and reporting on what he observed. He was not performing volunteer work or actual assignments for the agency. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Attorney General</span>, 01A30894 (2003), the Commission found the complainant, who volunteered at a U.S. attorney's office as part of an internship program, was not an employee for complaint-filing purposes, even though she had regular employment with the Bureau of Prisons. The Commission found the complainant had not demonstrated that internships often led to regular employment with the U.S. attorney's office.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that volunteer work eventually leads to a permanent paying position with the agency does not mean that the volunteer work was a prerequisite to compensable employment. In <span class="Italic">Cerqua v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01990447 (2001), the Commission found that the complainant, who was an employee of the agency at the time of the decision, failed to state a claim for discrimination that allegedly occurred when he was a volunteer:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning first to the dismissal of claims 2 and 3, Commission precedent holds that volunteer work is within the scope of Title VII where it is a prerequisite to regular employment or when former volunteers receive preferential treatment when applying for regular employment, and where a significant number of the agency's regular employees performed volunteer work for the agency<span class="Italic">. See Ferguson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910005 (March 6, 1991). Here, complainant did not dispute that he was a volunteer prior to September 5, 1995. Moreover, complainant provided no evidence, nor did he allege, that volunteer work is a prerequisite to regular employment or that it is linked to regular employment with the agency in any way. Accordingly, we affirm the agency's dismissal of claims 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120132601 (2014), the Commission found that the complainant was a volunteer and not an employee for Title VII purposes noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the instant formal complaint fails to state a claim under EEOC regulations because Complainant failed to show that he suffered harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Diaz v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (April 21, 1994). Complainant was a volunteer, and volunteers usually are not protected "employees" for the purpose of the administrative EEO complaint process (29 C.F.R. Part 1614). EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 2: Threshold Issue, EEOC Notice No. 915.003. However, an individual may be considered an employee of a particular entity if, as a result of volunteer service, they receive benefits such as a pension, group life insurance, workers' compensation, and access to professional certification, even if the benefits are provided by a third party. The benefits constitute "significant remuneration" rather than merely the "inconsequential incidents of an otherwise gratuitous relationship." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also, Fred M. &#x0026; Marion Rose v. Department of the Interior (National Park Service)</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120101487 &#x0026; 0120101488 (July 27, 2010). The record in this matter establishes that Complainant received no "significant remuneration" and, hence, was a volunteer who does not have standing to participate in the federal sector EEO complaint process. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the Agency's final decision dismissing Complainant's formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ellan K. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120141695 (2015) (health specialist without compensation was a volunteer and not an employee).</p>
<p class="noindent">A volunteer intern who was scheduled to receive a stipend of $6,315 upon successful completion of the internship was considered an employee for purposes of filing an EEO complaint in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120133242 (2014).</p>
<p class="noindent">In remanding the case for further development of the record in <span class="Italic">Wilda D. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120143016 (2016), the Commission elaborated on when receipt of remuneration may make a volunteer an agency employee for Title VII purposes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In EEOC Compliance Manuel Section 2, "Threshold Issues," No. 915.003, at 2-28 to 2-29 (July 21, 2005), the Commission advises that while volunteers usually are not protected "employees," an individual may be considered an employee of a particular entity if as a result of the volunteer service, she receives benefits such as a pension, group life insurance, and access to professional certification, even if the benefits are provided by a third party. The Commission advises that the benefits constitute "significant remuneration" rather than merely the `inconsequential incidents of an otherwise gratuitous relationship." The Commission also advises that a volunteer may also be covered by EEO statutes if the volunteer work is required for regular employment or regularly leads to regular employment with the same entity because in such situations, discrimination by the employer operates to deny the Complainant of an employment opportunity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant wrote in her complaint that she received a monthly stipend of $2,000, significant remuneration. But the record does not show the extent to which this remuneration was tied to her service at the Forest Service. Above, we asked the Agency to gather information on her internship arrangements. Also, the Agency is directed to gather information on whether Complainant was able to move to another internship "volunteer" opportunity, and whether she was able to complete the requirements of the internship program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant states that her stipend was increased from $1,500 to $2,000 while serving the Forest Service because she took a leadership role which required her to complete a Forest Service driver's education course that would provide her a Federal driver's license so she could drive Forest Service vehicles. The Agency should gather information on this. On appeal, Complainant submits an affidavit that while serving the Forest Service she was told she could remain in the position as long as she wanted and it could lead to a permanent position as a biological field tech if she was successful and worked hard. Complainant does not identify in which organization the permanent position would be located, which is highly relevant. On remand, we will direct the Agency to gather relevant information on this, as well as the other inquiries outlined above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its FAD, the Agency found that Complainant was a volunteer, as evidenced by her signing the Volunteer Services Agreement for Natural Resources Agencies, and 16 U.S.C. I 558c. But the Agency does not point to an applicable section of the statute which defines a volunteer, and given Complainant's stipend, the record at this point indicates that despite the agreement, she was an employee of some organization, but which one(s) has yet to be det ermined. On remand, the Agency shall gather facts on whether the Volunteer Services Agreement for Natural Resources Agencies included the Forest Service, and further identify the applicable definition of volunteer under the above statute, if any.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another relevant line of inquiry is where Complainant was located when alleged harassment occurred in issues 1a, 1c and 1d--did it occur when she was located on Forest Service premises or property or property managed by the Forest Service? Further, the record should be developed on Intern 1's relationship with the Forest Service. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Department of Defense (Office of the Secretary of Defense</span>), EEOC Appeal No. 0120131331 (July 15, 2015) (whether alleged discrimination is attributable to the Agency or its personnel factored into application on the determination on whether it should be deemed an employer).</p>
