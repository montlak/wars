<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-94"><span class="space">B.</span> STANDARD OF PROOF</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many interpreted the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> decision as implicitly overruling any argument that the clear and convincing evidentiary standard applies in cases not involving mixed motives. The Commission expressly rejected this conclusion in its adoption of Part 1614 in 1992. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(b). In its explanatory comments in the 1992 notice of final rulemaking, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Currently, 29 CFR 1613.271 states that full relief should be provided to an individual when discrimination is found unless the record contains clear and convincing evidence that the individual would not have been selected in the absence of discrimination. During the public comment and interagency coordination of the 1987 amendments to part 1613, published at 52 Fed. Reg. 41919 (1987), commenters suggested that the burden of proof be changed from "clear and convincing evidence" to "a preponderance of the evidence" standard. Subsequently, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 109 S. Ct. 1775 (1989), in which it held that an employer can avoid liability, and hence any relief, in a mixed motive case upon showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the same determination would have been made even absent discrimination. Proposed &#x00A7; 1614.501 contained the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard as &#x00A7; 1613.271 but EEOC invited comment on whether the Supreme Court's decision required any change to that standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some agency commenters argued that <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> required a change to preponderance of the evidence. Other agency commenters and most non-agency commenters believe that no change was necessary because <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> concerned proof at the liability stage while the regulation concerns proof at the relief stage and because the <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> decision itself cited and distinguished our regulation on this basis. We agree that the <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> decision does not require a change in the regulation. <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> relates solely to liability in mixed motive cases; it does not affect the standards of proof applicable to liability or relief in single motive cases. We recognize that the regulation will be applied most often to determining whether class members are entitled to individual relief after a class finding of discrimination, but it is also applicable to individual cases where there has been a finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also believe that <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> only applies to contemporaneous mixed motive cases, i.e., those cases where both motives or reasons were actually known and actually affected the decision. If an agency proves by clear and convincing evidence that it had some legitimate reason for <span id="Page_772"></span>taking the action in question or not selecting the complainant but only discovered that reason after the actual decision was made, it would not escape liability. It may succeed, however, in limiting the amount of relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">This provision was unchanged in the 1999 amendments to Part 1614.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, although Part 1614 was adopted after the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the Commission, in its notice of final rulemaking, did not comment on what effect, if any, the new legislation had on its position. In two sections of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, Congress reversed, in part, the holding of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> by providing at 42 USC 2000e-2(m):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">At 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), Congress also provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On a claim in which an individual proves a violation under section 2000e-2(m) of this title and a respondent demonstrates the respondent would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor, the court--</p>

<p class="noindent">Congress invalidated the holding of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> insofar as an employer could escape all liability for discrimination in a mixed-motive case. There is no indication that Congress intended to change the burden of proof in a mixed-motive case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Fuentes v. Attorney General</span>, 01956091 (1997), the Commission found that, although the supervisor's statement that the appellant lacked promotion potential because she was an unwed mother was direct evidence of discrimination, the agency showed that because the appellant was a temporary employee, she would not have been promoted anyway. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Fuentes</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, appellant contends that S2 made a statement to appellant's EEO counselor that appellant's status as an unwed mother did not lend itself to her promotion possibilities. While S2 denies making this statement, the record reflects that several witnesses, including the EEO counselor in question, remember a statement to that effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.109(e) (3), the AJ decided the case on the record and issued a recommended decision finding no discrimination. The agency issued a FAD on July 24, 1995, adopting the AJ's recommended decision. It is from this agency decision that appellant now appeals. The appellant raises no further contentions on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful review of the entire record, we find that the AJ's recommended decision sets forth the relevant facts and properly analyzes the appropriate regulations, policies and laws. We find no basis to disturb the AJ's findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission notes that the alleged statement concerning the marital status and/or morals of appellant was entirely inappropriate, and stands as direct evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the record indicates that at the time the alleged statement was made, appellant was a TAPER (temporary appointment pending establishment of a register) employee, who was not eligible for promotion. Moreover, as the statement in question was made in August of 1991, the agency was required only to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision absent the inappropriate statement by S2.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Fuentes</span>, the Commission indicates that in post-1991 Civil Rights Act cases, the burden is clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Carr v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05950651 (1997), the Commission clearly indicated that it will still apply the clear and convincing evidence standard in post-1991 Civil Rights Act cases not involving after-acquired evidence. In <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also appears to be challenging the failure of the previous decision to afford him the equitable relief of promotion to the subject position with back pay and benefits. Upon review of the record herein, we find that the previous decision correctly determined that appellant was not entitled to promotion to the subject position or an award of back pay and benefits in view of the evidence in the record that established that he would not have been selected for the position in the absence of discrimination. This evidence includes appellant's low ranking by the rating panel, consideration of the qualifications of the other candidates relative to those of appellant (other candidates possessed electronics training and were employed in that field while appellant had not had such training or held such positions), and the Selecting Official's testimony concerning the superior qualifications of at least two candidates other than the selectee over appellant. Therefore, to the extent that appellant challenges this determination in his request for reconsideration, his request is denied. However, the Commission exercises its discretion to reconsider the previous decision solely in order to clarify that pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.271(b)(2), the regulation in effect at the time of the subject nonselection, the presently applicable &#x00A7; 1614.501(c), and <span class="Italic">Day v. Matthews supra</span>, the agency, and not the appellant, bore the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant would not have been selected for the subject position in the absence of discrimination. Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency has met this burden herein.</p>
<p class="noindent">In footnote 4 of <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, the Commission specifically stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we note that our review of the record herein does not indicate that the nonselection issue is appropriate for disposition as a "mixed motive" case, in that it has been proven through circumstantial, rather than direct, evidence of discrimination. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Stock v. Attorney General</span>, 01953223 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission again applied the clear and convincing standard of proof in <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720060054 (2008), in a case involving a nonselection on the basis of age. After upholding the finding of age discrimination by the administrative judge, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the matter of relief. When an agency, or the Commission, finds that an applicant for employment has been discriminated against, the agency shall offer the applicant the position that the applicant would have occupied absent discrimination or, if justified by the circumstances, a substantially equivalent position unless clear and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant would have not been selected even absent the discrimination. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(b)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the hearing, the agency argued that Applicant A or Applicant B would have been selected before complainant. However, we are not persuaded that there is clear and convincing evidence to support this position. Applicant A scored substantially higher than the selectee, and if she had been a clear choice, she would have been selected first. Furthermore, since we have already found that the selection process was tainted by age discrimination, the fact that Applicant A was over the age of 40 also does not support the agency's conclusion that she would have been selected if the selectee was not. Finally, the interview notes for Applicant A reveal that the agency was concerned that she would not "fit" into the facility after having been out of the facility for some time. Accordingly, Applicant A was not a clear choice. As for Applicant B, this individual actually scored the highest in his outreach answer, but was not chosen for the position. Information on his age is not contained in the record. Interview notes for Applicant B reveal that he was going through personal issues at the time. Accordingly, he was not selected for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">O'Day v. McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co.</span>, 79 F.3d 756 (9th Cir. 1996), the court tackled a question left open by <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>; namely the standard of proof to be applied in an after-acquired evidence case. In a split decision, the court rejected an argument that the employer must establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated the employee if it had known of the misconduct. Instead, the court applied a preponderance of the evidence standard in finding that <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> would have fired the plaintiff for stealing company documents--a fact which it did not learn of until discovery in the case. As the <span class="Italic">O'Day</span> court, 79 F.3d at 759-61, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">McKennon</span> did not explicate how after-acquired evidence should be treated in every situation, leaving this issue to "be addressed by the judicial system in the ordinary course of further decisions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Court did hold, however, that after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing generally limits an employee's remedy in three significant ways. If an employer discovers that the plaintiff committed an act of wrongdoing and can establish that the "wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone if the employer had known of it at the time of the discharge,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at __-__, 115 S. Ct. at 886-87, the employer does not have to offer reinstatement or provide front pay, and only has to provide backpay "from the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new information was discovered,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at __, 115 S. Ct. at 886.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">McKennon</span> places the burden of proof with respect to this issue on the employer, carefully articulating that the employer must establish not only that it could have fired an employee for the later-discovered misconduct, but that it would in fact have done so. <span class="Italic">Id.; accord Reed v. AMAX Coal Co.</span>, 971 F.2d 1295, 1298 (7th Cir. 1992). This burden comports with the well-established rule in mixed-motive cases, where the burden rests on the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have discharged the employee (or taken whatever adverse action is at issue) regardless of its discriminatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 258, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 1794-95, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989). The inquiry focuses on the employer's actual employment practices, not just the standards established in its employee manuals, and reflects a recognition that employers often say they will discharge employees for <span id="Page_773"></span>certain misconduct while in practice they do not. As the Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, "proving that the same decision would have been justified. . .is not the same as proving that the same decision would have been made." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 252, 109 S. Ct. at 1791-92 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">McKennon</span> left open whether the preponderance of the evidence standard applicable in mixed-motive cases also applies in the after-acquired evidence context. Nowhere in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> does the Supreme Court suggest that employers bear a particularly heavy burden in this context; throughout the opinion the Court refers only to what employers must "establish." Relying on our decision in <span class="Italic">Nanty v. Barrows Co.</span>, 660 F.2d 1327, 1333 (9th Cir. 1981), O'Day nevertheless argues that we should require McDonnell Douglas to come forward with clear and convincing evidence that it would have discharged him for his misconduct. This we decline to do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Nanty</span> held that an employer who had an illegal motive for an employment decision could limit the employee's remedy by providing clear and convincing evidence that it would have made the same decision apart from the illegal motive. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The clear-and-convincing standard was thoroughly rejected in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, however; there a majority of the Supreme Court held that an employer who had an illegal motive for an employment decision could avoid liability outright if it showed by only a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision apart from the illegal motive. 490 U.S. at 258, 109 S. Ct. at 1794-95 (plurality opinion);<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 259-60, 109 S. Ct. at 1795-96 (White, J., concurring);<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 261, 109 S. Ct. at 1796-97 (O'Connor, J., concurring). By enacting the 1991 Civil Rights Act, Congress partially overruled <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>. The Act allows an employer to limit the employee's remedy, rather than defeat liability outright, by showing it would have made the same decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Congress also approved <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> in part, however, as the Act consciously left the opinion undisturbed to the extent it held the employer to a preponderance of the evidence standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 102-40(I), 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 45 n.39 (1991), reprinted in 1991 USCCAN 549, 583 n.39; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Dissent at 25-26. Taken together, <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> and the 1991 Civil Rights Act stand squarely for the proposition that an employer may limit the employee's remedy if it shows by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision apart from an illegal motive. On the standard of proof issue, <span class="Italic">Nanty</span> has therefore been overruled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent argues that <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> was a mixed-motive case and that "[t]he Supreme Court in McKennon emphasized that mixed-motive cases are not applicable in the after-acquired evidence context, where 'the case comes to [the court] on the express assumption that an unlawful motive was the sole basis for the firing.'" Dissent at 766-767 (<span class="Italic">quoting McKennon</span>, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 885). This overlooks the reason we are now considering the standard of proof issue; the Supreme Court did not address it in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>. The issue there was whether after-acquired evidence could defeat liability outright, or merely limit the employee's remedy. Of course mixed-motive cases don't bear on that question. As the Court explained in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>, it had taken the view in <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed.2d 471 (1977), a mixed-motive case, that an employer could defeat liability outright, if it showed that it had a legitimate motive for an employment action, not only an illegitimate one. <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 885. The <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> Court had reasoned that it would be difficult and unnecessary to untangle the impermissible from the permissible motives. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This reasoning couldn't possibly apply in the <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> context, however, for precisely the reason the Court there gave: In an after-acquired evidence case, the employer's actual motive for taking the employment action is clear and illegal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Taken in context, the Court's language in <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> gives not the slightest indication that <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> is inapplicable to the issue of the employer's standard of proof at the remedy stage of an after-acquired evidence case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague also observes that the employer in a mixed-motive case has acted from a legitimate motive as well as an illegitimate one, whereas the employer in an after-acquired evidence case has acted only from an illegitimate motive; according to the dissent, the employer's "<span class="Italic">post hoc</span> justifications" in an after-acquired evidence case are therefore "properly viewed with greater suspicion" than in a mixed-motive case. Dissent at 767. Title VII rejects any such distinction. Since Congress passed the 1991 Civil Rights Act, liability in mixed-motive cases is deemed established once the employee shows that a discriminatory criterion was a motivating factor in the employer's decision, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m); the only issue raised by the employer's evidence of an additional, legal motive is what the employee's remedy will be. After-acquired evidence cases are identically structured. Liability is established after the employee shows that a discriminatory criterion was a motivating factor in the decision, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m); the only issue raised by the employer's after-acquired evidence is what the employee's remedy will be, <span class="Italic">McKennon</span>, __ U.S. at __-__, 115 S. Ct. at 883-84. The mixed-motive employer is thus no less legally culpable by virtue of its legitimate motive than the after-acquired evidence employer. Under <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> and the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the mixed-motive employer need only meet the preponderance of the evidence standard at the remedy stage. There's no reason the after-acquired evidence employer should have to meet a higher standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore decline to apply the <span class="Italic">Nanty</span> standard, and instead take our cue from <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> and the 1991 Civil Rights Act. An employer can avoid backpay and other remedies by coming forward with after-acquired evidence of an employee's misconduct, but only if it can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have fired the employee for that misconduct. <span class="Italic">Accord Washington v. Lake County</span>, 969 F.2d 250, 255 (7th Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Smallwood v. United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 728 F.2d 614, 616 n.5 (4th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">In finding for McDonnell Douglas, the court found the plaintiff had offered no evidence to rebut the very specific evidence offered by the defendant about its termination policies and how they would have been applied in the case. Moreover, the court, applying a balancing test, found the act of removing the documents was not protected activity.
