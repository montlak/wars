<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-67"><span class="space">7.</span> Former Employees</h4>
<p class="noindent">Title VII applies to applicants for employment and employees. The Commission has also consistently held that it applies to former employees, to the extent they allege they are aggrieved by actions that took place at the time of their employment with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Cheeks v. Department of Labor</span>, 01832390 (1984). A former employee may also state a viable retaliation claim for protected activity that arose from his or her employment with an agency even where the disputed agency action occurred after the termination of the employment relationship. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Queen L. v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 0120180368 (2018).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission explained the rule in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120133147 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commission precedent is consistent with Federal court cases which have held that a strict and narrow interpretation of the word "employee to exclude former employees would undercut the remedial purposes of the discrimination statutes which are to furnish a remedy against an employer's use of discrimination in connection with a prospective, present or past relationship." <span class="Italic">Pantchenko v. C.B. Dodge Co</span>., 581 F.2d 1052, 1055 (2d Cir. 1978). The Commission has further held that "former employees frequently have standing to challenge agency actions that presently affect them and for which remedial action would be available if they prevailed on their complaints." <span class="Italic">Laborde v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910521 (July 25, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">In that case, the complainant alleged that the agency retaliated against her in her present position for protected activity that she engaged in while an agency employee. The agency dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, concluding that she was, at the time of her complaint, a contractor. The Commission reversed the dismissal, noting that the complainant was alleging a present harm from her prior employment with the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant is alleging that the Agency retaliated against her, for protected EEO activity that she engaged in while an Army &#x0026; Air Force Exchange employee, by informing SIGA that Complainant was "no longer acceptable" and "would not be used in the performance of any other contracts with the Agency."1 On appeal, Complainant explains that, on December 12, 2012, before she resigned from the Agency, she contacted an EEO Counselor regarding discrimination and a hostile work environment. She asserts that she has been subjected to retaliation from the Agency "after being in continuous contact with the Agency EEO since December 12, 2012, which directly led to me losing my new job...." The Commission finds that she has presented a cognizable claim. <span class="Italic">See Doyle v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520070207 (October 12, 2007) (Complainant stated a viable claim of retaliation when, as a former employee who had engaged in protected EEO activity, he was not selected for a contract position with the agency). The Commission has held that former employees have standing to file EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">See Sternberg v. Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890976 (January 9, 1990); <span class="Italic">Simpkins v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01985154 (December 3, 1999). Commission precedent is consistent with Federal court cases which have held that a strict and narrow interpretation of the word "employee to exclude former employees would undercut the remedial purposes of the discrimination statutes which are to furnish a remedy against an employer's use of discrimination in connection with a prospective, present or past relationship." <span class="Italic">Pantchenko v. C.B. Dodge Co</span>., 581 F.2d 1052, 1055 (2d Cir. 1978). The Commission has further held that "former employees frequently have standing to challenge agency actions that presently affect them and for which remedial action would be available if they prevailed on their complaints." <span class="Italic">Laborde v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910521 (July 25, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the matter presently before us, the Agency allegedly requested that SIGA remove Complainant from her position at the Agency facility in reprisal for her prior EEO activity. Such an action is akin to refusing to provide post-employment letters or offering negative job references to prospective employers on behalf of former employees, actions which violate the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co</span>., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Billy L. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020003453 (2020), applied the "prospective, present, or past relationship" rule to find that the complaint was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether Complainant has standing as a former employee of the Agency to bring his retaliatory harassment claim, as detailed in allegations 1, 2 and 3, turns on if the Agency allegedly discriminated against him in connection with its "prospective, present, or past relationship" with him. Complainant's harassment claim does not meet this standard. None of his allegations involve the named Agency employees working in their capacity as an employee of the Agency or sharing negative information <span id="Page_180"></span>regarding Complainant, fabricated or otherwise, gained in connection with the Agency's employment relationship with him. All the alleged actions clearly appear to have been taken by these individuals as private citizens, not Agency employees. This includes the unofficial verbal threats that bad things would happen to him if he entered Fort Greenly, which he does not allege he would do in any case. It also includes the allegation that Agency employees maliciously filed or made complaints with his present private sector employer even though he did not provide them fuel services, and Agency employees intentionally trying to endanger him with vehicles while he drove a fuel truck or screaming at him. The only connection to the Agency Complainant gives is that these people knew him or of him because he had formerly worked at Fort Greenly, and presumably did not like him. As understood by the above and like cases, these are not actions taken in connection with the Agency's past employment relationship with Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The courts have not always agreed and the circuits were split on the issue of whether Title VII applied to a former employee. In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.</span>, 519 U.S. 337, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed.2d 808 (1997), discussed fully below, the Supreme Court resolved that question by ruling that Title VII does cover former employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">While the Commission oriGINAlly held that Title VII applied to former employees to the extent that they were challenging actions that took place during their employment, this did not mean that an agency could act with impunity toward an employee once he or she had departed. In <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01882711 (1988), the complainant sought an upgrading of her position several times. Subsequent to her leaving the agency, her replacement received an increase in grade classification. The agency dismissed the employee's complaint on the basis that, as a former employee, she was not aggrieved. The Commission reinstated the complaint in <span class="Italic">Monroe</span>, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant was clearly not an employee of the agency nor an applicant for employment at the time she contacted the agency EEO Counselor on October 19, 1987, and later filed her formal complaint with the agency on January 12, 1988, for she was then working for the U.S. Postal Service. Yet the Commission interprets "aggrieved employee" in 29 CFR 1613.212(a) to mean a person who was an employee of the agency at the time the discrimination allegedly occurred, and not at the time that the complainant became aware of the alleged discrimination. In the instant case, appellant last spoke with her Supervisor about upgrading her position...on October 22, 1986, while she was still an employee of the agency. At that time she was told that there was no way that her position could be upgraded....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If in fact discrimination should ultimately be proven in this case, therefore, this Commission would deem that it occurred at the latest on October 22, 1986 and continued from that point to when the position was actually upgraded to a GS-5 on September 27, 1987. This Commission thus finds that since appellant was an employee of the agency on October 22, 1986, she therefore qualifies as an "aggrieved employee" under 29 CFR 1613.212(a)....</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the EEOC also previously ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over disputes that arise between an agency and a former employee that occur after the termination of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Givens v. USPS</span>, 01831532 (1985) (allegation that agency was withholding compensation for earned annual leave while appeal of termination was pending before MSPB). But, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01903156 (1990), the Commission explicitly overruled <span class="Italic">Givens</span>, holding that a former employee may file an EEO complaint "alleging discriminatory treatment for actions occurring <span class="Italic">after</span> the complainant has been separated, provided that there is a logical connection between the acts complained of and complainant's federal employment or his/her application for federal employment." The Commission reinstated the complaint alleging the agency was engaging in retaliation by delaying his payment for accrued annual leave and retirement contributions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The term "aggrieved employee" generally was interpreted by the Commission to mean an employee who suffers a present harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment, as a result of prohibited discrimination. 42 USC 2000e-2(a)(1). Where an appellant identifies an "unresolved personal harm or shows that there remains a potential for such harm, he is aggrieved and therefore states a claim pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.215(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01912382 (1991). In that case, the Commission found the existence of a letter of requirement regarding sick leave usage aggrieved the employee even though he had resigned from the agency. The existence of such a letter could have future adverse effects on the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Collins v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01950068 (1995), the Commission found that a complainant was aggrieved when she alleged that she was terminated from her private sector employment after the agency provided false information to her employer. In finding the complainant had standing to bring a complaint against the agency in <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant alleged that she suffered a harm when Knoxville College terminated her employment after allegedly receiving certain information from the agency. The agency maintains that appellant is not an employee nor an applicant for employment with the agency; thus, she has no standing to file an EEO complaint. After a thorough review of the record, we find that the issue in the instant complaint involved alleged discriminatory information in reference to appellant's prior employment with the agency, which was allegedly provided by the agency official. The record reveals that appellant was an employee of the agency from 1976 to 1992, and the alleged incident arose from and/or was based on her employment with the agency. Based on the foregoing, we find that appellant is an aggrieved employee; thus, her complaint states a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Burak v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01971107 (1998), the Commission found the complainant stated a claim where she alleged that her former government supervisor had her fired from a private sector job:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency found that appellant: (1) was terminated from the agency in 1993; (2) filed an EEO complaint in 1994 alleging that the agency failed to select her for several positions due to her sex; (3) was hired by a private employer which was a "permittee" of the agency; (4) was terminated from the private employer in February 1995; and (5) filed the instant discrimination complaint in June 1995 concerning the February 1995 termination. Appellant alleged in her complaint that her former agency supervisor influenced the private employer to terminate appellant in retaliation for her filing a prior EEO complaint and because of her sex. Appellant explained that her former agency supervisor "has a great deal of power when it comes to the administration of a permit and controls the status of the permit in his relationship with the permittee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency found:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he complainant was not terminated by the federal government in 1995. Since the Department did not make the decision in the matter about which she complained, the complaint is dismissed because it is outside [the] purview of the regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A former employee has standing to file an EEO complaint alleging that actions taken by an agency subsequent to his termination constitute reprisal for engaging in protected EEO related activity that arose out of the previous employment with the agency, where a nexus is shown between the employee's previous employment with the agency and the alleged subsequent action by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Kaiser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950289 (Nov. 7, 1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Sternberg v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890976 (Jan, 8, 1990)). The Commission finds that the instant matter states a claim under the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Kaiser</span>. Therefore, we find that the instant complaint was improperly dismissed for failing to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120133147 (2014) (complainant stated claim for relief where she alleged agency had her employment with a contractor terminated for EEO activity while she was an agency employee).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has also been expansive in construing "personal harm" when it comes to complaints of sexual harassment by former employees. In <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01911855 (1991), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[E]ven if no direct "make whole" relief such as reinstatement with backpay can be granted to appellant, owing to her legitimate departure when the job expired under the terms of the work study program, relief of a different kind can still be granted which has the effect of keeping appellant's complaint in the status of a live controversy. This is because the agency is liable for all acts of sexual harassment by its employees under 29 CFR 1604.11(c) and has the affirmative duty under 29 CFR 1604.11(f) of taking all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring. These steps would include such measures as raising the subject with employees, particularly supervisory personnel, as part of an employee education program, expressing strong agency disapproval of such harassment, developing appropriate sanctions against offending employees, informing employees of their rights to complain about such harassment to the agency EEO counselor in complete confidence under Title VII and without fear of reprisal, and developing methods to sensitize all employees to the issue of such harassment. Hence, if appellant's complaint was accepted by the agency for investigation and found to be valid as a result of that investigation, complaint redress and relief would have to include putting into effect the measures in 29 CFR 1604.11(f) as outlined above.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission may decline to exercise jurisdiction over an appeal involving a former employee when relief for that employee is no longer possible and the complaint seeks only prospective relief on behalf of others. <span class="Italic">Harris v. USPS</span>, 01850575 (1986) (former employee complained that supervisor followed him home when complainant left work due to an emergency). See also <a href="0100-2023-12-063.html#sec3-63">Complaints on Behalf of Others</a>, below.</p>
<p class="noindent">An exception to the above rule is applied where actions taken subsequent to the termination of employment arise out of a continuing relationship based on the former employment. In <span class="Italic">Gomillion v. USPS</span>, 01850096 (1985), the appellant, a retired postal worker, alleged that the agency had informed him that he could elect to pursue a disability retirement application at any time up to one year after his voluntary retirement. Later, when appellant <span id="Page_181"></span>sought application forms for disability retirement, the agency indicated that he could not apply for disability retirement because he had chosen optional retirement. The Commission found that "[a]s long as the agency and appellant have a continuing relationship arising out of his employment or an effort to obtain employment, he may file an EEO complaint which arises out of the relationship." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Horvath v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01956761 (1996), the Commission held that receipt of the complainant's annuity was a benefit of her prior government employment and, therefore, the complainant had standing to challenge a decision by the agency to deny her a privilege arising out of her former employment. In that case, the agency had received information indicating that the complainant might not be able to properly manage the annuity payments she received. The agency then issued notice that it did not want to appoint a representative payee unnecessarily, and that it would consider all the evidence, including submissions by the appellant, before any action would be taken. Because the agency was clearly seeking additional information before making a decision on whether to appoint a representative payee, the Commission determined the letter was a preliminary step to taking a personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent">The retirement of an employee after filing an EEO complaint does not <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> deprive the agency of jurisdiction over the complaint, as long as the allegations relate to an incident or incidents which occurred during employment. <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01881209 (1988). In that case, the Commission found that the complainant had suffered a sufficient injury from a performance appraisal to be aggrieved because, in the future, he may reapply for employment with the agency or seek other employment and the appraisal could hamper his chances.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission adopted a similar rationale where an agency contends a complaint has become moot because of the subsequent removal of the employee. In <span class="Italic">Golding v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01880605 (1988), the appellant filed a complaint alleging discrimination in the form of a poor performance appraisal, harassment and denial of training. The agency canceled the complaint when the employee subsequently was removed. Finding that there would be a remedy for the oriGINAl complaint if the appellant was reinstated, the Commission vacated the agency decision and ordered the complaint consolidated with the removal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all actions taken after an employee leaves an agency, however, aggrieve that person for EEO complaint purposes. For example, denial of access to the agency grounds after a complainant is terminated does not state a claim where the complainant has no need to have access to agency facilities. <span class="Italic">Dula v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01962713 (1996). Similarly, a complainant cannot be aggrieved by the filling of bid assignments that take place after the termination of employment. <span class="Italic">See Fratini v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995285 (2001). Of course, it is worth noting that, while such bid assignments do not aggrieve the complainant for purposes of filing a complaint, they may factor into the appropriate scope of relief if the employee is reinstated subject to a finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">As mentioned previously, the circuit courts of appeals were split on the issue of Title VII coverage for former employees. In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</span> 519 U.S. 337, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed.2d 808 (1997), in an opinion authored by Justice Thomas, a unanimous Supreme Court held that Title VII coverage does extend to former employees. In <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, the defendant fired the plaintiff in 1991. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff filed a complaint of discrimination with the EEOC. While that charge was pending, a prospective employer contacted Shell Oil for a reference. The plaintiff claimed that Shell gave a negative reference in retaliation for the EEOC charge. The district court initially dismissed the retaliation claim. The Fourth Circuit reversed, but the court sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span> upheld the district court's dismissal of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Seventh Circuit had also held that Title VII did not apply to former employees, by the time the <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> case reached the Supreme Court, the Seventh Circuit had overruled its previous decision and sided with the majority of the appellate courts in holding that Title VII does apply to former employees. In adhering to the majority view, and the view advocated by the EEOC, Justice Thomas wrote in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 117 S. Ct. at 846-49:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and "the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent." <span class="Italic">United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.</span>, 489 U.S. 235, 240, 109 S. Ct. 1026, 1030, 103 L. Ed.2d 290 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain</span>, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254, 112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149-1150, 117 L. Ed.2d 391 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole. <span class="Italic">Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co.</span>, 505 U.S. 469, 477, 112 S. Ct. 2589, 2594-2595, 120 L. Ed.2d 379 (1992); <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Bronson</span>, 500 U.S. 136, 139, 111 S. Ct. 1737, 1740, 114 L. Ed.2d 194 (1991). In this case, consideration of those factors leads us to conclude that the term "employees," as used in &#x00A7; 704(a), is ambiguous as to whether it excludes former employees. At first blush, the term "employees" in &#x00A7; 704(a) would seem to refer to those having an existing employment relationship with the employer in question. <span class="Italic">Cf. Walters v. Metropolitan Ed. Enterprises, Inc.</span>, 519 U.S. __, __, 117 S. Ct. 660, 664, __ L. Ed.2d __ (1997) (interpreting the term "employees" in &#x00A7; 701(b), 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e(b)). This initial impression, however, does not withstand scrutiny in the context of &#x00A7; 704(a). First, there is no temporal qualifier in the statute such as would make plain that &#x00A7; 704(a) protects only persons still employed at the time of the retaliation. That the statute could have expressly included the phrase "former employees" does not aid our inquiry. Congress also could have used the phrase "current employees." But nowhere in Title VII is either phrase used--even where the specific context otherwise makes clear an intent to cover current or former employees. Similarly, that other statutes have been more specific in their coverage of "employees" and "former employees," <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 2 USC &#x00A7; 1301(4) (1994 ed., Supp. I) (defining "employee" to include "former employee"); 5 USC &#x00A7; 1212(a)(1) (including "employees, former employees, and applicants for employment" in the operative provision), proves only that Congress can use the unqualified term "employees" to refer only to current employees, not that it did so in this particular statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, Title VII's definition of "employee" likewise lacks any temporal qualifier and is consistent with either current or past employment. Section 701(f) defines "employee" for purposes of Title VII as "an individual employed by an employer." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e(f). The argument that the term "employed," as used in &#x00A7; 701(f), is commonly used to mean "[p]erforming work under an employer-employee relationship," Black's Law Dictionary 525 (6th ed. 1990), begs the question by implicitly reading the word "employed" to mean "is employed." But the word "employed" is not so limited in its possible meanings, and could just as easily be read to mean "was employed." Third, a number of other provisions in Title VII use the term "employees" to mean something more inclusive or different than "current employees." For example, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 706(g)(1) and 717(b) both authorize affirmative remedial action (by a court or EEOC, respectively) "which may include...reinstatement or hiring of employees." 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(1) and 2000e-16(b). As petitioner notes, because one does not "reinstat[e]" current employees, that language necessarily refers to former employees. Likewise, one may hire individuals to be employees, but one does not typically hire persons who already are employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 717(b) requires federal departments and agencies to have equal employment opportunity policies and rules, "which shall include a provision that an employee or applicant for employment shall be notified of any final action taken on any complaint of discrimination filed by him thereunder." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b). If the complaint involves discriminatory discharge, as it often does, the "employee" who must be notified is necessarily a former employee. Similarly, &#x00A7; 717(c) provides that an "employee or applicant for employment, if aggrieved by the final disposition of his complaint,...may file a civil action...." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c). Again, given that discriminatory discharge is a forbidden "personnel actio[n] affecting employees,"<span class="Italic"> see</span> &#x00A7; 717(a), 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a), the term "employee" in &#x00A7; 717(c) necessarily includes a former employee. <span class="Italic">See Loeffler v. Frank</span>, 486 U.S. 549, 108 S. Ct. 1965, 100 L. Ed.2d 549 (1988) (involving a discriminatory discharge action successfully brought under &#x00A7; 717 by a former Postal Service employee).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, there are sections of Title VII where, in context, use of the term "employee" refers unambiguously to a current employee, for example those sections addressing salary or promotions.<span class="Italic"> See</span> &#x00A7; 703(h), 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(h) (allowing different standards of compensation for "employees who work in different locations"); &#x00A7; 717(b), 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b) (directing federal agencies to establish a plan "to provide a maximum opportunity for employees to advance so as to perform at their highest potential"). But those examples at most demonstrate that the term "employees" may have a plain meaning in the context of a particular section--not that the term has the same meaning in all other sections and in all other contexts. Once it is established that the term "employees" includes former employees in some sections, but not in others, the term standing alone is necessarily ambiguous and each section must be analyzed to determine whether the context gives the term a further meaning that would resolve the issue in dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent argues that the addition of the word "his" before "employees" narrows the scope of the provision. That argument is true, so far as it goes, but it does not resolve the question before us--namely, in what time frame must the employment relationship exist. The phrase "his employees" could include "his" former employees, but still exclude persons who have never worked for the particular employer being charged with retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor are we convinced by respondent's argument that Congress' inclusion in &#x00A7; 704(a) of "applicants for employment" as persons distinct from "employees," coupled with its failure to include "former employees," is evidence of congressional intent not to include former employees. The use of the term "applicants" in &#x00A7; 704(a) does not serve to confine, by negative inference, the temporal scope of the term "employees." Respondent's argument rests on the incorrect premise that the term <span id="Page_182"></span>"applicants" is equivalent to the phrase "future employees." But the term "applicants" would seem to cover many persons who will not become employees. Unsuccessful applicants or those who turn down a job offer, for example, would have been applicants, but not future employees. And the term fails to cover certain future employees who may be offered and will accept jobs without having to apply for those jobs. Because the term "applicants" in &#x00A7; 704(a) is not synonymous with the phrase "future employees," there is no basis for engaging in the further (and questionable) negative inference that inclusion of the term "applicants" demonstrates intentional exclusion of former employees. Finally, the use of the term "individual" in &#x00A7; 704(a), as well as in &#x00A7; 703(a), 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a), provides no meaningful assistance in resolving this case. To be sure, "individual" is a broader term than "employee" and would facially seem to cover a former employee. But it would also encompass a present employee as well as other persons who have never had an employment relationship with the employer at issue. The term "individual," therefore, does not seem designed to capture former employees, as distinct from current employees, and its use provides no insight into whether the term "employees" is limited only to current employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finding that the term "employees" in &#x00A7; 704(a) is ambiguous, we are left to resolve that ambiguity. The broader context provided by other sections of the statute provides considerable assistance in this regard. As noted above, several sections of the statute plainly contemplate that former employees will make use of the remedial mechanisms of Title VII<span class="Italic">. See supra</span>, at 846-847. Indeed, &#x00A7; 703(a) expressly includes discriminatory "discharge" as one of the unlawful employment practices against which Title VII is directed. 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a). Insofar as &#x00A7; 704(a) expressly protects employees from retaliation for filing a "charge" under Title VII, and a charge under &#x00A7; 703(a) alleging unlawful discharge would necessarily be brought by a former employee, it is far more consistent to include former employees within the scope of "employees" protected by &#x00A7; 704(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In further support of this view, petitioner argues that the word "employees" includes former employees because to hold otherwise would effectively vitiate much of the protection afforded by &#x00A7; 704(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief for Petitioner 20-30. This is also the position taken by EEOC<span class="Italic">. See</span> Brief for United States and EEOC as <span class="Italic">Amici Curiae</span> 16-25; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 2 EEOC Compliance Manual &#x00A7; 614.7(f). According to EEOC, exclusion of former employees from the protection of &#x00A7; 704(a) would undermine the effectiveness of Title VII by allowing the threat of post-employment retaliation to deter victims of discrimination from complaining to EEOC, and would provide a perverse incentive for employers to fire employees who might bring Title VII claims. Brief for United States and EEOC as <span class="Italic">Amici Curiae</span> 18-21.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Those arguments carry persuasive force given their coherence and their consistency with a primary purpose of antiretaliation provisions: Maintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms. <span class="Italic">Cf. NLRB v. Scrivener</span>, 405 U.S. 117, 121-122, 92 S. Ct. 798, 800-801, 31 L. Ed.2d 79 (1972) (National Labor Relations Act); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc.</span>, 361 U.S. 288, 292-293, 80 S. Ct. 332, 335-336, 4 L. Ed.2d 323 (1960) (Fair Labor Standards Act). EEOC quite persuasively maintains that it would be destructive of this purpose of the antiretaliation provision for an employer to be able to retaliate with impunity against an entire class of acts under Title VII--for example, complaints regarding discriminatory termination. We agree with these contentions and find that they support the inclusive interpretation of "employees" in &#x00A7; 704(a) that is already suggested by the broader context of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that the term "employees," as used in &#x00A7; 704(a) of Title VII, is ambiguous as to whether it includes former employees. It being more consistent with the broader context of Title VII and the primary purpose of &#x00A7; 704(a), we hold that former employees are included within &#x00A7; 704(a)'s coverage. Accordingly, the decision of the Fourth Circuit is reversed. It is so ordered.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> does not mean that a former employee will be aggrieved by everything a former employer could possibly do, and much of the Commission's earlier case law will remain intact in terms of determining if the employee is actually aggrieved. But, the Commission has applied the <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> doctrine to an agency that allegedly had a former employee terminated from private sector employment in retaliation for filing a complaint. <span class="Italic">Burak v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01971107 (1998).</p>
