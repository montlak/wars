<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-53"><span class="space">a.</span> Taxability of Back Pay and Damages</h5>
<p class="noindent">For the first few years after compensatory damages became available under Title VII, the state of the law was unsettled. Although compensatory damages were exempted from the Internal Revenue Service definition of gross income, moves were made several times in Congress to eliminate that exemption. The law now is settled. Under Pub. L. No. 104-188, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, the IRS code was amended such that compensatory damages for emotional distress under Title VII are now considered gross income and, thus, are taxable. The evolution of law on taxability of damages, as well as the current state of the law, is discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 112 S. Ct. 1827 (1992), a pre-1991 Act case, the Supreme Court held that all monetary relief obtained under Title VII is taxable income. Specifically, the Court held that back pay under Title VII was not covered by 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, which exempts "the amount of any damages received...on account of personal injuries or illness." The Court found the exemption applied only to "tort or tort type rights" and that Title VII did not create tort-like remedies for victims of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in 1993, the Internal Revenue Service issued an interpretation of Title VII, as amended by the 1991 Civil Rights Act, that excluded awards for intentional discrimination from the definition of gross income. IRS Rev. Rul. 93-88. Specifically, the IRS found that under the 1991 legislation, even an award intended as compensation for back pay was not subject to income tax. That ruling later was suspended by IRS Rev. Rul. 95-45, August 3, 1995, after the Supreme Court decided the <span class="Italic">Schleier</span> case, discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the Commission had never embraced the notion that awards under Title VII could be characterized as damages for personal injury as opposed to back pay, and therefore, not subject to taxation. Because prior to the 1991 Civil Rights Act, neither compensatory nor punitive damages were available under Title VII, there was little foundation for avoiding taxes by attempting to characterize any recovery under Title VII as something other than wages. In <span class="Italic">Burke v. United States</span>, 112 S. Ct. 1827 (1992), a case not involving the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the Supreme Court held that damage awards under Title VII could not be characterized as damages for personal injury and, thus, could not be exempt from income tax. Prior to the <span class="Italic">Burke</span> decision, two courts had held that damage awards in discrimination cases could be characterized as damages for personal injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pistillo v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, 912 F.2d 145 (6th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Rickel v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, 900 F.2d 655 (3d Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">In Rev. Rul. 93-88, the IRS found that <span class="Italic">Burke</span> was not controlling where the claim was brought under the 1991 Civil Rights Act and involved an allegation of intentional discrimination, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, disparate treatment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 112 S. Ct. 1827 (1992), the Supreme Court considered the excludability of damages received for disparate impact gender discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act as in effect prior to the 1991 amendment. Pursuant to section 2000e-5(g), the taxpayers in <span class="Italic">Burke</span> received only backpay. The Court stated that regulation section 1.104-1(c) has "linked the identification of a personal injury for purposes of &#x00A7; 104(a)(20 to traditional tort principles." 112 S. Ct. at 1870. The Court made clear that discrimination can constitute a personal injury for purposes of section 104(a)(2) if the relevant cause of action provides a tort-like remedy. It then examined the nature of a traditional tort and concluded that the most important characteristic was the availability of a broad range of damages, such as damages for emotional distress, pain and suffering, and punitive damages where appropriate. 112 S. Ct. at 1870-72. Because such broad range of damages was not available under the pre-1991 Title VII remedy, back pay under section 2000e-5(g), was not excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(2) of the Code as damages received on account of personal injury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Burke</span> contrasted pre-1991 Title VII with section 1981, which provides for a full range of compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages in appropriate cases. The Court at 112 S. Ct. 1873-74, indicated that all amounts recovered under section 1981, including back pay, would be excluded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII, as amended in 1991, permits a victim of disparate treatment discrimination not covered by section 1981 to recover, in addition to back pay, a full range of compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages where appropriate. Thus, Title VII and section 1981 currently provide the broad range of traditional tort remedies that the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Burke</span> said would warrant excludability under section 104(a)(2) of the Code.</p>
<p class="noindent">Initially, it was not clear how any of this applied to the ADEA, as discussed more fully below. However, the U.S. Tax Court reached a similar holding under the ADEA, finding that its tort-like remedies excluded awards for age discrimination from the definition of gross income. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Downey v. Commissioner</span>, 100 T.C. 634 (June 29, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior the amendment of Title VII, the Commission had consistently held that awards were subject to taxation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Branson v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01892298 (1989), the complainant accepted a "lump sum cash settlement in lieu of back pay...which does not include state or federal tax deductions...." The agreement also provided that the complainant would be responsible for any such taxes. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Branson</span> alleged that the agency breached the settlement agreement when it reported the lump sum settlement to the IRS and he was subsequently forced to pay taxes on it:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds the appellant seeks to have the $6800.00 received under the terms of the settlement agreement classified as compensatory damages for damage to his character so that he need not pay taxes on it. (See IRS Pub. 17, pp. 75-76 in record.) The Commission takes cognizance, however, of a circuit court ruling that a plaintiff in a Title VII action may not recover compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Keller v. Prince George's County Department of Social Services</span>, 827 F.2d 952 (4th Cir. 1987). Here, the court held that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Title VII grants authority only for equitable relief. Monetary relief available to a Title VII claimant is typically limited to an award for backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 955.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Commission finds that the equitable relief to be given in Title VII discrimination cases is only that which will make the complainant "whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination." <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405 at 418 (1975). The bottom line in the instant case, then, is whether the sum awarded appellant by the settlement agreement put him in the position he would have been in but for the discrimination he suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission concludes that the answer is yes in that the sum awarded appellant is the extra sum he would have received in wages had he not been discriminated against. The Commission further finds the sum awarded to be in the nature of back pay rather than compensatory damages which are excluded by Title VII, and that, therefore, the sum awarded is taxable by the IRS as equivalent to back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the payment of a lump sum back pay award resulted in greater tax liability than would have occurred if the monies had been received when due, this also was regarded as consequential damages and was not compensable under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kalra v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01901664 (1990). But see section on "<span class="blue">Tax Consequences</span>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission was not clear on whether awards in ADEA settlements could be structured in such a way that they would not be regarded as income subject to taxation. In a confusing decision due to lack of detail, the Commission held that the agency breached a settlement agreement under the ADEA by not fully refunding all withholdings after determining that a monetary settlement was not taxable income. <span class="Italic">See Gaughan v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01913069 (1991). In that case, the complainant agreed to retire and the agency agreed to give the complainant $20,000 to be "applied as back salary for the three highest years of earnings from the date of retirement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission's decision only states that the agency originally determined the award was taxable income, but "due to recent court decisions, the award should properly be considered a personal injury award which is excluded from income and not subject to taxation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission did not independently determine whether the award should be characterized as a personal injury award, but accepted the representations of the parties on that point.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant's victory in <span class="Italic">Gaughan</span> was short-lived. On reconsideration, the Commission reversed itself, finding that the parties intended the $20,000 as back pay. <span class="Italic">Gaughan v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05920163 (1992), states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the previous decision erred in finding that the agency had to take further action in order to comply with the settlement agreement. In the present case, the settlement agreement dated October 2, 1989, required the agency to pay "the sum of $20,000 to be applied as back salary for the three highest years of earnings from the date of retirement." The record reveals that the agency implemented the agreement by making a back pay adjustment in Pay Period 3/1990 in the gross amount of $15,038.24 representing earnings from Pay Period 19/1987 through Pay Period 25/19-89. After deductions for Medicare, Civil Service Retirement, Thrift Fund Account, and taxes, appellant received a net payment of approximately $10,163. The record also shows that a gross amount of approximately $5,086 was <span id="Page_1744"></span>paid to appellant on a biweekly basis with his regular salary payments from Pay Period 26/1989 to the date of his retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission agrees with the agency that it complied with the terms of the settlement agreement by issuing the back pay adjustments and making the various withholdings. Although appellant argues, in effect, that he should have received a net amount of $20,000, the Commission finds that if this had been appellant's expectation, this expectation should have been reduced to writing as part of the settlement agreement. In this regard, the Commission concurs with the agency's assertions that monies were withheld for Civil Service Retirement and the Thrift Fund Account in order to comply with the retirement aspect of the settlement agreement. That the agency's actions complied with the intent of the settlement agreement is evidenced by appellant's letter dated October 3, 1989, wherein appellant stated that it was his understanding that the $20,000 back salary "shall be considered a regular part of (appellant's) salary for purposes of computating [sic] his pension benefits...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also shows that the agency withheld Federal taxes from the $20,000 "back salary" because at the time the settlement agreement was implemented, it was the understanding of all the parties that such settlement amounts would be subject to Federal tax liability. The Commission finds it significant that appellant did not challenge the agency's withholding of Federal taxes until August 1990 when he presented the agency with copies of the recent decisions in <span class="Italic">Pistillo</span> and <span class="Italic">Rickel</span>. The fact that after the settlement agreement was implemented there may have been a change in the interpretation of the law regarding the taxability of monetary settlements in ADEA suits in the Circuit where appellant resides, did not require the agency to, in effect, rewrite the terms of the settlement agreement to comply with the new interpretation of the law. The present case does not present the situation where the parties have executed a settlement agreement based on a mutual mistake of fact regarding the implementation of an agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Asberry v. United States</span>, 692 F.2d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1982). The Commission emphasizes, however, that the provisions of a settlement agreement cannot operate to shelter the parties from any tax liabilities if the Internal Revenue Service, in its capacity as tax collecting authority determines that amounts awarded pursuant to a settlement agreement constitute "income" for tax purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency's Request to Reopen was pending before the Commission, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, __U.S.__, 60 U.S.L.W. 4404 (May 26, 1992). In <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, the Court held that "backpay awards received by respondents in settlement of their Title VII claims are not excludable from gross income as 'damages received...on account of personal injuries' under 104(a)(2)" of the Internal Revenue Code. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 4407. As noted <span class="Italic">supra</span>...the Commission is not relying on the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, however, as its basis for granting the agency's Request to Reopen and holding that it was proper for the agency to withhold Federal taxes from the $20,000 "back salary." Rather, the Commission finds that the agency properly made deductions for Federal tax when the settlement agreement was implemented because that was the intent of the parties as expressed in the settlement agreement dated October 2, 1989. As noted <span class="Italic">supra</span>...there is no indication in the record that the provisions of the settlement agreement violate any law or public policy. Accordingly, the Commission reverses its previous decision which found that further action was required by the agency in order to comply with the settlement agreement. Consequently, the Commission grants the agency's Request to Reopen.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's reconsideration decision in <span class="Italic">Gaughan</span> was not based on the premise that the ADEA prohibits awards for personal injury, nor was it based upon the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Burke</span>. Rather, it was based on the language of the specific agreement involved and the Commission's interpretation that the parties intended the award to be in the form of back pay. It is not clear whether the Commission's initial decision in <span class="Italic">Gaughan</span> can be understood to stand for the proposition that it will approve tax-exempting clauses in ADEA, if that is the clear intent of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Schleier</span>, 115 S. Ct. 2159, 2163-67 (1995), the Supreme Court resolved all confusion by ruling that the ADEA did not provide for tort-like remedies and, therefore, awards under the ADEA were subject to taxation as income. In deciding that no part of an ADEA settlement provided the plaintiff with compensation that was not subject to income tax, the Court in <span class="Italic">Schleier</span> wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent recognizes &#x00A7; 61(a)'s "sweeping" definition and concedes that his settlement constitutes gross income unless it is expressly excepted by another provision in the Code. Respondent claims, however, that his settlement proceeds are excluded from &#x00A7; 6.1(a)'s reach by 26 USC &#x00A7; 104(a). Section 104(a) provides an exclusion for five categories of "compensation for personal injuries or sickness." Respondent argues that his settlement award falls within the second of those categories, which excludes from gross income "the amount of any damages received...on account of personal injuries or sickness." &#x00A7; 104(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the plain language of the statute undermines respondent's contention. Consideration of a typical recovery in a personal injury case illustrates the usual meaning of "on account of personal injuries." Assume that a taxpayer is in an automobile accident, is injured, and as a result of that injury suffers (a) medical expenses, (b) lost wages, and (c) pain, suffering, and emotional distress that cannot be measured with precision. If the taxpayer settles a resulting lawsuit for $30,000 (and if the taxpayer has not previously deducted her medical expenses,<span class="Italic"> see</span> &#x00A7; 104(a)), the entire $30,000 would be excludable under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2). The medical expenses for injuries arising out of the accident clearly constitute damages received "on account of personal injuries." Similarly, the portion of the settlement intended to compensate for pain and suffering constitutes damages "on account of personal injury." Finally, the recovery for lost wages is also excludable as being "on account of personal injuries," as long as the lost wages resulted from time in which the taxpayer was out of work as a result of her injuries. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Threlkeld v. Commissioner</span>, 87 T.C. 1294, 1300, 1986 WL 22061 (1986) (hypothetical surgeon who loses finger through tortious conduct may exclude any recovery for lost wages because "[t]his injury...will also undoubtedly cause special damages including loss of future income"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 848 F.2d 81 (CA6 1988). The critical point this hypothetical illustrates is that each element of the settlement is recoverable not simply because the taxpayer received a tort settlement, but rather because each element of the settlement satisfies the requirement set forth in 104(a)(2) (and in all of the other subsections of &#x00A7; 104(a)) that the damages were received "on account of personal injuries or sickness."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, no part of respondent's ADEA settlement is excludable under the plain language of &#x00A7; 104(a)(2). Respondent's recovery of back wages, though at first glance comparable to our hypothetical accident victim's recovery of lost wages, does not fall within &#x00A7; 104(a)(2)'s exclusion because it does not satisfy the critical requirement of being "on account of personal injury or sickness." Whether one treats respondent's attaining the age of 60 or his being laid off on account of his age as the proximate cause of respondent's loss of income, neither the birthday nor the discharge can fairly be described as a "personal injury" or "sickness." Moreover, though respondent's unlawful termination may have caused some psychological or "personal" injury comparable to the intangible pain and suffering caused by an automobile accident, it is clear that no part of respondent's recovery of back wages is attributable to that injury. Thus, in our automobile hypothetical, the accident causes a personal injury which in turn causes a loss of wages. In age discrimination, the discrimination causes both personal injury and loss of wages, but neither is linked to the other. The amount of back wages recovered is completely independent of the existence or extent of any personal injury. In short, &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) does not permit the exclusion of respondent's back wages because the recovery of back wages was not "on account of" any personal injury and because no personal injury affected the amount of back wages recovered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent suggests, nonetheless, that the liquidated damages portion of his settlement fits comfortably within the plain language of &#x00A7; 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. He cites our observation in <span class="Italic">Overnight Motor Transportation Co. v. Missel</span>, 316 U.S. 572, 62 S. Ct. 1216, 86 L. Ed. 1682 (1942), that liquidated damages under the FLSA "are compensation, not a penalty or punishment," and that such damages might compensate for "damages too obscure and difficult of proof for estimate."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 583-584, 62 S. Ct., at 1223;<span class="Italic"> see also</span> <span class="Italic">Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O'Neil,</span> 324 U.S. 697, 707, 65 S. Ct. 895, 902, 89 L. Ed. 1296 (1945). He argues that Congress must be presumed to have known of our interpretation of liquidated damages when it incorporated FLSA's liquidated damages provision into the ADEA, and that Congress must therefore have intended that liquidated damages under the ADEA serve, at least in part, to compensate plaintiffs for personal injuries that are difficult to quantify.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with respondent that if Congress had intended the ADEA's liquidated damages to compensate plaintiffs for personal injuries, those damages might well come within &#x00A7; 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. There are, however, two weaknesses in respondent's argument. First, even if we assume that Congress was aware of the Court's observation in <span class="Italic">Overnight Motor</span> that the liquidated damages authorized by the FLSA might provide compensation for some "obscure" injuries, it does not necessarily follow that Congress would have understood that observation as referring to injuries that were personal rather than economic. Second, and more importantly, we have previously rejected respondent's argument: We have already concluded that the liquidated damages provisions of the ADEA were a significant departure from those in the FLSA,<span class="Italic"> see Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S., at 581, 98 S. Ct., at 870; <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,</span> 469 U.S., at 126, 105 S. Ct., at 624, and we explicitly held in <span class="Italic">Thurston</span>: "Congress intended for liquidated damages to be punitive in nature."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 125, 105 S. Ct., at 624.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our holding in <span class="Italic">Thurston</span> disposes of respondent's argument and requires the conclusion that liquidated damages under the ADEA, like back wages under the ADEA, are not received "on account of personal injury or sickness."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent seeks to circumvent the plain language of &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) by relying on the Commissioner's regulation interpreting that section. <span id="Page_1745"></span>Section 1.104-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations, 26 CFR &#x00A7; 1.104-1(c) (1994), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Section 104(a)(2) [of the Internal Revenue Code] excludes from gross income the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or agreement) on account of personal injuries or sickness. The term 'damages received (whether by suit or agreement)' means an amount received (other than workmen's compensation) through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort or tort type rights, or through a settlement agreement entered into in lieu of such prosecution."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent contends that an action to recover damages for a violation of the ADEA is "based upon tort or tort type rights" as those terms are used in that regulation, and that his settlement is thus excludable under the plain language of the regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we accept respondent's characterization of the action, but<span class="Italic"> see infra</span>, at 11-13, there is no basis for excluding the proceeds of his settlement from his gross income. The regulatory requirement that the amount be received in a tort type action is not a substitute for the statutory requirement that the amount be received "on account of personal injuries or sickness"; it is an additional requirement. Indeed, the statutory requirement is repeated in the regulation. As the Commissioner argues in her brief, an exclusion from gross income is authorized by the regulation "only when it both (i) was received through prosecution or settlement of an 'action based upon tort or tort type rights'...and (ii) was received 'on account of personal injuries or sickness."' We need not decide whether the Commissioner would have authority to dispense entirely with the statutory requirement, because she disclaims any intent to do so, and the text of the regulation does not belie her disclaimer. Thus, respondent's reliance on the text of the regulation is unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent also suggests that our decision in <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 504 U.S. 229, 112 S. Ct. 1867, 119 L. Ed.2d 34 (1992), compels the conclusion that his settlement award is excludable. In <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, we rejected the taxpayer's argument that the payment received in settlement of her backpay claim under the pre-1991 version of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was excludable from her gross income. Our decision rested on the conclusion that such a claim was not based upon "tort or tort type rights" within the meaning of the regulation quoted above. For two independent reasons, we think <span class="Italic">Burke</span> provides no foundation for respondent's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, respondent's ADEA recovery is not based upon "tort or tort type rights" as that term was construed in <span class="Italic">Burke</span>. In <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, we examined the remedial scheme established by the pre-1991 version of Title VII. Noting that "Title VII does not allow awards for compensatory or punitive damages," and that "instead, it limits available remedies to backpay, injunctions, and other equitable relief," we concluded that Title VII was not tort-like because it addressed "'legal injuries of an economic character.'" 504 U.S., at 238, 239, 112 S. Ct., at 1873, 1873.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent points to two elements of the ADEA that he argues distinguish it from the remedial scheme at issue in <span class="Italic">Burke</span>: First, the ADEA provides for jury trial, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(b); <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S., at 585, 98 S. Ct., at 872; <span class="Italic">but cf. Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 156, 101 S. Ct. 2698, 69 L. Ed.2d 548 (1981); and second, the ADEA allows for liquidated damages. We do not believe that these features of the ADEA are sufficient to bring it within <span class="Italic">Burke's</span> conception of a "tort type righ[t]." It is true, as respondent notes, that we emphasized in <span class="Italic">Burke</span> the lack of a right to a jury trial and the absence of any provision for punitive damages as factors distinguishing the pre-1991 Title VII action from traditional tort litigation,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, 504 U.S., at 238-240, 112 S. Ct., at 1872-1874. We did not, however, indicate that the presence of either or both of those factors would be sufficient to bring a statutory claim within the coverage of the regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, respondent's argument gives insufficient attention to what the <span class="Italic">Burke</span> Court recognized as the primary characteristic of an "action based upon...tort type rights": the availability of compensatory remedies. Indeed, we noted that "one of the hallmarks of traditional tort liability is the availability of a broad range of damages to compensate the plaintiff 'fairly for injuries caused by the violation of his legal rights.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 235, 112 S. Ct., at 1871. We continued: "Although these damages often are described in compensatory terms...in many cases they are larger than the amount necessary to reimburse actual monetary loss sustained or even anticipated by the plaintiff, and thus redress intangible elements of injury that are deemed important, even though not pecuniary in [their] immediate consequence[s]." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. (internal quotation marks omitted). Against this background, we found critical that the pre-1991 version of Title VII provided no compensation "for any of the other traditional harms associated with personal injury, such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, harm to reputation, or other consequential damages."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 239, 112 S. Ct., at 1873.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the pre-1991 version of Title VII, the ADEA provides no compensation "for any of the other traditional harms associated with personal injury." Monetary remedies under the ADEA are limited to back wages, which are clearly of an "economic character," and liquidated damages, which we have already noted serve no compensatory function. Thus, though this is a closer case than <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, we conclude that a recovery under the ADEA is not one that is "based upon tort or tort type rights."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, and more importantly, the holding of <span class="Italic">Burke</span> is narrower than respondent suggests. In <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, following the framework established in the IRS regulations, we noted that &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) requires a determination whether the underlying action is "based upon tort or tort type rights." <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 504 U.S., at 234, 112 S. Ct. at 1870. In so doing, however, we did not hold that the inquiry into "tort or tort type rights" constituted the beginning and end of the analysis. In particular, though <span class="Italic">Burke</span> relied on Title VII's failure to qualify as an action based upon tort type rights, we did not intend to eliminate the basic requirement found in both the statute and the regulation that only amounts received "on account of personal illness or sickness" come within &#x00A7; 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. Thus, though satisfaction of <span class="Italic">Burke's</span> "tort or tort type" inquiry is a necessary condition for excludability under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2), it is not a sufficient condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the plain language of &#x00A7; 104(a)(2), the text of the applicable regulation, and our decision in <span class="Italic">Burke</span> establish two independent requirements that a taxpayer must meet before a recovery may be excluded under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2). First, the taxpayer must demonstrate that the underlying cause of action giving rise to the recovery is "based upon tort or tort type rights"; and second, the taxpayer must show that the damages were received "on account of personal injuries or sickness." For the reasons discussed above, we believe that respondent has failed to satisfy either requirement, and thus no part of his settlement is excludable under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1996, through Pub. L. No. 104-188, the IRS code was amended so that compensatory damages for emotional distress, when not the result of physical injury or sickness, are now considered gross income and taxable. The IRS code at 26 USC 104(a)(2), as amended, now reads:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Except in the case of amounts attributable to (and not excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 for any prior taxable year, gross income does not include--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the amount of any damages (other than punitive damages) received (whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or periodic payments) on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness.</p>
<p class="noindent">In other words, in order for damages for emotional distress to be considered as nontaxable, they must be the result of physical injuries or physical sickness. All amounts not excluded from the definition of gross income are included. Any amount included as gross income is taxable.</p>
<p class="noindent">The IRS clarified the meaning of the new statute through Rev. Rul. 96-65:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[1]&#x2003;Are amounts received in satisfaction of a claim for denial of a promotion due to disparate treatment employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991 (Title VII), excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">LAW AND ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[2]&#x2003;In general, section 61(a) provides that, except as otherwise provided by law, gross income includes all income from whatever source derived.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[3]&#x2003;Section 104(a)(2), as amended by section 1605 of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act) 110 Stat. 1755, 1838, provides generally that gross income does not include the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or agreement) on account of personal PHYSICAL injuries or PHYSICAL sickness. Section 104(a) further provides that, for purposes of paragraph (2), emotional distress is not treated as a physical injury or physical sickness except to the extent of damages paid for medical care (described in 213(d)(1)(A) or (B)) attributable to emotional distress. The 1996 Act amendments to section 104(a) apply to amounts received after August 20, 1996, but not to amounts received under a written binding agreement, court decree, or mediation award in effect on (or issued on or before) September 13, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[4]&#x2003;Before its amendment by the 1996 Act, former section 104(a)(2) provided generally that gross income does not include the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or agreement) on account of personal injuries or sickness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[5]&#x2003;Section 1.104-1(c) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that the term "damages received (whether by suit or agreement)" means an amount received (other than workmen's compensation) through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort or tort type rights, or through a settlement agreement entered into in lieu of such prosecution.</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1746"></span>[7]&#x2003;In light of <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, the Service issued Rev.

All three of these statutes provide a broad range of compensatory damages of the type the Supreme Court focused upon in <span class="Italic">Burke</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[8]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Commissioner v. Schleier</span>, 515 U.S., 115 S. Ct. 2159 (1995), the Supreme Court held that back pay and liquidated damages received to settle a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 USC section 621-634 (ADEA), are not excludable from gross income under former section 104(a)(2). The Court concluded that former section 104(a)(2) and its regulations set forth two requirements for a recovery to be excludable from gross income: (1) it must be based on tort or tort type rights, and (2) it must be received "on account of personal injuries or sickness.' The Court held that back pay and liquidated damages received under the ADEA met neither requirement because (1) the ADEA does not compensate for any of the other traditional tort harms associated with personal injury, (2) the back pay is completely independent of the existence or extent of any personal injury, and (3) the ADEA liquidated damages are punitive in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[9]&#x2003;Based on Schleier, Notice 95-45, 1995-2 C.B. 330, suspended Rev. Rul. 93-88, and added section 5.05 to Rev. Proc. 95-3 1995-1 C.E. 385, to provide that pending issuance of published guidance, the Service will not issue rulings or determination letters on whether amounts received are excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(2) in situations affected by Schleier.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[10]&#x2003;In light of Schleier, and the amendment of section 104(a)(2) by the 1996 Act, the Internal Revenue Service has reconsidered Rev. Rul. 93-88.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[11]&#x2003;HOLDINGS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Current section 104(a)(2). Back pay received in satisfaction of a claim for denial of a promotion due to disparate treatment employment discrimination under Title VII is not excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(2) because it is completely independent of, and thus is not damages received on account of, personal physical injuries or physical sickness under that section. Similarly, amounts received for emotional distress in satisfaction of such a claim are not excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(2), except to the extent they are damages paid for medical care (as described in section 213-(d)(1)(A) or (B)) attributable to emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;Former section 104(a)(2). Back pay received in satisfaction of a claim for denial of a promotion due to disparate treatment employment discrimination under Title VII is not excludable from gross income under former section 104(a)(2) because it is completely independent of, and thus is not damages received on account of personal injuries or sickness under that section. However, damages received for emotional distress in satisfaction of such a claim are excludable from gross income under former section 104(a)(2) because they are received "on account of personal injuries or sickness."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;Wages and compensation. Back pay includable in gross income under Holding (1) or (2) is "wages" for purposes of section 3121 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)), section 3306 (Federal (Unemployment Tax Act (PTITA)), and section 1401 (federal income tax withholding), and is "compensation" for purposes of section 3231 (Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[12]&#x2003;Rev. Rul. 93-88 is obsolete. Notice 95-45 is superseded. Rev. Rul. 72-341, 1972-2 C.B. 32, and Rev. Rul. 84-92, 1984-1 C.B. 204, which hold that amounts received to settle a claim under pre-1991 Title VII are (1) includible in gross income as compensation, (2) "wages" for FICA, FUTA, and federal income tax withholding purposes, and (3) "compensation" for RRTA purposes, are obsolete. Rev. Proc. 96-3, 1996-1 I.R.B. 82, is clarified to delete section 5.05.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[13]&#x2003;Pursuant to the authority contained in section 7805(b), this revenue ruling will not apply adversely to damages received under any provision of law providing tort or tort type remedies for employment discrimination for race, color, religion, gender, national origin, or other similar classifications, if the damages are received (1) on or before June 14, 1995, the date that Schleier was decided by the Supreme Court, or (2) pursuant to written binding agreement, court decree or mediation award in effect on (or issued before) June 14, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent">The bottom-line is that compensatory damages for emotional distress are taxable. Of course, the Revenue Ruling does hold open, at least theoretically, the possibility that someone could suffer physical injury or sickness as the result of discrimination and that emotional distress could be attributed to that injury or sickness. Although that would seem unlikely, some possibility might exist in sexual harassment cases where there is actual touching, or in cases under the Rehabilitation Act where a failure to make reasonable accommodation could result in exacerbation of an existing physical injury or sickness.</p>
