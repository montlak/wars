<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-107"><span class="space">5.</span> Cessation of Conduct</h4>
<p class="noindent">A complaint of sexual harassment is not moot because the RMO has ceased the alleged offensive conduct. <span class="Italic">See Hill v. USPS</span>, 01860314 (1986). The agency may not dismiss the complaint based on a failure to prosecute in good faith, even though the employee acknowledges that the offending sexual conversations ceased. "[A]n employee who alleges that she has been harassed in the workplace for reasons prohibited by Title VII...has alleged a distinct and palpable injury to herself." <span class="Italic">Wilkins v. USPS</span>, 01873371 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Warth v. Seldin</span>, 422 U.S. 490 (1975)).</p>
<p class="noindent">While "[i]t is axiomatic that appropriate corrective action for sexual harassment would include cessation of the sexual harassment," the issue with respect to dismissal of the complaint is whether the complainant received full relief. <span class="Italic">Eastland v. USPS</span>, 01873334 (1987). In that case, the Commission held that counseling and suspension of the offender were not full relief to the complainant because they "did not eliminate the harassment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">What the Commission appears to envision as full relief is not only cessation of the offending conduct, but some reasonable assurance that it will not repeat itself in the future. This assurance extends not only to the victim of harassment who has filed the complaint, but to other potential victims in the agency. In <span class="Italic">Latham v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01902708 (1990), the Commission refused to find a complaint was moot where the offending supervisor had since left the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he agency seems to believe that by simply conceding that harassment occurred that it can escape publicly acknowledging that fact and can avoid providing appellant with any relief (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, attorney's fees). According to the agency, since the harassment occurred more than three years ago and [the] supervisor...no longer is at the agency, posting a notice of discrimination would "not serve its intended purpose nor be remedial in nature." However, if we were to accept the agency's arguments this not only would give appellant an empty victory but also could discourage other employees who may have been (or currently are being) similarly harassed from bringing the matter to the attention of management officials. Thus, although [the] supervisor...has retired and appellant has been reassigned to another supervisor who appears to treat her in a professional manner..., the Commission maintains an ongoing interest to determine whether the agency has taken steps to ensure that the complained of conduct is not repeated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the Commission believes that in addition to making a particular victim of discrimination whole, a remedy should be "tailored to cure or correct the particular source of the identified discrimination and minimize the chance of its recurrence." <span class="Italic">Appendix A to 29 CFR Part 1613--Policy Statement on Remedies and Relief for Individual Cases of Unlawful Discrimination</span>. This is particularly true where, as here, there has been a finding of sexual harassment creating a hostile working environment. Accordingly, since agencies are obligated to take steps to prevent sexual harassment in the first instance and resolutely remedy it when it occurs, the remedies required oftentimes extend beyond the individual circumstances of the particular complainant. Moreover, the Commission finds that where there has been a violation of a statute which it enforces, requiring the offending agency to post a notice admitting its discrimination serves to remind the agency of its obligation to uphold and enforce EEO laws and, particularly in regard to sexual harassment, discourages the recurrence of such unlawful conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency was ordered to continue training all management and supervisory personnel on their responsibilities to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment, post a violation notice, and award the complainant reasonable attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Cessation of the conduct does not necessarily mean that the agency's remedial steps have been effective. In <span class="Italic">Pruden v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01970573 (2000), the Commission found that although the conduct ceased after the agency suspended the harasser and required him to issue a formal letter of apology, the complainant was unable to work in the area where the harassment took place, and the agency was therefore required to reassign her.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ranivand v. Secretary of State</span>, 01A02017 (2000), the Commission found that the agency's detail of the alleged harasser did not render the complaint moot. Although the detail temporarily caused the conduct to cease, the Commission held that the temporary assignment "did not provide a reasonable expectation that the alleged harassment will not recur." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kyriazi v. Secretary of Defense, DLA</span>, 05930086 (1994), the Commission considered the agency's contention that cessation of the offending harassment made the complaint moot. The Commission noted two problems with the agency's argument. First, mere cessation of the conduct does not mean the agency made reasonable assurances that the conduct will not recur. Moreover, the agency's reorganization, which placed the complainant under another supervisor, did not completely eradicate the effects of past discrimination where the complaint was seeking compensatory damages. In <span class="Italic">Kyriazi</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues, in pertinent part, that appellant has admitted that the harassment at issue ceased upon the intervention of the Commander in approximately January, 1992. The agency further states that the allegation is moot as appellant is now under a different supervisor pursuant to a reorganization in March, 1991. In her request, appellant argues that her statements were misinterpreted and that the harassment did not entirely stop. Appellant further indicates that although she has a different first-level supervisor, her prior supervisor is still able to harass her as they still work in the same area. Based on the record evidence available, the Commission is not convinced that there is no reasonable expectation that the harassment at issue could recur even though appellant now has a different supervisor, given that appellant and the alleged harasser still work in the same division. In this regard, the Commission has considered appellant's contention that her previous supervisor's subordinates, her coworkers, were also involved in the alleged harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Commission finds that interim events have not completely eradicated the effects of the alleged violation. In this regard, the Commission notes that the previous decision stated, in response to appellant's claim on appeal for compensatory damages to remedy the alleged harassment, that compensatory damages were not available under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 for pre-Act conduct, citing EEOC Policy Guidance on Application of Damages Provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to Pending Charges and Pre-Act Conduct (December 27, 1991). However, in light of the subsequent rescission of the above cited Policy Guidance, the Commission concludes that the allegation at issue may not be found moot given the potential availability of compensatory damages under the Act<span class="Italic">. See</span> Rescission of Policy Guidance on Application of Damages Provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to Pending Charges and Pre-Act Conduct (April 19, 1993); <span class="Italic">Blumner v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922527 (November 26, 1993). Based upon the above, the Commission finds that the agency's rejection of appellant's harassment allegation as moot was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S. Ct. 1483 (1994), decision eliminated any claims for compensatory damages for claims arising before November 1, 1991, see Chapter 21 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-12-135.html#sec3-132">Compensatory Damages</a>," there is no reason the Commission would not apply the same rationale with respect to mootness in claims arising after that date.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although cessation of the conduct may not render a complaint moot, it may preclude the complainant from making a showing that the harassment rose to the level of a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Aidelman v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01932532 (1994), the Commission found that several instances of profane language did not constitute sexual harassment, or sex-based harassment, when the male coworkers would refrain from further profane comments when asked to cease. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Aidelman</span> also found the agency acted <span id="Page_891"></span>promptly and effectively to deal with one incident involving a pornographic magazine:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence of the general work atmosphere, involving employees other than the complainant, is also relevant to the issue of whether there existed a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII<span class="Italic">. Delgado v. Lehman</span>, 665 F. Supp. 460, 468 (E.D. Va. 1987). Occasional, isolated, or trivial remarks of a sexual nature do not create a hostile work environment<span class="Italic">. Scott v. Sears</span>, <span class="Italic">Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 978 F.2d 210, 214 (7th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Downes v. F.A.A.</span>, 775 F.2d 288, 293 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Sexual harassment must be unwelcome conduct, thus, where a complainant actively participated in the activities about which she complained, no hostile work environment is properly found<span class="Italic">. Weinheimer v. Rockwell Int'l Corp.</span>, 54 FEP Cases 828 (M.D. Fla. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, based on the record as a whole, that while appellant was subjected to some unwelcome conduct or comments of a sexual nature as well as some non-sexual acts of harassment, she has failed to prove a case of sexual harassment. First, the record as a whole indicates that the alleged harassment was not "sufficiently severe or pervasive" to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment. Instead, appellant was subjected to occasional crude comments which other witnesses stated would cease when a listener objected to them. In addition, we do not find, for example, that the incident with Coworker 1 was motivated by sex, but instead occurred due to a genuine disagreement about proper work procedures. Second, we conclude that the agency, through appellant's supervisors, took immediate and appropriate corrective action as soon as appellant gave the agency notice by raising genuine matters of concern related to sexual harassment, such as the pornographic magazine in her mail folder. For these reasons, then, we find no sexual harassment in this case....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission did not precisely articulate the point in <span class="Italic">Aidelman</span>, whether a few incidents of profane language constitute a hostile environment will depend on the nature of the comments. This extends not only to the actual language, but to whether the comments are specifically directed at the complainant, or are more general in nature. In <span class="Italic">Aidelman</span>, the comments were general in nature and not specifically directed at the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where the conduct rises to the level of creating a hostile environment, an agency may avoid liability for the harassing conduct if it takes prompt action that results in stopping the conduct. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hopkins and Conerly v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A44613 (2005), the Commission found that the agency was not liable for a hostile environment that included racial slurs where, upon learning of the conduct, it counseled the harasser, issued a letter of warning and barred him from any further contact with the complainants. Responding to the complainants' claim that the harasser should have been transferred, the Commission found such action was not necessary where the actions taken by the agency resulted in stopping the perpetrator from any further harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no showing of hostile environment harassment where the original relationship is voluntary and the alleged harasser ceases any advances after being told his conduct is unwelcome. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mannweiler v. Attorney General</span>, 01933266 (1994), the Commission found that the complainant demonstrated no sexual harassment where there was evidence she participated in soliciting the original attentions of her supervisor and he ceased almost all contact with her after she requested he do so:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has long held that "unwelcome conduct" is conduct which the employee did not solicit or incite, and which the employee regarded as undesirable or offensive<span class="Italic">. Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 903 (11th Cir. 1982). Appellant alleges that the RO often summoned her into his office and would discuss personal matters. Appellant also stated that these matters usually included comments regarding his physique, clothing, unhappiness with his wife, and whether she was happy with her husband. Appellant contends that the RO purchased a pair of jade earrings for her on one of his business trips as a form of affection. She also indicated that he wanted her to call him at home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows, however, that appellant presented minimal evidence to substantiate her claim that prior to September/October 1991, the RO's actions were "unwelcomed." Specifically, the agency, however, presented the preponderant evidence supporting that appellant actively participated in the lengthy conversations with the RO. In addition, there was testimony that appellant "looked for reasons" to go into the RO's office. There was also testimony that appellant conducted herself in a manner so as to attract the RO. Further, there was testimony that appellant changed the way she dressed after she filed a complaint against the RO. None of these assertions were persuasively refuted by appellant. In <span class="Italic">Weinheimer v. Rockwell Int'l Corp.</span>, 54 FEP Cases 828 (M.D. Fla. 1990), it was held that a hostile work environment was not shown where the plaintiff actively participated in the activities about which she complained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, appellant fails to show that she complained (prior to filing her complaint) to anyone about the treatment she received from the RO. The record shows that for more than nine months, appellant continued to have contact with the RO despite it allegedly negatively affecting her work, or, as she alleges, after the contact became against her will. Appellant indicates that, September/October 1991, she advised the RO that she wanted to perform her duties without "constant personal unwanted attention." Appellant stated that the RO agreed. Afterwards, appellant indicated the RO refused to speak to her, ignored her, and often questioned her subordinates about her work product.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds the totality of the evidence supports a finding of no discrimination based on sex and sexual harassment. Specifically, appellant asserts that in September/October 1991, she asked the RO to allow her to perform her work without his unwanted personal attention. It was not until that point that appellant acknowledged to the RO that his conduct was "unwelcomed." Thereafter, appellant acknowledges, the RO's behavior changed. He no longer subjected her to the activities she complained of. In fact, appellant indicates the RO stopped speaking to her regularly and asked her subordinates questions he normally asked her about her work product. Although appellant shows the RO's behavior changed after she advised him that she no longer wanted to participate in their "relationship," she does not show that the "harassment" continued.</p>
