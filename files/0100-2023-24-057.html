<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-42b"><span class="space">F.</span> INTERIM ACCOMMODATIONS</h4>
<p class="noindent">Timing is everything, and where it appears that an accommodation may take time to implement, agencies are well advised to institute interim accommodations. That won the day in <span class="Italic">Matthews v. EEOC</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30060.txt">07A30060</a> (2004), where the Commission excused an accommodation delay finding that the measures the agency took in the interim precluded that delay from violating the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the agency unduly delayed providing complainant with the funds so that an ergonomic study could have been conducted and changes implemented. Complainant requested an ergonomic study to be performed on her workstation in May 1999. The agency initially authorized that study the same month. The record is unclear what exactly happened, however, it is certain that money set aside for the ergonomic study became lost due to an administrative mix up. The record shows that the DC secured a second money transfer in November 1999. At that time, complainant could make an appointment with an ergonomic consultant and the study could be conducted. While the AJ found that the administrative error was understandable, she found that it was unclear as to why no agency officials took steps to uncover the problem earlier considering complainant's condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer should respond expeditiously to a request for reasonable accommodation. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (revised October 17, 2002) at question 10. If the employer and the individual with a disability need to engage in an interactive process, this too should proceed as quickly as possible<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Similarly, the employer should act promptly to provide the reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Unnecessary delays can result in a violation of the ADA<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In determining whether there has been an unnecessary delay in responding to a request for reasonable accommodation, relevant factors would include: (1) the reason(s) for delay, (2) the length of the delay, (3) how much the individual with a disability and the employer each contributed to the delay, (4) what the employer was doing during the delay, and (5) whether the required accommodation was simple or complex to provide<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at n.38. Based on these factors, it is clear that the agency delayed in providing complainant with the funds necessary to conduct an ergonomic study. The only reason for the delay was an administrative error on the agency's part. The delay was for over eight months. The delay in providing such a simple request is completely attributed to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the analysis does not stop there. During the delay, as noted above, the agency provided other accommodations that would allow complainant to perform her position. The agency made available notetakers and other assistance. During the relevant time, the agency modified complainant's intake assignment. When it was complainant's turn to do intake, if she did not feel well, the agency would skip her name and just go to the next person on the list. The agency also provided complainant with advanced sick leave and the desk she requested. Therefore, although there was an unwarranted delay in conducting the ergonomic study, the agency worked with complainant in order to provide other reasonable accommodations. Accordingly, we conclude that the AJ erred in concluding that the delay amounted to a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case, <span class="Italic">Craig V. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2021002012 (2022), the Commission found that the alternative interim accommodations offered the complainant while the agency resolved certain budgetary issues were sufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record demonstrates that the Agency made a good faith effort to engage in the interactive process to provide Complainant with the necessary reasonable accommodations for him to perform the essential duties of his position. Several elements of Complainant's request were delayed in arrival due to budget constraints; however, Agency officials provided alternative accommodations including assistance with interview notes and allowing him to work extended hours from home. Additionally, the Agency provided Complainant various technological equipment including; a wireless microphone, a CapTEL 840i phone, interactive software with two laptops, a desktop docking station, and several headsets. Some difficulties ensued in that some of the equipment could not be fully installed because of unforeseen network security issues; however, IT officials attempted to troubleshoot any other issues that arose. Furthermore, the record reveals that Complainant indicated <span id="Page_1318"></span>to management officials that he had everything he needed to perform his duties. Complainant has presented no evidence demonstrating that the provided accommodations and alternative accommodations were ineffective. Additionally, to the extent the Agency did not provide any requested accommodations, Complainant has not provided evidence demonstrating how these accommodations were needed to enable him to perform the duties of his position. Accordingly, the Commission finds that Complainant has not demonstrated that the Agency denied him reasonable accommodation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Harvey G. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 2022000813 (2022) (delay in providing accommodation did not violate the Rehabilitation Act where parties were waiting to better understand what was necessary by way of accommodation until after the complainant's surgery, and the agency provided temporary accommodations until that time).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rabby v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120071659 (2008), the Commission found that the delay in providing a reading assistant was not a denial of accommodation where some of the delay resulted from the complainant's own insistence on the assistant having certain credentials, there was difficulty finding a qualified applicant, the ultimate selectee's security clearance was delayed because of questions about foreign influence and, in the interim, the agency had provided the complainant with assistive devices. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rabby</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that complainant established that he is a qualified individual with a disability, we find that the agency provided complainant with a reasonable accommodation and did not unnecessarily delay in providing the accommodation. The record reflects that the agency began the process of providing complainant an accommodation in April 2005 by posting the vacancy announcement for the reader assistant position. The record further reveals that complainant stated that he wished to be present during the interviews of the reader assistants or participate by phone. Additionally, after the agency posted the position description containing complainant's requirement that applicants possess two years of college education in the English language or English literature, no applicants applied or were eligible. We find that these delays were not the result of the agency's actions but were due to complainant's requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although complainant contends on appeal that the agency unnecessarily delayed when it first determined that candidate 1 had priority, complainant has proffered no evidence to call into question that the agency was required to give candidate 1 priority consideration since she was a family member of an embassy employee. Complainant contends candidate 1 was not the best candidate since she was only available for part-time employment while the position required full-time employment. However, we find that this alone is insufficient to cast doubt on the reason provided by the agency for providing candidate 1 with priority consideration for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also contends that once candidate 2 was selected, the agency unnecessarily delayed in providing her the appropriate security clearance. The record reflects that with regard to candidate 2's security clearance, CWPL provided affidavit testimony that she was in constant contact with the Regional Security Officer assigned to process the security clearance. Complainant argues that the agency should have expedited candidate 2's security clearance in order to accommodate him; however, complainant failed to show that the agency was able or obligated to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant additionally argues that candidate 2 should have received an interim security clearance: however, the record reflects that candidate 2 was unable to obtain an interim security clearance due to the fact that her file revealed that she had some foreign influences, such as owning property in another country or having family in another country, that could have resulted in candidate 2 revealing classified information. Complainant has not offered any evidence to cast doubt on the agency's reason for not providing candidate 2 with an interim security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that, despite the delay of six months, the agency was actively taking measures to hire a reader assistant. Due to the delays resulting from the lack of acceptable candidates, complainant's contributed somewhat to the delay due to his request to be present at the interviews and to the position description he drafted. Furthermore, the need to give candidate 1 priority and resolve any conflicts arising from nepotism, and the need for candidate 2 to obtain a security clearance, also contributed. Therefore, we find that the agency did not unnecessarily delay when it did not provide complainant a reader assistant until January 19, 2006. As such, we find that the preponderance of the evidence shows that agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that, although the agency failed to provide complainant a reader assistant from November 10, 2005 to January 19, 2006, CWLP stated that complainant did not want one of the temporary reader assistant's services extended. It is unclear from the record why this was the case and whether complainant's failure to do so resulted in the lack of temporary reader assistants. Nevertheless, complainant was provided assistive technology during this time period. We note that, under the Rehabilitation Act, protected individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodation, but they are not entitled to their accommodation of choice. <span class="Italic">See Castaneda v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01931005 (February 17, 1994). Complainant failed to offer any clarification as to the specific deficiencies of the assistive technology provided for him. Therefore, we find that the agency did not fail to provide complainant with a reasonable accommodation during this time period.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Conner v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01996212 (2002) (finding the agency did not act in a timely manner in providing accessibility to a restroom based, in part, upon the urgency of the complainant's need for accommodation and the interim accommodation efforts were insufficient because they did not fully address the complainant's needs).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Nicki D. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 0720180023 (2021), the Commission found that the agency's failure to provide an interim accommodation constituted an independent basis for liability. In that case, the complainant explained that the accommodation requested was of an immediate nature. She had multiple sclerosis that required physical therapy three times a week. The complainant requested to telework three days a week to accommodate her physical therapy schedule. It took the agency 11 weeks to approve the request on a temporary basis. The agency, thereafter, determined that the job required the complainant's attendance at work and she was terminated. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Nicki D</span>. found that the agency discriminated against the complainant based on her disability and failed to reasonably accommodate her in the position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630. In order to establish that the Agency denied Complainant a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must show that: (1) she was an individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); (2) she was qualified individual with a disability pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); and (3) the Agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002) ("Enforcement Guidance"). Under the Commission's regulations, an agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a <span id="Page_1319"></span>disability unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(0) and (p).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis begins with the threshold question as to whether Complainant was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the regulations. An individual with a disability is one who: (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record of such impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g). Major life activities include such functions as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working; and the operation of a major bodily function. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i). An impairment is a disability if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to the ability of most people in the general population. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find no dispute as to whether Complainant was an individual with a disability. In this regard, we note that Complainant qualified for Schedule A hiring due to her disability of multiple sclerosis. Th record reflects that her chain of command was aware of her disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that Complainant meets the threshold requirement which would entitle her to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act, Complainant must also show that she was a "qualified" individual with a disability within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The regulation defines such an individual as a disabled person who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question. We agree with the AJ that she was.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the record here reveals that Complainant's work performance became problematic only after she requested a continuation of telework. Up until her midyear review, she had received a "Fully Successful" rating. While the Agency argued that S1 emailed Complainant regarding concerns about her work, and perhaps S2 also noticed issues with Complainant's work after S1 alerted her to her concerns, the record does not show that Complainant received any official warnings, counseling, or training regarding her performance. As such, we find that Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, to the extent that Complainant received notification of her performance deficiencies, we agree with the AJ that the deficiencies were related to the Agency's failure to timely provide Complainant with reasonable accommodation. Here, we note that Complainant was denied the opportunity to telework until November 18, 2014, which caused her to delay her therapy sessions. The record further reflects that Complainant's therapy sessions were also disrupted in Spring 2015 due to the Agency's failure to approve her request to telework until March 2015. Given that the purpose of the Rehabilitation Act is to allow an individual with a disability to work with or without reasonable accommodation, we would be remiss to allow the Agency to rely on <span id="Page_1320"></span>Complainant's alleged performance deficiencies, during periods when she did not have an accommodation, as a basis for finding her not qualified. We therefore conclude that Complainant was indeed qualified based on her demonstrated performance, as reflected in her September 2014 evaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further agree with the AJ that this case hinges upon whether the Agency provided an effective reasonable accommodation. To be entitled to a requested accommodation, an employee must demonstrate it would be both reasonable and effective to help the employee perform the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">Rose v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A45063, (Feb. 3, 2005). Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodation, but the agency is free to choose the accommodation as long as it is effective. <span class="Italic">Goodman v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120044371 (May 2, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We concur in the AJ's determination that the Agency did not provide an effective reasonable accommodation. Specifically, we note that the Agency failed to acknowledge that Complainant's condition was a permanent condition and not something that could be corrected during a set time period. Moreover, the record shows that the DPM made multiple assumptions and mistakes with regard to Complainant's request. For example, the DPM was not aware that Complainant used a wheelchair; she believed that Complainant's request involved an issue with her commute and not her disability; and she mistakenly confused the requirements of the CBA with the reasonable accommodation requirements. While it is true that Complainant initially was allowed to telework, no plan was developed for how to handle Complainant's ongoing requests. The Commission has consistently found that, although an employer may choose among effective accommodations, "forcing an employee to take leave when another accommodation would permit an employee to continue working is not an effective accommodation." <span class="Italic">Denese G. v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the Agency's failure to engage in the interactive process resulted in the Agency's failure to provide Complainant with an effective accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Humphrey v. Memorial Hosp. Ass'n</span>, 239 F.3d 1123, 1139 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that when employer fails "to engage in the interactive process, liability is appropriate if a reasonable accommodation without undue hardship to the employer would otherwise have been possible"). We also concur in the AJ's determination that, had the DPM interacted with Complainant, an accommodation could have been provided to Complainant without undue hardship to the employer. <span class="Italic">See also Broussard v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01997106 (Sept. 13, 2002), <span class="Italic">req. to recon. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 05A30114 (Jan. 9, 2003) (an agency cannot be held liable solely for a failure to engage in the interactive process; liability for a failure to engage occurs when failure to engage in the interactive process results in agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we find that the DPM's and S1's proposal that Complainant take leave did not constitute a reasonable accommodation here, as there was an alternative accommodation that would have allowed Complainant to continue working a full day and would not have resulted in an undue hardship to the Agency. Specifically, we find that the Agency has not shown that it would have incurred a significant difficulty or expense if it had allowed Complainant to continue to telework. There is no evidence that this proposed accommodation would have been "unduly disruptive to other employees' ability to work." The Agency's assertion that allowing Complainant to telework "would not be fair to the other employees" does not establish undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, we find that the Agency failed to provide Complainant with reasonable accommodation from March 27 to May 14, 2015. <span class="Italic">See also Lloyd E. v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120150325 (Aug. 17, 2017).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with the AJ that the Agency's failure to provide Complainant with an interim accommodation constitutes an independent basis of liability. While we are mindful of the Agency's contention that the 11-week delay in providing Complainant with reasonable accommodation was due to Complainant's own five-week delay in responding to the DPM's October 8, 2014 request, we note that the interactive process is a two-way street. Under our regulations, when all the facts and circumstances known to the agency make it reasonably likely that an individual will be entitled to reasonable accommodation, but the accommodation cannot be provided, the agency shall provide an interim accommodation that allows the individual to perform some or all of the essential functions of his or her job, if it is possible to do so without imposing undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(d)(3)(Q). As we noted in our Final Rule on Affirmative Action for Individuals with Disabilities in Federal Employment, interim accommodations play a crucial role in preserving the requesting individual's ability to work, as they may be necessary in order to avoid, for example, a worsening of symptoms, exacerbation of a medical condition, or pain. Given the facts and circumstances in this case, we agree with the AJ that the Agency unlawfully violated the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to provide Complainant with an interim accommodation during the pendency of the interactive process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we considered the Agency's contention that the DPM's verbal approval of Complainant's requested accommodation on October 8, 2014, constituted an interim accommodation. However, we find such contention to be unpersuasive. In this regard, we note that the October 2014 verbal approval was expressly conditioned on Complainant's submission of medical documentation, which Complainant did not provide until November 13, 2014. Given that Complainant did not fulfill the condition precedent of the verbal approval until November 13, 2014, it stands to reason that the verbal approval could not have been in effect prior to November 13, 2014. Furthermore, the record reflects that even though the DPM received Complainant's medical documentation on November 13, 2014, she did not allow Complainant to telework until November 18, 2014. Indeed, we note that S1 authorized Complainant to telework on November 17, 2018, on an emergency basis because the DPM did not allow Complainant to telework prior to November 18, 2014. We therefore reject the Agency's contention that Complainant was afforded an interim accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also considered the Agency's reference to <span class="Italic">Melodee M. v. Dep't of Agric</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120142984 (Jan. 24, 2017) to support its contention that the delay in providing Complainant with accommodation was not unreasonable. There, the Commission declined to hold the agency liable for a five-month delay in the reasonable accommodation process because the Commission found that the delay was excusable in light of complainant's own failure to timely provide supporting medical documentation to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find the Agency's reliance on Melodee M., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, to be unpersuasive. In this regard, we note that the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Melodee M., supra</span>, made no mention as to whether the complainant was afforded an interim accommodation. Furthermore, we note that in the cases where the Commission excused an agency's delay, the Commission did so because the agency provided the complainant with an interim accommodation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dwight B. v. Dep't of Vet. Aff</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120170053 (Sept. 21, 2018); and <span class="Italic">Wendel v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120090538 (Sept. 9, 2010). Given that our regulation at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(d)(3)(Q), clearly obliged the Agency to provide interim accommodations, we decline to follow <span class="Italic">Melodee M., supra</span>. For the above reasons, we conclude that the Agency failed to reasonably accommodate Complainant.</p>
