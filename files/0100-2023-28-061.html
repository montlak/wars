<h4 class="h4" id="sec19-61"><span class="space">1.</span> Use of Statistical Evidence</h4>
<p class="noindent">There have been significant changes in the use of statistics to show adverse impact on a class. Historically, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of class discrimination could be established by use of statistics alone, or by cumulative evidence "including statistics, patterns, practices, general policies or specific (i.e., anecdotal) instances of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Osolinik v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 05870101 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">EEOC v. American National Bank</span>, 652 F.2d 1176 (4th Cir. 1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent">There has always been some requirement that the class agent demonstrate how the numbers proffered are relevant. Numbers alone, without appropriate analysis or explanation, are insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. For example, in <span class="Italic">Osolinik</span>, the Commission found the class statistics relative to promotion of females in the Solicitor General's Office were fatally flawed where there was no control in the sample for such factors as the late entry of women into law school and the job market.</p>
<p class="noindent">When both competitive and noncompetitive promotions are at issue, <span id="Page_1650"></span>statistical evidence relevant to both types of promotion should be presented. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Forehand v. Florida State Hospital, et al.</span> 89 F.3d 1562, 1572 (11th Cir. 1996). In <span class="Italic">Forehand</span>, the court set forth the proper analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ideally, to determine whether there existed a disparity between the percentage of eligible blacks and those promoted, the parties would compare the percentage of blacks seeking competitive promotions to the percentage competitively promoted and, independently, they would compare the percentage of blacks in the workforce to the percentage granted noncompetitive promotions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court found that the parties erred by comparing "the percentage of <span class="Italic">all</span> black employees promoted (including both competitive and noncompetitive promotions) to the percentage in the pool from which promotions were granted." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In 1989, the Supreme Court placed additional requirements on the use of statistics to demonstrate a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of adverse impact. In <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 490 U.S. 642, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 104 L. Ed.2d 733 (1989), the Supreme Court found that merely showing an underrepresentation of the class in the employer's work force was insufficient. It must also be shown that "the application of a specific or particular employment practice created the disparate impact under attack." <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01902649 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Wards Cove)</span>. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not significantly disturb the holding of <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> with respect to demonstrating that an underrepresentation in the work force is related to a specific employment practice. See Chapter 11 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-20-002.html#sec11-3">The Wards Cove Case</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no fixed method for using statistics in adverse impact cases, though there are some generally accepted methods. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931216 (1994), the Commission explained the use of "standard deviation" to evaluate statistics in adverse impact cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that facially neutral employment rules, practices, policies, or procedures which have significant adverse effects upon members of a statutorily protected group, or which otherwise cause members of a protected group to be denied access to equal employment opportunities are unlawful<span class="Italic">. Watson v. Fort Worth Bank of Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977 (1988); <span class="Italic">Connecticut v. Teal</span>, 457 U.S. 440 (1982). Such practices are said to have a disparate impact upon members of a protected class, and it does not matter whether those practices are objective or subjective in nature<span class="Italic">. Watson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on a disparate impact theory, the appellant must adduce statistical evidence that the ostensibly neutral employment practice(s) has a disparate impact on the statutorily protected group.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has stated that there is no fixed statistical or numerical value for establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact, and that statistical evidence must be analyzed in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual case<span class="Italic">. Hazelwood School District v. United States</span>, 433 U.S. 299 (1977). However, the Court has noted that the proper comparison in such a showing is between the racial composition of the jobs at issue and the racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor market<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 308. In this case, what is at issue is not the racial composition of the Postal Inspector jobs, but rather, the racial composition of the individuals who were deemed qualified to sit for the Examination. Appellant contended that the appropriate method for analyzing the statistical evidence in this case is the four-fifths rule, which is set forth in the Commission's Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedure (contained at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1607 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.). Pursuant to this rule, adverse impact is inferred if the members of the protected class are selected at a rate which is less than four-fifths of the rate at which the group with the highest rate is selected. In this case, however, the record does not contain evidence of how many individuals applied for Postal Inspector positions and were turned down because they did not have a college degree. Another equally acceptable method of analysis for determining disparate impact is the standard deviation analysis<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 311. Because the record contains the necessary information to employ this method, we find that it is more appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard deviation is the measure of the predicted fluctuations from the expected number of persons in a particular protected class that one would expect to find in a given population. Courts have held that if the difference between the expected number and the actual number is more than two or three standard deviations, this difference may be classified as non-random, and, therefore, statistically significant. In this case, the Commission will look at the standard deviation for black individuals from within the agency taking the Examination, and the standard deviation for black individuals from outside the agency taking the Examination. To determine the standard deviation for black individuals from within the agency, it is first necessary to determine the total population of agency employees taking the Examination. In this case, the number is 16,744. This number is then multiplied by the expected percentage of black agency employees one would expect to take the Examination (20% or .20), which is then multiplied by the expected percentage of non-black agency employees one would expect to take the Examination (80% or .80). The standard deviation is then determined by taking the square root of this number. This yields the following results:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Total Population = 16,744</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Expected number of black agency employees taking the Examination is 16,744 x .20, which equals 3,349</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;3,349 is then multiplied by .80, which equals 2,679</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;The square root of 2,679 is 51.8</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Standard Deviation = 51.8</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, two standard deviations would be approximately 104. Therefore, in order for the number of black agency employees taking the Examination to be statistically significant for purposes of determining disparate impact, it would have to at least be less than 3,245, which is the number of black agency employees taking the Examination (3,349) minus two standard deviations (104). In this case, because the number of black agency employees who took the Examination was 4,334, it is apparent that appellant has not shown that the college degree requirement has a disparate impact on black agency employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of determining the standard deviation for black individuals from outside the agency taking the Examination, the relevant population is 589, and the percentage of non-agency black individuals one would expect to take the Examination is 10.3% or .103 (the percentage of black individuals in the U.S. workforce). Therefore, the number of non-agency black individuals one would expect to take the Examination would be approximately 61 (589 x .103 = 61). This number is then multiplied by the percentage of non-black non-agency employees one would expect to take the Examination, 89.7% or .897, which equals 55 (.897 x 61 = 55). The square root of 55 is approximately 7.4, which is the standard deviation. More simply stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Total Population = 589</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Expected number of non-agency black individuals taking the Examination is 589 x .103, which equals 61</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;61 is then multiplied by .897, which equals 55</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;The square root of 55 is 7.4</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Standard Deviation = 7.4</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, two standard deviations would be approximately 15. Therefore, in order for the number of non-agency black individuals taking the Examination to be statistically significant for purposes of disparate impact, it would have to at least be less than 40, which is the expected number of non-agency black individuals one would expect to take the Examination minus two standard deviations (55-15 = 40). In this case, because the actual number of non-agency black individuals taking the Examination was 78, appellant has not shown that the college degree requirement has a disparate impact on non-agency black individuals. Accordingly, the Commission finds appellant has not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under a disparate impact theory, and finds that, for this reason, he has not established that the agency discriminated against him based on race.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Author's note</span>: An astute reader has picked up on the fact that the Commission's standard deviation analysis is in error. The expected number of non-black individuals taking the examination is 61 and not 55. As a result, the proper calculation should be 61-15=46 and not 55-15=40. So much for the mathematical abilities of both the Commission and the author.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission considered a standard deviation of 3.48, as reported by the agency's own expert, to be an admission of a "gross disparity" that raised an inference of discrimination on the part of the agency in <span class="Italic">Ely C. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720140019 (2019):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A disparity of less than two standard deviations can be regarded as reasonably attributable to chance factors or statistically insignificant. Both Complainant's and the Agency's expert applied the threshold of two standard deviations in assessing whether a disparity was statistically significant. The Agency's expert found that the level of under-promotion of GS-II African American female employees was 3.48 standard deviations from what would have been expected to have occurred by chance, where 2.00 standard deviations was considered statistically significant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to a disparate treatment analysis, the AJ found that the Class could not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for statistically significant disparity in promotions for Black female class members because of the Class's flawed statistics; as such, the Class could not prevail in its case for class-wide discrimination as set forth in the complaint. Notwithstanding, the AJ found, and we agree, that the Agency's evidence was an admission on the part of the Agency of a gross disparity in promotions for Black Females to the GS-I2 level that raised an inference of discrimination in this matter. The AJ further found, and we agree, that this constituted a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for the pattern or practice analysis of disparate treatment. Moreover, the Agency did not rebut this inference of discrimination or otherwise proffer any evidence to explain the gross disparity. This failure on the part of the Agency to explain the level of under promotion for Black females was made worse because the evidence appeared in its own expert's report and not the class expert's <span id="Page_1651"></span>report. Thus, the Agency was on notice regarding this evidence and that it could be used to support a finding of discrimination. Accordingly, the unrebutted inference was sufficient for a finding that Black female employees as defined in the class complaint were discriminated against in receiving promotions from the year 2000 to the present into GS-12 level positions. While this finding differed slightly from the complaint brought previously by the Class, we agree that the evidence supports this modification from all GS-7 through GS-13 African American females to the under-promotion of GS-11 African-American female employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">While crediting the "standard deviation" method in <span class="Italic">Emelda F. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120121347 (2018), the Commission also emphasized that the "surrounding facts and circumstances" must be considered. For instance, the statistical evidence presented must be properly calculated using the right data and expert testimony must be credible. <span class="Italic">Emelda F</span>. involved allegations that the agency's personnel office encouraged command to set minimal areas of consideration in merit staffing, and that this policy had an adverse impact on the hiring of blacks. Finding no discrimination, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Emelda F.</span> focused on the data used, how the data was analyzed and the credibility of the expert testimony:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Claims of disparate impact involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that, in fact, fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity. <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. U.S</span>., 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977). Proof of discriminatory motive is not required under a disparate-impact theory. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact, a class must show that an agency practice or policy, while neutral on its face, disproportionately impacted members of the protected Class. This is demonstrated through the presentation of statistical evidence which establishes a statistical disparity that is linked to the challenged practice or policy. <span class="Italic">See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 994 (1988) (complainant must present "statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the class must: (1) identify the specific practice or practices challenged; (2) show statistical disparities; and (3) show that the disparity is linked to the challenged practice or policy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Obas v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A04389 (May 16, 2002). The burden is on the class to show that "the facially neutral standard in question affects those individuals [within the protected group] in a significantly discriminatory pattern." <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 329 (1977); <span class="Italic">see also Gaines v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03990119 (Aug. 31, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a class establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden shifts to the agency to establish that the employment practice is consistent with business necessity. The Commission has held that "[p]roof of business necessity includes a showing that no acceptable policies or practices are available which would serve the employer's interests without such disproportionate impact upon a particular group." <span class="Italic">Stiles v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01945728 (Dec. 12, 1996). Finally, if the agency satisfies its burden of proving business necessity, the class may nevertheless prevail if it identifies an alternative employment practice that would accomplish the same goal with a less-adverse impact on the protected class. <span class="Italic">See Ricci v. DeStefano</span>, 557 U.S. 557, 578 (2009) (citing 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C)); <span class="Italic">Abril-Rivera v. Johnson</span>, 806 F.3d 599, 606 (1st Cir. 2015); <span class="Italic">Huber v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120070399 (July 9, 2009) (citing Section 105 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (Nov. 21, 1991)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in all disparate impact cases, the AJ relied upon the parties' experts to show that the AOCs set by the Agency caused a disparate impact on the number of Black applicants hired. The question of whether the Class established that the AOC created an adverse impact rests on the testimony of the expert witnesses. The proper comparison in a disparate impact case is between the racial composition of the at-issue jobs and the racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor market. <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 490 U.S. 642, 650 (1989), <span class="Italic">quoting Hazelwood School District v. United States</span>, 433 U.S. 299, 307-08 (1977); <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Schultz</span>, 815 F.2d 84, 91 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05940647 (June 8, 1995). Whether the relevant labor market for a particular job should be constructed from demographic measures like civilian labor force statistics or applicant flow data depends upon the extent to which specialized knowledge and skills are demanded for that job. Demographic statistics are useful when the jobs at issue require no special expertise. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Transportation Agency of Santa Clara County, California</span>, 480 U.S. 616, 631-32 (1987); <span class="Italic">Bragdon v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890700 (April 25, 1990). Where special qualifications are required to fill the job, however, demographic indicators like the civilian labor force statistics may have little probative value. <span class="Italic">Hazelwood</span>, 433 U.S. at 309; <span class="Italic">Mayor of the City of Philadelphia v. Educational Quality League</span>, 415 U.S. 605, 620-21 (1974). In such situations, a comparison should be made between the employer's work force and those in the labor force who possess the relevant qualifications, i.e., the qualified applicant pool. <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span>, 490 U.S. at 650-51; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 480 U.S. at 632; <span class="Italic">Hazelwood</span>, 433 U.S. at 308; <span class="Italic">Bragdon, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In calculating the disparity, the AJ considered two measures: the four-fifths, or 80%, rule, and a standard-deviation analysis. Under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP), "a selection rate for any race, sex or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths or eighty percent of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1607(4)(d). Courts have typically considered the four-fifths rule as a "rule of thumb." <span class="Italic">See Jones v. City of Boston</span>, 752 F.3d 38, 49 (1st Cir. 2014); <span class="Italic">Isabel v. City of Memphis</span>, 404 F.3d 404, 412-13 (6th Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Stout v. Potter</span>, 276 F.3d 1118, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second measure, standard deviation analysis, compares criteria to find whether there was a disparity large enough to be noticed, which is referred to a "statistically significant" result. A statistically significant disparity means that the probability of the disparity occurring by is unlikely, and may have been due to some other factor. In this analysis, the probabilities are then expressed as corresponding standard deviations. The more standard deviations, the more likely the disparity was due to some factor other than chance. Courts and scientists routinely find that any result exceeding 1.96 standard deviations (positive or negative) is statistically significant, meaning it was a result that was unlikely to have occurred randomly, and may have been due to some other factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has not endorsed a bright-line rule or precise number of "standard deviations" which would require a finding of discrimination. Instead, courts examine statistics on a case-by-case approach when analyzing the significance of a disparity. <span class="Italic">See Ottaviani v. State Univ. of New York at New Paltz</span>, 875 F.2d 365, 371 (2d Cir. 1989) (declining to hold that two standard deviations as a matter of law presents a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case). Moreover, courts should look not only at the statistics, but at the surrounding facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also, International Bd. of Teamsters</span>, 431 US. at 340 (describing the usefulness of statistics as dependent on the surrounding facts and circumstances); <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 995 (1988) (superseded by statute on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While standard deviation analysis may support the proof offered under the four-fifths rule, it may also rebut it. <span class="Italic">See Hazelwood</span>, 433 U.S. at 311, n.17. Put another way, "a fluctuation of more than two or three standard deviations would undercut the hypothesis that decisions were being made randomly with respect to race...." <span class="Italic">Castaneda v. Partida</span>, 430 U.S. 482, 497 n.17 (1977); <span class="Italic">see also Jones v. City of Boston</span>, 752 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2014) (while the four-fifths rule does have a certain practical utility, that utility does not justify giving the rule decisive weight in establishing proof of disparate impact.) Therefore, when both analyses are offered, the fact-finder should consider the results of both.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find substantial evidence to support the' AJ's legal conclusion that the Class did not meet its burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. In determining there was no inference of discrimination, the AJ found that the Class Expert's (Expert 1's) results were not credible. The AJ explained in detail his reasoning as to why he was not persuaded by Expert 1; specifically, he found that Expert 1's evidence was not as reliable based on his methodology, experience, and knowledge of the Federal personnel system. He further noted that Expert 1 made several errors in his calculations and gave vague testimony. We find substantial evidence to support that finding, and therefore no reason to overturn this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Class also argues that the Agency's own expert, Expert 2, found a statistically-significant disparity, which was ignored by the AJ. As explained <span class="Italic">supra</span>, Expert 2 found a difference of negative 2.33 standard deviations when he compared the expected number of Black applications found within the AOC to the actual number of Black applications found within the AOC, over all 233 competitions, which included both the General Schedule (GS) and Federal Wage System (FWS), during the Class period. This translated to 12.5 fewer applications than one would expect, if the determination of "in or out" of the AOC had been a random process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ relied on the EEOC's 80% rule in reaching the legal conclusion that there was no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Expert 2 found that the Black's selection ratio (the ratio of the actual number of Blacks found to be within the AOC versus the expected number within the AOC if the process had been random) was 93.7% of the White selection ratio. Hr'g. Tr. 1545-1547. We don't have to decide, because as noted above, the Agency's expert appropriately disaggregated the data because the AOCs differed so much by position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Expert 2 testified that, once he noted the disparity, he then recalculated the data in an attempt to find out what was responsible for the disparity. The AJ credited Expert 2's testimony that this was not to ignore the data but, rather, to find where the disparity was coming from. Hr'g. Tr. at p. 1553. When the number of competitions were separated into subsets by pay plan, pay system, activity, job family, and job series, the disparity only <span id="Page_1652"></span>existed in one job family (FWS-4700, Maintenance Mechanic), and was not a disparity which existed Class-wide. Moreover, when he re-analyzed the data, without that job family, there was no longer any statistical significance. This, according to the AJ, was persuasive evidence that the disparity in the overall results noted by Expert 2 predominantly came from one job family, and was not present Class-wide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Class argues that disaggregation of data in this manner operated to ignore the statistically-significant disparity, and constituted reversible error. However, we agree with the Agency's argument that it was not erroneous to consider the pay system subset data when there was substantial evidence that the size of the AOC varied considerably by position. In that regard, Expert 3 provided descriptive analyses of the filling of vacancies at the Naval complex and testified that, in fact, there was great variation amongst the AOCs, and that they varied according to position. Expert 3 noted that the more specialized the position, the larger the AOC. Conversely, the lower-skilled positions used narrower AOCs, because they were able to fill the position from within the specific activity. Hr'g. Tr. at p. 1703-1706; Exhibit A403 at p. 5, 6. For example, for clerical jobs, only 1% of the AOCs were within the "wider" AOC category. In the engineering and architecture job series, 53% of the AOCs were in the "wider" AOC group. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. While the Class correctly points out that the smaller the data group, the less reliable the results, we cannot find clear error in the determination of the AJ, after a hearing, to give probative value to the subset data.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the AJ relied on the labor market data presented by Expert 3 in finding no discrimination. Specifically, the labor market statistics revealed a higher proportion of Blacks in Newport County than in the Class geographic area. Moreover, the percentage of Blacks in Newport activities was higher than the proportion of Blacks in all the activities operated by the Navy, Department of Defense, and other Federal agencies in the Class area. Expert 3 found that expanding the AOC would result in a lower percentage of Black representation because the Newport Naval Complex had a higher proportion of Blacks than the comparison groups. We do not agree with the Class that these statistics represented a "bottom line" approach, which was rejected in <span class="Italic">Connecticut v. Teal</span>, 457 U.S. 440 (1982) (holding that the nondiscriminatory "bottom line" of selection process was not a defense when written examination was discriminatory). Instead of examining whether Blacks were ultimately hired more than Whites, which would constitute a "bottom line" defense, Expert 3 used labor market statistics to see if potential Black applicants were disparately impacted at the AOC stage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find the AJ applied appropriate weight to the statistics and concluded that negative 2.33 standard deviations was due to only one job family, and was not Class-wide. The AJ looked at "the surrounding facts and circumstances," <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span>, 431 U.S. at 340, and determined that, because the size of the AOC's varied according to job, and consequently, the pay system, analyses of subsets of the data, after a hearing on the merits, was not inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Class failed to establish that the practice in question caused the disparity. <span class="Italic">See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. at 994. Because there is no rule which requires the finding of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case at a certain number of standard deviations, and considering the surrounding facts and circumstances presented in this case, we find that the AJ did not err. We find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's decision, which was based on the credibility of expert witnesses, and we find no reason to overturn this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Class has not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact discrimination because it did not prove with persuasive statistical evidence that the agency's policy or practice caused a class-wide disparate impact. Based on a thorough review of the record and the contentions on appeal, including those not specifically addressed herein, we therefore AFFIRM the Agency's final action.</p>
