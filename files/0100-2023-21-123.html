<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-114"><span class="space">L.</span> CONSTRUCTIVE ADVERSE ACTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has noted that sexual harassment does not always fall neatly into the tangible employment action or hostile environment analysis. In some cases, both forms of sexual harassment are present. One scenario that presents both types of cases is when a complainant alleges that a hostile environment leads to a constructive discharge. In the wake of <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> it was not clear whether employers would be held strictly liable in such cases or would have an affirmative defense available to them.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders</span>, 542 U.S. 129 (2004), the Supreme Court determined that in such cases employers do have an affirmative defense available:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case concerns an employer's liability for one subset of Title VII constructive discharge claims: constructive discharge resulting from sexual harassment, or "hostile work environment," attributable to a supervisor. Our starting point is the framework <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> established to govern employer liability for sexual harassment by supervisors. As earlier noted, <span class="Italic">see supra,</span> at 5-6, those decisions delineate two categories of hostile work environment claims: (1) harassment that "culminates in a tangible employment action," for which employers are strictly liable,<span class="Italic"> Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 765; accord <span class="Italic">Faragher,</span> 524 U.S., at 808, and (2) harassment that takes place in the absence of a tangible employment action, to which employers may assert an affirmative defense, <span class="Italic">Ellerth,</span> 524 <span id="Page_918"></span>U.S., at 765;<span class="Italic"> accord Faragher,</span> 524 U.S., at 807. With the background set out above in mind, we turn to the key issues here at stake: Into which <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> category do hostile-environment constructive discharge claims fall--and what proof burdens do the parties bear in such cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher,</span> the plaintiffs-employees sought to hold their employers vicariously liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors, even though the plaintiffs "suffer[ed] no adverse, tangible job consequences." <span class="Italic">Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 747. Setting out a framework for employer liability in those decisions, this Court noted that Title VII's definition of "employer" includes the employer's "agent[s]," 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e(b). <span class="Italic">See Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 754. We viewed that definition as a direction to "interpret Title VII based on agency principles." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> The Restatement (Second) of Agency (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), the Court noted, states (in its black-letter formulation) that an employer is liable for the acts of its agent when the agent "'was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.'" <span class="Italic">Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 758 (<span class="Italic">quoting</span> Restatement &#x00A7; 219(2)(d)); <span class="Italic">accord Faragher,</span> 524 U.S., at 801.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We then identified "a class of cases where, beyond question, more than the mere existence of the employment relation aids in commission of the harassment: when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate." <span class="Italic">Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 760. A tangible employment action, the Court explained, "constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 761. Unlike injuries that could equally be inflicted by a co-worker, we stated, tangible employment actions "fall within the special province of the supervisor," who "has been empowered by the company as...[an] agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 762. The tangible employment action, the Court elaborated, is, in essential character, "an official act of the enterprise, a company act." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> It is "the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> Often, the supervisor will "use [the company's] internal processes" and thereby "obtain the imprimatur of the enterprise." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> Ordinarily, the tangible employment decision "is documented in official company records, and may be subject to review by higher level supervisors." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> In sum, we stated, "when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate[,]...it would be implausible to interpret agency principles to allow an employer to escape liability."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 762-763.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a supervisor's harassment of a subordinate does not culminate in a tangible employment action, the Court next explained, it is "less obvious" that the agency relation is the driving force.<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 763. We acknowledged that a supervisor's "power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> But we also recognized that "there are acts of harassment a supervisor might commit which might be the same acts a coemployee would commit, and there may be some circumstances where the supervisor's status [would] mak[e] little difference." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An "aided-by-the-agency-relation" standard, the Court suggested, was insufficiently developed to press into service as the standard governing cases in which no tangible employment action is in the picture. Looking elsewhere for guidance, we focused on Title VII's design "to encourage the creation of antiharassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 764. The Court reasoned that tying the liability standard to an employer's effort to install effective grievance procedures would advance Congress' purpose "to promote conciliation rather than litigation" of Title VII controversies. <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> At the same time, such linkage of liability limitation to effective preventive and corrective measures could serve Title VII's deterrent purpose by "encourag[ing] employees to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> Accordingly, we held that when no tangible employment action is taken, the employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing, as an affirmative defense, both that "the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior," and that "the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 765;<span class="Italic"> accord Faragher,</span> 524 U.S., at 807.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> also clarified the parties' respective proof burdens in hostile environment cases. Title VII, the Court noted, "borrows from tort law the avoidable consequences doctrine," <span class="Italic">Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 764, under which victims have "a duty 'to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages' that result from violations of the statute," <span class="Italic">Faragher,</span> 524 U.S., at 806 (<span class="Italic">quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC,</span> 458 U.S. 219, 231, n.15 (1982)). The <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> affirmative defense accommodates that doctrine by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to stave off avoidable harm. But both decisions place the burden squarely on the defendant to prove that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm.<span class="Italic"> Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 765;<span class="Italic"> accord Faragher,</span> 524 U.S., at 807; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> C. McCormick, Law of Damages 130 (1935) (defendant has burden of persuading factfinder "plaintiff could reasonably have reduced his loss or avoided injurious consequences").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The constructive discharge here at issue stems from, and can be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassment or hostile work environment. For an atmosphere of sexual harassment or hostility to be actionable, we reiterate, <span class="Italic">see supra,</span> at 1, the offending behavior "must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Meritor,</span> 477 U.S., at 67 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). A hostile-environment constructive discharge claim entails something more: A plaintiff who advances such a compound claim must show working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Breeding v. Arthur J. Gallagher &#x0026; Co.,</span> 164 F.3d 1151, 1160 (CA8 1999) ("[A]lthough there may be evidence from which a jury could find sexual harassment,...the facts alleged [for constructive discharge must be]...so intolerable that a reasonable person would be forced to quit.");<span class="Italic"> Perry v. Harris Chernin, Inc.,</span> 126 F. 3d 1010, 1015 (CA7 1997) ("[U]nless conditions are beyond 'ordinary' discrimination, a complaining employee is expected to remain on the job while seeking redress.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Suders' claim is of the same genre as the hostile work environment claims the Court analyzed in<span class="Italic"> Ellerth</span> and Faragher. Essentially, Suders presents a "worse case" harassment scenario, harassment ratcheted up to the breaking point. Like the harassment considered in our pathmarking decisions, harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may be effected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisory conduct, or official company acts. Unlike an actual termination, which is always effected through an official act of the company, a constructive discharge need not be. A constructive discharge involves both an employee's decision to leave and precipitating conduct: The former involves no official action; the latter, like a harassment claim without any constructive discharge assertion, may or may not involve official action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 24.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, a constructive discharge is functionally the same as an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects. <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> at 16, n.8. As the Third Circuit observed, both "en[d] the employer-employee relationship," and both "inflic[t]...direct economic harm." 325 F.3d, at 460 (internal quotation marks omitted). But when an official act does not underlie the constructive discharge, the <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> analysis, we here hold, calls for extension of the affirmative defense to the employer. As those leading decisions indicate, official directions and declarations are the acts most likely to be brought home to the employer, the measures over which the employer can exercise greatest control. <span class="Italic">See Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 762. Absent "an official act of the enterprise,"<span class="Italic"> ibid.,</span> as the last straw, the employer ordinarily would have no particular reason to suspect that a resignation is not the typical kind daily occurring in the work force. And as <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and<span class="Italic"> Faragher</span> further point out, an official act reflected in company records-a demotion or a reduction in compensation, for example-shows "beyond question" that the supervisor has used his managerial or controlling position to the employee's disadvantage.<span class="Italic"> See Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S., at 760. Absent such an official act, the extent to which the supervisor's misconduct has been aided by the agency relation, as we earlier recounted, <span class="Italic">see supra,</span> at 13, is less certain. That uncertainty, our precedent establishes, <span class="Italic">see supra,</span> at 13-14, justifies affording the employer the chance to establish, through the<span class="Italic"> Ellerth/Faragher</span> affirmative defense, that it should not be held vicariously liable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Third Circuit drew the line differently. Under its formulation, the affirmative defense would be eliminated in all hostile-environment constructive discharge cases, but retained, as<span class="Italic"> Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> require, in "ordinary" hostile work environment cases, i.e., cases involving no tangible employment action. That placement of the line, anomalously, would make the graver claim of hostile-environment constructive discharge easier to prove than its lesser included component, hostile work environment. Moreover, the Third Circuit's formulation, that court itself recognized, would make matters complex, indeed, more than a little confusing to jurors. Creation of a hostile work environment is a necessary predicate to a hostile-environment constructive discharge case. Juries would be so informed. Under the Third Circuit's decision, a jury, presumably, would be cautioned to consider the affirmative-defense evidence only in reaching a decision on the hostile work environment claim, and to ignore or at least downplay that same evidence in deciding the closely associated constructive discharge claim. It makes scant sense thus to alter the decisive instructions from one claim to the next when the only variation between the two claims is the severity of the hostile working conditions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Faragher,</span> 524 U.S., at 801 (affirming "the virtue of categorical clarity").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, finally, two recent Court of Appeals decisions that indicate how the "official act" (or "tangible employment action") criterion should play out when constructive discharge is alleged. Both decisions advance the untangled approach we approve in this opinion. In <span class="Italic">Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc.,</span> 333 F. 3d 27 (CA1 2003), the plaintiff claimed a constructive discharge based on her supervisor's repeated sexual <span id="Page_919"></span>comments and an incident in which he sexually assaulted her. The First Circuit held that the alleged wrongdoing did not preclude the employer from asserting the <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> affirmative defense. As the court explained in <span class="Italic">Reed,</span> the supervisor's behavior involved no official actions. Unlike, "e.g., an extremely dangerous job assignment to retaliate for spurned advances," 333 F.3d, at 33, the supervisor's conduct in <span class="Italic">Reed</span> "was exceedingly unofficial and involved no direct exercise of company authority"; indeed, it was "exactly the kind of wholly unauthorized conduct for which the affirmative defense was designed," <span class="Italic">ibid.</span> In contrast, in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Sappington,</span> 351 F.3d 317 (CA7 2003), after the plaintiff complained that she was sexually harassed by the judge for whom she worked, the presiding judge decided to transfer her to another judge, but told her that "her first six months [in the new post] probably would be 'hell,'" and that it was in her "'best interest to resign.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 324. The Seventh Circuit held that the employer was precluded from asserting the affirmative defense to the plaintiff's constructive discharge claim. The<span class="Italic"> Robinson</span> plaintiff's decision to resign, the court explained, "resulted, at least in part, from [the presiding judge's] official actio[n] in transferring" her to a judge who resisted placing her on his staff.<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> at 337. The courts in<span class="Italic"> Reed</span> and <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> properly recognized that <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher,</span> which divided the universe of supervisor-harassment claims according to the presence or absence of an official act, mark the path constructive discharge claims based on harassing conduct must follow.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its summation, the Third Circuit qualified its holding that a constructive discharge itself "constitutes a tangible employment action within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher.</span>" 325 F.3d, at 462. The affirmative defense <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> delineated, the court said, might be imported into the anterior issue whether "the employee's decision to resign was reasonable under the circumstances." 325 F. 3d, at 462. As the Third Circuit expressed its thinking:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[I]t may be relevant to a claim of constructive discharge whether an employer had an effective remedial scheme in place, whether an employer attempted to investigate, or otherwise to address, plaintiff's complaints, and whether plaintiff took advantage of alternatives offered by antiharassment programs."<span class="Italic"> Ibid.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">These considerations, the Third Circuit recognized, "are, of course, the same considerations relevant to the affirmative defense in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher.</span>" <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Third Circuit left open when and how the<span class="Italic"> Ellerth/Faragher</span> considerations would be brought home to the fact trier. It did not address specifically the allocation of pleading and persuasion burdens. It simply relied on "the wisdom and expertise of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing whether all, some, or none of the evidence relating to employers' antiharassment programs and to employees' exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial." 325 F. 3d, at 463.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We see no cause for leaving the district courts thus unguided. Following <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher,</span> the plaintiff who alleges no tangible employment action has the duty to mitigate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to allege and prove that the plaintiff failed in that regard. <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> at 14-15. The plaintiff might elect to allege facts relevant to mitigation in her pleading or to present those facts in her case in chief, but she would do so in anticipation of the employer's affirmative defense, not as a legal requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, when a hostile environment culminates in a personnel action, the affirmative defense is not available to the agency and it is strictly liable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scherman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A44024 (2006) (no affirmative defense available where supervisor subjected complainant to sexual harassment and then reassigned her to be his personal secretary).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is, however, very difficult for a complainant to demonstrate that a hostile environment has led to a constructive removal. If the complainant fails to prevail on the constructive discharge claim, then the affirmative defense is available. For example, in <span class="Italic">Pierson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120063611 (2007), the complainant demonstrated that her supervisor repeatedly engaged in conduct that resulted in physical contact that was often sexual in nature. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Pierson</span>, found<span class="Italic">:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that S1 was complainant's supervisor, we apply the law of supervisory liability to determine whether there is a basis for imputing liability to the agency. The Supreme Court and the Commission have moved away from the commonly used categories of "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" and hostile work environment harassment, finding it more useful analytically to distinguish between harassment that results in a tangible employment action and harassment that creates a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Indus, v. Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S. 742, 760-65 (1998); <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</span> 524 U.S. 775, 807,4998); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, at 2, n.7 (June 18, 1999). In <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher, supra,</span> the Supreme Court made clear that employers are subject to vicarious liability for unlawful harassment by supervisors. The standard of liability set forth in these decisions is premised on two principles: 1) an employer is responsible for the acts of its supervisors, and 2) employers should be encouraged to prevent harassment and employees should be encouraged to avoid or limit the harm from harassment. In order to accommodate these principles, the Court held that an employer is always liable for a supervisor's harassment if it culminates in a tangible employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we first address whether the harassment here culminated in a tangible employment action. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that complainant alleges she was forced to resign because of S1's conduct, we must determine whether she was constructively discharged. Unlawful constructive discharge occurs when the employer, motivated by discriminatory animus, creates working conditions that are so difficult, unpleasant, or intolerable that a reasonable person in complainant's position would feel compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Social Sec. Admin.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01 A1 14791 (Feb. 21, 2003). There are three elements to a constructive discharge claim. Complainant must show that: (1) a reasonable person in her position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct which constituted prohibited discriminatory treatment created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) complainant's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">Greer v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01976756, 01976792 (Dec. 29, 2000) (<span class="Italic">citing Taylor v. Dep't of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900630 (July 20, 1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not find complainant's resignation to be a constructive discharge. A reasonable person in complainant's position would not have felt compelled to resign under these particular circumstances. By November 1, 2004, the agency had reassigned S1 out of the unit where complainant worked. The record shows that the workplace was such that she could have avoided all contact with S1 in his new position. Moreover, complainant has not argued that any other management official created an unbearable working environment for her. Therefore, it does not follow that her work environment in general became so intolerable that she felt compelled to leave. Accordingly, we do not find that the alleged harassment culminated in a tangible employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, S1's actions resulted in an unlawful hostile work environment, and as such, the agency may raise an affirmative defense to liability for damages which it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
