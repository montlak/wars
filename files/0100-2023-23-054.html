<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-53"><span class="space">4.</span> Nexus Requirement</h4>
<p class="noindent">To be entitled to a reasonable accommodation, "employee is required to show a nexus between the disabling condition and the requested accommodation." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Elenore F. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120141913 (2016) (complainant submitted no evidence of a connection between her hearing impairment and requested accommodation); <span class="Italic">Karin C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120132494 (2015) (complainant did not show her absences, which resulted in leave restriction letter, were due to Meniere's disease); <span class="Italic">Featherstone v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113188 (2013) (employee seeking daytime tour to take medication did not demonstrate why medication could not be taken on nighttime tour); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, 0120120154 (2013) (complainant's "assertion that the typographical errors "apparently" were not his fault because he could not see is insufficient to show that a disability caused the many performance problems underlying the termination of his employment."). For example, if the employee is seeking reasonable accommodation through a flexible sick leave policy, the employee must demonstrate there is a causal connection between his disabling condition and his absences. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wojtila v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995705 (2002); <span class="Italic">Omar v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912905 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that a disabling condition coincides with excessive absences is insufficient in the absence of evidence demonstrating a link between the two. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Upchurch v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01992399 (2002) (complainant failed to establish a nexus between her fear of flying, that she claimed resulted in a lowered performance appraisal, and her depression); <span class="Italic">In re Estate of Williams v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01982598 (2001) (holding that complainant failed to establish a nexus between her cancer and her request to move a copier or change her work location to minimize her exposure to ammonia); <span class="Italic">Sheriff v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 03950044 (1995) (where there was no evidence that the complainant's physical disabilities prevented her from performing the essential functions of the position, there can be no finding of discrimination). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Myers v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A23380 (2003), the Commission found there was no nexus between the complainant's pulmonary condition and her request for accommodation which included permission to telecommute, and for a change in hours and days off. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120122896 (2014) ("The physician's brief notes were insufficient to establish a nexus between Complainant's medical condition and her requested accommodations."); <span class="Italic">Desrosiers v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A55600 (2006) (no nexus shown between knee condition and request to skip lunch and leave work early); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A51588 (2005) (no showing of nexus between ankle injury and/or stress and request for shift change).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Concha E. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120140732 (2016), the essential functions of the complainant's job required 100% computer work, but her condition made her unable to sit for prolonged periods of time. Rather than requesting an accommodation that would address her inability to sit for long periods, she requested a lighter workload. The Commission had little trouble finding no nexus between the accommodation sought and the limitations imposed by the complainant's condition</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01986974 (2002), the Commission found the complainant had failed to establish the required nexus between his learning disability and his requested accommodations. In that case, the complainant failed to attain the minimum score on a math test for the position he sought. The Commission noted that analyzing the test as a qualification standard under 29 CFR 1630.10, the complainant failed to show the test tended to screen him out of the selection process because he had not demonstrated any causal connection between his learning disability and his failure to obtain the minimum math score.</p>
<p class="noindent">Stated another way, an agency is not required to provide an accommodation that does not assist an employee in performing the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">Conley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984624 (2001). For example, in <span class="Italic">Shoemaker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A40111 (2005), the Commission found that the complainant failed to establish a nexus between her request for two consecutive days off and the performance of the essential functions of her position as part-time flexible employee. Although the employee presented a statement from her physician that not having two consecutive days off would have a depressant effect on the complainant, the Commission found that this <span id="Page_1157"></span>evidence did not explain how the requested accommodation would assist her in performing essential job functions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the precise contours of the decision are unclear, in <span class="Italic">Hyche v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A41471 (2005), the Commission found that the agency did not fail to provide reasonable accommodation for a vision impairment by permanently reassigning the complainant to the day shift because the complainant apparently failed to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between her impairment and the specific accommodation request. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hyche</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, after careful review of the record, the Commission determines that the facts of this case fail to demonstrate that night driving creates a "barrier" to complainant's employment. The record reflects that complainant works eight straight weeks on the day schedule, followed by two weeks on an evening or night schedule, and that night driving is therefore limited to these two week periods. Complainant contends that she requires the requested accommodation because the glare from night driving causes her eyes to itch, water, and dry-out, which increases the chance of corneal graft rejection. However, in her affidavit, complainant stated that night driving is not actually the issue, but rather the risk of graft rejection. The May 10, 2002 physician's letter complainant submits indicates that "It is reasonable to expect that night driving is difficult at present due to glare"; however, there is nothing in the record supporting a finding that night driving would further injure complainant's eyes or increase the risk of graft rejection. Moreover, the record is devoid of any evidence to indicate that complainant's vision precludes her from legally driving at night. In her affidavit, complainant states that night driving "puts a little strain on my eyes," and indicates that they hurt more after driving at night. Although complainant argues on appeal that working at night is also detrimental to her vision, record evidence fails to support this contention. Complainant's physician indicates that complainant's vision would be unaffected by the time of day once she was working inside the facility. We also note record evidence reflects that after arriving at the facility to work the night shift, complainant treats her eyes with drops, which substantially corrects any ill-effect from the glare experienced during her commute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances of this case, where complainant's medical documentation failed to confirm that driving to work at night (or working the night shift) would result in an injury to her eyes, or increase the risk of graft rejection, or that driving at night was unduly dangerous or difficult, we find that the agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act when it denied complainant's request for a permanent daylight shift as a reasonable accommodation for her vision impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Julius C. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120151295 (2017), the complainant, a materials' handling supervisor for the Air Force, requested a reassignment out of the warehouse he worked in due to rashes he began suffering after beginning work there. In support of his request, he submitted a doctor's note stating that he "could not work in 'industrial areas due to medical reasons' due to contact with an unknown substance." The agency denied his request, finding the medical documentation inadequate. Months later, he renewed his request, noting his "ongoing severe allergic contact skin reaction dermatitis." This time, he submitted a doctor's note stating that he was being exposed to an unknown substance or material at work that was causing his rashes and advising that the complainant be reassigned out of the warehouse. His request was again denied because the doctor's note failed to identify the source of the rashes and the complainant's supervisor was "not convinced" that a substance from the warehouse was the cause. The complainant alleged a failure to accommodate. In its final agency decision, the agency found that the complainant failed to show a nexus between his disability and his request for assignment, "as the material/substance that caused Complainant's dermatitis was unknown and unable to be identified." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Julius C</span>. disagreed, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we find the Agency erred in finding that Complainant did not establish a nexus between his disability and his requested accommodation. In so finding, we note that Complainant's doctor advised that Complainant "switch the areas of work exposure as we are unable to determine what is causing the allergic reaction-skin rash-contact dermatitis." Although the exact substance that was affecting his skin may have been unknown, the Agency did not rebut Complainant's affidavit that the warehouse where he was assigned contained batteries, weapons, aircraft parts and general supplies. In addition, the Chief of Customer Support declared that she had observed Complainant "numerous times with a rash on his head, face, neck and arms where it was welted up and very red." We note that S1, herself, also averred that she saw a rash on Complainant's forehead.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Estate of Merlon Thomley v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120052652 (2007), the Commission found that the complainant failed to establish a nexus between his disability and the requested accommodation and also failed to establish that there was nexus between his removal for unacceptable performance and his disability. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Thomley</span> had a permanent vision impairment that reduced his field of vision in each eye to less than 10% and also resulted in flashers and floaters in his visual field. The agency granted an accommodation to place him at a workstation most near natural light. Although the complainant's job was in a largely paperless environment, the agency also permitted him to print out computerized documents and reproduce them on a high-contrast copier to make them easier to read. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Thomley</span> found that the agency did not fail to accommodate the complainant by providing desktop equipment that would produce high-contrast copies. The Commission found that the vision impairment did not interfere with the complainant's ability to reproduce the documents on the copier because there was no impairment of mobility. The Commission also noted that the reasons for the complainant's performance--lack of job knowledge, inability to work independently and inability to process actions with multiple issues--were equally unrelated to his visual impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases involving misconduct, the employee must show the misconduct is due to the disabling condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stallworth v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05900416 (1990) (complainant failed to show how post-traumatic stress syndrome caused him to assault his supervisor). An employer relies on a disability in taking disciplinary action when it bases the action on conduct caused by the disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter R. Co</span>., 951 F.2d 511 (2nd Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 506 U.S. 815 (1992). In that case, the court found the employee was discharged on the basis of his disability when the employer relied on his excessive absences that were caused by his substance abuse.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Widnall</span>, 79 F.3d 1003 (10th Cir. 1996), the court rejected the <span class="Italic">Teahan</span> approach in a case where the employee had been terminated for making threats. Although the employee contended the threatening behavior was caused by his alcoholism, the court determined that it could not accept any interpretation of the phrase "solely by reason of" his disability that would allow alcoholic employees to get away with behavior that would not be excused for other employees. In rejecting the <span class="Italic">Teahan</span> approach, the <span class="Italic">Widnall</span> court wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish the second element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, Mr. Williams must show he was qualified to perform his job's essential functions <span class="Italic">apart from</span> his handicap, i.e., with or without reasonable accommodation. Mr. Williams contends he was qualified, or would have been qualified, to perform the essential functions of his job had defendant provided reasonable accommodation for his alcoholism. Mr. Williams argues defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his alcoholism because he was not provided inpatient treatment for a sufficient period of time prior to his termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Mr. Williams does not refute the finding of the Merit Systems Protection Board that he was entered into treatment. Appellee's App. at 35; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 78. Further, Mr. Williams does not dispute the fact that he had been in an inpatient rehabilitation program for a week at the time he made one of the threats. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 37 n.*.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reasonable accommodation for the handicap of alcoholism requires, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an employee be given time off to participate in a treatment program. <span class="Italic">See Fuller v. Frank</span>, 916 F.2d 558, 562 (9th Cir. 1990). Mr. Williams was allowed time off for treatment. However, defendant was under no obligation to wait until Mr. Williams successfully completed the program, especially where as here, the threats continued while he was in treatment. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. We agree that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"both effective treatment and the needs of the workplace require that an alcoholic employee be firmly confronted with the consequences of his drinking. Excessive sensitivity is no more conducive to a cure than is undue rigor, and in the final analysis 'reasonable accommodation' is the establishment of a process which embodies a proper balance between the two."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 561 (quoting <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253, 259 (4th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, defendant did all it was reasonably required to do to accommodate Mr. Williams' disability. Because the threats continued despite treatment, defendant was justified in concluding Mr. Williams' handicap could not be reasonably accommodated without "undue hardship" on defendant in the form of potential harm to Mr. Williams' supervisor and co-workers. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., School Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline</span>, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 1131 n.17, 94 L. Ed.2d 307 (1987). Because his disability could not be reasonably accommodated, Mr. Williams cannot satisfy the second prong of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, Mr. Williams contends the threats he made were a direct result of his disability. We have not addressed whether an adverse action may properly be taken against a party because of an attribute caused by the handicap and not the handicap itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Mr. Williams urges that we adopt the court's position in <span class="Italic">Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter Railroad</span>, 951 F.2d 511 (2d Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 506 U.S. 815, 113 S. Ct. 54, 121 L. Ed.2d 24 (1992), and hold that adverse actions taken against an employee caused by the employee's handicap are sufficient to support a claim under &#x00A7; 501(b). Brief of Appellant at 7-8. In <span class="Italic">Teahan</span>, the court held that termination which was justified as being due to absenteeism shown to be caused by substance abuse is termination "solely by reason of" that abuse for purposes of the Act. 951 F.2d at 517.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1158"></span>We disagree. We cannot adopt an interpretation of the statute which would require an employer to accept egregious behavior by an alcoholic employee when that same behavior, exhibited by a nondisabled employee, would require termination. We agree that "an employer subject to the Rehabilitation Act must be permitted to terminate its employee on account of egregious misconduct, irrespective of whether the employee is handicapped." <span class="Italic">Little v. FBI</span>, 1 F.3d 255, 259 (4th Cir. 1993). There the court noted that an "employer 'may hold a[n]...alcoholic to the same standard of performance and behavior to which it holds others, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the person's...alcoholism.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 258 (quoting 42 Fed. Reg. 22,686 (1977)). We agree with the view that "the Act does not protect alcoholics or drug addicts from the consequences of their misconduct." 1 F.3d at 258.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Sixth Circuit rejected the <span class="Italic">Teahan</span> holding in <span class="Italic">Maddox v. University of Tennessee</span>, 62 F.3d 843 (6th Cir. 1995), and held that "[e]mployers subject to the Rehabilitation Act and ADA must be permitted to take appropriate action with respect to an employee on account of egregious or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the employee is disabled." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 848. The court supported its reasoning by noting that both &#x00A7; 706(8)(C)(v) and 42 USC &#x00A7; 12114(c)(4) of the ADA clearly contemplate distinguishing misconduct from one's status as an alcoholic. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 847-48. The court concluded that "it strains logic to conclude that such [egregious or criminal] action could be protected under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA merely because the actor has been diagnosed as an alcoholic and claims that such action was caused by his disability." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 848.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Mr. Williams does not deny that he made threats against his supervisor and co-workers. He also does not deny that he received a letter placing him in a nonduty pay status and putting him on notice that if he did not provide certification from a mental health professional that he could safely return to work, administrative action including removal would be considered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 19. Mr. Williams also does not deny that he was removed in accordance with Air Force regulations which authorize removal as a penalty for threatening another with bodily harm. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 20, 87. Clearly, Mr. Williams' dismissal was for his egregious conduct and the threat it posed to the safety of his supervisor and co-workers.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1006-07.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is unlikely that a complainant can show a nexus between his mental illness and his misconduct where the complainant can recognize the onset of episodes and has done so in the past. In <span class="Italic">Means v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 03940050 (1994), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the hearing, petitioner's psychiatrist indicated that between manic episodes an individual's behavior could vary "all the way from being perfectly normal...to any lay person's scrutiny to what we call partial remission, which is mini...psychotic episodes...." She said that such mini episodes might look like "angry episodes or irritable episodes, or whatever...." The psychiatrist did not address whether she believed the misconduct at issue in this case was the result of petitioner's disorder. Further, petitioner himself specifically stated that he did not believe that his disorder caused the behavior at issue in two of the incidents in which the agency charged him with insubordination and/or discourteous conduct, nor did he assert during his testimony that it caused any of the other misconduct with which he was charged. In this regard, we note that the psychiatrist testified that individuals with bipolar disorder are able to recognize the onset of their illness. And, the record shows that petitioner on several occasions recognized the onset of an episode and went to the hospital and/or committed himself voluntarily. Having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, including petitioner's medical evidence, we find that the evidence is insufficient for us to conclude that the misconduct with which petitioner is charged represents a manifestation of his mental disorder rather than a deliberate challenge to agency officials' authority. Consequently, we find that petitioner failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a nexus existed between his disabling condition and the incidents for which he was disciplined.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Allen v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993959 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, since reasonable accommodation is always prospective, an employer is not required to excuse past misconduct even if it is the result of the individual's disability. Reasonable Accommodation Guidance at 48. An employer is not barred from imposing discipline on or terminating an employee who, because of a disability, violated a conduct rule that is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 47. An employer never has to excuse a violation of a uniformly applied conduct rule that is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01995481 (2002) (no nexus between disabling condition and charged misconduct where issue was not complainant's absence, but failure to notify agency of absence); <span class="Italic">Hufford-Smith v. Attorney General</span>, 01995040 (2002) (even if complainant established nexus between bulimia and shoplifting, agency had zero tolerance policy for shoplifters).</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden is on the complainant to show a connection between his disability and the conduct at issue. <span class="Italic">Brill v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01910547 (1991). The Commission found there was no nexus shown where complainant's disability was alcoholism, but performance problems were allegedly the result of side effects from thorazine taken for stress. Absent medical evidence demonstrating that stress was a result of the alcoholism or was a disabling condition in its own right, there was no causal connection demonstrated between the side effects of the medication and the complainant's performance problems.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where the complainant establishes a nexus between his or her disability and the misconduct, the disability is not an excuse for misconduct. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996955 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commission guidance holds that an agency may discipline an individual with a disability for violating a conduct standard, even if the misconduct resulted from the disability, as long as the conduct standard is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span>, No. 915.002 (March 25, 1997), at question 30; <span class="Italic">see also Ayers v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01975550 (February 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Except in the most obvious cases, a showing of nexus will require medical testimony or documentation.</p>
