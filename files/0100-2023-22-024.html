<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-25"><span class="space">7.</span> Sexual Orientation, Transgender Status, and the Courts</h4>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia</span>, 590 US ___, Nos. 17-1618, 17-1623, 18-107 (June 2020), the circuit courts were split as to whether sexual orientation and transgender status stated a claim of sex-based discrimination under Title VII. Of course, the Commission had already decidedly held that the "because of sex" prohibition in Title VII is broad enough to include sexual orientation and transgender status, but not all courts had taken such a progressive approach. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120133080 (2015) (sexual orientation); <span class="Italic">Macy v. Attorney General</span>, 0120120821 (2012) (transgender status). Before most courts, the most successful argument was still that discrimination based on transgender status and/or sexual orientation is stereotyping based on sex. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Scott Medical Health Center</span>, Civ. No. 2:16-cv-00225-CB (W.D. Pa. 2016) (finding that the employee stated a claim of sex-based harassment when his supervisor "routinely made unwelcome and offensive comments about [the plaintiff], including but not limited to regularly calling him 'fag,' 'faggot,' 'fucking faggot,' and 'queer,' and making statements such as 'fucking queer can't do your job'" and denying the employer's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim; holding that sexual orientation is protected under Title VII as sex based stereotyping); <span class="Italic">EEOC v.</span> <span class="Italic">R.G. &#x0026; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc</span>., 884 F.3ds 560 (6th Cir. 2018) (finding that terminating a transgender employee violated Title VII because of her failure to conform to sex stereotypes and also noting that "it is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee's status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee's sex."); <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital, et al.</span>, 850 F.3d 1248 (11th Cir. 2017) (declining to extend Title VII sex-based protections to sexual orientation).</p>
<p class="noindent">A fairly major victory for the EEOC came out of the U.S. District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania where the court, in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Scott Medical Health Center</span>, Civ. No. 2:16-cv-00225-CB (W.D. Pa. 2016), denied the employer's motion to dismiss the employee's complaint for failure to state a claim The employee filed a complaint of discriminatory sex based harassment when his supervisor "routinely made unwelcome and offensive comments about [the plaintiff], including but not limited to regularly calling him 'fag,' 'faggot,' 'fucking faggot,' and 'queer,' and making statements such as 'fucking queer can't do your job.'" The court agreed with the Commission that sexual orientation is, indeed, protected under Title VII, reasoning:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that [employees] matched the stereotype associated with their group, for "'[i]n forbidding employers to discriminate against individuals because of their sex, Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 251 (citing <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13 (1978)). There is no more obvious form of sex stereotyping than making a determination that a person should conform to heterosexuality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, the Court finds discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is, at its very core, sex stereotyping plain and simple; there is no line separating the two. <span class="Italic">Contra Prowel</span>, 579 F.3d at 291 ("[T]he line between sexual orientation discrimination and discrimination "because of sex" can be difficult to draw."). It is, in the view of the undersigned, a distinction without a difference. Forcing an employee to fit into a gendered expectation--whether that expectation involves physical traits, clothing, mannerisms or sexual attraction--constitutes sex stereotyping and, under <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, violates Title VII. Simply put, Mr. McClendon's alleged conduct toward Mr. Baxley "stemmed from an impermissibly cabined view of the proper behavior" of men. <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 236-37.</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, the most successful arguments in the private sector at that time were those grounded in sex-based stereotyping, but there was a definite trend with some circuit courts aligning themselves with the Commission's position on sexual orientation and transgender status.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Seventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana</span>, 853 F.3d 339 (7th Cir. 2017), for example, held that Title VII protections against sex discrimination extends to sexual orientation. Hively, an openly gay female and part-time adjunct professor for Ivy Tech, alleged discrimination based on her sexual orientation when she applied for but was not selected for five full-time positions and her part-time contract was not renewed. Ivy Tech moved for dismissal for failure to state a claim, citing Seventh Circuit precedent holding that sexual orientation is not protected under Title VII as sex-based discrimination. Granting Ivy Tech's motion, the district court dismissed Hively's case with prejudice. A limited panel of Second Circuit judges affirmed the district court's dismissal. Hively moved for a rehearing of the case <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, which was granted. The <span class="Italic">Hively</span> court wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The logic of the Supreme Court's decisions, as well as the common-sense reality that it is actually impossible to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without discriminating on the basis of sex, persuade us that the time has come to overrule our previous cases that have endeavored to find and observe that line.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a growing judicial consensus, the Second Circuit, sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, soon followed in <span class="Italic">Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc</span>., 883 F.3d 100 (2nd Cir. 2018), similarly holding that sexual orientation discrimination constitutes a form of discrimination "because of...sex" in violation of Title VII and further noting that "[s]exual orientation is a function of sex, and by extension, sexual orientation is a subset of sex discrimination." Zarda, a skydiving instructor, claimed that he was fired after revealing his sexual orientation to a client. The <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> court framed the issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he question before us is whether an employee's sex is necessarily a motivating factor in discrimination based on sexual orientation. If it is, then sexual orientation discrimination is properly understood as "a subset of actions taken on the basis of sex." <span class="Italic">Hively</span>, 853 F.3d at 343.</p>
<p class="noindent">Answering both questions in the affirmative, the majority reasoned that in order to "identify the sexual orientation of a particular person," an employer must "know the sex of the person and that of the people to whom he or she <span id="Page_997"></span>is attracted." Tying both considerations together, the <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> court continued:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because one cannot fully define a person's sexual orientation without identifying his or her sex, sexual orientation is a function of sex. Indeed sexual orientation is doubly delineated by sex because it is a function of both a person's sex and the sex of those to whom he or she is attracted. Logically, because sexual orientation is a function of sex and sex is a protected characteristic under Title VII, it follows that sexual orientation is also protected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer's failure to reference gender directly does not change the fact that a "gay" employee is simply a man who is attracted to men. For purposes of Title VII, firing a man because he is attracted to men is a decision motivated, at least in part, by sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court dismissed arguments that the framers of Title VII never intended for the "sex" to be construed as including "sexual orientation" by pointing to "sexual harassment and hostile work environment claims, both of which were initially believed to fall outside the scope of Title VII's prohibition" and explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[B]ecause Congress could not anticipate the full spectrum of employment discrimination that would be directed at the protected categories, it falls to courts to give effect to the broad language that Congress used.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court gave voice to this principle of construction when it held that Title VII barred male-on-male sexual harassment, which "was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII," <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, 523 U.S. at 79-80, and which few people in 1964 would likely have understood to be covered by the statutory text. But the Court was untroubled by these facts. "[S]tatutory prohibitions," it explained, "often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Applying this reasoning to the question at hand, the fact that Congress might not have contemplated that discrimination "because of...sex" would encompass sexual orientation discrimination does not limit the reach of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next, the <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> court employed the "but for" and "comparative test," which "determines whether the trait that is the basis for discrimination is a function of sex by asking whether an employee's treatment would have been different 'but for that person's sex.'" As an initial matter, one must determine what the proper comparators are: between a woman attracted to women and a man attracted to women or between a woman and a man, both of whom are attracted to people of the same sex. Using the <span class="Italic">Hively</span> decision as an example, the court, in <span class="Italic">Zarda</span>, wrote in support of the former comparison:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Determining which of these framings is correct requires understanding the purpose and operation of the comparative test. Although the Supreme Court has not elaborated on the role that the test plays in Title VII jurisprudence, based on how the Supreme Court has employed the test, we understand that its purpose is to determine when a trait other than sex is, in fact, a proxy for (or a function of) sex. To determine whether a trait is such a proxy, the test compares a female and a male employee who both exhibit the trait at issue. In the comparison, the trait is the control, sex is the independent variable, and employee treatment is the dependent variable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government's s proposed approach to <span class="Italic">Hively</span>, which would compare a woman attracted to people of the same sex with a man attracted to people of the same sex, adopts the wrong framing. To understand why this is incorrect, consider the mismatch between the facts in the government's comparison and the allegation at issue: Hively did not allege that her employer discriminated against women with same-sex attraction but not men with same-sex attraction. If she had, that would be classic sex discrimination against a subset of women. Instead, Hively claimed that her employer discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. To address that allegation, the proper question is whether sex is a "motivating factor" in sexual orientation discrimination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), or, said more simply, whether sexual orientation is a function of sex. But, contrary to the government's suggestion, this question cannot be answered by comparing two people with the same sexual orientation. That would be equivalent to comparing the gender non-conforming female plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> to a gender non-conforming man; such a comparison would not illustrate whether a particular stereotype is sex dependent but only whether the employer discriminates against gender non-conformity in only one gender. Instead, just as <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> compared a gender non-conforming woman to a gender conforming man, both of whom were aggressive and did not wear makeup or jewelry, the <span class="Italic">Hively</span> court properly determined that sexual orientation is sex dependent by comparing a woman and a man with two different sexual orientations, both of whom were attracted to women.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having addressed the proper application of the comparative test, we conclude that the law is clear: To determine whether a trait operates as a proxy for sex, we ask whether the employee would have been treated differently "but for" his or her sex. In the context of sexual orientation, a woman who is subject to an adverse employment action because she is attracted to women would have been treated differently if she had been a man who was attracted to women. We can therefore conclude that sexual orientation is a function of sex and, by extension, sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Turning to gender stereotyping, the <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> court noted that homosexuality "represents the ultimate case of failure to conform to gender stereotypes," namely the expectation that men are only attracted to women and women are only attracted to men.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying, in part, on <span class="Italic">Loving v. Virginia</span>, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), the <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> court further held that the "prohibition on associational discrimination applies with equal force to all the classes protected by Title VII, including sex":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The conclusion that sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination is further reinforced by viewing this issue through the lens of associational discrimination. Consistent with the nature of sexual orientation, in most contexts where an employer discriminates based on sexual orientation, the employer's decision is predicated on opposition to romantic association between particular sexes. For example, when an employer fires a gay man based on the belief that men should not be attracted to other men, the employer discriminates based on the employee's own sex. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin</span>, 2015 WL 4397641, at *6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]f a male employee married to a man is terminated because his employer disapproves of same-sex marriage, the employee has suffered associational discrimination based on his own sex because "the fact that the employee is a man instead of a woman motivated the employer's discrimination against him."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Loving</span>, the Commonwealth of Virginia argued that anti-miscegenation statutes did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because such statutes applied equally to white and black citizens. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 7-8. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that "equal application" could not save the statute because it was based "upon distinctions drawn according to race." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10-11. Constitutional cases like <span class="Italic">Loving</span> "can provide helpful guidance in [the] statutory context" of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Ricci v. DeStefano</span>, 557 U.S. 557, 582 (2009); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Reva B. Siegel, She the People: The Nineteenth Amendment, Sex Equality, Federalism, and the Family, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 947, 949 (2002) (arguing that, in the constitutional context, "the Supreme Court developed the law of sex discrimination by means of an analogy between sex and race discrimination"). Accordingly, we find that <span class="Italic">Loving's</span> insight--that policies that distinguish according to protected characteristics cannot be saved by equal application--extends to association based on sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ssociational discrimination is not limited to acts; instead, as with all other violations of Title VII, associational discrimination runs afoul of the statute by making the employee's protected characteristic a motivating factor for an adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we see no principled basis for recognizing a violation of Title VII for associational discrimination based on race but not on sex. Accordingly, we hold that sexual orientation discrimination, which is based on an employer's opposition to association between particular sexes and thereby discriminates against an employee based on their own sex, constitutes discrimination "because of...sex." Therefore, it is no less repugnant to Title VII than anti-miscegenation policies.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court summarized its holding and applied it to the facts of <span class="Italic">Zarda</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since 1964, the legal framework for evaluating Title VII claims has evolved substantially. Under <span class="Italic">Manhart</span>, traits that operate as a proxy for sex are an impermissible basis for disparate treatment of men and women. Under <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes is prohibited. Under <span class="Italic">Holcomb</span>, building on <span class="Italic">Loving</span>, it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of an employee's association with persons of another race. Applying these precedents to sexual orientation discrimination, it is clear that there is "no justification in the statutory language...for a categorical rule excluding" such claims from the reach of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, 523 U.S. at 80; <span class="Italic">see also Baldwin</span>, 2015 WL 4397641, at *9 ("Interpreting the sex discrimination prohibition of Title VII to exclude coverage of lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of sex inserts a limitation into the text that Congress has not included.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII's prohibition on sex discrimination applies to any practice in which sex is a motivating factor. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m). As explained above, sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination because sexual orientation is defined by one's sex in relation to the sex <span id="Page_998"></span>of those to whom one is attracted, making it impossible for an employer to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without taking sex into account. Sexual orientation discrimination is also based on assumptions or stereotypes about how members of a particular gender should be, including to whom they should be attracted. Finally, sexual orientation discrimination is associational discrimination because an adverse employment action that is motivated by the employer's opposition to association between members of particular sexes discriminates against an employee on the basis of sex. Each of these three perspectives is sufficient to support this Court's conclusion and together they amply demonstrate that sexual orientation discrimination is a form of sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although sexual orientation discrimination is "assuredly not the principal evil that Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII," "statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils." <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, 523 U.S. at 80. In the context of Title VII, the statutory prohibition extends to all discrimination "because of...sex" and sexual orientation discrimination is an actionable subset of sex discrimination. We overturn our prior precedents to the contrary to the extent they conflict with this ruling. <span class="Italic">See Simonton</span>, 232 F.3d at 35; <span class="Italic">Dawson</span>, 398 F.3d at 218-20.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Zarda has alleged that, by "honestly referr[ing] to his sexual orientation," he failed to "conform to the straight male macho stereotype." For this reason, he has alleged a claim of discrimination of the kind we now hold cognizable under Title VII. The district court held that there was sufficient evidence of sexual orientation discrimination to survive summary judgment on Zarda's state law claims. Even though Zarda lost his state sexual orientation discrimination claim at trial, that result does not preclude him from prevailing on his federal claim because his state law claim was tried under "a higher standard of causation than required by Title VII." <span class="Italic">Zarda</span>, 855 F.3d at 81. Thus, we hold that Zarda is entitled to bring a Title VII claim for discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The dissent in <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> also issued a lengthy discussion. After a copious review of the historical context of the passage of Title VII and relying on the expressed language regarding sex discrimination, Judge Lynch wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The above history makes it obvious to me, however, that the majority misconceives the fundamental public meaning of the language of the Civil Rights Act. The problem sought to be remedied by adding "sex" to the prohibited bases of employment discrimination was the pervasive discrimination against women in the employment market, and the chosen remedy was to prohibit discrimination that adversely affected members of one sex or the other. By prohibiting discrimination against people based on their sex, it did not, and does not, prohibit discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority's linguistic argument does not change the fact that the prohibition of employment discrimination "because of...sex" does not protect gays and lesbians. Simply put, discrimination based on sexual orientation is not the same thing as discrimination based on sex. As Judge Sykes explained,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[t]o a fluent speaker of the English language--then and now--the ordinary meaning of the word "sex" does not fairly include the concept of "sexual orientation." The two terms are never used interchangeably, and the latter is not subsumed within the former; there is no overlap in meaning. ...The words plainly describe different traits, and the separate and distinct meaning of each term is easily grasped. More specifically to the point here, discrimination "because of sex" is not reasonably understood to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, a different immutable characteristic. Classifying people by sexual orientation is different than classifying them by sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Hively</span>, 853 F.3d at 363 (Sykes, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">To further bolster its position, the <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> dissent pointed to the fact that federal and state legislators are currently trying to enact legislation protecting gay men and women against employment discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This movement, which has now been successful in twenty-two states--including all three in our Circuit--and the District of Columbia, has proceeded by expanding the categories of prohibited discrimination in state anti-discrimination laws. In none of those states did the 21 prohibitions of sexual orientation discrimination come by judicial interpretation of a pre-existing prohibition on gender-based discrimination to encompass discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Similarly, the Executive Branch has prohibited discrimination against gay men and lesbians in federal employment by adding "sexual orientation" to previously protected grounds. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 13087, 63 Fed. Reg 30,097 (May 28, 1998). Finally, the same approach has been reflected in the repeated (but so far unsuccessful) introduction of bills in Congress to add "sexual orientation" to the list of prohibited grounds of employment discrimination in Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, to the extent that we can infer the awareness of Congress at all, the continual attempts to add sexual orientation to Title VII, as well as the EEOC's determination regarding the meaning of sex, should be considered, in addition to the three appellate court decisions, as evidence that Congress was unquestionably aware, in 1991, of a general consensus about the meaning of "because of...sex," and of the fact that gay rights advocates were seeking to change the law by adding a new category of prohibited discrimination to the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> majority's stereotyping and associational discrimination holdings, the dissent argued:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he homophobic employer is not deploying a stereotype about men or about women to the disadvantage of either sex. Such an employer is expressing disapproval of the behavior or identity of a class of people that includes both men and women. 853 F.3d at 370. That disapproval does not stem from a desire to discriminate against either sex, nor does it result from any sex-specific stereotype, nor does it differentially harm either men or women <span class="Italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> the other sex. Rather, it results from a distinct type of objection to anyone, of whatever gender, who is identified as homosexual. The belief on which it rests is not a belief about what men or women ought to be or do; it is a belief about what all people ought to be or do--to be heterosexual, and to have sexual attraction to or relations with only members of the opposite sex. That does not make workplace discrimination based on this belief better or worse than other kinds of discrimination, but it does make it something different from sex discrimination, and therefore something that is not prohibited by Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, however, is not discrimination of the sort at issue in <span class="Italic">Holcomb</span> and <span class="Italic">Barrett</span>. In those cases, the plaintiffs alleged that they were discriminated against because the employer was biased--that is, had a "discriminatory animus"--against members of the race with whom the plaintiffs associated. There is no allegation in this case, nor could there plausibly be, that the defendant discriminated against Zarda because it had something against men, and therefore discriminated not only against men, but also against anyone, male or female, who associated with them. I have no trouble assuming that the principle of <span class="Italic">Holcomb</span> and <span class="Italic">Barrett</span> applies beyond the category of race discrimination: an employer who fired or refused to promote an AngloAmerican, Christian employee because she associated with Latinos or Jews would presumably run afoul of that principle just as much as one whose animus ran against black Americans. Such an employer would clearly be discriminating against the employee on the basis of her friends' ethnicity or religion--in the formulation from the Barrett opinion, that employer would be victimizing an employee out of "discriminatory animus toward protected third persons with whom the [employee] associate[d]." 556 F.3d at 512.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is more difficult to imagine realistic hypotheticals in which an employer discriminated against anyone who so much as associated with men or with women, though I suppose academic examples of such behavior could be conjured. But whatever such a case might look like, discrimination against gay people is not it. Discrimination against gay men, for example, plainly is not rooted in animus toward "protected third persons with whom [they] associate." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 556 F.3d at 512. An employer who practices such discrimination is hostile to gay men, not to men in general; the animus runs not, as in the race and religion cases discussed above, against a "protected group" to which the employee's associates belong, but against an (alas) unprotected group to which they belong: other gay men.</p>
<p class="noindent">In closing, the <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> dissent noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the end, perhaps all of these arguments, on both sides, boil down to a disagreement about how discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation should be conceptualized. Whether based on linguistic arguments or associational theories or notions of stereotyping, the majority's arguments attempt to draw theoretical links between one kind of discrimination and another: to find ways to reconceptualize discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as discrimination on the basis of sex. It is hard to believe that there would be much appetite for this kind of recharacterization if the law expressly prohibited sexual orientation discrimination, or that any opponent of sexual orientation discrimination would oppose the addition of sexual orientation to the list of protected characteristics in Title VII on the ground that to do so would be redundant or would express a misunderstanding of the nature of discrimination against men and women who are gay. I believe that the vast majority of people in our society--both those who are hostile to homosexuals and those who deplore such hostility--understand bias against or disapproval of those who are sexually attracted to persons of their own sex as a distinct type of prejudice, and not as merely a form of discrimination against either men or women on the basis of sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority asserts that discrimination against gay people is nothing more than a subspecies of discrimination against one or the other gender. Discrimination against gay men and lesbians is wrong, however, <span id="Page_999"></span>because it denies the dignity and equality of gay men and lesbians, and not because, in a purely formal sense, it can be said to treat men differently from women. It is understandable that those who seek to achieve legal protection for gay people victimized by discrimination search for innovative arguments to classify workplace bias against gays as a form of discrimination that is already prohibited by federal law. But the arguments advanced by the majority ignore the evident meaning of the language of Title VII, the social realities that distinguish between the kinds of biases that the statute sought to exclude from the workplace from those it did not, and the distinctive nature of anti-gay prejudice. Accordingly, much as I might wish it were otherwise, I must conclude that those arguments fail.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia</span>, No. 17-13801 (11th Cir. 2018), the county terminated Bostock for playing in a gay recreational softball league. According to the County, Bostock's participation evidenced conduct "unbecoming of a County employee." The 11th Circuit unceremoniously affirmed the district court's dismissal for failure to state a claim. Citing to 5th Circuit precedent, <span class="Italic">Blum v. Gulf Oil Corp</span>., 597 F.2d 936 (5th Cir. 1979), the 11th Circuit wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...This circuit has previously held that "[d]ischarge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII." <span class="Italic">Blum v. Gulf Oil Corp</span>., 597 F.2d 936, 938 (5th Cir. 1979)1 (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (emphasis added). And we recently confirmed that <span class="Italic">Blum</span> remains binding precedent in this circuit. <span class="Italic">See Evans v. Ga. Reg'l Hosp</span>., 850 F.3d 1248, 1256 (11th 723 Fed. Appx. 964, *964; 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 12405, Cir. 2017), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 138 S. Ct. 557, 199 L. Ed. 2d 446 (2017). In <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, we specifically rejected the argument that Supreme Court precedent in <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs</span>., 523 U.S. 75, 79, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998), and <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 250-51, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1989), supported a cause of action for sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, Bostock has abandoned any challenge to the district court's dismissal of his gender stereotyping claim under <span class="Italic">Glenn</span> because he does not specifically appeal the dismissal of this claim. <span class="Italic">See Timson</span>, 518 F.3d at 874. Moreover, the district court did not err in dismissing Bostock's complaint for sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII because our holding in <span class="Italic">Evans</span> forecloses Bostock's claim. And under our prior panel precedent rule, we cannot overrule a prior panel's holding, regardless of whether we think it was wrong, unless an intervening Supreme Court or Eleventh Circuit <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision is issued. <span class="Italic">United States v. Kaley</span>, 579 F.3d 1246, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">United States v. Steele</span>, 147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">The 11th Circuit later denied Bostock's appeal for an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> review of his case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Shortly after <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> came the Sixth Circuit opinion on transgender status in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. R.G. &#x0026; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc</span>., 884 F.3d 560 (6th Cir. 2018), where the court held that discrimination on the basis of transgender and transitioning status is necessarily discrimination on the basis of sex. Aimee Stephens, born male, began working for Harris Funeral Homes while living and presenting as a man. The Funeral Home terminated Stephens shortly after she informed management that she was transitioning from a male to a female and that she would be begin presenting as a woman at work. The circuit court affirmed the district court's finding that Stephens was fired because of her failure to conform to sex stereotypes, in violation of Title VII, but also explained that "it is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee's status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee's sex." Relying on <span class="Italic">Hively</span>, but also acknowledging that transgender status is different from sexual orientation, the court explained the proper analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Seventh Circuit's method of "isolat[ing] the significance of the plaintiff's sex to the employer's decision" to determine whether Title VII has been triggered illustrates this point. <span class="Italic">See Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. Coll. of Ind</span>., 853 F.3d 339, 345 (7th Cir. 2017). In <span class="Italic">Hively</span>, the Seventh Circuit determined that Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation--a different question than the issue before this court--by asking whether the plaintiff, a self-described lesbian, would have been fired "if she had been a man married to a woman (or living with a woman, or dating a woman) and everything else had stayed the same." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the answer to that question is no, then the plaintiff has stated a "paradigmatic sex discrimination" claim. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Here, we ask whether Stephens would have been fired if Stephens had been a woman who sought to comply with the women's dress code. The answer quite obviously is no. This, in and of itself, confirms that Stephens's sex impermissibly affected Rost's decision to fire Stephens.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Schroer v. Billington</span>, 577 F. Supp.2d 293 (D.D.C. 2008), provides another useful way of framing the inquiry. There, the court noted that an employer who fires an employee because the employee converted from Christianity to Judaism has discriminated against the employee "because of religion," regardless of whether the employer feels any animus against either Christianity or Judaism, because "[d]iscrimination 'because of religion' easily encompasses discrimination because of a change of religion.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 306 (emphasis in oriGINAl). By the same token, discrimination "because of sex" inherently includes discrimination against employees because of a change in their sex. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 307-08.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is evidence that Rost at least partially based his employment decision on Stephens's desire to change her sex: Rost justified firing Stephens by explaining that Rost "sincerely believes that 'the Bible teaches that a person's sex (whether male or female) is an immutable God-given gift and that it is wrong for a person to deny his or her God-given sex,'" and "the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman." <span class="Italic">R.G. &#x0026; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc</span>., 201 F. Supp.3d at 848. As <span class="Italic">amici</span> point out in their briefing, such statements demonstrate that "Ms. Stephens's sex necessarily factored into the decision to fire her." <span class="Italic">Equality Ohio Br</span>. at 12; <span class="Italic">cf. Hively</span>, 853 F.3d at 359 (Flaum, J., concurring) (arguing discrimination against a female employee because she is a lesbian is necessarily "motivated, in part, by...the employee's sex" because the employer is discriminating against the employee "because she is (A) a woman who is (B) sexually attracted to women").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Funeral Home argues that <span class="Italic">Schroer's</span> analogy is "structurally flawed" because, unlike religion, a person's sex cannot be changed; it is, instead, a biologically immutable trait. We need not decide that issue; even if true, the Funeral Home's point is immaterial. As noted above, the Supreme Court made clear in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> that Title VII requires "gender [to] be irrelevant to employment decisions." 490 U.S. at 240. Gender (or sex) is not being treated as "irrelevant to employment decisions" if an employee's attempt or desire to change his or her sex leads to an adverse employment decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, discrimination against transgender persons necessarily implicates Title VII's proscriptions against sex stereotyping. As we recognized in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, a transgender person is someone who "fails to act and/or identify with his or her gender"--i.e., someone who is inherently "gender non-conforming." 378 F.3d at 575; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 568 (explaining that transgender status is characterized by the American Psychiatric Association as "a disjunction between an individual's sexual organs and sexual identity"). Thus, an employer cannot discriminate on the basis of transgender status without imposing its stereotypical notions of how sexual organs and gender identity ought to align. There is no way to disaggregate discrimination on the basis of transgender status from discrimination on the basis of gender non-conformity, and we see no reason to try.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We did not expressly hold in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> that discrimination on the basis of transgender status is unlawful, though the opinion has been read to say as much--both by this circuit and others. In <span class="Italic">G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board</span>, 654 F. App'x 606 (4th Cir. 2016), for instance, the Fourth Circuit described Smith as holding "that discrimination against a transgender individual based on that person's transgender status is discrimination because of sex under federal civil rights statutes." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 607. And in <span class="Italic">Dodds v. United States Department of Education</span>, 845 F.3d 217 (6th Cir. 2016), we refused to stay "a preliminary injunction ordering the school district to treat an eleven-year old transgender girl as a female and permit her to use the girls' restroom" because, among other things, the school district failed to show that it would likely succeed on the merits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 220-21. In so holding, we cited Smith as evidence that this circuit's "settled law" prohibits "[s]ex stereotyping based on a person's gender non-conforming behavior," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 221 (second quote quoting <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 378 F.3d at 575), and then pointed to out-of-circuit cases for the propositions that "[a] person is defined as transgender precisely because of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes," <span class="Italic">id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Brumby</span>, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2011)), and "[t]he weight of authority establishes that discrimination based on transgender status is already prohibited by the language of federal civil rights statutes," <span class="Italic">id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd</span>., 822 F.3d 709, 729 (4th Cir.) (Davis, J., concurring), <span class="Italic">cert. granted in part</span>, 137 S. Ct. 369 (2016), and <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, 137 S. Ct. 1239 (2017). Such references support what we now directly hold: Title VII protects transgender persons because of their transgender or transitioning status, because transgender or transitioning status constitutes an inherently gender non-conforming trait.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Eleventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital, et al.</span>, 2017 WL 943925 (11th Cir. 2017), sitting in a three judge panel, declined to extend Title VII sex-based protected to sexual orientation. With the change in administrations and two vacancies on the Commission, readers are advised that a change in the Commission's position regarding sexual orientation and transgender status could change.</p>
