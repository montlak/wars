<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-37"><span class="space">7.</span> Harassment Outside of the Workplace</h4>
<p class="noindent">The fact that sexual harassment physically occurs off the work premises does not deprive an agency of the jurisdiction to investigate those allegations when the effect of the off-duty contacts is to create "an intolerable influence in the employee's working conditions." <span class="Italic">Palacios v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01830134 (1983). The Commission found that the alleged perpetrator was an agency employee, that the incidents alleged occurred both in the workplace and off the agency's premises and that they constituted a series of events which, if proven true, affected the employee's work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Limpiado v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01965513 (1997), the Commission held the agency was not liable for alleged sexual harassment that occurred after duty hours and off agency premises. In <span class="Italic">Limpiado</span>, the appellant alleged that she was sexually harassed when she was followed home by a coworker. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Limpiado</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant alleged discrimination with respect to an action that transpired after duty hours and off agency premises. Since this action is beyond the authority of the agency and no remedial action could be taken, we find that with respect to the matter raised in allegation 1, appellant has failed to establish harm with respect to a term, privilege, or condition of her employment with the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Palacios</span> clearly is the correct view. The simple fact of the matter is that the conduct in <span class="Italic">Limpiado</span> was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment regardless of where it occurred. It should be noted that harassment outside of the workplace poses special problems with respect to liability since, if the harassment involves a coworker, it may be more difficult for a complainant to demonstrate the agency knew or should have known of the harassment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kokangul v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A61380 (2006), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a claim that the complainant had been sexually assaulted by a coworker in a guest house that was used for temporary lodging of agency employees. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Kokangul</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that complainant's complaint was improperly dismissed pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1) for failure to state a claim. Unwelcome sexual advances or verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(a)(3). Sexual harassment which occurs off the work premises and after duty hours does not deprive the agency of the jurisdiction to investigate those allegations when the effect of the off-duty contact is to create an "intolerable influence in the employee's working conditions." <span class="Italic">See Palacios v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 01830134 (June 6, 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all harassment involving agency employees that takes place off the worksite will be found to implicate a term or condition of employment. In <span class="Italic">Gentry v. National Security Agency</span>, 0120082076 (2008), the complainant alleged that she was sexually harassed by a coworker on a privately run "Park-N-Ride" van that was used to commute to the agency's facility. In upholding dismissal of the complaint in <span class="Italic">Gentry</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A vanpool standard operating procedures document reveals that the vanpool is privately run, that passengers are responsible for paying the vanpool, and the vanpool operator may terminate a rider's membership in the vanpool at anytime. Complainant's claim fails to state a claim because the alleged harassment occurred while she was off-duty and commuting to and from work in a privately operated vanpool. For this reason, a term, privilege, or condition of complainant's employment was not involved.</p>
<p class="noindent">As part of the determination as to whether off-duty conduct creates an "intolerable influence" on working conditions, the Commission will consider the nature of the work environment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Department of Commerce</span>, 0120131858 (2013), the Commission found that the agency erred in dismissing the complaint on the basis that the conduct alleged was in the context of a voluntary relationship because that constituted a decision on the merits prior to investigation. However, the Commission did observe that because the complainant and alleged harasser both worked and lived on ship that in "[a] work environment, like the one at issue, where employees both work and live together, make it more likely that off-site, off-duty incidents have such art effect on the work environment."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Butler v. Yselta Independent School District</span>, 161 F.3d 263 (8th Cir. 1998), the Eighth Circuit used language from <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> in finding there was no hostile environment in a case where the harassment took place outside the workplace. In <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, a school principal harassed two teachers by sending them anonymous letters at home. Some of the letters contained sexual content. The <span class="Italic">Butler</span> court, 161 F.3d 267-71 explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are witnesses to the birth of a second generation of sexual harassment law. The first generation was heralded by the D.C. Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Costle</span>, 561 F.2d 983 (D.C. Cir. 1977), and the publication by Catharine A. MacKinnon of Sexual Harassment of Working Women in 1979. It reached maturity with <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986), in which the Supreme Court held that a hostile work environment could create a valid Title VII claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the center of the second generation of sexual harassment law are four important cases the Supreme Court decided last Term. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Faragher <span id="Page_836"></span>v. City of Boca Raton</span>, __ U.S. __, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed.2d 662 (1998) (finding an employer vicariously liable for harassment where it failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent the harassment); <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, __ U.S. __, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed.2d 633 (1998) (finding an employer subject to liability for harassment by a supervisor of an employee, but allowing the employer an affirmative defense if no tangible job action resulted); <span class="Italic">Gebser v. Lago Vista Ind. Sch. Dist.</span>, __ U.S. __, 118 S. Ct. 1989, 141 L. Ed.2d 277 (1998) (finding a school not vicariously liable for sexual harassment by a teacher of a student, when the school did not have notice of the harassment); <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.</span>, 523 U.S. 75, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed.2d 201 (1998) (holding that sex discrimination consisting of same-sex sexual harassment is actionable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These rulings were preceded by substantial work in the academy, particularly scholarly commentators who reexamined the theoretical underpinnings of sexual harassment law. <span class="Italic">See</span> Kathryn Abrams, <span class="Italic">The New Jurisprudence of Sexual Harassment</span>, 83 Cornell L.Rev. 1169 (1998); Anita Bernstein, <span class="Italic">Treating Sexual Harassment with Respect</span>, 111 Harv. L.Rev. 445 (1997); Katherine M. Franke, <span class="Italic">What's Wrong with Sexual Harassment?</span>, 49 Stan. L.Rev. 691, 764 (1997); Vicki Schultz, <span class="Italic">Reconceptualizing Sexual Harassment</span>, 107 Yale L.J. 1683 (1998). While the nuances of these writers' approaches to sexual harassment differ, all emphasize that sexual harassment is discrimination based on sex, not merely workplace behavior with sexual overtones.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This clarification and refining of sexual harassment doctrine come at an important time. The volume of sexual harassment complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and state agencies has more than doubled since 1991. <span class="Italic">See</span> <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/">http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/harass.html</a> (visited Oct. 13, 1998) (reporting 6,883 complaints lodged in 1991, and 15,889 in 1997). To ensure the continued vitality of Title VII as a remedy for the sexual harassment wrong, this court must separate meritorious claims from those that identify offensive conduct but do not state a claim under Title VII. The claims here fall in this latter category. While the letters the plaintiffs received were undoubtedly immature and inappropriate, and while some of the letters had a sexual content, a consideration of all the circumstances does not permit the conclusion that the letters created a hostile or abusive environment at the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The touchstone of our inquiry, of course, must be the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court and the words of the statute itself. The <span class="Italic">Burlington</span> Court found that "the labels <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> and hostile work environment are not controlling for purposes of establishing employer liability." __ U.S. at __-__, 118 S. Ct. at 2270-71. As the Court noted, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 2264, the terms "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" and "hostile work environment" do not appear in the relevant statute, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1). This section forbids an employer "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual's...sex."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court distinguished between two classes of cases, those in which "a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate," __ U.S. at __, 118 S. Ct. at 2268, and those where "the agency relation aids in commission of supervisor harassment which does not culminate in a tangible employment action,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 2269. We will consider these in order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Tangible employment actions are the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates. A tangible employment decision requires an official act of the enterprise, a company act." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2269. When a supervisor takes such an action, the action by the supervisor becomes the action of the employer. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In such cases, the employer is necessarily liable. Although the Supreme Court did not concisely define "tangible employment action," it did note that such an action "constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2268. It also stated that such an action "in most cases inflicts direct economic harm." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2269.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiffs suffered no tangible employment action as a result of Irwin's conduct. Even assuming that Gracia withdrew from extracurricular activities as a result of the letters, as she claims, this does not constitute a "change in employment status" under the Supreme Court definition. The plaintiffs also claim that Irwin's decision to reassign them to different grade levels constituted a tangible employment action. We need not decide, however, whether teaching at one grade level entails "significantly different responsibilities" from teaching at another, for two reasons. First, the plaintiffs have offered no evidence connecting their grade level reassignments to the letters they received, and the reassignment of a number of other employees suggests no such evidence exists. Second, the plaintiffs' grade reassignments were ultimately reversed. While Gracia complains that the interim principal initially did not want to allow her to teach at her customary grade level, she admitted that she was allowed to do so after another teacher offered to trade with her. Thus, even if an employment action was contemplated, or even favored, by the school district, none occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We thus turn to the second class of sexual harassment violations identified by the Supreme Court. Even if no tangible employment action is taken against an employee, an employer may be vicariously liable "for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2270.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court clarified the definition of "hostile environment," however, by noting that the conduct must be "severe or pervasive." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2264. The Court elaborated this in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>: "[I]n order to be actionable under the statute, a sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so." __ U.S. at __, 118 S. Ct. at 2283 (citing <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 21-22, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993)). Whether an environment meets this standard depends on "'all the circumstances,' including the 'frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S. Ct. 367).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A reasonable jury could determine that Gracia and Butler were offended and even frightened by the letters that they received. A reasonable person, however, could not perceive the work environment itself to be hostile or abusive. The factors specifically enumerated by the Supreme Court all militate toward this conclusion. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DeAngelis v. El Paso Mun. Police Officers Ass'n</span>, 51 F.3d 591, 594-96 (5th Cir. 1995) (finding no liability after evaluating the factors elaborated in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> in a case involving anonymous messages in a workplace newsletter).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the allegedly discriminatory conduct--consisting of occasional letters--was infrequent. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 596 (finding that "[f]our printed derogatory references to [the plaintiff] at irregular intervals in two and a half years do not evince sufficient hostility toward her as a matter of law"). We do not place undue weight on this factor, however. Even occasional anonymous letters can be frightening, and irregular receipt of such letters may be even more disarming than letters that arrive like clockwork and become an expected nuisance for which the victim may be prepared. Perhaps it is part of a stalker's modus operandi to surprise a victim when she least expects it. Nonetheless, the frequency factor affords plaintiffs little or no support.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the conduct was less severe than, for example, public circulation or display of similar targeted messages would have been. One scholar, for example, has found the circulation of pornographic materials in the workplace problematic because it would "mark the workplace as an arena in which masculinity is appropriate or even constitutive." <span class="Italic">Abrams, supra</span>, at 1211. The individual receipt of letters apparently coming from a single individual does not mark the workplace at all, because it does not demonstrate a communal effort to define who is welcome in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the statements in the letters received by the plaintiffs were also not threatening. As with the first factor, however, we do not place much weight on this consideration, given the anonymous nature of the correspondence. The anonymity of a letter may itself make it threatening, even if the content is innocuous. A threatening statement, such as "I am watching you," is more threatening still when the author is unknown. But here, the anonymous notes had no threatening content whatsoever. At worst, a reasonable person receiving such messages could be afraid that someone dislikes her and objectifies her. We do not diminish the hurt that comes with such knowledge, but we do not find that it supports a finding that a workplace environment is hostile.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fourth, the correspondence would not interfere unreasonably with a reasonable person's work performance. It is relevant that the letters were received at home, and not at work. To be sure, any unpleasant happenings in an individual's home life may affect work performance. A teacher may become less energetic after a personal tragedy, but we know that does not make the work environment itself hostile. Here, the plaintiff specifically suspected that the writer was someone from work, and she turned out to be correct, but it was not specifically work performance that was affected. The workplace itself is central to the wrong of sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Abrams, supra</span>, at 1219 (identifying the "ultimate harm or wrong of sexual harassment" as the perpetuation of "the workplace as a site of male control, where gender hierarchy is the order of the day and masculine norms structure the working environment"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> Bernstein, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 495 (arguing that the central concern in a hostile work environment case is whether the employer has treated employees with respect).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While none of the Supreme Court's four factors thus supports plaintiffs' effort to state a claim, the Supreme Court's command that courts look to "all the circumstances" indicates that the list is not exclusive. Our jurisprudence suggests a factor related to but distinct from the second and fourth factors above, whether the complained of conduct <span id="Page_837"></span>undermined the plaintiffs' workplace competence. <span class="Italic">See DeAngelis, supra</span>, at 593 ("A claim for a sexually hostile working environment is not a trivial matter. Its purpose is to level the playing field for women who work by preventing others from impairing their ability to compete on an equal basis with men."). The letters here commented on the plaintiffs' personal lives and habits, but did not state or suggest that they or women in general were incompetent to be teachers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the children's rhyme, all insults, like sticks and stones, can hurt, but this does not mean that all insults are tortious. As Schultz has persuasively argued, the "core component of [hostile work environment] harassment is conduct designed to undermine a woman's competence." Schultz, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1769; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 1762 ("[M]uch of the behavior that creates a hostile work environment is conduct that has the purpose or effect of undermining the perceived or actual competence of women (and some men) who threaten the idealized masculinity of those who do the work."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> Franke, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 772 (arguing that for conduct to constitute sexual harassment, it must be "a practice, grounded and undertaken in the service of hetero-patriarchal norms").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That some of the letters plaintiffs received contained sexual content is irrelevant. To be sure, sexualized comments or pictures can undermine competence; for example, a cartoon suggesting that women are incapable of teaching on account of their sex might undermine the ability of women to teach. A plaintiff, however, must show that implicit or explicit in the sexual content is the message that the plaintiff is incompetent because of her sex, and the plaintiffs cannot draw such a connection here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That Irwin sent messages to male administrators further indicates that the correspondence did not undermine the plaintiffs' competence. To be sure, as the Supreme Court decided in <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, a man can be guilty of sexually harassing other men, and presumably an individual could be guilty of sexually harassing both men and women. But <span class="Italic">Oncale</span> was not a hostile environment case, and, under the circumstances of this case, Irwin's sending of offensive materials to both men and women is evidence that the workplace itself, while perhaps more sexually charged than necessary, was not sexually charged in a way that made it a hostile environment for either men or women. Indeed, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Oncale</span> explicitly recognized that sexual content is not the Title VII talisman:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We have never held that workplace harassment, even harassment between men and women, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations. "The critical issue, Title VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 998 (quoting <span class="Italic">Harris, supra</span>, at 25, 114 S. Ct. 367 (Ginsburg, J., concurring)). Butler and Gracia were not exposed "to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment," and they are thus not entitled to relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the complainant alleges that incidents of harassment took place both at the workplace and away from the workplace, the agency should evaluate all of the incidents in determining if a hostile environment existed. <span class="Italic">Goede v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996903 (2001).</p>
