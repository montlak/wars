<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-211"><span class="space">2.</span> Cooperation With Investigators</h4>
<p class="noindent">Both agencies and complainants have an obligation to cooperate with EEO investigators. Conflicts between complainants and investigators are common. There are many reasons for the conflicts, including a complainant's basic distrust of the investigator who is often an agency employee; a complainant's misunderstanding of the investigator's role; or an investigator's misunderstanding of his or her own role. Whatever the reason, these conflicts can lead to a complainant refusing to work with the investigator. In evaluating whether dismissal is proper in such circumstances, the agency must clearly focus on the reasons for the complainant's failure to cooperate. The Commission has found instances where the refusal of the complainant to cooperate was justified and obviously, dismissal in those cases is improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency was justified in dismissing a complaint on the basis of failure to prosecute where the appellant continually declined to meet with the investigator assigned to the case and subsequently failed to meet with a second investigator appointed by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of Transportation</span>, 01830353 (1983). In one case of interest, the Commission determined that the failure to prosecute must be the result of "direct and willful neglect" by the employee. <span class="Italic">Badget v. USPS</span>, 01853337 (1986). The Commission held the fact that the employee could not proceed because he was incarcerated did not equate with such neglect.</p>
<p class="noindent">A face-to-face meeting with the investigator is not required. The agency errs in dismissing a complaint on the basis of failing to attend the investigative interview where it knows the complainant is incarcerated and cannot attend. <span class="Italic">Bursey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902395 (1990). In both instances where the complainant failed to make the interview, the agency was notified. The Commission noted the interview could have taken place by telephone or written questions. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cofield v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A62087 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Maxey v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01962024 (1997), the Commission found dismissal for failure to cooperate was proper where the appellant scheduled a meeting with an EEO investigator in December, and later asserted that she could not meet him during the month of December for religious reasons. As the Commission in <span class="Italic">Maxey</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reference to complaint No. 95-2306, the Commission also finds that the agency was justified in dismissing this complaint for appellant's failure to cooperate with the EEO investigator. In this regard, we note that appellant had cancelled three pre-scheduled appointments with the investigator and provided an inadequate explanation as to why she cancelled the third appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning this last point, we note that appellant had oriGINAlly agreed to meet with the investigator on Monday, December 4, 1995, at 9:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, then changed the time to 10.00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> at another location, and finally cancelled the December 4, 1995 meeting altogether because it conflicted with her religious beliefs that December was a "sacred" month. The Commission questions appellant's motive for doing so, however, since she had oriGINAlly agreed to meet with the investigator on December 4, 1995, then confirmed the appointment on November 30, 1995, only to state on December 2, 1995, that she regarded the whole month of December 1995 as a "sacred" month and therefore could not meet with the investigator until sometime in January 1996.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is only in cases, as here, where the complainant has engaged in delay or contumacious conduct and the record is insufficient to permit adjudication, that the Commission has allowed a complaint to be cancelled for failure to prosecute (cooperate). <span class="Italic">See Arturoc Raz v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05890177 (June 14, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">But where the complainant takes actions that indicate a continued interest in pursuing a complaint, it is error for the agency to dismiss the complaint for failure to respond to a request to confirm participation in the factfinding conference. <span class="Italic">See Weiss v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05960441 (1998). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Bowie v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05816 (2002), the Commission reversed dismissal of a complaint where the complainant responded, albeit several days late, to the agency's second request for an affidavit and answered most of the questions posed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the Commission's regulation giving agencies 180 days to investigate complaints, it is error for the agency to dismiss a complaint for failure to cooperate where the complainant refuses to participate in an investigation after the expiration of 180 days. <span class="Italic">Koch v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 01965642 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Koch</span>, the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the complaint after the employee failed to appear for an investigative interview. The Commission found that in the absence of an agreement by the complainant to extend the time period for conducting the investigation, the agency had no right to demand the complainant's continued participation in the investigation after 180 days.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not unreasonable for a complainant to insist on corrections to the investigatory affidavit. <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921016 (1992). The agency is not justified in dismissing a complaint for failure to prosecute where the complainant indicates she will sign the affidavit after those corrections are made.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has dismissed cases for failure to give an investigative affidavit, but "[t]he Commission has determined that the failure of a complainant to respond to an investigative affidavit does not, without more, constitute failure to cooperate." <span class="Italic">Mann v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954471 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, the complainant disputed the agency's allegation that he failed to submit an affidavit. But of more importance to the Commission was the fact that the allegation of discrimination clearly framed the issue for investigation. The complainant identified the assignment he was denied and the officials he believed had engaged in discrimination. As a result, the allegation of discrimination could be investigated by the agency without regard to the complainant's cooperation or failure to cooperate. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Scarborough v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971014 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sparks v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955753 (1996), the refusal to cooperate with the investigator and give an affidavit led to dismissal where the underlying complaints involved incidents of reprisal and a hostile environment. Unlike cases involving a nonselection, where the complainant usually has very little information on the agency's reasons, in <span class="Italic">Sparks</span> the agency did not have sufficient information to investigate without the complainant's cooperation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kohan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01983621 (1999), the complainant's failure to respond to 10 different requests for information in five separate complaints <span id="Page_267"></span>led the Commission to uphold the agency's dismissal of the latest complaint for failure to cooperate. Of interest in the <span class="Italic">Kohan</span> case was the Commission's acknowledgment that the information requested in the affidavit was already provided in precomplaint counseling and the formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Terry v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120092613 (2011), the Commission reversed an agency decision dismissing the complaint for failure to cooperate where the complainant, without explanation, did not respond to the investigator's interrogatories but the Commission found there was otherwise enough evidence in the record to investigate the complainant's claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that, although Complainant has not explained why she did not respond to the request for an affidavit, there is insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that she purposely engaged in delay or contumacious conduct. Instead, we find that there was sufficient information in the record to have permitted the Agency to have continued the investigation (by collecting evidence from management witnesses) without Complainant's affidavit to permit an adjudication on the merits. A review of the record indicates that Complainant spoke with the Agency's Dispute Resolution Specialist assigned to her case and provided extensive information as detailed in the Dispute Resolution Specialist's Report and the EEO Investigative report. The information provided on Complainant's claims was sufficient to identify the specific management actions she is concerned with, the relevant timeframes and the responsible management officials. This is sufficient information to permit management witnesses to respond to complainant's allegations.<span class="Italic"> See Hearl v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120082505 (July 28, 2008). Whether or not these statements by Complainant provide sufficient evidence to support her claim of discrimination can be addressed in an adjudication of the merits of her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency should have completed its investigation of the complaint without Complainant's affidavit and allowed for an adjudication on the merits rather than dismissing the complaint. The complaint is hereby remanded to the Agency for further processing in accordance with this decision and the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">An appellant's objections to the assignment of a particular investigator do not give him the right to refuse to cooperate with the EEO process. In <span class="Italic">Delgado v. Resolution Trust Corporation</span>, 01960212 (1997), the Commission explained that such an appellant must wait for the result of the investigation, and then request a hearing if he is dissatisfied with the results:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of this refusal to cooperate with either the agency or the Investigator, appellant cites to Chapter 5 of EEOC Management Directive (MD) 110 (October 22, 1992). He contends that the assignment of the investigation was in direct violation of Section V(c)(2), which provides in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The investigator, if a contract investigator, shall not have been hired by or be obligated to the person(s) involved in the matter(s) giving rise to the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that a conflict of interest exists because the Investigator is one of the usual EEO investigating firms for the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency's contention, however, that appellant's appropriate recourse was to cooperate with the Investigator and then seek a formal hearing if he was dissatisfied with the results of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld the agency's dismissal of the complaint in <span class="Italic">Delgado</span> on the basis of failure to cooperate because the record was insufficient for purposes of adjudication. Given that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Delgado</span> at least had good reason to question the legitimacy of the investigation--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a potential conflict of interest--the resulting dismissal of the complaint seems harsh. Under the circumstances and given the Commission's reluctance in past cases to dismiss complaints for failure to cooperate, a remand with instructions to the complainant to cooperate or risk dismissal would seem more appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Hobbs v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01981943 (1999), the Commission had little trouble finding that the complainant failed to cooperate where he insisted on a white, non-Hispanic, male investigator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record herein, we find that the agency properly dismissed appellant's complaint for failure to cooperate. The record is replete with examples of how appellant has not cooperated in the investigation of his complaint. Appellant's failure to complete the interrogatories demonstrates contumacious conduct. His requirement that the EEO Investigator meet a certain profile is unreasonable. Appellant's demand that the EEO Counselor contact him to initiate the counseling process with regard to allegations 4-5 demonstrates a lack of due diligence in pursuit of the complaint. Appellant's actions have clearly impeded the processing and investigation of his complaint. Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint on the grounds of failure to cooperate was proper and it is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not dismiss a complaint for failure to cooperate, however, when the allegations in the complaint are otherwise sufficiently clear for the agency to conduct an investigation and issue a decision on the merits even without the complainant's participation in the investigation. In <span class="Italic">Hearl v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120082505 (2008), the agency dismissed the complaint for failure to cooperate where the complainant failed to respond to the 55 interrogatories submitted by the investigator. The complainant alleged that he had been denied reasonable accommodation by not being provided with the services of an interpreter, not provided with close captioning on training videos, and not provided with stobe light fire alarms. He also alleged that management did not follow seniority lists in making work assignments and that he was not provided with similar awards to comparably situated employees. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Hearl</span>, simply found that conduct did not rise to the level of being contumacious:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that, although complainant has not explained why he did not respond to the request for an affidavit, there is insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that he purposely engaged in delay or contumacious conduct. The agency only made one written request for the information and, in his appeal, complainant indicates he does not always understand all the forms he has to fill out for his complaint. Instead, we find that there was sufficient information in the record to have permitted the agency to have continued the investigation (by collecting evidence from management witnesses) without complainant's affidavit to permit an adjudication on the merits. A review of the pre-complaint and formal complaint forms submitted by complainant, as well as the EEO counselor's report, provide sufficient information on complainant's claims to identify the specific management actions he is concerned with, the relevant timeframes and the responsible management officials. This is sufficient information to permit management witnesses to respond to complainant's allegations. Whether or not these brief statements by complainant provide sufficient evidence to support his claim of discrimination can be addressed in an adjudication of the merits of his complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Those who venture into U.S. district court, however, should be somewhat circumspect of any failure to cooperate with the agency's investigation. In <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, 118 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 1997), the court upheld the dismissal of a complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies based on the failure of the plaintiff to cooperate with the agency investigation. The court in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, 118 F.3d at 409-10, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The 180-day provision essentially allows the claimant to appeal to the district court if there has not been final agency action on her claim after six months from filing the claim with the agency<span class="Italic">. Munoz v. Aldridge</span>, 894 F.2d 1489, 1492 (5th Cir. 1990). There is no dispute that more than 180 days passed between the time Barnes filed her formal complaint and the time she filed her Title VII action in district court. However, it is well established that, notwithstanding the passage of 180 days, plaintiffs who resort to the administrative process but do not cooperate in the proceedings can thereby fail to exhaust their administrative remedies. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Bergland</span>, 614 F.2d 415, 418 (5th Cir. 1980) (finding no federal court jurisdiction where plaintiff's administrative complaint "described general situations that could have occurred at any time;...[and] did not set out any specific incidents or dates of discrimination"). The purpose of exhaustion is to give the agency the information it needs to investigate and resolve the dispute between the employee and the employer. "The test for cooperation in the administrative process is a common sense one, geared to the functional demands of dispute resolution." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1493. Good faith effort by the employee to cooperate with the agency and the EEOC and to provide all relevant, available information is all that is required to demonstrate an exhaustion of administrative remedies. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> After reviewing the record, we conclude that Barnes did not act in good faith or make reasonable efforts to provide the necessary relevant information to the SEC after filing her formal complaint. She repeatedly refused to answer questions, provide details, make a statement, give a deposition or even sign her complaint. Even after extensive investigation, the EEOC did not have the information it needed to pursue and resolve Barnes's dispute with the SEC. It is clear that as to her gender and sexual harassment claims, which were only marGINAlly referenced in the informal process, she wholly failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The factual bases of Barnes's claims of racial discrimination were better developed during the informal phase of the administrative process than were her sexual harassment and gender discrimination claims. This case presents the question whether a plaintiff who cooperates during the investigation of her informal complaint but refuses to cooperate after filing a formal complaint may rely on her earlier cooperation as the basis of exhaustion. The answer in this case is that she may not. While we recognize that a plaintiff need not participate in a futile exercise, <span class="Italic">see Jordan v. United States</span>, 522 F.2d 1128 (8th Cir. 1975), the record does not support the conclusion that the EEOC's formal complaint process would have proven futile if Barnes had participated in good faith. During the informal complaint stage, Barnes took the position that Matta did not treat her fairly because of her race. Even after the EEO investigator raised questions about the possibility of gender discrimination and sexual harassment, Barnes failed to attribute her problems with Matta to such discrimination during the informal process. However, in the formal complaint, sexual harassment and gender discrimination figured prominently in Barnes's explanation for her alleged suffering of disparate <span id="Page_268"></span>treatment illustrating the inconsistencies between her formal and informal complaints. Cooperation in an earlier informal process is not sufficient to satisfy the obligation to exhaust administrative remedies by cooperating in a subsequent formal investigation. Further, the record indicates that the EEOC took both Barnes's formal and informal complaint seriously, devoting extensive time and resources to investigating the claims, as well as suspending Matta until the allegations could be resolved. Had Barnes complied with the SEC's requests for cooperation, the agency could have ruled on the merits of her complaint. Due to Barnes's refusal, it was unable to do so and canceled the complaint. The law affords the agency discretion to cancel a formal complaint on the ground that the complainant has failed, after due opportunity, to supply the agency with the information sufficiently specific to enable it to conduct a meaningful investigation. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Bergland</span>, 614 F.2d 415, 418 (5th Cir. 1980). We find that the agency did not abuse its discretion in canceling the complaint in this case. Further, a complainant may not be dilatory at the administrative level, wait for the 180 days to pass, and then invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Because Barnes refused to cooperate, thereby failing to exhaust her administrative remedies, the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate her Title VII claims. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are indications that the courts are less lenient than the Commission in their determinations as to whether a complainant failed to cooperate. However, in fairness, given the facts in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, there is a good chance the Commission, if given the opportunity, would have concluded the complainant failed to cooperate.</p>
