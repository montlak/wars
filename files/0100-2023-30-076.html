<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-74"><span class="space">7.</span> Leave and Benefits Restoration</h4>
<p class="noindent">Because a victim of discrimination is entitled to be made whole, this extends to the restoration of benefits, such as sick and annual leave. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ferrall v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A30054 (2003); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120053035 (2006). And, restoration of such benefits is not limited to the time period when the discriminatory acts occurred. <span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Dominica H. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020005336 (2022) (finding the agency improperly limited the complainant's leave restoration to the period of time that the discrimination occurred; "Because Complainant's physical and emotional symptoms were not confined to a given year, but rather persisted during the entire period from April 2012 until early 2019, she used sick and annual leave consistently during this same period as a result of the Agency's discriminatory and retaliatory actions."). In order to be entitled to leave restoration, the employee must demonstrate a causal nexus between the discrimination and need to take leave. <span class="Italic">Evans v. Attorney General</span>, 0120080335 (2012), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Velez v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902746 (Nov. 16, 1990). In the <span class="Italic">Evans</span> case, the Commission found that the complainant was entitled to restoration of sick leave where she took extended sick leave immediately after reporting her sexual harassment by a supervisor, began seeing a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a distinction must be made between restoration of sick leave and a claim for monetary reimbursement for sick leave used. The distinction was explained in <span class="Italic">Merriell v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05890596 (1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission has previously determined that a claim for monetary reimbursement with respect to the use of sick leave is essentially a claim for compensatory damages arising from medical illnesses, which thus cannot be recovered in a Title VII action. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO Request No. 05880821 (January 6, 1989). However, a claim for restoration of sick leave hours which were allegedly taken because of, or as a result of, discriminatory actions has been determined to be a request for equitable damages which are awardable under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01872448 (September 30, 1987). The restoration of leave is equivalent to an award of lost benefits or other concomitant of employment which would have been earned, retained or accrued absent the alleged discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co.</span>, 29 F.E.P. Cases 1259, at 1266 (11th Cir. 1982) Accordingly, if leave was taken in order to avoid or recover from discriminatory harassment, such leave must be treated as excused administrative leave in order to make the appellant whole and place her in the position she would have been in absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01841151 (March 6, 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, the proper remedy is restoration of used sick leave and not monetary reimbursement for the sick leave used. The rationale is that the employee, in using sick leave, has not lost any pay. There is an exception, however, as the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720140011 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has argued that Complainant is only entitled to restoration of her sick leave, but not its cash value as required by the AJ in his modified order. We agree. First, it is clear that Complainant did not lose any pay as a result of her use of sick leave resulting from the discrimination as it is undisputed that she had adequate paid sick leave to cover her absences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant retired from the Agency in September 2013, so there is a question as to whether restoration of sick leave would provide her with a meaningful remedy. However, unlike annual leave, a federal employee is not entitled to a cash payment for unused sick leave at the time of retirement. Complainant may, however, be entitled to a recalculation of her annuity based upon additional service credit for any unused sick leave. Therefore, we will modify the AJ's order to require it to restore Complainant's sick leave and file a request on her behalf with the Office of Personnel Management to recalculate her annuity based on any additional service credit she may be entitled to as a result of the additional unused sick leave balance at the time of her retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant has not worked because he was not hired by the agency does not preclude him from obtaining accrued sick and annual leave as part of a make-whole remedy. In <span class="Italic">McClendon v. Postmaster General</span>, 04960013 (1997), the agency argued that it would violate its regulations to grant an employee accrued leave for periods he did not work. The Commission rejected the argument, noting it was the make-whole standard of relief under Title VII that determined the extent of relief and not the agency's regulations. An employee is entitled to restoration of sick leave even if it extends beyond the period of harassment. In <span class="Italic">Leona L. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019004396 (2020), for instance, the Commission found the agency failed to grant the complainant the sick leave to which she was entitled when it restored only the complainant's sick leave through the date of the harasser's retirement. Remanding the case for full compliance, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Leona L</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the sick leave restoration ordered by the AJ, we find that the Agency has failed to comply with this aspect of the AJ's Order. The AJ specified that the Agency was to restore to Complainant's sick leave balance all sick leave expended due to the discrimination from December 20, 2015 through the date the AJ's decision became final, December 20, 2018.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency states that it restored sick leave through the date of the Manager's retirement, July 31, 2016. However, Complainant maintains that she utilized sick leave attributable to the harassment beyond that date. Altogether, Complainant states that she used sick leave due to the harassment for the following dates: December 28-29, 2015 (16 hours), February 23-25, 2016 (24 hours), February 28-March 1, 2017 (16 hours), and March 14-16, 2018 (24 hours). Thus, Complainant seeks restoration of 80 hours of sick leave, including 40 hours after July 31, 2016. With respect to the 40 hours at issue after July 31, 2016, Complainant indicated that her symptoms and medical treatment were directly related to the harassment that she experienced. According to Complainant, she suffered from anxiety, stress, panic attacks, nausea, vomiting, a migraine and insomnia during the relevant periods after July 31, 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in February 2016, a clinician diagnosed Complainant as suffering from adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. According to the clinician, Complainant reported that her Supervisor was harassing her at work and that she feels embarrassed, humiliated and very afraid. The clinician noted that the resulting symptoms include intense anxiety at work, shaking/trembling, nausea and crying. The clinician further noted that these symptoms are also reported to carry over at home. In a letter dated September 5, 2018, from Complainant's physician, the physician stated that Complainant is currently under her care and has been seen at her Clinic since September 2015 for anxiety. The physician explained that Complainant is followed routinely for prescription monitoring and refills. According to the physician, Complainant continues to exhibit symptoms of panic attacks and anxiety. The physician noted that Complainant also continues to see a counselor for this. We find based on the submissions from Complainant's medical providers and Complainant, that the AJ's Order entitled Complainant to a restoration of 80 hours of sick leave. We find that to the extent the Agency has failed to restore that amount of sick leave, the Agency has improperly failed to comply with the AJ's Order.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, an employee is entitled to restoration of sick leave for the total time period involved in the discrimination even if such restoration puts the employee over the "use or lose" provisions that apply to accumulation of leave. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Postmaster General</span>, 04990018 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Janet B. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120132683 (2015), the Commission noted that annual leave is different than sick leave because of the cap on accrual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Annual leave is different in nature than sick leave. Complainant earned 208 hours of annual leave yearly, and we take administrative notice that unlike sick leave, the typical maximum carry over from year to year of annual leave is 240 hours. As Complainant had such a high annual leave balance in April 2011, we presume that she tended to carry over the maximum amount of annual leave from year to year. Given that, she would need, in any event, to use all the annual leave she earned to prevent a loss thereof from year to year. Over relevant period of April 21, 2009 to February 1, 2011, Complainant earned approximately 366 hours of annual leave, and used 340 hours. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Agency's decision to restore 33 hours of annual leave. On appeal, Complainant expresses concern that that reinstating annual leave could result in forfeiture thereof due to policies capping the amount annual leave that can be carried over to the next calendar year, and asks that our order protect restored leave from forfeiture due to such a cap. We will address this in our order.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its order, the Commission gave the complainant three years to use the excess annual leave.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Reed v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0210080520 (2011), a case that had already been before the Commission on two previous appeals, the EEOC explained the standards for restoring leave as relief:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant is entitled to restoration of leave which was taken for purposes of avoiding or recovering from discriminatory conduct. In order <span id="Page_1772"></span>to be entitled to leave restoration, the employee must demonstrate a causal nexus between the discrimination and need to take leave. <span class="Italic">Velez v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01902746 (Nov. 16, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several of Complainant's co-workers presented testimony indicating that Complainant took an unusual amount of leave following the Agency's actions. One co-worker stated, "It appeared [Complainant] took a lot of leave and began volunteering to work mid-shifts to avoid being at the facility when management was there." Another stated, "He has taken quite a bit of leave and having known how conscientious he was prior to these threats from management, it is obvious that [Complainant] is avoiding coming to work due to the environment." Another one stated, "[Complainant] has used a large amount of leave, both sick and annual. I know [Complainant] well enough to say that his use of leave is directly related to how he is treated at work." And another co-worker stated, "[Complainant] has taken a lot of leave since these events." One of his daughters stated that in the time after January 1998, she noticed that her father's absences from work became "more often and more excessive." Based on this evidence, we find that Complainant has shown a causal nexus between the discriminatory act and the need to take leave after November 1, 1997.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also noted in <span class="Italic">Reed</span> that the agency had failed to honor the complainant's request for his leave record for the relevant period of time, that it was more likely than not the agency had those records and chose not to supplement the record with them and, as a result, the Commission ordered the agency to restore to the complainant all sick and annual leave taken during the relevant time period.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where an employee has been required to take sick leave as a result of discriminatory harassment, it is appropriate for the employee to seek restoration of that leave as a remedy. In such cases, the absence can be excused as administrative leave in order to make the employee whole. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01912382 (1991). However, in order to be entitled to restoration of the leave, the employee must demonstrate a causal connection between the harassment and the need to take leave. <span class="Italic">See George v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A04425 (2002); <span class="Italic">Velez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902746 (1990); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Pruette v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951567 (1998) (restoration of leave was denied where a medical report credited the absence to treatment by coworkers that was found to be nondiscriminatory, and not to the actions of the agency found to be retaliation); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952347 (1997) (a case remanded for a supplemental investigation of whether the failure to promote the complainant to another position caused her six week absence due to carpal tunnel syndrome).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant is required to take leave without pay as a result of discrimination because she no longer has sick or annual leave available, the agency must reimburse her for use of that leave. <span class="Italic">Porter v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 04930002 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">"[A] successful Title VII harassment complainant is entitled to reimbursement of sick leave taken as a direct result of unlawful discrimination." <span class="Italic">Meagher v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01923706 (1993). The restoration of sick leave taken "for the purpose of avoiding or recovering from discriminatory harassment was a valid component of equitable relief under Title VII." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As such, it is not part of compensatory damages under the 1991 Civil Rights Act, but part of the "make whole" remedy. In <span class="Italic">Meagher</span>, the case was remanded to give the complainant an opportunity to submit specific medical documentation for each absence she alleged was the result of sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Yeh v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01973721 (2000) (a complainant is entitled to the restoration of leave taken as a result of discrimination, but not monetary reimbursement); <span class="Italic">Marr v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 04990013 (2000) (restoration of leave is part of "make whole" relief and not compensatory damages).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the employee is receiving OWCP benefits does not absolve an agency from all liability. When an employee is forced to take leave as the result of an agency's failure to make reasonable accommodation to a disability, the employee is entitled to restoration of that leave, and the agency is required to reimburse the complainant for any difference between what she would have earned and the amount she collected in OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922440 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant can be entitled to restoration of sick leave used as a direct result of the discriminatory treatment, even where the complainant is no longer employed by the agency, when the restoration of sick leave can have an impact on the complainant's retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">D'Andrea v. Postmaster General</span>, 04930004 (1994). However, the complainant must present evidence that there is a nexus between the discrimination and his use of sick leave.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a complainant is not entitled to expungement of the records indicating she took sick leave. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Postmaster General</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. "Because expungement of sick leave from appellant's attendance record cannot be viewed as a benefit that she would have received absent the discrimination, it is not available as part of equitable relief." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When a complaint receives a retroactive promotion, he is entitled to payment for leave at the higher grade. In <span class="Italic">Burton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 0420050029 (2007), the Commission found that the agency erred in failing to pay the complainant for leave at the GS-11 level even though he was a GS-9 when he took the leave. The Commission ordered a retroactive promotion as part of the remedy in the case. The Commission found no significance to the fact that the leave had been provided through the agency's shared leave program.</p>
<p class="noindent">Restoration of leave is an element of equitable relief and not an element of compensatory damages. In <span class="Italic">Burton v. Attorney General</span>, 0720090046 (2011), the Commission found its administrative judge erred in order the agency to pay the complaint $1,633.00 as reimbursement for sick leave taken as a result of discrimination. The proper remedy, the Commission, held was the restoration of the 30.5 hours of leave involved.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Commission orders leave restoration, the agency must also provide documentation that clearly explains the agency's calculations. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Juli Z. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120102789 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has not explained the specific amount of sick leave, annual leave, and LWOP taken by Petitioner because of the harassment; how it determined how much leave was attributed to discrimination; or the manner by which it restored the leave and compensated Petitioner for it. Additionally, it is unclear whether the Agency increased Petitioner's leave balances, or if its payment of $20,203.74 entirely represents the monetary value of all leave owed to Petitioner. Therefore, we cannot find that the Agency's payment of $20,203.74 for leave restoration demonstrates full compliance with our order. The Agency must now provide a plain language, step-by-step narrative that clearly sets forth such an explanation for its calculations and payments.</p>
