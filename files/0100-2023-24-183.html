<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-157"><span class="space">3.</span> Telework Policies</h4>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency has established telework policies regarding eligibility for telework, it is possible that an accommodation could include altering those eligibility requirements for a qualified individual. However, the agency is not required to waive all eligibility requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Dahlman v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 0120073190 (2010), the complainant was reassigned to a compliance officer position after her major depressive disorder and PTSD made it impossible for her to perform the essential functions of a product safety investigator. The complainant then sought an additional accommodation telework three days a week for a <span id="Page_1423"></span>period of 8-10 months. The Commission found that an alternative proposal by the agency to give the complainant more complex work for a 30-day period to evaluate if she could work independently, along with rest breaks and adjustments to work hours as necessary, was a reasonable accommodation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dahlman</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for her June 2006 reasonable accommodation request, the record reveals complainant requested that she be permitted to work at home three days per week for the next eight to ten months. As support, she claimed that her depression and PTSD caused her to experience problems with her memory, concentration and produced severe exhaustion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, complainant's supervisor informed her that the office's policy was to postpone telework for new Compliance Officers for the first six months-one year, so that she could acclimate to the new position. Furthermore, he informed complainant that almost half of her work involved working with samples, which could not be removed from the office. Moreover, complainant's supervisor informed her that he had not yet had the opportunity to assess whether complainant could work independently. Accordingly, complainant's supervisor agreed to assign complainant more complex work, and if (after 30 days) she was working at a desirable level, he would permit complainant to work at home one day per week. Moreover, the supervisor agreed to allow complainant to take rest breaks as needed, and would adjust her work hours as needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although complainant asserts that this arrangement amounts to a denial of accommodation, we disagree. Complainant's psychiatrist testified in a deposition that complainant's symptoms would be alleviated if she moved to another job, and was permitted a meaningful rest period. Indeed, complainant has been provided a place to rest with a bed, as needed. He also indicated that her functioning would be impaired if she were not able to telecommute three days per week, but stated that alternative work hours would possibly also help. (Wilson Deposition at p. 52-60). Complainant's supervisor agreed to an alternative work schedule and one day of telework. Complainant is entitled to an "effective" accommodation, but not necessarily the accommodation of her choice. In the context of job performance, an "effective" accommodation means that the reasonable accommodation enables the individual to perform the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Notice No. 915.002 (October 17, 2002). Complainant has not offered persuasive evidence that the various accommodations offered to her were ineffective.</p>
<p class="noindent">Merely allowing an employee to telework under the agency's existing telework policy is not a reasonable accommodation when the employee requires more telework than is allowed under the policy. For example, in <span class="Italic">Clayton C. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120120350 (2015), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we cannot agree with the Agency's finding that Complainant's reasonable accommodation "expired." We find no evidence that Complainant's need for an accommodation, which was obvious, was eliminated. Furthermore, S3 and the Agency assert that Complainant did not request an accommodation once the accommodation "expired" so it considered his tele-work request in light of the agency's tele-work policy. We find persuasive evidence that Complainant repeatedly explained that his request was made as a request for reasonable accommodation. When an individual decides to request accommodation, the individual or his/her representative must let the employer know that s/he needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. To request accommodation, an individual may use 'plain English' and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase 'reasonable accommodation.'" <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002, Question 1 (rev. October 17, 2002). In response, S3 simply ignored Complainant's subsequent requests while applying Agency tele-work principles as he would from any other employee. To the extent that S3 did not understand why Complainant required tele-work as an accommodation, we find the proper course of action would have been to request medical documentation from Complainant. However, S3 failed to do so. In this case, because Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability, the Agency had a duty to engage in the interactive process to determine if there was an effective reasonable accommodation for his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kenneth W. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120140286 (2016), the Commission refused to second guess an agency policy disallowing telework to probationers and employees with performance issues where the complainant was terminated prior to receiving an answer to his request for an exception. The complainant, a probationary attorney-advisor, suffered from irritable bowel syndrome. As a reasonable accommodation, he requested telework. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Kenneth W</span>., credited the agency's denial of the complainant's request due to his probationary status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence in the record to support the contention that the Agency failed to engage Complainant in an interactive process regarding his request to telework. The record reflects that Complainant was a probationary employee that had yet to achieve production requirements, and was therefore ineligible for telework. Complainant began the process of applying for an exception to the telework guidelines, but had not completed the necessary paperwork, or supplied the necessary documentation, before he was terminated as a result of poor performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because he did not establish that he was a qualified individual with a disability, Complainant was not entitled to an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on disability, we concur with the AJ's finding that the Agency articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying Complainant's request to telework, and for terminating his employment. Complainant did not complete the process of applying for an exception to the telework guidelines, which he was required to do before being allowed to telework based on his status as a probationary employee that had not met production guidelines. Complainant was ultimately terminated for failing to meet production standards. Complainant has not shown that the Agency's reasons for prohibiting him from teleworking, and ultimately terminating his employment were pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory business reasons for each of the actions it took. The Commission has long held that an Agency has broad discretion to set policies and carry out personnel decisions, and should not be second-guessed by the reviewing authority absent evidence of unlawful motivation. <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 259; <span class="Italic">Vanek v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940906 (January 16, 1997). We find that none exist in the instant matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies routinely adopt policies disallowing telework to employees with performance deficiencies. Sometimes, however, those policies conflict with the reasonable accommodation requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. In that case, agency policies must give way to the agency's obligations to qualified individuals with disabilities. Agencies must modify their policies regarding where work is performed if needed as a reasonable accommodation as long as the accommodation would be effective and would not cause an undue hardship. That is what the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Natalie S. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120140815 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to Complainant, on May 19, 2011, she requested to work from home 40 hours per week as a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Complainant stated that she worked in an open area with approximately 200 employees, which exacerbated her PTSD symptoms. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. According to Complainant's May 19, 2011, request, she requested "a segregated work environment" and asked that she not be assigned any PTSD or trauma claims. On June 6, 2016, Complainant submitted a request to work from home 40 hours per week because CI "is a threat to me. ...I do not feel safe and I do not feel that my fears are being taken seriously within the agency." On August 17, 2011, Complainant submitted additional medical documentation and Complainant's union representative (UR1) requested that Complainant "be assigned to a Work-At-Home status until such time that her Medical Retirement paperwork is complete." According to the record, Complainant was moved to a secluded work area the first week of June 2011, and the Agency stopped assigning Complainant cases involving PTSD or trauma.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that on October 10, 2011, S3 told her that her accommodation request to work from home was denied because her conduct and performance were not consistent with the guidelines for working from home. According to the October 6, 2011, Denial of Accommodation form signed by S3, 53 was not approving the requested accommodation because "[Complainant's] conduct and performance are not consistent with Work at Home guidelines." According to the Agency's telework program guidelines, to be eligible for the program, employees "must be at journeyman status, have overall performance evaluations equivalent to fully successful or higher, not be on a performance improvement plan, and not have disciplinary actions taken against him/her within the last 12 months and/or adverse actions taken against him/her within the last 18 months." S3 stated that an RSVR of Complainant's tenure was required to produce three and one-half rated actions per day, but Complainant was averaging less than one action per day. According to S3, on September 14, 2011, Complainant was offered a workspace in a lower traffic area than the workspace to which she was moved in June 2011, but Complainant declined the offer. Complainant resubmitted her request to work from home on December 16, 2011, reportedly because coworkers frightened her when they approached her and because she did not trust management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the FAD, the Agency determined that it satisfied its obligation to provide Complainant with an effective reasonable accommodation when it stopped assigning her cases involving PTSD and trauma and changed the location of her cubicle in June 2011. However, in October 2011, 53 stated that she was denying Complainant's request for full-<span id="Page_1424"></span>time telework because of her performance and conduct issues, not because Complainant had already been provided with an effective accommodation. The fact that Complainant's performance issues continued between June 2011 and October 2011 suggests that the provided accommodations were not effective. Moreover, the Agency's explanations for denying Complainant's requested accommodation are somewhat inconsistent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal employers must modify their policies regarding where work is performed if needed as a reasonable accommodation if the accommodation would be effective and would not cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> Enforcement Guidance, Question 34. The Enforcement Guidance notes, "An employer does not have to eliminate an essential function, i.e., a fundamental duty of the position. ...Nor is an employer required to lower production standards--whether qualitative or quantitative--that are applied uniformly to employees with and without disabilities. However, an employer may have to provide reasonable accommodation to enable an employee with a disability to meet the production standard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In The Americans With Disabilities Act: Applying Performance and Conduct Standards to Employees with Disabilities, Question 7 (Jan. 20, 2011) (available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/perfomiance-conduct.html">https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/perfomiance-conduct.html</a>), the Commission noted, "An employer may not withdraw a reasonable accommodation as punishment for the unsatisfactory performance rating. Simply withdrawing the telework arrangement or a modified schedule is no different than discontinuing an employee's use of a sign language interpreter or assistive technology as reasonable accommodations." Similarly, an employer may not withhold a reasonable accommodation, such as telework, from an employee with a disability as a punishment. The Commission also noted that if an accommodation is not assisting an employee in improving his performance as intended, "the employer and employee may need to explore whether any changes would make the accommodation effective, whether an additional accommodation is needed, or whether the original accommodation should be withdrawn and another should be substituted." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Where, as here, the accommodation appears ineffective, the employer and employee should reexamine the reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's request to telework was denied by S3 because Complainant's "conduct and performance [we]re not consistent with Work at Home guidelines." Specifically, Complainant recently had been suspended for sharing C1's confidential medical information, and Complainant was not meeting the productivity standards for her position. However, according to Complainant, she was not meeting productivity standards because she had not been provided with an effective accommodation. We previously have noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he ADA's reasonable accommodation obligation, which includes modifying workplace policies, might require an employer to waive certain eligibility requirements or otherwise modify its telework program for someone with a disability who needs to work at home. For example, an employer may generally require that employees work at least one year before they are eligible to participate in a telework program. If a new employee needs to work at home because of a disability, and the job can be performed at home, then an employer may have to waive its one-year rule for this individual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Work at Home/Telework as a Reasonable Accommodation, Question 1 (Oct. 27, 2005) (available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html">https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the record, the Agency failed to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation when the Agency failed to consider whether the telework guidelines could be modified as a reasonable accommodation, or whether Complainant was eligible for alternative telework arrangements as a reasonable accommodation. For example, the Agency could have afforded Complainant a trial period of no less than 30 days to determine whether full-time telework was an effective accommodation that allowed Complainant to meet her productivity standards and whether her conduct continued to be an issue. If the accommodation was ineffective after the trial period, then the Agency would not have to offer full-time telework to Complainant, as it would not have been an effective accommodation. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that the Agency undertook an individualized assessment that providing Complainant with the effective reasonable accommodation would have caused the Agency an undue hardship. Although the Agency cited Complainant's productivity and conduct as the reasons for denying the requested accommodation, the Agency has not established that providing Complainant with full-time telework would have imposed an undue hardship on its operations. We therefore find that Complainant met her burden that the Agency failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, we will reverse the Agency's final decision with respect to the denial of a reasonable accommodation, and the Agency shall comply with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;If Complainant is still employed by the Agency, the Agency shall offer Complainant full-time telework as a reasonable accommodation for a trial period of not less than 30 calendar days, within 30 calendar days of the date this decision is issued. If the Agency terminates Complainant's reasonable accommodation of full-time telework after the trial period, it shall set forth in a compliance report the reason(s).</p>
