<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-124"><span class="space">4.</span> Aviation and Transportation Security Act</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a case of first impression, the EEOC held that the Aviation and Transportation Security Act does not exempt the Transportation Security Administration from the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. However, in <span class="Italic">Getzlow v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120053286 (2007), the Commission also held that any conflicts between the ATSA and the Rehabilitation Act had to be resolved in favor of the ATSA. As discussed further below, the federal appeals courts have ruled that the ATSA supercedes the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Getzlow</span> was denied a position as a transportation security screener because her bipolar disorder prevented her from successfully completing computer-based security exercises that were part of the qualification standards for the job. The complainant contended that she was entitled to the reasonable accommodation of taking the test "under relatively quiet conditions and with help available to operate the computer."</p>
<p class="noindent">First, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Getzlow</span> addressed whether the ATSA deprived it of jurisdiction over the complainant's claim. Acknowledging the importance of national security, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Getzlow</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ATSA, enacted in the wake of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). One of the responsibilities of TSA is overseeing security screening for passengers and baggage at airports. The ATSA grants the Under Secretary of Transportation the authority to establish hiring criteria for security screening personnel and to "develop a security screening personnel examination for use in determining the qualification of individuals seeking employment as security screening personnel." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935(e)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ATSA was enacted to foster the national security and the protection of our nation's transportation systems. To further these critical purposes, the statute contains detailed provisions mandating hiring qualifications for security screeners. The ATSA provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;QUALIFICATIONS.--Within 30 days after the date of enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, the Under Secretary shall establish qualification standards for individuals to be hired by the United States as security screening personnel. <span class="Italic">Notwithstanding any provision of law,</span> those standards shall require, at a minimum, an individual--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii)&#x2003;to meet, at a minimum, the requirements set forth in subsection (f);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(f)&#x2003;EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS FOR SCREENING PERSONNEL--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;SCREENER REQUIREMENTS.--<span class="Italic">Notwithstanding any provision of law,</span> an individual may not be deployed as a security screener unless that individual meets the following requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;The individual shall possess basic aptitudes and physical abilities, including color perception, visual and aural acuity, physical coordination, and motor skills, to the following standards:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;Screeners operating screening equipment shall be able to distinguish on the screening equipment monitor the appropriate imaging standard specified by the Under Secretary.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;Screeners operating any screening equipment shall be able to distinguish each color displayed on every type of screening equipment and explain what each color signifies.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii)&#x2003;Screeners shall be able to hear and respond to the spoken voice and to audible alarms generated by screening equipment in an <span class="Italic">active</span> checkpoint environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">49 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 44935 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes, as a preliminary matter, that it has jurisdiction over the complaint at issue. The ATSA does not divest the Commission of jurisdiction over complaints brought by security screeners against TSA under the Rehabilitation Act or other statutes the Commission enforces. While Congress gave TSA broad authority to establish terms and conditions of employment for security screeners, that authority does not include complete exemption from &#x00A7; 501 of the Rehabilitation Act and the other employment discrimination laws. Accordingly, the EEOC has authority to hear complaints involving security screener positions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further held that whether a complaint by a security screener states a claim for relief would be decided on a case-by-case basis and "will depend on whether there is any conflict between the ATSA-mandated qualifications and the complainant's Rehabilitation Act claim." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission determined that section 44935 gives TSA the right to impose qualification standards that "might not otherwise pass muster under the Rehabilitation Act." As a result, the complainant could not challenge the qualification standard and TSA did not have to prove that it was job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Getzlow</span>, went on to find that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record compels a finding that complainant cannot prove that she was "otherwise qualified" for the security screener position at the time she requested the agency to reasonably accommodate her bipolar disorder. The ATSA requires that security screeners "be able to hear and respond to the spoken voice and to audible alarms generated by screening <span id="Page_1219"></span>equipment in an <span class="Italic">active</span> checkpoint environment."... Complainant's unequivocal assertion that she was unable to cope with (what she perceived as) a chaotic testing environment constituted an admission that she would not be able to function effectively in the "active" environment of a busy international airport..."</p>
<p class="noindent">Since the agency knew the complainant was not qualified at the time she requested accommodation, there was no violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Seyfang v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120054534 (2008), where the complainant was deaf in one ear. The agency made the complainant a conditional offer of employment, but later withdrew the offer based on the results of the medical examination. The complainant claimed that the agency could have accommodated her through the use of a "cross aid" that transmits sounds from the nonhearing ear to the functional ear. The Commission found that TSA has promulgated medical standards pursuant to its statutory authority and that the complainant could not meet the standards that required hearing in both ears. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Chelsie L. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120140618 (2017), further noted that being physically fit and able to perform the functions of the position is not enough where her disability fails to comport with the agency's established medical guidelines and qualification standards for a TSO position. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Chelsie L.</span> though able to perform the essential functions of the TSO position, suffered from migraine headaches and sick cell anemia, both disqualifying conditions under the agency's medical guidelines. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120121521 (2014) ("While the Rehabilitation Act traditionally requires that agencies employing qualification standards that have the effect of screening out persons with disabilities show that those standards are job-related and consistent with business necessity, our precedent dictates that qualification standards developed under the ATSA are not subject to this requirement."). The ATSA, however, does not entirely preempt the agency's responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Solomon B. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120162325 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The discussion of "qualified" does not end at Complainant's position of record. The term "qualified individual with a disability," with respect to employment, is defined as a disabled person who. with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The term "position" is not limited to the position held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held as a result of reassignment. Therefore, in determining whether an employee is "qualified," an agency must look beyond the position which the employee presently encumbers. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act</span> (Enforcement Guidance--Reasonable Accommodation), No. 915.002 (revised October 17, 2002); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix, to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630.2(o).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an employee subject to the act cannot meet a qualification standard and, therefore, is not qualified, the agency still must consider reassignment options as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Marielle L. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720140024 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined, however, that the Agency erred when its inquiry ceased at that point. The Agency was required to consider the availability of a reassignment as an accommodation. Its failure to do so was a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not dispute this finding of discrimination, nor does it challenge the AJ's order that Complainant be offered a reassignment with an award of back pay, compensatory damages, attorney's fees and costs. The Commission has discretion to review only the issues specifically raised on appeal. Since neither party raised the finding of discrimination or the damages award, we shall not review these matters on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, however, the Agency argues, that AJ exceeded her authority in requiring it to "change its national policy on TSO personnel and the applicability of the Rehabilitation Act to those employees." According to the Agency, such a change "attempts to nullify the 'notwithstanding' provision contained in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935." The Commission disagrees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that the ATSA does not divest the Commission of jurisdiction over a complaint brought by a TSO against the Agency under the Rehabilitation Act or other statutes the Commission enforces. <span class="Italic">Kimble v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120072195 (Nov. 24, 2009). While Congress gave the Agency broad authority to establish terms and conditions of employment for security screeners, that authority does not include complete exemption from &#x00A7; 501 of the Rehabilitation Act and the other employment discrimination laws. <span class="Italic">Chapman v. Dep't. of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120051049 (Aug. 6, 2008), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den'd</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080805 (Dec. 11, 2008); <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dep't. of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120054463 (Aug. 31, 2007); <span class="Italic">Getzlow v. Dep't. of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120053286 (Jun. 26, 2007), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den'd</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520070839 (Oct. 12, 2007). Accordingly, the Commission has authority to hear complaints under the Rehabilitation Act involving TSO positions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency must comply with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act where there is no conflict between the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act and the ATSA. <span class="Italic">Getzlow, id</span>. As found by the AJ, and not contested by the Agency, the determination of whether an employee is "qualified" does not end at Complainant's TSO position. The term "qualified individual with a disability," with respect to employment, is defined as a disabled person who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The term "position" is not limited to the position held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held as a result of reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Hampton v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (August 1, 2002). Therefore, in determining whether an employee is a qualified individual with a disability, an agency must look beyond the position which the employee presently encumbers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has consistently applied this reasoning to appeals concerning TSOs that were terminated when they were unable to perform the essential functions of the TSO position. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720100037 (March 26, 2014); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120440 (August 4, 2015); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120121521 (August 29, 2014). We have held that in determining whether a qualified individual with a disability can perform the essential functions of the position, "the term 'position' is not limited to the position held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held as a result of reassignment." <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120122648 (July 17, 2015) <span class="Italic">Hampton v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (July 31, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Agency's assertion that to require it to change its current policy exceeds the Commission's authority. The AJ's remedy merely requires the Agency to create a policy that reflects the obligation that it already has--to offer a reasonable accommodation in the form of a reassignment, when appropriate, to TSOs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant's attorney proffered the testimony of an Agency Reasonable Accommodation Program Manager, which supports the need for a change in policy. The Program Manager testified at the hearing that when a TSO can no longer perform the job that they were hired for, "our policy states that if you do not meet the statutory requirements of the TSO position, then you are not eligible for an accommodation under our policy which includes a reassignment (emphasis added)." However, she stated that for non-TSO employees, when a determination is made that they are no longer able to perform the duties of that position, the position search for a reassignment is 'automatically triggered." The Program Manager also testified that with respect to reasonable accommodation, "everything is done from headquarters" rather than individual airports, noting that headquarters has access to "all of the vacancies...." Consequently, we agree with the AJ in ordering an agency-wide modification in the existing policy to accurately reflect the Agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. The remedy ordered simply mirrors the law and regulations already expressed in various Commission decisions, regarding TSOs and reasonable accommodation, and the existing interplay between the Rehabilitation Act and the ATSA.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Solomon B. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120162325 (2018) (the analysis does not end with a determination that the complainant is not qualified for the position at issue; the Rehabilitation Act picks up where the ATSA ends and the agency must look to whether reassignment is a viable option as a reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the ATSA imposes qualifications for an employee that an applicant cannot meet, the agency has no obligation to accommodate that individual during the application process. In <span class="Italic">Freese v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120070755 (2009), the complainant, an applicant for a security screener position, had a severe form of dyslexia that rendered it difficult for him to read dense, single-spaced type. The ATSA specifically requires that security screeners be able to read and write English well enough to "read English language identification media, credentials, airline tickets, and labels on items normally encountered in the screening process." The complainant in <span class="Italic">Freese</span> requested accommodation in the application process in the form of an oral examination in lieu of a written application. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Freese</span>, found that the agency was not required to provide such an accommodation where the condition precluded the complainant from performing an essential function of the position of security screener:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the individual is not an employee, but an applicant for employment, the Commission's policy states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employer must provide a reasonable accommodation to a qualified applicant with a disability that will enable the individual to have an equal opportunity to participate in the application process and to be considered for a job (unless it can show undue hardship). Thus, individuals with disabilities who meet initial requirements to be considered for a job should not be excluded from the application process because the employer speculates, based on a request for a reasonable accommodation for the application process, <span id="Page_1220"></span>that it will be unable to provide the individual with reasonable accommodation to perform the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Enforcement Guidance at Q. 13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The critical point made by the Commission in the Enforcement Guidance is that an employer should assess the need for accommodation for the application process separately from any accommodation that may be needed to perform the job. Where no clear evidence exists showing that an individual is unable to perform the job, an employer must accommodate the person in the application phase. For TSA, this determination will also include an assessment of whether the individual can meet the ATSA-mandated qualification standards, with or without an accommodation. TSA must therefore provide a qualified individual with a disability with a reasonable accommodation for the application process so long as such accommodation would not negate an ATSA-mandated standard and no undue hardship exists. <span class="Italic">See Getzlow v. Department of Homeland Security</span> (TSA), EEOC Appeal No. 0120053286 (June 26, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we will assume for the sake of argument that complainant is an individual with a disability. Next, complainant must establish that he is a "qualified individual with a disability," which is defined as an individual with a disability who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that the ability to read certain documents, such as identification media, credentials, airline tickets, and labels on items normally encountered in the screening process, is a standard that is mandated by the ATSA, and as a result, is an essential function of the Security Screener position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant's medical documentation indicates that he has "severe deficits in auditory and visual processing" which negatively impacts his reading and math skills. Complainant demonstrated during the hearing that he was capable of reading a legal brief that was doublespaced in fourteen-point font. However, a legal brief is not the type of material that a Security Screener would be required to read. Had complainant demonstrated that he was able to read a boarding pass or a driver's license, where the font is much smaller than fourteen-point and not double-spaced, he may have been able to establish that he could perform the essential functions of the position. However, complainant did not offer such a demonstration during the trial. The AJ found that the travel documentation Security Screeners are required to read are not double-spaced, and have blocks of densely typed words that are juxtaposed against each other. We note that the burden remains on complainant to establish that he can perform the essential functions of the position, and not on the agency to establish that complainant cannot perform the essential functions of the position. We find that complainant failed to establish that he can perform to the ATSA-mandated standard, which is an essential function of the position. Therefore, complainant failed to establish that he is qualified for the position of Security Screener.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The analysis now turns to whether the agency is required to accommodate an individual during the application process if that individual is not qualified for the position. The Commission has issued decisions in cases very similar to this one. For example, in <span class="Italic">Getzlow</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission held that because there was clear evidence that complainant would not be able to meet one or more of the ATSA-mandated standards, complainant was not qualified for the Security Screener position and, as a result, the agency had no duty to accommodate complainant during the application process. <span class="Italic">Getzlow</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120053286. In this case, because complainant failed to establish that he was qualified for the Security Screener position, we find that the agency had no duty to accommodate complainant during the application process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further alleges that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to process complainant's numerous requests for reasonable accommodation. The Commission previously has held that an agency cannot be held liable solely for failure to engage in the interactive process, but can be found liable if the failure to engage in the interactive process resulted in the agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Broussard v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01997106 (September 13, 2002), <span class="Italic">req. to recon. den.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A30114 (January 9, 2003). The sole purpose of the interactive process is to facilitate the identification of an appropriate reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Broussard</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30114. The agency's failure to engage in this process does not give rise to a separate cause of action because the interactive process is not an end in itself. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Rather, the alleged denial of reasonable accommodation gives rise to a cause of action, and in order to prevail on such a claim, complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Bielfelt v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC No. Appeal 01A10475 (June 19, 2002). We have already established that complainant is not a qualified individual with a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act. Therefore, the agency cannot be held liable for failure to process complainant's request for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Chapman v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120051049 (2008), the Commission found that the ATSA did not preempt a Rehabilitation Act claim where the complainant alleged that the agency failed to accommodate his hearing impairment during the application process to become a security screener. The complainant alleged that because his hearing aids were being updated, he asked for an accommodation of having the test administrator speak loudly so he could hear test instructions or be provided with a personal assistant to guide him through the process. The agency refused the accommodation. In finding that the administrative judge had erred in holding the ATSA preempted the claim, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Chapman</span>, again stressed that the determination must be made on a case-by-case basis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, complainant has not challenged an ATSA-mandated standard. Rather, he has alleged that he is a qualified individual with a disability that could have participated in the application process if he had been provided a reasonable accommodation, as was requested. Further, it appears that complainant is alleging that he could have met the ATSA-mandated hearing standard and performed the screener job without an accommodation that would have negated the standard. That is adequate to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission denied reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Chapman v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520080805 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found it had jurisdiction over the claim in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120072909 (2009), where the complainant alleged that she was terminated as a security screener because of her disability. The Commission found that the agency erred in dismissing the claim because the complainant was not challenging "an ATSA-mandated qualification standard," but was alleging she was discriminatorily terminated for alleged poor work performance and misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Windy H. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120152971 (2017), the Commission reaffirmed its <span class="Italic">Getzlow</span> holding regarding jurisdiction, but affirmed the agency's finding that the complainant failed to prove disability discrimination when it terminated her. In that case, the agency argued that the complainant was not qualified for her position because she could not meet the medical requirements mandated by the position, namely that incumbents must be able to lift 70 pounds. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Windy H</span>. presented the agency with a doctor's report releasing her to full duty, but with the conflicting limitation that she could only lift 40 pounds. Having failed to establish that she was a qualified individual with a disability, the Commission affirmed the agency's finding of no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the federal appeals courts have ruled that the ATSA does preempt the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Joren v. Napolitano</span>, 633 F.3d 1144 (2011), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 181 L. Ed.2d 175 (2011); <span class="Italic">Castro v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 472 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir. 2006). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Field v. Napolitano</span>, No. 11-1139 (1st Cir. 2011).</p>
