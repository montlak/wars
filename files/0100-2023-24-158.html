<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-133"><span class="space">EE.</span> TRAINING AS AN ACCOMMODATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Training, which can also include such things as job coaches, can be a viable form of reasonable accommodation. For example, in its factsheet, <span class="Italic">The Americans with Disabilities Act: Applying Performance and Conduct Standards to Employees with Disabilities</span>, the Commission provides the following answer in response to Question 11:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Jane with Down syndrome is employed as a bagger at a grocery store. Jane is very friendly and likes to hug customers. She means well, but management finds the behavior unacceptable. Jane's manager tells her and contacts the job coach who helped Jane learn to do her job [and] has the job coach return to work with Jane for a few days until she learns that she cannot hug the customers. It is job-related and consistent with business necessity to require that Jane refrain from hugging customers. Although the grocery store does not have a rule specifically prohibiting physical contact with customers, refraining from such conduct is an inherent part of treating customers with appropriate respect and courtesy.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">King v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120100248 (2011), the complainant, a soil conservationist technician who suffered the effects of a traumatic brain injury, contended that the agency denied him reasonable accommodation when it failed to provide him with job training and also with work assignments that would assist in remembering the training he received. Although the Commission remanded the case to the agency for further investigation due to deficiencies in the complaint file, its decision is instructive on the issue of training as an accommodation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">King</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Complainant alleged that he was denied a reasonable accommodation when the Agency failed to provide him with engineering training that he required to perform the duties of his position. Further, Complainant indicated that, in addition to training, Complainant required assignment of duties following training that would allow him to learn the material. Complainant indicated that without the assignment, his disability prevented him from retaining the information received during the training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the training, Complainant averred that the engineering training he requested was related to the position Complainant encumbered and was not just for a position Complainant sought. Complainant stated in his affidavit that engineering training was needed to do inventory and evaluations, engineering designs, construction and project oversight. Complainant's position description states that his position included the following duties:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Gather and compile needed information (using a level to run profiles, cross-sections, and topographic surveys) and other field data (soil irrigations, erosion, surface drainage and sedimentation) for evaluation of feasibility design, layout and construction of conservation practices;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Assist landowners and private contractors on installing, scheduling and maintaining several conservation practices including conservation tillage, grass waterways, erosion control structures, cover crops, rotations, pasture seeding, critical area seeding and nutrient management.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Document that conservation components have been installed and notes whether they are according to the Agency's standards and specifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Record survey readings, compute soil loss, compile survey data and prepare sketches, such as basic agronomic and engineering designs, as assigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, it appears that Complainant's position did require engineering training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's supervisor (Supervisor) averred that Complainant could perform the "basic duties." However, the Supervisor was not asked by the Agency's investigator any further questions that would illicit more information on the specific duties Complainant could or could not do. Other documents and evidence could have been gathered by the Agency's investigator in order for the Commission to determine whether the training Complainant requested would have actually assisted him in performing his current position. For example, Complainant's performance appraisals from 2004 could show if there were deficiencies in Complainant's duties that could be improved by the training he requested. In addition, the Supervisor, Complainant and Complainant's co-workers should have been asked for specific information as to the duties of Complainant's current position and how the training would have assisted Complainant in learning how to perform those duties. The Agency focused the issue of training on how it would assist Complainant in procuring a promotion, the Agency's investigation failed to provide information as to how the training may assist Complainant in his current position. As such, we find that the record has not been fully developed for the Commission to make a determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Commission finds that the record is also deficient as to the second part of Complainant's request for a reasonable accommodation, namely the assignments so that Complainant could learn the information he received. The witnesses were not asked about the assignments. It is clear that the Agency accepted Complainant's claim of denial of reasonable accommodation based on the denial of training and when training was provided, Complainant was not given the opportunity to use the training material in his assignment. We also note that the record is not clear as to whether the Supervisor was aware of Complainant's need for assignments to reinforce what he had learned. The Commission cannot make a determination as to whether the Agency denied Complainant's requests for reasonable accommodation. Therefore, the Commission finds that a supplemental investigation is required to develop the record enough for the Agency and the Commission to render a decision on the matter at hand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also notes that Complainant's complaint not only alleged that the Agency denied him reasonable accommodation, but also treated him differently based on his condition. A review of the record indicates that Complainant was not provided with the same assignments as his co-workers who were also Soil Conservationist Technicians. As a result of the assignments, Complainant alleges he was not able to perform all the functions of his position like his co-workers. As such, we find that Complainant has also asserted a claim of disparate treatment based on his disability with regard to the assignment of duties as compared to his coworkers. Therefore, the Agency should also conduct a supplemental investigation on this addition claim of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720120034 (2014), the Commission found that the agency failed to provide reasonable accommodation when it did not extend the on-the-job training period for the complainant to give her an opportunity to meet the production standard. Although the decision is somewhat unclear on an agency's obligations in this regard, one factor was that there was a procedure for extending the training period:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that Complainant was "qualified" because she identified a reasonable accommodation (additional time for on-the-job training beyond the two-year FCIP period) that would allow her to perform the essential functions of the CA position (processing Social Security claims) and to meet the production standard associated with the position's essential functions (processing eight cases per day). Specifically, we find that the requested accommodation seems to be both reasonable and <span id="Page_1404"></span>effective because giving Complainant additional time for on-the-job training appears to be a feasible solution to Complainant's problems with processing cases efficiently. In addition, we agree with the AJ that Complainant's requested accommodation was not a lowering of the production standard. The production standard at issue here is processing eight cases per day. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n) (examples of production standards include typing 75 words per minute and cleaning 16 rooms per day). The Agency was not required to lower the production standard to processing less than eight cases per day. The Agency, however, was required to provide reasonable accommodation--in this case, additional time for on-the-job training--to enable Complainant to meet the eight-cases-per-day production standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we agree with the AJ that the Agency failed to prove that the reasonable accommodation requested by Complainant would cause an undue hardship. We note that, on appeal, the Agency did not specifically claim undue hardship but instead argued that providing the requested accommodation was unreasonable in Complainant's situation. We find that the Agency's generalized conclusions on appeal regarding the impact of the accommodation on other CAs or Social Security applicants and beneficiaries are insufficient to show that the requested accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. Although the Agency questioned the effectiveness of the requested accommodation and asserted that its policies prohibited management from requesting an extension of the FCIP appointment for the purpose of giving Complainant an opportunity to demonstrate improvement in performance, we emphasize that neither of those two assertions show that the requested accommodation would be a significant difficulty or expense for the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the Agency failed to make a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate Complainant's disability with respect to providing additional time for on-the-job training beyond the two-year FCIP period. Although the Agency argued that its decision not to extend the time period was based on its good faith belief that EEOC policy guidance did not require such an extension, the record reflects that the decision was based on other reasons. Specifically, we note that the AJ credited M1's hearing testimony that management had concerns "that because of the hiring authority that they had hired [Complainant] under that that could not be possible." Management did not seek an extension even though the Personnel Policy Manual stated that extensions of FCIP appointments were possible. We note that the Agency provided Complainant with other accommodations (a cubicle change to a quieter location, an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, and a mentor change) during her two-year employment. We emphasize, however, that an agency's duty to provide reasonable accommodation is ongoing and that certain individuals require only one reasonable accommodation, while others may need more than one. <span class="Italic">See</span> Reasonable Accommodation Guidance, Question 32. Accordingly, we find that the Agency is liable for compensatory damages in connection with its failure to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
