<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-133"><span class="space">6.</span> Relief for Violations</h4>
<p class="noindent">When an agency violates the Commission's regulations regarding preemployment inquiries, the complainant is not automatically entitled to, as relief, the position for which he applied. In <span id="Page_1228"></span><span class="Italic">Thompson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951359 (1996), the Commission found the agency's preemployment inquiries were discriminatory, but also found that there was no connection between those inquiries and the nonselection of the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As evidence of pretext, appellant asserts that the agency improperly considered his disability through its pre-employment inquiries. As indicated above, through the "Pre-Hire Interview Questionnaire," the agency solicited various types of information regarding each applicant's prior work history, physical and mental health, workers' compensation claims, use of drugs and alcohol, and sick leave usage, among other things. Likewise, during the preemployment process, the agency solicited information from the VA to document each applicant's disability for purposes of Veteran's Preference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(e) provides that an agency may not make a pre-employment inquiry as to whether an applicant is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of a disability. An agency may, however, make pre-employment inquiry into an applicant's ability to meet the essential functions of the job. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(e). Moreover, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12112(d)(3)(B) and 12112(d)(4)(c), requires employers to maintain information regarding the medical condition and history of individuals with disabilities in separate medical files and to treat such information as confidential except in specified situations<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.14(b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1). These ADA requirements are applicable to cases brought under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act pursuant to Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, P.L. 102-569 (October 29, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the record, we find that the information solicited by the agency in its pre-employment process constituted prohibited pre-employment inquiries. Therefore, we agree with the AJ's finding of disability discrimination based on the agency's prohibited pre-employment inquiries. However, we disagree with the AJ's conclusion that these prohibited inquiries played a part in the agency's decision not to select appellant. We find that the AJ's conclusion in that regard is unsupported by the record and is also inconsistent with the AJ's earlier findings. Despite acknowledging that appellant was not even considered with Applicant 43, the AJ found that the nonselection of Applicant 43 (whom the AJ identified as an individual with a mental disability) was evidence of discriminatory motivation. However, there is no information in the record regarding the qualifications of Applicant 43 and we find that the AJ was improper in making such a finding. Rather, as stated above, we find that the record establishes that the sole reason for appellant's nonselection was his work record, specifically, his prior termination from Sears.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency, in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, was ordered to review its preemployment hiring process to ensure it was in compliance with the Rehabilitation Act, to provide training to its personnel regarding preemployment inquiries and to file a compliance report with the Commission. The only personal relief the complainant was entitled to was the posting of a notice of violation and attorney fees. The Commission ordered similar relief in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, after finding that the complainant had not established that the disclosure of information resulted in his nonselection. However, in <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the Commission declined to award attorney fees because the complainant obtained no personal relief. It appears, however, that <span class="Italic">Jones</span> is an anomaly as the Commission has awarded fees in other similar cases. See <a href="0100-2023-30-001.html#sec22-1">Chapter 22</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dupon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992295 (2002), the difficulty of establishing a causal connection between an illegal preemployment medical inquiry and a subsequent nonselection was again demonstrated. In <span class="Italic">Dupon</span>, the Commission found the agency presented clear and convincing evidence that it would not have selected the complainant because a legitimate inquiry made after a conditional offer of employment would have yielded the same information that the illegal preemployment inquiry yielded, namely, the complainant's medical condition precluded him from performing the essential functions of the position and, as a result, he was not a qualified individual with a disability. Still, the Commission found that the complainant was entitled to an award of compensatory damages. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Dupon</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers may evaluate whether an applicant is qualified for a job in question by, for example, asking about an applicant's ability to perform specific job functions or by asking applicants to describe or demonstrate how they would perform the job's tasks<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002, <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> (Oct. 10, 1995) (web version) ("1995 Enforcement Guidance"), at 2. Under the Rehabilitation Act, however, "an employer may ask disability-related questions and require medical examinations of an applicant only after the applicant has been given a conditional job offer." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR 1630.13(a). As this Commission has explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the past, some employment applications and interviews requested information about an applicant's physical and/or mental condition. This information was often used to exclude applicants with disabilities before their ability to perform the job was even evaluated. For example, applicants may have been asked about their medical conditions at the same time that they were engaging in other parts of the application process, such as completing a written job application or having references checked. If an applicant was then rejected, s/he did not necessarily know whether s/he was rejected because of disability, or because of insufficient skills or experience or a bad report from a reference. As a result, Congress established a process...to isolate an employer's consideration of an applicant's medical condition.... Under the law, an employer may not ask disability-related questions and may not conduct medical examinations until after it makes a conditional job offer to the applicant. This helps ensure that an applicant's possible hidden disability (including a prior history of a disability) is not considered before the employer evaluates an applicant's non-medical qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1995 Enforcement Guidance, at 1-2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency did not simply ask complainant if he could perform the functions of the automation clerk job, or merely require him to demonstrate his ability to lift the trays or parcels that typically must be lifted by automation clerks. This would have been fine<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, 29 CFR 1630.14(a); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 1995 Enforcement Guidance, at 10 (providing that if an "employer requires applicants to lift a thirty pound box and carry it twenty feet," this "is not a medical examination [but] is just a test of whether the applicant can perform this task"). Instead, the agency asked complainant questions designed specifically to elicit information about his particular disability, and required him to undergo a physical examination where an agency doctor explored the nature and extent of his back injury<span class="Italic">. See</span> Agency's PS Form 2485 (Nov. 1991) (asking whether complainant had "any medical disorder or physical impairment which could interfere in any way with the full performance of duties of the position for which [complainant was] applying"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Affidavit of SPSS (Jul. 27, 1998), at 2; and Affidavit of HRS (Aug. 27, 1998), at 1 (in which SPSS and HRS both concede that the agency's contract physician gave complainant a "physical examination").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the agency did not wait to ask complainant about his condition or to examine his back until after it had given complainant a clear conditional job offer. This, too, would have been all right<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, 29 CFR 1630.13(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 1995 Enforcement Guidance, at 13 (noting that "[a]fter giving a job offer to an applicant, an employer may ask disability-related questions and perform medical examinations," and that a "job offer may be conditioned on the results of post-offer disability-related questions or medical examination"); <span class="Italic">cf. id.</span> at 15 (indicating that "[a]t the post-offer stage, an employer [may] ask[ ] new hires whether they have had back injuries...[and] give [ ] medical examinations designed to diagnose back impairments to persons who stated that they had prior back injuries"). In this case, though, the agency asked disability-related questions and performed a medical examination of complainant before he was ever given any offer of employment by and with the agency<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, Complainant's Affidavit (June 28, 1998), at 3 (where complainant contends that "[o]ne of the big failure[s] of the [agency]...was that...the medical exams [were] performed without [my first] being offered a job by the [agency]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear to us that the pre-offer questions asked of complainant were "disability-related questions," and that the pre-offer physical given to complainant was a "medical examination" (as these terms-of-art are defined for Rehabilitation Act purposes). We therefore find that this agency activity was a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act, and thus a form of prohibited disability discrimination<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Commerce,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A01247 (June 26, 2001); <span class="Italic">Dereyna et al. v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980077 (Jan. 19, 2001); and <span class="Italic">Thompson v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951359 (Aug. 7, 1996). We further find that this unlawful activity might have resulted in actual injury to complainant, and that as a result, he may be entitled to compensatory damages<span class="Italic">. See McCartin v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01985866 (Aug. 21, 2001); and <span class="Italic">Nolan v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01975113 (Nov. 1, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disability-Based Non-Selection</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the agency violated the law's prohibitions on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations, we must now decide whether this violation so tainted the agency's decision not to hire complainant that this hiring decision itself must be set aside. That is, we must determine whether complainant should be placed in the position he sought, and should be given other appropriate relief (such as back pay)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A10033 (June 25, 2001) (providing that "[w]hen discrimination is found, the agency must provide the complainant with an equitable remedy that constitutes full, make-whole relief to restore him or her to the position he or she would have occupied absent the discrimination"). We have held in the past that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_1229"></span>In light of...prohibited [disability-related] inquiries [and/or medical examinations], the agency [can] only avoid the "make-whole" remedies of placement and back pay, if it can establish by clear and convincing evidence that complainant would not have been chosen for the...position at issue absent the prohibited inquiries [and/or physical examination]. Therefore, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that the record establishes by the clear and convincing evidence standard that complainant's non-selection was unrelated to any disability disclosed as a result of the unlawful pre-employment inquiries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Nolan v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01975113 (Nov. 1, 2000), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. Matthews,</span> 530 F.2d 1083 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">see also Dereyna et al. v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980077 (Jan. 19, 2001) (arguing that "[p]lacing such an onerous burden on the employer is proper, inasmuch as the employer's unlawful acts caused the difficulty in determining what would have resulted if there had been no discrimination").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, this analysis presupposes that the prohibited pre-offer inquiry and/or examination revealed that an applicant had an actual "disability" (within the technical meaning of the Rehabilitation Act), and that the applicant was "qualified" to perform the job sought<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Dereyna et al. v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980077 (Jan. 19, 2001); and <span class="Italic">Hobbs v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01944181 (Jan. 26, 1996). We have repeatedly ruled that a Rehabilitation Act claim based on non-selection can only succeed if the complainant can demonstrate that (1) he is an "individual with a disability"; (2) he is a "qualified individual with a disability"; [FN10] and (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action because of his disability<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A10033 (June 25, 2001); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 29 CFR 1630.4(b) (stating that "[i]t is unlawful for [an agency] to discriminate on the basis of disability against a qualified individual with a disability in regard to [among other things]...hiring").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant was certainly subject to an "adverse employment action" when the agency refused to hire him. We do not think, however, that complainant can prove another critical prong of the above-outlined framework--that he was a "qualified individual with a disability." Even if we assume that he was an "individual with a disability" at the time of the non-selection, we do not think that complainant was "qualified" for the position for which he applied. The evidence in the record reveals that he simply was not able to perform at least one of the essential functions of the automation clerk job, and that no reasonable accommodation could change this fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Any permissible post-offer disability-related inquiries or medical examinations would have revealed what the (admittedly invalid) pre-offer activity did (and what complainant's own personal doctor later confirmed)--that complainant was restricted from lifting over twenty pounds and was precluded from any "all day" lifting. As the agency stated in its letter denying complainant the position:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A review of your medical records and evaluation by our Medical Officer reveals significant findings of chronic low back pain. The findings/restrictions are no lifting over 20 lbs. These conditions are not compatible with the activities required for this position. The position of Casual Clerk requires arduous physical activity such as continuous walking, standing, pushing, bending, twisting, use of hands and fingers, reaching above the shoulder, heavy lifting up to 70 pounds, in constant noise and dust, and working around machinery with moving parts or vehicles. Under these conditions, postal employment would place your personal health and safety in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency Letter to Complainant Denying Appointment (Dec. 1, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This description of the position's essential functions--and of complainant's inability to perform them with or without a reasonable accommodation--was first detailed on the agency's PS Form 2485. On this form, the agency noted that "heavy lifting up to 70 pounds" and "moderate carrying, 15-44 pounds" (along with "reaching above shoulder," "use of fingers," "walking (8 hours)," "standing," and "repeated bending") were "functional requirement[s]...essential to the duties of this position." <span class="Italic">See</span> Agency's Form 2485 (Nov. 1991). This form also reflects the agency doctor's assessment that complainant was "not medically qualified to perform essential functions of the position," and that "[a]ccommodations will not reduce medical risk or restriction." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> While this assessment was made (and the form filled out) before complainant was given a conditional offer, we <span class="Italic">see</span> no reason to presume that the essential functions of the position in question, or the doctor's assessment of complainant's ability to perform them with or without an accommodation, would have changed if the form had properly been filled-out post-offer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given these facts, we believe the agency has shown (by clear and convincing evidence) that it would not have selected complainant in any event. According to the uncontested evidence in the record, complainant never could have lifted up to 70 pounds, and thus could not perform (with or without a reasonable accommodation) at least one of the essential functions of the position for which he applied<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, Affidavit of HRS (Aug. 27, 1998), at 2 (where the selecting official herself explained how "[complainant] stated a preference for a Mail Processor position at the main office on swing shift. A Mail Processor works on the automated mail processing equipment and is responsible for loading and unloading mail onto or from the automated equipment. It is moderately heavy work and very fast paced. This position required continuous standing or walking the entire shift of work, lifting trays of mail 20 pounds or more on a continuous basis throughout the shift or work and continuous bending and twisting."); and Affidavit of SPSS (Jul. 27, 1998), at 2 (in which SPSS also stipulated that "the position of casual clerk-automation required applicants be able to walk, stand, lift, etc.... [A]n essential function is the ability to lift a tray of letter mail weighing up to 45 pounds on a repetitive basis"); <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(n)(3)(i) (providing that "[e]vidence of whether a particular function is essential includes...[t] he employer's judgment as to which functions are essential").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For this reason, the agency was not obligated to hire complainant, and he thus is not entitled to any "make-whole" relief (such as placement in the position or back pay) in connection with this non-selection<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McCartin v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01985866 (Aug. 21, 2001) (concluding that even though complainant had been subjected to a prohibited pre-offer medical examination, he had not shown he was a "qualified individual with a disability," and thus could not prevail on a related non-selection claim); and <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A10033 (June 25, 2001) (similarly ruling that a complainant "ha[d] not established his claim of discriminatory non-selection, because he was not a 'qualified individual with a disability' with regard to the position sought"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McKinley v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01933326 (Sept. 8, 1994), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950027 (Dec. 8, 1995) (holding that even though an applicant was subjected to prohibited pre-offer disability-related questioning, the applicant would not have been selected for the job in question even absent this discrimination, and was therefore not entitled to placement and/or back pay).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hoskins v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120091049 (2010) (no evidence impermissible preemployment medical examination affected complainant's ranking for position based on his interview performance); <span class="Italic">Darangelo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A5399 (2005) (agency made impermissible preemployment inquiry, but complainant submitted no evidence she could perform the essential functions of the position even with accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Green-Collins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120061125 (2008), the Commission found that the agency had conducted an improper medical inquiry when the selecting official reviewed the applicants' workers' compensation claims and discovered the complainant had previously filed several OWCP claims. Although the Commission found that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by looking at the complainant's workers' compensation history, it also found that the agency established she would not have been selected in any event where the determinative selection factor was supervisory recommendations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Nolan v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01975113 (2000), the Commission found there was insufficient evidence in the record to determine if the impermissible preemployment inquiries caused the complainant's nonselection. The case was remanded to the agency to supplement the record on that issue and to determine whether the complainant was entitled to compensatory damages. In <span class="Italic">Nolan</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Commission has held that an employer may ask a potential employee whether they can perform any and all job functions, the Assistant's question about complainant's lifting ability was appropriate<span class="Italic">. See</span> Enforcement Guidance, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. However, based on our review of the record, we find that the information solicited by the SO constituted prohibited pre-employment inquiries. The record reflects that prior to the selection decision, the SO asked complainant about the history and severity of her past back injury, and the SO conceded that he solicited information from complainant about the back injury she sustained while she was employed by the Army and the events surrounding her related medical discharge. Further, we find that the SO's line of questioning concerning complainant's impairment after learning about her entitlement to a veteran's preference was sufficiently broad that it was likely to elicit information about any disability she may have had. We therefore find that the SO's questions regarding the history and severity of complainant's work-related injury and her physical limitations in general elicited information about disability and thus was impermissibly disability-related and violated the Rehabilitation Act<span class="Italic">. See Norcross v. Sneed</span>, 755 F.2d 113 (8th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. United States Postal Service</span>, 662 F.2d 292 (5th Cir. 1981). The Commission finds that the above described inquiries by the SO were improper and are explicitly prohibited by EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we address complainant's assertion that the agency did not offer her employment because the SO regarded her as disabled due to her <span id="Page_1230"></span>responses to his prohibited pre-employment inquiries. While we find that complainant established <span class="Italic">per se</span> disability discrimination due to the agency's improper pre-employment questioning during the job interview, we must consider whether the information gathered as the result of the prohibited inquiries was used as part of the agency's decision not to select complainant for the Office Assistant position. Therefore, we initially must determine whether complainant is a qualified individual with a disability....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...However, the Commission finds that there is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude whether the SO regarded complainant as an individual with a disability, as that term is defined by the Rehabilitation Act. In addition, there is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude which, if any, major life activities the SO regarded complainant as being substantially limited in performing. We therefore decline to proceed to a determination on the merits as to whether the SO's prohibited pre-employment questions establish that he regarded complainant as an individual with a disability. The complaint is thus remanded to the agency for the gathering of additional relevant evidence on the issue of whether, due to his pre-employment inquiries, the SO regarded complainant's back injury as substantially limiting any of her major life activities such that she was regarded as an individual with a disability, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(g), (i). In its investigation, the agency should determine specifically which major life activities the SO may have regarded complainant as substantially limited in performing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Should it be determined on remand that the SO regarded complainant as an individual with a disability, the inquiry then proceeds to a determination of whether the agency's prohibited inquiries were in part responsible for the agency's decision not to select complainant. In light of the prohibited inquiries, the agency only avoid the "make-whole" remedies of placement and back pay, if it can establish by clear and convincing evidence that complainant would not have been chosen for the Office Assistant position at issue absent the prohibited inquiries. Therefore, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that the record establishes by the clear and convincing evidence standard that complainant's nonselection was unrelated to any disability disclosed as a result of the unlawful pre-employment inquiries<span class="Italic">. See e.g., Day v. Mathews</span>, 530 F.2d 1083 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Bozeman v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120120923 (2013), the complainant did establish that an impermissible medical inquiry during the preemployment stage resulted in his nonselection. In <span class="Italic">Bozeman</span>, there were four candidates for the position and the selecting official eliminated two of the candidates. The selecting official then called the complainant to discuss his medical restrictions. Deeming his response to be less than truthful, the selecting official then eliminated the complainant from consideration and selecting the remaining candidate. <span class="Italic">Bozeman</span> also contains an example of a good cross examination of a selecting official:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ erred in finding that the Agency's impermissible disability-related inquiry was not a determinative factor in Complainant's non-selection. There is substantial evidence in the record to reflect that the crux of Complainant's non-selection was based on the selecting official's impermissible disability-related inquiry with Complainant. It was during this conversation regarding Complainant's medical restrictions that the selecting official developed concerns regarding Complainant's integrity and credibility. We agree with Complainant's attorney that "had [the selecting official] not made this phone call, she would not have developed her perception of [Complainant's] credibility, and he would not have been disqualified as a viable candidate for the Labor Relations Specialist position."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The selecting official's testimony at the hearing indicates that Complainant was no longer considered a viable candidate after this conversation:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant's Counsel: And then your testimony was after that phone call which raised the credibility issues in your mind, that left [the selectee]?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Selecting Official: That's correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant's Counsel: So following that phone conversation, [Complainant]...was in the same way disqualified as the other two [applicants] were, correct?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Selecting Official: That would be fair to say, yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant's Counsel: So it would not have mattered how outstanding his writing skills were after that phone call correct?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Selecting Official: No.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant's Counsel: It would not have matter what kind of energy he displayed during his interview after that phone call?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Selecting Official: No.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant's Counsel: It would not have mattered what kind of educational background he had after that phone call; correct?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Selecting Official: Correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant's Counsel: It would not have mattered what kind of prior supervisory experience he had after that phone call?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Selecting Official: Correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant's Counsel: In fact there is nothing that mattered <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> his qualifications for this job once you had the phone call with him correct?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Selecting Official: Correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The selecting official's affidavit taken during the investigation also reflects that she stated she had concerns with Complainant's ethics, integrity, and credibility. The selecting official further asserted that during the telephone call with Complainant (the impermissible medical inquiry), she found Complainant's statements to be odd because she questioned how Complainant would have known that his doctor would authorize a change in his restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the crux of Complainant's non-selection was based on Complainant's responses during the Agency's impermissible medical inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that even if the selecting official believed Complainant's responses regarding his medical restrictions to be less than truthful, the selecting official should not have used this perception to eliminate Complainant from further consideration as an applicant, because such a perception stemmed from the Agency's impermissible medical inquiry. An applicant's answers to an improper disability-related inquiry, even if false, cannot serve as a basis for the applicant's elimination from the applicant pool. <span class="Italic">See Leonel v. Am. Airlines, Inc</span>., 400 F.3d 702, 709-11 (9th Cir. 2005). "[A]n employer that violates its employees' rights by asking impermissible questions ought not be able to base adverse employment decisions on the resulting answers (to which it was not entitled in the first place)." <span class="Italic">Downs v. Mass. Bay. Transp. Auth</span>., 13 F. Supp.2d 130, 140-41 (D Mass. 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency's non-selection for the Labor Relations Specialist position at issue was due to unlawful discrimination stemming from Complainant's responses to the Agency's impermissible disability-related inquiry.</p>
