<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-21"><span class="space">5.</span> Reasonable Suspicion Standard</h4>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant alleges that considerations weigh in favor of tolling the time limit, the agency must make a factual determination of when the complainant became aware of the alleged discrimination, or when a reasonable person should have become aware of the alleged discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 01830804 (1983). In <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the complainant was asked to resign while he sought treatment for alcoholism and was told that he would be reemployed after his rehabilitation. He alleged that he did not become aware of the discriminatory treatment until after he completed his treatment, returned to work and, through discussions with coworkers, found that white employees who suffered from alcoholism were not required to resign during treatment. Complainants need not and should not wait for evidence of all the facts that point to discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gilbert B. v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 0120152531 (2016) ("The Commission has adopted a reasonable suspicion standard (as opposed to a 'supportive facts' standard) to determine when the forty-five (45) day limitation period is triggered. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970852 (Feb. 11, 1999). Thus, the time limitation is not triggered until a complainant reasonably suspects discrimination, but before all the facts that support a charge of discrimination have become apparent."). Where, however the alleged discriminatory action is a nonselection, a complainant may reasonably wait for the agency to announce its selection for the position. In <span class="Italic">Emerson P. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120162817 (2017), the Commission held that the agency's unofficial advance notice to the complainant of his nonselection, even where his supervisors told him who the likely selectee would be, did not trigger the complainant's reasonable suspicion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 29, 2016, Complainant received unofficial advance notice from his regional leadership that he likely would not be selected for the PAC at the Oakland RO. The ASAC and SAC also informed Complainant who the Agency would select in lieu of him to a "ninety-percent degree" of certainty. This, however, was not official notification of his non-selection. At that point, we find that there was still a possibility that the Selectee might not have either been selected or accepted the RAC position in Oakland. From the Agency's record, it is also unclear whether the non-selection discussion conversation involving the ASAC, SAC and Complainant, definitively advised him whether the Agency would make a job announcement wherein he could apply to fill the RAC vacancy. After all, the ASAC had, at one point, advised Complainant to prepare his resume for such an opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hence, the circumstances of this case support the Complainant's position that his claim of discrimination did not become reasonably apparent until May 2016, when Complainant was officially informed that the Selectee's transfer to the Oakland RAC position had been approved and her start date was announced. Prior to the ASAC's email of May 5, 2016, it was reasonable for Complainant to think that he still had a ten-percent chance of remaining in his acting RAC slot. However, after the ASAC's email, Complainant had official notice that Selectee would replace him and serve as the permanent RAC with an effective date of May 15, 2016. Only then did all the facts to support a claim of discrimination become apparent to the Complainant. <span class="Italic">See Arnaldo P. v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120161967 (September 14, 2016) (while the complainant "had some unofficial notice that he might not be selected, the decision not to select him did not become effective until the Agency issued its disposition notice..."). Accordingly, the trigger-date for the 45-day EEO counselor contact began on May 5, 2016, not on March 29, 2016 as the Agency contends. Therefore, we find that the Complainant's EEO Counselor contact on May 17, 2016, was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sylvia B. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120170479 (2017), found that the complainant's claim of discrimination did not become reasonably apparent until the agency released the results of an OIG investigation, which revealed that, like the complainant, other agency officials were found to have inappropriately used government IT, but unlike the complainant, were not disciplined. In <span class="Italic">Cottman v. Defense Investigative Service</span>, 05880312 (1988), the Commission redubbed the reasonable person standard the "reasonable suspicion" standard. Although it does not appear that the standard itself changed, in <span class="Italic">Cottman</span>, the Commission did compare it with other possible standards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No cases have utilized such a low standard as a "mere feeling" by the complainant to trigger the 30 day time period. <span class="Italic">Paredes v. Nagle</span>, 27 FEP Cases 1347, n.6. In <span class="Italic">Reeb v. Economic Opportunity Atlanta, Inc.</span>, 516 F.2d 924 (5th Cir. 1975), the court held that the limitations period did not begin to run until the facts that would support a charge of discrimination were apparent or should have been apparent to a reasonable person. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Myles v. Schlesinger</span>, 436 F. Supp. 16, the court held that the limitations period is not triggered until a complainant reasonably suspects discrimination. This "reasonable suspicion" standard was endorsed by the court in <span class="Italic">Paredes v. Nagle</span>, 27 FEP Cases 1345 (1982). Addressing the issue of which standard to employ the <span class="Italic">Paredes</span> court noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This reasonable suspicion standard, as opposed to some type of "supportive facts" standard, appears to be the best triggering standard for this situation; it is an effective middle ground position which accommodates both the desire to prevent the filing of frivolous, unfounded complaints and the desire to get these discrimination matters promptly into the agency's investigation and conciliation channels. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1347.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cottman</span>, the Commission found that it was reasonable for a person who was not selected for a position to inquire about the successful candidate, including inquiry into the race and age of that person. The mere inquiry did not trigger the time period for initiating counseling because such an inquiry "without more, does not indicate appellant reasonably suspected discrimination...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The time period was triggered when the complainant was informed of the race and age of the selectee. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ruth v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A06000 (2001) (comparing the appropriate "reasonable suspicion" standard with a "supportive facts" standard). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Michel v. Attorney General</span>, 0120123297 (2013), the Commission found that the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion that the agency's withdrawal of his conditional job offer was potentially disability discrimination at the time of the withdrawal. The complainant subsequently made a FOIA request for documents regarding the withdrawal and found upon receipt of the documents that he did not pass the background check because he appeared to colleagues to be depressed. The Commission determined that the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination until he received and reviewed the documents. However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sanora S. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120181597 (2019), held that the complainant who was not retained in a position did have an affirmative duty to inquire into the agency's actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Complainant claims she did not find out until March 31, 2016, that the two comparatives were retained despite Complainant's term appointment ending in August 2013, we note there is no indication Complainant did anything at all to try to find out whether everyone in her job category had been non-renewed. Moreover, we note that based on her affidavit, Complainant had already suspected that her supervisor displayed a harsh attitude towards African-Americans while treating White employees with professionalism. Complainant also stated that once she engaged in protected in June 2013, she was subject to increased scrutiny and argues the close proximity of that scrutiny with her protected activity suggest she was subjected to retaliation. Complainant clearly knew of the closeness in time between her protected activity and the end of her term appointment at the time those actions occurred. Upon review, we find Complainant has not provided adequate justification for her untimely EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">In applying the reasonable suspicion standard, the Commission will go beyond the assertions of the complainant and examine her actions. Where the complainant requested a desk audit to challenge the classification of her position on four separate occasions, the fact that coworkers later expressed surprise about her grade level was not the event that gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that the classification was discriminatory<span class="Italic">. Matlack v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01890070 (1989). The complainant's actions in pursuing the classification appeals undermined her assertion that she did not suspect discrimination until hearing the comments of coworkers.</p>
<p class="noindent">A "[r]easonable suspicion arises when one has reason to support the belief that prohibited discrimination has occurred, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, facts and/or circumstances." <span class="Italic">Royster v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05910690 (1991). In that case, the Commission held that the agency erred in focusing on the date that the complainant's request for an upgrade was denied. The proper focus was on when the complainant first had a reasonable suspicion that the denial was discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether a complainant meets the "reasonable suspicion" standard, the Commission will consider what, if anything, the complainant learned between the time of the original incident and the event which the complainant claims triggered his suspicions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Fowler v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952036 (1996), the Commission rejected the complainant's timeliness arguments where he was unable to demonstrate that he learned anything of significance between his original rejection for a position and a subsequent reaffirmation of his ineligibility. The Commission found that the complainant should have known at the time of his original rejection that his considerable driving experience would have qualified him for the position of motor vehicle operator. Further, the complainant failed to point to anything specific in the reaffirmation that provided additional insight into his allegation that age was the reason for his rejection. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120122956 (2012) (reasonable suspicion did not arise when complainant was advised his job would be abolished but when he learned a similarly situated employee received better treatment); <span class="Italic">Piper v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120102304 (2011) (female nurse did not discover until four months after detail that male nurses and physicians involved in incident were not detailed); <span class="Italic">Rice v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A32696 (2003); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994766 (2002) (complainants did not develop a reasonable suspicion that denial of leave was discriminatory until learning that coworkers were granted leave); <span class="Italic">Queener v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966745 (1997) (complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion <span id="Page_47"></span>that her suspension was discriminatory until several months later, when a black employee committed a similar infraction, left an unattended vehicle running and was not disciplined).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the "reasonable suspicion" standard, the time frame for contacting a counselor does not begin to run when requests for work assignments are denied. Rather, the 45-day period begins when the complainant discovers that her requests for work assignments were treated differently than those of a similarly situated coworker. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Larry v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955688 (1996). In that case, the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint as untimely, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has adopted a "reasonable suspicion" standard (as opposed to a "supportive facts" standard) to determine when the limitation period is triggered under the EEOC Regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.105(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Ball v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880247 (July 6, 1988). Thus, the limitation period is not triggered until a complainant should reasonably suspect discrimination, but before all the facts that would support a charge of discrimination have become apparent. In this case the Commission finds that appellant could not have reasonably suspected discrimination until she learned that she and her co-worker had been treated differently with respect to the granting of work requests. If, as appellant asserts, she did not learn of the disparate treatment until February 8, 1995, then her EEO contact of March 22, 1995 was within the 45-day limitation period. The agency has not presented any evidence to rebut appellant's assertion. Therefore, the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint for failure to timely contact an EEO Counselor was likewise improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Wynn v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A10384 (2001), the Commission found that the 45-day period for contacting a counselor did not begin when the complainant received an ineligibility rating. The timeframe only started after he learned that a less qualified employee outside of the complainant's protected category was selected for the position. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Richard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11760 (2001), the Commission found that reasonable suspicion was not triggered by the agency's denial of vacation time to an employee with a low leave balance but instead when a comparative employee with a low leave balance was subsequently granted vacation time. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54583 (2005), the Commission found that the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination when he was reassigned upon his return to work. At that time, the agency told the complainant that there was no work to accommodate him at his former work station. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Commission found that the complainant did not develop a reasonable suspicion until he learned that another worker who returned from an injury was assigned to his former work station. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072511 (2007);<span class="Italic"> Romano v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54277 (2005). Another example is provided by <span class="Italic">Aponte v. Attorney General</span>, 0120092542 (2009), where the complainant did not contest the denial of a transfer to the facility where her husband worked until another an associate warden and his wife were both assigned to the same facility. Prior to that the agency had contended that policy prohibited the assignment of spouses to the same facility. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Martine L. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>., 0120152142 (2015) (time for counselor contact did not run from date complainant was informed of nonselection, but on date a coworker informed her that her EEO complaints had allegedly been discussed during selection process).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Longo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04496 (2001), the Commission found that counselor contact was untimely where the complainant's request for bereavement leave was denied in June 1999 and it was not until February 2000 that he discovered two other employees had been granted bereavement leave. In <span class="Italic">Longo</span>, the Commission determined that there was an intervening event that should have led the complainant to suspect discrimination sooner; namely, he was granted bereavement leave in December 1999 without being required to submit documentation. That event, the Commission found, should have triggered the complainant's reasonable suspicion of discrimination, and the subsequent counselor contact was untimely. A similar result was reached by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kalra v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A03263 (2001), where the Commission found that the time period for contacting a counselor did not begin when the complainant learned of the qualifications of the selectee, but instead ran from an earlier point in time when the selecting official told the complainant that he planned to hire someone who spoke better English. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Kalra</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we conclude that complaint failed to initiate timely Counselor contact regarding claims 1 and 2. The record indicates that complainant had a "reasonable suspicion" of discriminatory conduct regarding the selection process around the time of the first non-selection. At that time, complainant contends that his supervisor admitted to him that he planned to hire someone "who can speak better English" than the complainant. We reject complainant's argument that timeliness should be measured beginning at the time he became "aware of the facts" regarding the other employees' qualifications. The regulations do not allow a potential complainant to wait indefinitely for an awareness of the facts regarding a claim; instead, they require diligent pursuit of the EEO process whenever reasonable suspicion occurs. Consequently, we have held that waiting until one has supporting facts or proof of discrimination before initiating the EEO process can result in untimely Counselor contact<span class="Italic">. Bracken v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900065 (March 29, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Commission has held that the doctrine of laches is an equitable defense for an agency under which an individual's failure to diligently pursue their actions can bar their claims from further consideration<span class="Italic">. Sapp v. USPS,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950666 (May 31, 1996) (three-year delay); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910476 (August 15, 1991) (four-year delay). Therefore, because the Commission concludes that complainant failed to present adequate justification for waiving the applicable time limits, we find that the agency properly found that claims 1 and 2 were the subject of untimely EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has noted that applying the reasonable suspicion standard too stringently "is to encourage [the] filing of a premature and conceivably meritless complaint." <span class="Italic">Puana v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01996640 (2001) (reasonable suspicion standard was not triggered because complainant knew he had engaged in EEO activity before receiving his rating, but only after he learned of the ratings of his peers).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an appellant initially believes that harassment is based on personal animosity, and only later has reason to suspect a discriminatory motive, the time limits for EEO contact begin to run when the discriminatory motive is suspected. In <span class="Italic">Buzzell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965112 (1997), the incidents of alleged harassment all occurred more than 45 days prior to EEO contact. The appellant argued that she did not suspect that she was discriminated against on a basis covered under EEOC regulations until "sometime" in January 1996. On appeal, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Buzzell</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;I am married to a Postal Service Supervisor...[Person A] became my husband's immediate supervisor beginning in May, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;From the end of July through the third week in August, 1995, [Person A] mercilessly harassed my husband to the point that, on August 21, 1995, my husband was forced to take sick leave for stress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;After my husband was gone, [Person A], who was also my first-line supervisor, turned her wrath on me.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although I knew that [Person A's] treatment of me was arbitrary and capricious, I did not believe that she was discriminating against me because of a basis covered by any of the federal anti-discrimination laws. I believed that she was harassing me because I am married to my husband whom she detested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...When I saw the lengths that [Person A] would go to accommodate a black employee [concerning placement of a black employee in January 1996 into a particular position without bidding on a job and paying that black employee at an improperly high rate of pay], I knew that [Person A's] disgraceful treatment of me was not simply because of whom I married but was also because of my race. When I came to this realization, sometime in January, 1996, I contacted an EEO Counselor within 45-days.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Buzzell</span> found that this was a reasonable explanation of why the complainant did not suspect discrimination until January 1996, and the agency failed to show that she suspected discrimination or should have suspected discrimination more than 45 days before she contacted an EEO Counselor. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Macelis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965211 (1997) (complainant suspected that her supervisor personally disliked her as early as 1988, but had no reason to suspect discrimination until 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Mann v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992477 (1999), the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination within the 45-day period when she was counseled by a supervisor not to take an examination for a promotion because she was not yet qualified. It was not until a later discussion with a union steward that the complainant found out that the supervisor had counseled other females not to take the exam. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Mann</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, appellant states that she did not reasonably suspect that management was acting in a discriminatory fashion when her manager approached her in order to deter her from taking the maintenance exam on July 1, 1998. The manager gave appellant an apparently legitimate reason for her not to take the maintenance exam when he told her that she was not qualified to take such an exam based on her knowledge, skills, and abilities. On appeal, appellant alleges that the manager approached a union steward who is charged with orienting new hires including explaining the proper procedure for attaining desired promotions. Appellant claims that the manager suggested to the steward that he modify his orientation regarding the Promotion Eligibility Register (PER) so that new hires, particularly women, would not apply for positions for which the manager felt they were not eligible. Appellant alleges that the union steward conducted an inquiry and found that the manager had counseled female hires on the PER and following the counseling, the new hires would decide not to take the exam. Appellant was approached by the union steward. During their conversation on August 28, 1998, the union steward suggested to appellant that the incident with the manager may have been motivated by discriminatory intent. Appellant contacted an EEO Counselor on September 14, 1998. Under the circumstances of <span id="Page_48"></span>this case, the Commission finds that appellant reasonably suspected on August 28, 1998, that she was discriminated against. Appellant raised this issue with an EEO Counselor on September 14, 1998. Therefore, we find that appellant timely contacted the EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Escobedo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991906 (2001), the Commission found that the complainant's contact with a counselor was untimely where he claimed he did not know that a reprimand was the reason he had not been selected for a position six months earlier. The complainant maintained that he did not find out that the letter of reprimand was considered until the day before he initiated counseling. Without disputing that contention, the Commission found that the complainant had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination when the reprimand was issued because, at that time, he complained that his supervisor had issued it to prevent him from being selected for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary for a complainant to have articulated a basis of discrimination in order for the reasonable suspicion standard to be triggered. In <span class="Italic">Senicola v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05950739 (1996), the complainant first filed a complaint with the Special Counsel alleging that he had been discriminated against on the basis of political affiliation after being told by the chief of labor relations that he had no basis for an EEO complaint. The Commission later rejected his argument that, because he had not articulated a basis of discrimination within the Commission's jurisdiction in his complaint to Special Counsel, he was unaware of the alleged discrimination. In rejecting the complaint in <span class="Italic">Senicola</span>, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that even though political affiliation is not a basis for filing an EEO complaint, appellant need not articulate a basis for discrimination in order for the time limit to begin. Pursuant to the reasonable suspicion standard, the limitations period is triggered when a complainant should reasonably suspect discrimination, but before all the facts that would support a charge of discrimination may have become apparent<span class="Italic">. See Ball v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880247 (July 6, 1988). Thus, the fact that he did not articulate a basis of discrimination to the Office of Special Counsel is not dispositive. As noted in the previous decision, given appellant's other actions, it is reasonable to conclude that appellant should have suspected discrimination around that time.</p>
<p class="noindent">A request for information under the Freedom of Information Act by a public interest organization representing the complainant can be sufficient to show that the complainant had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination even if it does not articulate a specific basis for inquiring about "disparate treatment." In <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120054527 (2007), the complainant initiating counseling in December 2002 on a class action complaint alleging that the agency discriminated against minority employees by delaying a response to possible anthrax exposure. The complainant alleged that the agency responded more quickly to possible exposure at the Boca Raton facility, where the employees are mostly Caucasian, than it did in Brentwood, where most of the employees are minorities. She subsequently filed her class action complaint in March 2003.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the complainant had been represented by the public interest organization, Judicial Watch, since April 2002. In June 2002, Judicial Watch issued a press release indicating it was planning a variety of legal actions for "the disparate treatment and reckless endangerment the Brentwood postal workers faced." It also filed a FOIA request seeking information about that treatment and received a response in October 2002. The Commission determined that the complainant had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination in at least June 2002 and, therefore, her request for counseling was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further determined a letter sent by Judicial Watch to the EEOC's Washington Field Office did not constitute a timely request for counseling, even though it was addressed to someone who had a "logical connection" to the EEO process. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Briscoe,</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that a complainant's contact of the EEOC is sufficient to constitute the initiation of EEO counseling. <span class="Italic">See Shapleigh v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A20532 (May 3, 2002); <span class="Italic">Castleman v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01964146 (May 30, 1997). The primary factors considered are the complainant's timely initiation of contact with someone associated with the EEO process, and expressed intent to begin the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, in such cases, the complainants have not been represented by counsel. <span class="Italic">Shapleigh, supra, Castleman, supra.</span> In contrast, in <span class="Italic">Simmer v. Dep't of Health and Human Serv.,</span> where a complainant was represented by counsel, the Commission found that the complainant failed to timely initiate EEO counseling despite her counsel's having contacted the EEOC District Office in a timely manner. EEOC Appeal No. 01934696 (April 13, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant is represented by Judicial Watch, which mailed a letter on her behalf to WFO on December 6, 2003. While she, through counsel, timely initiated contact with someone associated with the EEO process and expressed intent to begin the EEO process, her contact cannot be considered timely because she was represented by counsel. We note that complainant had sought EEO counseling twice in 2002, prior to seeking counseling in the present matter. Moreover, the Commission is troubled by complainant's further delay in seeking EEO counseling once WFO informed Judicial Watch on December 12, 2002 that it lacked authority to process the complaint. In this regard, the record reveals that complainant waited 11 more days and did not contact an EEO counselor until December 23, 2002. When her 11 day delay is coupled with her two prior EEO contacts and the fact that she was represented by counsel, the Commission must find that her EEO counselor contact was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the fact that an employee files a grievance over a personnel action does not necessarily indicate a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Dise v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962456 (1998), the Commission found that the complainant's grievance, which alleged that he was not selected because of union activity, did not show that the complainant had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects appellant developed a reasonable suspicion of unlawful employment discrimination when, on December 4, 1995, he learned that two black males under forty years of age had been selected for the Job Training Instructor position. Until this time, appellant had no reason to believe that he was being subjected to discrimination. Despite the agency's contention that he had filed a grievance in October, 1994, when he learned he was denied the position, there is no evidence in the record indicating that appellant believed, or had reason to believe, he was being subjected to unlawful employment discrimination. Indeed, appellant stated in his grievance that he believed the real reason he was denied the position was due to his union activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">A general belief that a particular agency official discriminates against a certain group is not sufficient to trigger a reasonable suspicion that a specific personnel action may be discriminatory. In <span class="Italic">Gadsden v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A05418 (2001), the Commission rejected an agency argument that because the complainant had stated in precomplaint documents that the selecting official had a "track record" of discriminating against black females, she had a reasonable suspicion that her own nonselection was discriminatory. The Commission found that initiation of counseling was timely because she contacted a counselor within 45 days of discussions she had with the selecting official and selectee that led her to believe the selectee was less qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">It would seem that agency officials are entitled to the assumption that they act in good faith and in accordance with the law. In <span class="Italic">Gavin v. Attorney General</span>, 01986485 (1999), the Commission found the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination when he made a FOIA request for information about those who received accelerated promotions. He only had a reasonable suspicion after he received the information. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gavin</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency states that appellant made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in January 1997 regarding the names of persons who received accelerated promotions. However, we do not find that a FOIA request necessarily reflects that an individual suspected or reasonably should have suspected discrimination at the time the FOIA request was made. Appellant argues that the FOIA request was "made with the reasonable expectation that management made decisions fairly and equally, and that, if asked, information would be provided to clarify the situation." Although appellant was obligated to contact an EEO Counselor within 45 days of when he should have reasonably suspected discrimination, he was not obligated to assume that every action taken by the agency that harmed him was motivated by discrimination. Appellant's actions in pursuing the instant matter were reasonable and well explained by appellant on appeal. The Commission finds that there is no persuasive evidence in the record showing that appellant should have reasonably suspected discrimination prior to March 7, 1997. Appellant's contact of an EEO Counselor on April 17, 1997, was less than 45 days after March 7, 1997, and was therefore timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the Commission has treated requests for information with a great deal of inconsistency under the reasonable suspicion standard. For example, it has held that when a complainant makes a FOIA request concerning the other applicants for a position, this indicates a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A10230 (2001), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant contends that she had no idea that she had been discriminated against until she had reviewed part of the requested applications on April 12, 2000. Then she determined that she had been discriminated against in four non-selections on the bases of race and sex. In response, the agency contends that based on the "reasonable suspicion" standard, the 45-day limitation is triggered when the complainant reasonably suspects discrimination but before all the facts have become apparent. The agency reasoned that the 45-day limitation period was triggered at the latest when complainant made her FOIA requests on January 27, 2000, because she would not have made the FOIA requests in the first place absent a suspicion of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held that an FOIA request concerning the qualifications and national origins of other applicants is in itself an indication that a complainant had a reasonable suspicion of the alleged discrimination<span class="Italic">. Bustos v. Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01781 (May 31, 2000). Thus, we agree with the agency's conclusion that complainant had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination when she made her FOIA requests on January 27, 2000.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_49"></span><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kazuko M. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120161095 (2016) (concluding that complainant had or should have had a reasonable suspicion where he was advised by an EEO Assistant to submit a FOIA request regarding the allegedly discriminatory nonselection, but didn't make counselor contact until after receiving the agency's FOIA response; presumably, complainant's discussion with an EEO Assistant suggested that he suspected discrimination before having made his FOIA request). On the other hand, in <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00083 (2001), the Commission found that a complainant's request that the agency provide a list of candidates and their qualifications did not indicate a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. The Commission in<span class="Italic"> Wagner</span> found that there was "no indication that the complainant knew or should have known the sex or age of the selectee" prior to the time he received the requested information from the agency. Therefore, his EEO contact within 45 days of receiving the information was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, a request for further information about a selection process was not deemed indicative of a reasonable suspicion of discrimination in <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A53129 (2005). The Commission in that case found that the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination at the time he requested further information about the cancelation of a vacancy announcement. The Commission determined that the complainant only developed a reasonable suspicion after he received the information and discovered the identity of the agency managers who had ordered cancelation of the announcement and his subsequent reassignment to the FBI.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McDowell v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01954446 (1996), the Commission found that the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination where her detail was abruptly ended and the supervisor characterized her behavior on detail as disruptive. It was not until the complainant discovered that the agency believed she had stolen government files and denied her access to the detail facility that she had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. Since she initiated counseling within 45 days of finding out the latter information, her contact with the counselor was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bognot v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01954083 (1996), the Commission found that the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion of age discrimination where he did not find out for a couple of months that his former duties were being performed by younger military personnel. The complainant was bumped by an employee with greater seniority during a RIF. The Commission found it was reasonable for the complainant to assume that his duties were being performed by that employee until he was informed to the contrary. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A53878 (2005), the Commission found that the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion that the termination of her detail was discriminatory where she did not find out for nine months that a similarly situated coworker's detail was not terminated and, as a result, would probably become a permanent assignment. However, in <span class="Italic">Honeycutt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972020 (1998), the Commission found the complainant did have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination, even though she did not discover who the agency selected until a couple of months after the selection. In <span class="Italic">Honeycutt</span>, the complainant alleged that, on the day of the interviews, she heard one applicant state that she already had the job, but the agency manager told the applicant that "some old people" still had to be interviewed. The Commission found that overhearing such a comment should have raised a reasonable suspicion of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the complainant waited two years, the time frame for contacting a counselor does not begin to run if the complainant truly could not have had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination sooner. In <span class="Italic">Wozniak v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955636 (1996), the Commission reversed an agency dismissal for failure to timely contact a counselor where the complainant waited two years before initiating counseling on a denial of advanced sick leave. On appeal, the complainant alleged that she only became aware of the alleged discrimination two years later when the agency granted advanced sick leave to a black employee. Further, the complainant maintained, and the agency did not dispute, that there had been no requests for advanced sick leave between her own and that of the black employee. Under these circumstances, the Commission found that the complainant should not have had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination until leave was granted to the black employee. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Harkins v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01975879 (1998), the appellant did not become aware that she was being forced into early disability retirement until she obtained her medical records some months after the agency notified her of its intent to remove her on expiration of her leave without pay status. The medical records contained a letter from her physician to the agency stating that appellant would be able to return to work in six to nine months following surgery. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Harkins</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that appellant contacted an EEO Counselor on December 17, 1996. Appellant argues that it was not until November 19, 1996, that she received the information that caused her to believe that she had been subjected to discrimination. According to appellant, she learned that the agency knew in June 1996, that she would be able to return to work 6-9 months after her July 1996 surgery. Appellant maintains that upon receiving this information, she realized that the agency told her she could either retire or be separated because it did not want to accommodate her upon her return to work. Although appellant was confronted with the option of either retiring or being separated in June 1996, we are not persuaded that appellant should have had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination prior to when she learned that the agency knew that she would able to return to work 6-9 months after her surgery. Therefore, appellant's contact of an EEO Counselor on December 17, 1996, was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972915 (1998), the Commission found that the complainant's EEO contact was untimely based on the fact that he could have had the conversation which led to his reasonable suspicion of discrimination sooner:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the appellant represents that he did not seek EEO counseling until April 3, 1996, because after the remark he relapsed. The appellant also represents that his use of crack cocaine then led to his arrest and incarceration in a detention center and a treatment facility from February 9, 1996 until April 22, 1996. The appellant further represents that he did not think about the Postmaster's remark as discriminatory until he discussed the matter with his father and learned that his father had discussed his head injury with the Postmaster just 4 days prior to the Postmaster's remark.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the entire record, the Commission concludes that the appellant has not presented adequate justification for tolling the 45-day time limitation for EEO counselor contact. The appellant could have chosen to discuss the remark with his father in November 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent">A personnel action not accompanied by an explanation may prevent a complainant from forming a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Postmaster General</span>, 05960558 (1996), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he previous decision erroneously found that appellant should have developed a reasonable suspicion that he had been discriminated against as of February 13, 1995, when he received a one line letter from the agency denying his reinstatement request. However, we find that this letter offered appellant an insufficient basis upon which to develop a reasonable suspicion of discriminatory motivation in that it offered absolutely no insight into the agency's reasons for the denial beyond a vague allusion to his "employment history." Nor did the agency's subsequent oblique reference to appellant's "work record" afford appellant sufficient information to trigger such a reasonable suspicion. We are not convinced that appellant's statement on appeal that he believed he had a good work record indicates that he should have developed a reasonable suspicion of discrimination when we consider the dearth of information he was offered on this early date. Under the circumstances of this case, we are persuaded that it was not until appellant was made aware that the agency had denied his reinstatement request based upon absences which he believed to be caused by his disabilities that he possessed sufficient facts upon which to develop a reasonable suspicion of discriminatory motivation. As soon as appellant was given adequate insight into the agency's reason for the denial of his request to link this denial in his mind to his alleged disabilities, he acted immediately to demonstrate a prudent regard for his rights in the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Manning v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962982 (1996), the Commission found that the complainant should not have suspected discrimination until three years after an agency restructuring. The Commission also noted that, even had the complainant suspected discrimination earlier, there was no evidence that EEO time limits were posted at the agency at the time of the restructuring, so contact would be timely anyway. A period of more than two years between a nonselection and the initiation of counseling did not render the complainant's contact untimely in <span class="Italic">Dennis v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120072346 (2007), where the complainant maintained that he did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination in his nonselection until a screening panel member told him that another panel member had made disparaging remarks about the complainant. See section on "<a href="0100-2023-11-027.html#sec2-28">Posting Requirements</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Lengthy delays are not inexcusable, <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span>. An employee who did not initiate precomplaint counseling until over a year after being denied a light-duty assignment was found to have initiated timely counseling where he demonstrated he had no reason to be aware of possible discrimination until a white employee was granted light duty in similar circumstances. <span class="Italic">Potts v. USPS</span>, 01832191 (1984). Employees who are terminated also may be excused from initiating counseling in a timely fashion when their complaints are prompted by subsequent events that indicate disparate treatment. The Commission acknowledges that it is more difficult for a former employee to learn of subsequent events. <span class="Italic">Murray v. USPS</span>, 01842049 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Meyer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971874 (1997), the Commission found that the agency erred when it determined that the complainant should have developed a reasonable suspicion of discrimination when comparative male employees with the same representative had their disciplinary actions resolved. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Meyer</span> credited the complainant's assertion that she was not informed that the cases of the comparatives were resolved, and that her case would not be, until a later date:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also found that appellant should have developed a reasonable suspicion when two male employees, who had the same representative as appellant, had their disciplinary actions resolved in <span id="Page_50"></span>February 1995, and when the third male employee had his disciplinary action resolved in April 1995. We are, however, persuaded by appellant's contention that she only developed a reasonable suspicion on August 7, 1995. Appellant argued that on that day, her representative informed her that the cases of the three male employees were resolved; that the representative was unsuccessful in obtaining a similar resolution for appellant; and that appellant should hire an attorney and pursue the EEO complaint process on this matter. While the agency contends that appellant's argument is not credible since appellant and her representative undoubtedly discussed the resolution of the cases of the male employees well prior to August 1995, no evidence has been presented to support this contention. Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss allegation 1 for failure to timely contact an EEO Counselor was improper and is REVERSED. Allegation 1 is REMANDED to the agency for further processing in accordance with this decision and applicable regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120150123 (2015) (complainant did not become aware that manager did not issue coworker a letter of warning for same conduct on the same day). However, "the discovery of [a] subsequent comparator, without more, is insufficient to conclude that Complainant did not reasonably suspect discrimination at an earlier date. Rather, the evidence of this comparator is simply further support for Complainant's claim." <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120111534 (2011). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Wes S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161214 (2017), expounded on what may constitute "more":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency found that the 45 day limitation period was triggered on the date of the alleged discriminatory action (denial of light duty work). Complainant argues that the 45 day limitation was triggered on the date he became aware that two of his white colleagues, who also requested short term light duty ("comparators") were treated significantly more favorably than he was in the same situation. Complainant alleges that this information, along with a prior EEO experience are what gave rise to reasonable suspicion of discrimination. Specifically, Complainant alleges that the instant complaint constitutes a "second offense" and he previously filed a formal complaint two years ago alleging a similar incident of discrimination on the basis of race. He further explains, and the Agency does not dispute, that the prior allegation was investigated, but no decision was issued as it was resolved when the parties entered a settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant complaint, we find Complainant provides "more" in the form of not one but two comparators, and his prior EEO experience. We find Complainant established that reasonable suspicion existed for him when he learned about his comparators. As that was within 45 days of Complainant's initial EEO contact, Complainant's complaint is timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Casual observation of employment conditions may not be sufficient to trigger the "reasonable suspicion" standard. In <span class="Italic">Butler v. Postmaster General</span>, 01913841 (1991), the employee was examined by a physician for pain in her left hand and the physician placed the complainant's hand and wrist in a brace for three weeks. Thereafter, the complainant was not allowed to return to work unless she provided a CA-17 form from her doctor. Several months later the employee filed a complaint alleging that a male worker, whose hand was put in a cast, was allowed to continue working without providing the CA-17 form. The Commission rejected the argument that the complainant was in a position to observe others who were allowed to work at the facility with similar injuries. The Commission found that the determining factor was not the complainant's ability to casually observe other injured workers who were allowed to continue on duty, but whether or not the complainant knew that those employees were allowed to continue on duty without submitting a CA-17 form. Since the complainant gave a credible explanation as to when she learned that those employees were not required to provide a CA-17 form, the Commission determined that the complaint was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">That an employee views a performance evaluation as unfair at the time it is issued does not mean he had a reasonable suspicion that the evaluation was discriminatory. <span class="Italic">McClary v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 01933890 (1994). The employee contended he did not suspect discrimination until he initiated EEO counseling on another issue and saw the notes of his second-line supervisor changing his initial evaluation and also realized that a second, similarly situated female, received a higher evaluation. The Commission found that the employee did not have a reasonable suspicion based on his opinion of the evaluation when it was issued, even though he was aware another female employee had received a higher evaluation. "Simply viewing an appraisal as unfair, however, is not the same as suspecting discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is entitled to presume that the agency programs and policies are legal. In <span class="Italic">Wieselquist v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01971509 (1998), the Commission rejected the agency's rather bizarre argument that the complainant should have had a reasonable suspicion based solely on the existence of an affirmative action plan and his nonselection:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision, the agency held that the appellant should have had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination based on his non-selection for certain management positions between the years 1983-1992 because of the enactment by the FAA of an Affirmative Action Plan (AAP), not approved by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in 1985. This holding presupposes that the appellant should have assumed that the mere existence of the AAP alone was cause to have reasonable suspicion that he had been discriminated against. Non-selection for a position combined with the existence of the AAP is not a basis for reasonable suspicion. It is just as reasonable for a person to assume that the hiring procedures of the agency are legal. The agency asserts the contrary; that because the AAP was in existence, the appellant should have assumed that it was being administered in an illegally discriminatory manner solely on the basis of his non-selection for certain management positions. Appellant claims that he only became suspicious when he read an article in the Washington Times titled Race, Sex Tilt Hiring of Inspectors, published on May 28, 1996. The appellant claims that the article served to tie together the separate parts of his experience and give him a reasonable suspicion that he had been discriminated against. The Commission finds that the appellant had a reasonable suspicion only after reading the aforementioned newspaper article. Accordingly, the final agency decision is hereby REVERSED.</p>
<p class="noindent">Comments that, on their face, suggest discrimination may not be sufficient to trigger the reasonable suspicion standard when they are not linked to any particular personnel action. For example, in <span class="Italic">Perez v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01966599 (1998), the selecting official had referred to the complainant as "old [and] sick." The Commission determined, however, that the complainant did not have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination in the filling of the position until he learned that GS-9 employees, such as himself, had been improperly excluded from applying for a promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although widespread knowledge of workplace practices may indicate that a complainant had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination earlier, there is no bright line rule. In <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120120236 (2012), the agency dismissed for untimely counselor contact an allegation by the complainant, a mail processing clerk, that it had violated the confidentiality provisions of the ADA by placing information his medical condition in an agency electronic database. The agency contended that the complainant should have known of the potential ADA violation because of a class action complaint brought by mailhandlers at the facility that had been settled two months earlier. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span>, reversed explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not persuaded by the Agency's assertion that since there was a class action case with Mailhandlers on the same issue that Complainant, a Clerk, should have suspected a violation with respect to his own medical information. Where as here, there is an issue of timeliness, "[a]n agency always bears the burden of obtaining sufficient information to support a reasoned determination as to timeliness." <span class="Italic">See Guy v. Dep't of Energy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930703 (Jan. 4, 1994) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920506 (Aug. 25, 1992). We find that the Agency has not met this burden.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found that the agency's argument that no violation could have occurred within 45 days of counselor contact because it had revamped the database several months before went to the merits of the complainant and not the issue of timeliness.</p>
