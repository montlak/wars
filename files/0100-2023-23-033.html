<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-34"><span class="space">6.</span> Mitigating Medications, Measures and Devices</h4>
<p class="noindent">As discussed above in the section on Substantial Limitation under the ADA, the Commission oriGINAlly took the position that whether a condition was substantially limiting was to evaluated without regard to mitigating measures, medications and devices. In <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> and <span class="Italic">Kirkingburg</span>, the Supreme Court rejected the Commission's regulatory interpretation of the ADA and held that the substantial limitation determination had to take into account mitigating measures, medications, devices and, in the case of <span class="Italic">Kirkingburg</span>, even mitigating techniques learned by the human body to ameliorate the effects of a physical or mental impairment. The immediate result was to severely curtail the number of individuals who were covered by the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent">While on its face the result of a case like <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> where the Supreme Court found no violation of the ADA when United Air Lines refused to hire two sisters with severe, but correctable, vision problems may not seem contrary to the oriGINAl intent of the ADA, the way it reached that result was. The Court held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue under the ADA because their corrected vision was no worse than the average person in the general population. Most of the flying public probably has little problem with an airline enforcing a standard that requires minimal uncorrected vision--a result the Court could have reached without holding that the plaintiffs were not covered by the ADA. For example, the Court could have held that it would have been an undue hardship for United to accommodate the plaintiffs because it would have posed a significant risk to public health and safety if either of the plaintiffs lost or broke their glasses during flight.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the way the Court reached its result in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> and <span class="Italic">Kirkingburg</span>, when applied to other cases, was directly contrary to congressional intent. Assume, for example, that the plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> had not applied to be global airline pilots but instead had applied for jobs as grocery store clerks. The store could refuse to hire the plaintiffs solely because of their vision problem and the plaintiffs would have no standing to sue the store because they were not individuals with disabilities based on their uncorrected vision. That result would be demanded by <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> even though imposing an uncorrected vision <span id="Page_1120"></span>standard on grocery store clerks would have no relationship to the actual duties of a grocery store clerk.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the rules of construction in the ADAAA, Congress specifically addressed the effects of mitigating measures, medications, devices and techniques. The ADAAA, at 42 USC 12102(4)(E), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures such as--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(I)&#x2003;medication, medical supplies, equipment, or appliances, low-vision devices (which do not include ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses), prosthetics including limbs and devices, hearing aids and cochlear implants or other implantable hearing devices, mobility devices, or oxygen therapy equipment and supplies;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(II)&#x2003;use of assistive technology;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(III)&#x2003;reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids or services; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(IV)&#x2003;learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(ii)&#x2003;The ameliorative effects of the mitigating measures of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(iii)&#x2003;As used in this subparagraph--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(I)&#x2003;the term 'ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses' means lenses that are intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(II)&#x2003;the term 'low-vision devices' means devices that magnify, enhance, or otherwise augment a visual image.</p>
<p class="noindent">In providing that only the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures should be disregarded in making substantial limitation determinations, Congress addressed one of the concerns expressed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>; namely, that if substantial limitations determinations had to be made without regard to the ameliorating effects of mitigating measures, then undesirable effects of such measures could not be taken into account. In <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, Justice O'Connor contended that the EEOC's regulation that conditions had to be assessed in their unmitigated state meant that things such as the negative side effects of medications also could not be taken into account and, in some cases, it could be the very side effects of the medication that were substantially limiting. No doubt that Justice O'Connor was correct in observing that the treatment of medical conditions can be debilitating even if the condition itself has not reached that stage. An easy example is that, given increased screening and early detection methods, several forms of cancer can be diagnosed before they become symptomatic or at least before the symptoms become substantially limiting. Of course what follows--chemotherapy or radiation therapy--can in itself be debilitating.</p>
<p class="noindent">In H.R. Rep. 110-730, Part I, at pp. 14-15, the House Committee on Education and Labor explained the reasoning behind the amendment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The bill prohibits consideration of the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures when determining whether an individual's impairment substantially limits major life activities. This restores Congress's oriGINAl intent and overturns the Supreme Court's decision in Sutton that the effect of mitigating measures should be considered. The Committee provides an illustrative list of measures whose use might reduce the impact of the limitations caused by an impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Mitigating measures include low vision devices, which are devices that magnify, enhance, or otherwise augment a visual image, such as magnifiers, closed circuit television, larger-print items, and instruments that provide voice instructions. Low vision devices do not include ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses, which are lenses that are intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error. The Committee provides an exception to the prohibition against the consideration of the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures by requiring consideration of the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Committee acknowledges that guaranteeing comprehensiveness in a finite list of mitigating measures is impossible, therefore the bill includes a non-exhaustive list of such measures. The Committee does not intend to convey a negative implication in the absence of any particular mitigating measure from the list. For example, other measures like the use of a job coach, personal assistant, service animal, surgical intervention, or compensatory strategy that might mitigate, or even allow an individual to otherwise avoid performing particular major life activities, should not be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Committee believes that an individual with an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity should not be penalized when seeking protection under the ADA simply because he or she managed their own adaptive strategies or received informal or undocumented accommodations that have the effect of lessening the deleterious impacts of their disability. The Committee supports the finding in <span class="Italic">Bartlett v. NYS Board of Law Examiners</span>, in which the court held that in determining whether the plaintiff was substantially limited with respect to reading, Bartlett's ability to 'self-accommodate' should not be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Committee expects that upon elimination of the consideration of ameliorative effects of a mitigating measure, individuals with serious health conditions who were improperly excluded from the ADA's protected class will be found to be substantially limited and entitled to protection from disability-based discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, examples that likely would be decided differently with regard to the threshold question of whether one qualifies as disabled once the effects of mitigating measures are not taken into account include several cases as described below. In <span class="Italic">McClure v. General Motors Corp.</span> the court decided an individual with muscular dystrophy who successfully learned to live and work with his disability was not qualified to protection under the ADA. In <span class="Italic">Orr v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc</span>. the court noted that the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> decision required consideration of the impact of the plaintiff's careful regimen of medicine, exercise, and diet and declining to consider the impact of uncontrolled diabetes on the plaintiff's ability to see, speak, read, and walk. In <span class="Italic">Todd v. Academy Corp.</span> the court found that, "without medication, Plaintiff would suffer daily seizures, including grand mal seizures which involve loss of consciousness, general thrashing, and tonoclonic activity," but concluded that the plaintiff was not disabled because medication reduced the frequency and intensity of these seizures. In <span class="Italic">Schriner v. Sysco Food Service</span> the court found that the plaintiff with diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder was not substantially limited in a major life activity when taking medication to manage his condition. In <span class="Italic">McMullin v. Ashcroft</span>, the court decided that "[v]iewing Plaintiff's impairment in light of the corrective measures of his medication, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to show that his depression" substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC had never interpreted its regulation to require that the negative effects of medication could not be considered in making a substantial limitation determination. Congress, in passing the ADAAA, quite simply determined that one result did not inexorably flow from the other. It limited its amendment to excluding consideration of the "ameliorative effects" of mitigating measures.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is also worth noting that Congress expressly included an exception for "ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses." Again, in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, Justice O'Connor had noted that if the ameliorating effects of mitigating devices, such as eyeglasses, were not taken into account in determining whether an individual had a substantial limitation, then individuals with relatively common vision impairments that are easily correctable would be included in ADA coverage. Under the ADAAA, these individuals are excluded. 42 USC 12102(4)(E)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent">In adopting its sixth rule of construction in the revised ADA regulations, at 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(1)(vi), the Commission states quite simply:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. However, the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considering in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one of its lengthier explanations of the new regulations, the Commission, in the appendix section that accompanies the regulation, addressed the Catch-22 under the previous interpretation of the ADA where individuals who had been discriminated against because of a disability did not qualify as an individual with a disability under the law. As a result, as noted above, they had no standing to challenge the discriminatory practice. The appendix section is also significant because in it the Commission explains that individuals who have not experienced substantially limiting symptoms from an impairment because of the early intervention of mitigating measures are covered under the ADA if the symptoms would have been substantially limiting without that early intervention.</p>
<p class="noindent">The appendix section that accompanies 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(1)(vi) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1630.2(j)(1)(vi) states: "The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. However, the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ameliorative effects of mitigating measures shall not be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Thus, "[w]ith the exception of ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses, impairments must be examined in their unmitigated state." <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This provision in the ADAAA and the EEOC's regulations "is intended to eliminate the catch-22 that exist[ed] * * * where individuals who are subjected to discrimination on the basis of their disabilities [we]re frequently unable to invoke the ADA's protections because they [we]re not considered people with disabilities when the effects of <span id="Page_1121"></span>their medication, medical supplies, behavioral adaptations, or other interventions [we]re considered." Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 2; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9 ("This provision is intended to eliminate the situation created under [prior] law in which impairments that are mitigated [did] not constitute disabilities but [were the basis for discrimination]."). To the extent cases pre-dating the 2008 Amendments Act reasoned otherwise, they are contrary to the law as amended. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 9 &#x0026; nn.25, 20-21 (citing, e.g., <span class="Italic">McClure v. General Motors Corp</span>., 75 F. App'x 983 (5th Cir. 2003) (court held that individual with muscular dystrophy who, with the mitigating measure of "adapting" how he performed manual tasks, had successfully learned to live and work with his disability was therefore not an individual with a disability); <span class="Italic">Orr v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</span>, 297 F.3d 720 (8th Cir. 2002) (court held that <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 527 U.S. 471 (1999), required consideration of the ameliorative effects of plaintiff's careful regimen of medicine, exercise and diet, and declined to consider impact of uncontrolled diabetes on plaintiff's ability to see, speak, read, and walk); <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. National Bd. of Med. Examiners</span>, 225 F.3d 620 (6th Cir. 2000) (where the court found that an individual with a diagnosed learning disability was not substantially limited after considering the impact of self-accommodations that allowed him to read and achieve academic success); <span class="Italic">McMullin v. Ashcroft</span>, 337 F. Supp.2d 1281 (D. Wyo. 2004) (individual fired because of clinical depression not protected because of the successful management of the condition with medication for fifteen years); <span class="Italic">Eckhaus v. Consol. Rail Corp.</span>, 2003 WL 23205042 (D.N.J. Dec. 24, 2003) (individual fired because of a hearing impairment was not protected because a hearing aid helped correct that impairment); <span class="Italic">Todd v. Academy Corp</span>., 57 F. Supp.2d 448, 452 (S.D. Tex. 1999) (court held that because medication reduced the frequency and intensity of plaintiff's seizures, he was not disabled)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual who, because of the use of a mitigating measure, has experienced no limitations, or only minor limitations, related to the impairment may still be an individual with a disability, where there is evidence that in the absence of an effective mitigating measure the individual's impairment would be substantially limiting. For example, someone who began taking medication for hypertension before experiencing substantial limitations related to the impairment would still be an individual with a disability if, without the medication, he or she would now be substantially limited in functions of the cardiovascular or circulatory system.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence showing that an impairment would be substantially limiting in the absence of the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures could include evidence of limitations that a person experienced prior to using a mitigating measure, evidence concerning the expected course of a particular disorder absent mitigating measures, or readily available and reliable information of other types. However, we expect that consistent with the Amendments Act's command (and the related rules of construction in the regulations) that the definition of disability "should not demand extensive analysis," covered entities and courts will in many instances be able to conclude that a substantial limitation has been shown without resort to such evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Amendments Act provides an "illustrative but non-comprehensive list of the types of mitigating measures that are not to be considered." <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9. Section 1630.2(j)(5) of the regulations includes all of those mitigating measures listed in the ADA Amendments Act's illustrative list of mitigating measures, including reasonable accommodations (as applied under title I) or "auxiliary aids or services" (as defined by 42 U.S.C. 12103(1) and applied under titles II and III).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since it would be impossible to guarantee comprehensiveness in a finite list, the list of examples of mitigating measures provided in the ADA and the regulations is non-exhaustive. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 20. The absence of any particular mitigating measure from the list in the regulations should not convey a negative implication as to whether the measure is a mitigating measure under the ADA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, the fact that mitigating measures include "reasonable accommodations" generally makes it unnecessary to mention specific kinds of accommodations. Nevertheless, the use of a service animal, job coach, or personal assistant on the job would certainly be considered types of mitigating measures, as would the use of any device that could be considered assistive technology, and whether individuals who use these measures have disabilities would be determined without reference to their ameliorative effects. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 20; 2008 House Educ. &#x0026; Labor Rep. at 15. Similarly, adaptive strategies that might mitigate, or even allow an individual to otherwise avoid performing particular major life activities, are mitigating measures and also would not be considered in determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether or not an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity is unaffected by whether the individual chooses to forgo mitigating measures. For individuals who do not use a mitigating measure (including for example medication or reasonable accommodation that could alleviate the effects of an impairment), the availability of such measures has no bearing on whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The limitations posed by the impairment on the individual and any negative (non-ameliorative) effects of mitigating measures used determine whether an impairment is substantially limiting. The origin of the impairment, whether its effects can be mitigated, and any ameliorative effects of mitigating measures in fact used may not be considered in determining if the impairment is substantially limiting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the use or non-use of mitigating measures, and any consequences thereof, including any ameliorative and non-ameliorative effects, may be relevant in determining whether the individual is qualified or poses a direct threat to safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA Amendments Act and the regulations state that "ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses" shall be considered in determining whether someone has a disability. This is an exception to the rule that the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures are not to be taken into account. "The rationale behind this exclusion is that the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses, without more, is not significant enough to warrant protection under the ADA." Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 2. Nevertheless, as discussed in greater detail below at &#x00A7; 1630.10(b), if an applicant or employee is faced with a qualification standard that requires uncorrected vision (as the plaintiffs in the Sutton case were), and the applicant or employee who is adversely affected by the standard brings a challenge under the ADA, an employer will be required to demonstrate that the qualification standard is job related and consistent with business necessity. 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADAAA and the EEOC's regulations both define the term "ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses" as lenses that are "intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error." So, if an individual with severe myopia uses eyeglasses or contact lenses that are intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error, they are ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses, and therefore any inquiry into whether such individual is substantially limited in seeing or reading would be based on how the individual sees or reads with the benefit of the eyeglasses or contact lenses. Likewise, if the only visual loss an individual experiences affects the ability to see well enough to read, and the individual's ordinary reading glasses are intended to completely correct for this visual loss, the ameliorative effects of using the reading glasses must be considered in determining whether the individual is substantially limited in seeing. Additionally, eyeglasses or contact lenses that are the wrong prescription or an outdated prescription may nevertheless be "ordinary" eyeglasses or contact lenses, if a proper prescription would fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the statute and the regulations distinguish "ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses" from "low vision devices," which function by magnifying, enhancing, or otherwise augmenting a visual image, and which are not considered when determining whether someone has a disability. The regulations do not establish a specific level of visual acuity (e.g., 20/20) as the basis for determining whether eyeglasses or contact lenses should be considered "ordinary" eyeglasses or contact lenses. Whether lenses fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error is best determined on a case-by-case basis, in light of current and objective medical evidence. Moreover, someone who uses ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses is not automatically considered to be outside the ADA's protection. Such an individual may demonstrate that, even with the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses, his vision is still substantially limited when compared to most people.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ADAAA also addresses another part of the rationale used in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> to determine that the EEOC's regulation was an incorrect interpretation of the ADA. The Court noted that although the EEOC had been given specific statutory authority to issue regulations under the employment provisions of the ADA, it had not been granted similar authority to issue regulations defining a disability. As a result, the Court determined that it was under no obligation to grant deference to the Commission's regulations defining a disability and disregarding the effects of mitigating measures. The ADAAA, at 42 USC 12205a, adds Section 506 to the ADA specifically authorizing the EEOC, along with the Attorney General and Secretary of Transportation who have other responsibilities under the Act, to issue regulations defining disability. Thus, the Supreme Court would be required to grant deference to the Commission's regulations defining disability in any subsequent challenge to its interpretation.</p>
