<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-155"><span class="space">g.</span> Poor Performance</h5>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to grant an employee the accommodation of teleworking where the employee's performance demonstrates an inability to work without close supervision. In <span class="Italic">Yeargins v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0320100021 (2010), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, petitioner indicated that he required work at home five days a week in order to return to work following his bout of pneumonia. Petitioner noted he could not come into the workplace due to his use of a supplemental oxygen tank. The Commission notes that although petitioner's use of the oxygen tank appeared to have been temporary, even at the hearing in April 2007, petitioner still required the small oxygen tank in order to leave the house.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2006, Petitioner filled out the request for a reasonable accommodation (working from home full-time) and provided medical documentation to support his request. The agency denied petitioner's request on July 11, 2006. The Director indicated that working from home was not an option for petitioner. The Director noted that petitioner had work performance deficiencies that prevented him from working independently. At the MSPB hearing, she testified that petitioner lacked the writing and analytical skills needed for his position. Further, the Director averred that petitioner also lacked the knowledge of civil rights laws in order to work from home independently. In addition, the agency provided a copy of petitioner's performance appraisal which noted that petitioner was rated "unacceptable" for the element of "written communication." Also, in the remaining four elements, petitioner was rated "marGINAlly successful." The comments made by the Director and the Supervisor regarding petitioner's rating supported the low evaluations. The Supervisor noted that petitioner's performance was poor with direct supervision; they could not allow him to work without direct supervision from home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner has not contested the agency's assessment of his performance. Therefore, based on a review of the record, we find that petitioner has not shown that working from home would have been an effective reasonable accommodation. Petitioner has not argued that there would have been any other accommodation that would have allowed him to return to work. Accordingly, we find that petitioner has not established that he is an otherwise qualified individual with a disability for purposes of coverage under the Rehabilitation Act. Therefore, we conclude that petitioner failed to show that the agency's removal action was based on disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Beitsch v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120093495 (2011), where the complainant exhibited performance problems while teleworking two days per week and the agency denied his request to telework five days per week. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Beitsch</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Complainant requested to work from home, initially for two days a week but also for five days a week. The Director indicated that Complainant was permitted to work from home two days per week in order to see if the accommodation was effective. The Director indicated that Complainant had performance issues that dated back to 2001. Further, he noted that Complainant was made aware of the deficiencies in his performance from face-to-face discussions, emails, and formal notification. The Director also informed Complainant that he must provide an action plan for the work he would perform while working from home and to keep the Deputy Director informed of his work progress. Despite the efforts by management to improve Complainant's work performance, the Director determined that Complainant's performance continued to be marGINAlly acceptable. Further, the Deputy Director stated that Complainant failed to produce evidence of work while teleworking. Based on Complainant's failure to improve his performance, the Director denied Complainant's request to work from home five days a week. Based on the evidence within the record including Complainant's performance appraisals, memorandum of notification of performance, and several emails from management officials to Complainant regarding his lack of ability to meet the needs of his position, we find that teleworking would not have been an effective accommodation. As such, we cannot find that the Agency's decision to deny telework was a violation of the Rehabilitation Act as alleged by Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Corazon P. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, DC-0752-20-0379-I-2 (MSPB 2021), an MSPB administrative judge rejected the petitioner's failure to reasonably accommodate claim where the agency allowed for telework on a temporary basis and the petitioner's performance suffered:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Petitioner's request for full-time telework, the Agency engaged Petitioner's physician to help the Agency reassess the appropriateness of telework as an accommodation. Petitioner remained on full-time telework during this process. Petitioner's physician informed the Agency's physician that full-time telework would allow Petitioner to be a productive employee because she reported that she had no issues at home. The Agency physician concluded that in his medical opinion that a person with such a severe reaction to alcohol and its products is unable to work in a government facility without being at severe risk to him/herself. He added that due to the "potential exposure the employee may get from the products listed above can never be fully mitigated and as such, I would find it unreasonable to accommodate an employee with such a medical condition in a government facility." However, the Agency ultimately determined that Petitioner could not be accommodated outside of the facility with full-time telework because of her performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In The Americans With Disabilities Act: Applying Performance and Conduct Standards to Employees with Disabilities, Question 7 (Jan. 20, 2011) (available at https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/performance-conduct.html), the Commission noted, "An employer may not withdraw a reasonable accommodation as punishment for the unsatisfactory performance rating. Simply withdrawing the telework arrangement or a modified schedule is no different than discontinuing an employee's use of a sign language interpreter or assistive technology as reasonable accommodations." Similarly, an employer may not withhold a reasonable <span id="Page_1422"></span>accommodation, such as telework, from an employee with a disability as a punishment. The Commission also noted that if an accommodation is not assisting an employee in improving his performance as intended, "the employer and employee may need to explore whether any changes would make the accommodation effective, whether an additional accommodation is needed, or whether the oriGINAl accommodation should be withdrawn and another should be substituted." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Where the accommodation appears ineffective, the employer and employee should reexamine the reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that it would not have been an effective accommodation to continue to provide Petitioner with full-time telework. Specifically, Agency officials testified that full-time telework was ineffective due to Petitioner frequently missing deadlines, failing to complete assignments, and requiring frequent and extensive technological support.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as the MSPB AJ noted, even granting full-time telework, Petitioner was required to report in-person from time to time because her essential functions included consulting with Contracting Officers, serving as a procurement advisor, attendance at in-person training courses, traveling to field and contractor facilities, and obtaining DAWIA certification which required classroom attendance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency subsequently considered reassigning Complainant to a vacant position. In general, reassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort and should be considered only when: (1) there are no effective accommodations that would enable an employee to perform the essential functions of his or her current position; or (2) accommodating the employee in the current position would cause an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n); Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation, "Reassignment." An agency should reassign the employee to a vacant position that is equivalent in terms of pay, status, and other related factors. If there are no vacant equivalent positions, then the agency should reassign the employee to a lower-level position that is closest to the current position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner has not identified any vacant, funded position that she could have performed with or without reasonable accommodation. In litigation, an employee seeking reassignment as a reasonable accommodation generally must make a facial showing that there existed a vacant, funded position whose essential functions the employee could perform. <span class="Italic">See Hampton v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (Aug. 1, 2002) (complainant can establish that vacant, funded positions existed by producing evidence of particular vacancies or by showing that s/he was qualified to perform a job or jobs that existed at the agency and there were trends or patterns of turnover in the relevant jobs so as to make a vacancy likely during the time period); compare with <span class="Italic">Bill A. v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131989 (Oct. 26, 2016) (during investigative stage of federal administrative process, agency has obligation to develop adequate investigative record and obtain information about availability of vacant, funded positions). Accordingly, Petitioner has not shown that she could have performed the essential functions of the position held or desired with or without reasonable accommodation. Therefore, we concur with the MSPB AJ that the Agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act regarding her claim of denial of a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Telework may be discontinued where it is the result of a settlement agreement and the employee's work performance becomes inadequate. In <span class="Italic">Wes L. v. Secretary of the Interior</span>, 0120142725 (2016), the agency and the complainant entered into a settlement agreement that, among other things, allowed the complainant to telework. The agreement conditioned that the agency could discontinue the complainant's telework if his presence in the office ever became necessary. When his performance began to fail, the agency determined that he was no longer eligible for telework and his presence in the office was necessary for "direct supervision" until his performance improved to a satisfactory level. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Wes L</span>., rejected the agency's argument that agency policy concerning telework can supersede an agreement provision regarding same, but ultimately determined that the agency was not in breach of the agreement by requiring the complainant to return to work in the office full time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also are not persuaded by the Agency's argument that it need not comply with the Agreement's telework requirement based on the Agency's policy that disallowed telework for those with less than a successful evaluation. Term 8 permitted telework subject only to one condition. Further, the parties agreed at Term 18 that the Agreement contains the complete understanding of the parties and that there were no other governing terms, express or implied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Agreement provided Complainant with a conditional right to telework. The Agreement expressly permitted telework to stop if the Agency determined that Complainant's presence in the office was necessary. Because the Agency determined that, as of March 28, 2013, Complainant's presence in the office was deemed "necessary," the Agency's termination of the telework agreement did not constitute a breach because the determination was not at odds with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Further, the record shows that Complainant had been counseled as to his work performance prior to the termination of the telework arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, we find that Complainant failed to establish that the Agency breached the Agreement with regard to the telework provision (Term 8 of the Agreement) as of the date of the breach allegation.</p>
