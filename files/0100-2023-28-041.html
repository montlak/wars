<p class="noindent">As in all other aspects of discrimination complaints, informal resolution is encouraged. After development of the record, the administrative judge is responsible for seeing that both parties are provided copies of all materials regarding the complaint, and for providing the class agent with an opportunity to meet with the agency representative to discuss informal resolution. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.204(g):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;The administrative judge shall furnish the agent and the representative of the agency a copy of all materials obtained concerning the complaint and provide opportunity for the agent to discuss materials with the agency representative and attempt resolution of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;The complaint may be resolved by agreement of the agency and the agent at any time pursuant to the notice and approval procedure contained in paragraph (g)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;If the complaint is resolved, the terms of the resolution shall be reduced to writing and signed by the agent and the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;Notice of the resolution shall be given to all class members in the same manner as notification of the acceptance of the class complaint and to the administrative judge. It shall state the relief, if any, to be granted by the agency and the name and address of the EEOC administrative judge assigned to the case. It shall state that within 30 days of the date of the notice of resolution, any member of the class may petition the administrative judge to vacate the resolution because it benefits only the class agent, or is otherwise not fair, adequate and reasonable to the class as a whole. The administrative judge shall review the notice of resolution and consider any petitions to vacate filed. If the administrative judge finds that the proposed resolution is not fair, adequate and reasonable to the class as a whole, the administrative judge shall issue a decision vacating the agreement and may replace the original class agent with a petitioner or some other class member who is eligible to be the class agent during further processing of the class complaint. The decision shall inform the former class agent or the petitioner of the right to appeal the decision to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and include EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition. If the administrative judge finds that the resolution is fair, adequate and reasonable to the class as a whole, the resolution shall bind all members of the class.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> MD-110 at 8-10 to 8-11.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge may vacate any resolution that "benefits only the class agent, or is otherwise not fair, adequate, and reasonable to the class as a whole." 29 CFR 1614.204(g)(4). Under the previous version of 1614.204(g) (1992), the benchmark was that the settlement be "fair and reasonable." Although the language for reviewing settlements has changed somewhat from the original version of Part 1614, the standard is essentially the same. The main change is the elimination of the agency's role in petitions to vacate settlements. Such petitions are now filed directly with the administrative judge, and the judge issues a binding decision with appeal rights to both parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once agreement is reached, notice of the resolution and its terms must be given to all class members in the same manner as notification of acceptance of the complaint. Any member of the class who believes the settlement is not fair and reasonable must notify the agency EEO director, in writing, within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the resolution and its terms, and request that the settlement be vacated and that the petitioner replace the class agent. The petition is forwarded to the administrative judge, who will issue a decision on the petition. A decision to accept a petition vacates any settlement. Both the class agent and the petitioner have the right to appeal the administrative judge's determination on the legality of settlement to the EEOC. 29 CFR 1614.204(g)(4). If a petition to vacate the settlement is not filed within the 30-day period, the settlement becomes binding on the agency, the class agent, and all class members.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Branch v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01902620 (1990), the Commission explained, in detail, the process and standards for reviewing settlement agreements in class actions. Although the <span class="Italic">Branch</span> case was decided under Part 1613, the provisions with respect to settlement are virtually identical in Part 1614:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 CFR 1613.609 of EEOC regulations provides for the AJ to afford the parties an opportunity to discuss the materials produced through discovery and attempt resolution of the complaint. If a settlement is reached, the class is given appropriate notification. In cases where a settlement only benefits the class agent or is otherwise alleged to be unfair or unreasonable, any class member may, within 30 days of notification, petition the agency's Director of Equal Employment Opportunity to replace the class agent. Such a petition would be processed according to 29 CFR 1613.604, and if the AJ finds that the fair and reasonable standard was violated, the AJ would recommend the petitioner replace the original class agent and act as the class agent for the rest of the process. Granting such a petition vacates the settlement between the agency and the former class agent. The agency's decision on such a petition can be appealed to the Office of Review and Appeals by the petitioner or former class agent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fair and reasonable standard operates as a check on unfair settlements, in somewhat the same manner as the provision in Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure operates for civil actions. Rule 23(e) requires court approval for any settlement once a case has been certified as a class action. In considering whether a settlement should be approved under Rule 23(e), the issue is whether the settlement is fair and reasonable. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Moore v. City of San Jose</span>, 615 F.2d 1265 (9th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Stewards and Stewardesses Ass'n v. American Airlines</span>, 573 F.2d 960 (7th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation</span>, 648 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Cotton v. Hinton</span>, 559 F.2d 1326 (5th Cir. 1977). Thus Rule 23(e) precedents should be applied in considering the fairness and reasonableness of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Anderson</span>, 667 F.2d 1204 (5th Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 459 U.S. 828 (1982). In determining the adequacy and reasonableness of the proposed settlement, we will not adjudicate the dispute because the very purpose of compromise is to reduce the litigation expense. <span class="Italic">Young v. Katz</span>, 447 F.2d 431, 433 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court identified six factors which should be considered in determining whether a settlement agreement is fair and reasonable. They were 1) whether the settlement was a product of fraud or collusion; 2) the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; 3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; 4) the factual and legal obstacles [to] prevailing on the merits; 5) the possible range of recovery and the certainty of damages; and 6) the respective opinions of the participants, including class counsel, class representative, and the absent class members. <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, 667 F.2d at 1209....</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Branch</span>, the Commission reviewed a settlement that provided relief only to the class agent and eight named members of the class. The <span class="Italic">Branch</span> analysis, though tied to the specific complaint and settlement agreement, is useful in terms of demonstrating how the six criteria outlined above are applied:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Evidence of Fraud or Collusion</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The settlement agreement was reached after negotiation between the agency and the class representative. Each party to the agreement acknowledged that concessions were made by both parties. Since appellant presented no evidence that the agreement was reached as the result of fraud or collusion, we find that the settlement agreement was not the product of fraud or collusion. Courts have enunciated that in the absence of fraud or collusion the most important factor is the probability of the success on the merits. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Flinn v. FMC Corp.</span>, 528 F.2d 1169 (4th Cir. 1975) <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 424 U.S. 967 (1976); <span class="Italic">Grunin v. International House of Pancakes</span>, 513 F.2d 114 (8th Cir. 1975); <span class="Italic">City of Detroit v. Grinnel Corp.</span>, 495 F.2d 448, 455 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Complexity, Expense, and Likely Duration of Litigation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the testimony of the class agent and class representative, the expense of continued litigation seems to be the major reason for the settlement. The class representative estimates it would cost approximately $25,000 to pursue this matter over several years. His estimation is not based on estimates obtained from any expert witnesses who would be used in the presentation of statistical evidence. Appellant's attorney submitted that his firm would absorb the cost of litigation without current payment from members of the class. He agreed with the class representative's estimation of the cost of continued litigation but believed it represented the high end. Actual preparation was estimated at 100 hours. The class had no subclass and the issue is well defined. The actual number of members was not provided but membership was estimated between 60 and 100 members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Stage of the Proceedings and Amount of Discovery Completed</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">There has only been one exchange of documents to date. By the class representative's own admission he has not reviewed the data provided to date. After a thorough review of the information provided, it may prompt the need for additional information. The AJ concluded that discovery is not at a stage that a hearing on the merits could be set within the next sixty days. As a result of the lack of informed discovery it is difficult to determine the likelihood of success on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Factual and Legal Obstacles Prevailing on the Merits</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to assess this factor, a comparison should be made between the terms of the settlement agreement with the likely rewards should the class prevail on every issue. <span class="Italic">Cotton</span>, 559 F.2d at 1330. In this instance, two expert witnesses were presented. After each had analyzed the information related to the promotions both had findings which were directly antithetical to one another. Both experts were testifying to preliminary unwritten conclusions but both maintained that neither believed their respective interpretation of the data would change. The AJ found that both experts were credible and the class might be able to establish a statistical disparity should its expert's opinion be deemed more convincing than the opinion of the agency's expert. Appellant nor the agency were able to identify why the interpretation of the other expert witness was not reliable. The only remaining source from which to infer the strength of the class complaint is from the opinion of counsel. <span id="Page_1644"></span>The class representative does not believe the class has a good chance of prevailing on the merits. Appellant's counsel stated that evidence in the case raises questions that warrant pursuit through litigation, the cost for which his firm is willing to absorb without current payment from class members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Possible Range of Recovery and the Certainty of Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court has stated that "if the settlement offer was grossly inadequate...it can be inadequate only in light of the strength of the case presented by the plaintiffs...The fact that a proposed settlement may only amount to a fraction of the potential recovery does not, in and of itself, mean that the proposed settlement is grossly inadequate and should be disapproved. <span class="Italic">City of Detroit</span>, 495 F.2d at 448. Depending on whether the class is successful on the merits, the recovery can range from zero to full relief. There is no evidence in that record of what would constitute full relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If each member could show he or she was denied a promotion because of a proven discriminatory policy or practice, full relief might consist of retroactive promotion with backpay differential. The record does not establish if each member of the class applied for a promotion during the time period in question or whether he or she was qualified. The AJ found and we agree that there was little evidence of potential damages and any high figure would be speculative. The AJ proceeded to take the average cash award under the proposed settlement agreement ($1,989.37) and multiply it by the number of members in the class (100) and come up with a figure of $198,937.00. Attorneys fees and costs would have to be added to this amount. It is unlikely that every member would be entitled to relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding injunctive relief, the AJ correctly noted that "it is difficult to ascertain the extent of relief which could be ordered in the event discrimination were proved because we do not know which employment practices, if any, might be the source of discrimination." The settlement agreement offers the candidate more information, than they customarily received, about how they fared in the selection process. The agreement also holds the selecting official to a higher degree of accountability and further provides for a representative number of blacks to serve as subject matter experts on the selection panels.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Respective Opinions of the Participants</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The number of those objecting to the settlement and the substance of their objections should also be considered. Numbers alone are not controlling, as an agreement can be fair even though a number of class members may oppose it. <span class="Italic">Salinas v. Roadway Express, Inc.</span>, 802 F.2d 787, 790 (5th Cir. 1986) <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 479 U.S. 1103 (1987); <span class="Italic">Cotton</span>, 559 F.2d at 1331; <span class="Italic">Bryan v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.</span>, 494 F.2d 799, 803 (3rd Cir. 1974). Eight members testified at the fairness hearing. Their basic sentiment was that only the class agent is to receive a promotion, only eight class members are to receive back pay, the representation provided to the class was allegedly inadequate, their individual claims were not considered, and the proposed injunctive relief does not go far enough to correct past injustice. The AJ found, and we agree, that the efforts of the representative were inadequate with regard to his communication with class members but not as it relates to the prosecution of the class complaint. Without payment from the class, the class representative or his firm is unwilling to commit the necessary resources to pursue this matter on behalf of the class.</p>
<p class="noindent">Based on its review of the agreement, the Commission found it was fair and reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), the court is required to approve any settlement agreements reached in class actions. The settlement must be fair, adequate, reasonable, and not the product of collusion. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Albright</span>, 139 F.3d 227 (D.C. Cir. 1998). It is not an abuse of discretion for the court to approve a settlement agreement even when a significant number of the class members, including the named plaintiffs, object to the settlement, as long as the agreement is fair, adequate, and reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A challenge to the fairness of a class settlement by a complainant must be specific and not simply express general dissatisfaction of the amount received by the complainant. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141801 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, and based upon the findings articulately and persuasively set forth in her Final Order, we conclude that the AJ did not abuse her discretion when she concluded that the settlement agreement was fair, adequate and reasonable to the class as a whole. The AJ properly concluded that the terms of the settlement were based on appropriate factors, including: the total class size of 40,898 and the likely response rate for claims of relief; the length of the proceedings and the interest in finality; the likelihood of success on the merits due to the complexity of the issues; and the good faith, arms-length settlement negotiations. While Complainant may believe that her proportional share under the agreement is inadequate, she makes no persuasive argument that the compromises reached in this resolution were not reasonable and fair to the class as a whole. We conclude that Complainant's claim is not sufficient to reject the overall fairness of the settlement. <span class="Italic">See McCormick v. United States Postal Service</span>, Appeal No. 0120081844 (July 1, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agency settles a class complaint prior to certification of the class, it is not required to give notice of the settlement to potential class members. In <span class="Italic">Jimerson v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01954746 (1996), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.605(a) provided that after acceptance of a class complaint, the agency, within fifteen calendar days, shall have used all reasonable means to notify all class members of the existence of the class complaint. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.613 required an agency to inform class members of its disposition of a class complaint within ten days of its transmittal of a notice of disposition to a class agent. EEOC regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.604(j) provided that an Administrative Judge's recommendation to the agency on whether to accept, reject or cancel a class complaint shall have become the agency decision unless the agency rejected or modified the decision within thirty calendar days of receipt of the decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant alleged in allegation 3 that the agency improperly failed to notify her of the right to file an individual discrimination complaint, pursuant to the Wes Motley class complaint. The agency dismissed this allegation for failure to state a claim, finding that the Wes Motley class complaint had been settled before it was certified as a class and, therefore, before it had to provide the notice required under Section 1613.605(a). The agency contends that the AJ's recommended decision was received on August 16, 1990; that the settlement of the class complaint was effective September 14, 1990; that the settlement agreement was effective within thirty days of the date of the agency's receipt of the AJ's recommended decision; and that the agency was therefore under no obligation to notify appellant of the disposition of the class complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Class Agent entered into a settlement agreement effective September 14, 1990, according to the terms of the agreement itself, twenty-nine days after the agency's receipt of the AJ's recommended decision. We therefore find that the agency was not under an obligation to provide appellant with notice regarding the disposition of the class complaint under EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.605(a), since at the time the settlement became effective no class had been certified. Appellant has not sustained a personal harm with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a). Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss allegation 3 is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that some members of the class object to the specific monetary relief they receive under a class action settlement does not render the entire agreement unfair to the class as a whole. In <span class="Italic">McCormack v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120081844 (2008), the Commission rejected an individual challenge to a class action settlement agreement in class action entitled <span class="Italic">Glover v. Postmaster General</span>, alleging that individuals with disabilities in permanent rehabilitation positions were denied advancement opportunities. The class settlement provided for $61 million to be distributed to class agents, members, and their attorneys. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">McCormack</span>, found that its review of the acceptance of an administrative judge of a class action settlement should be conducted under an abuse of discretion standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With the global settlement agreement, the parties agreed to a total settlement of $61,000,000.00. Notice at 4. Each class agent is to receive $85,000. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> $53,665,767.00 is to be distributed to the eligible class members, with $250,000.00 reserved in case of calculation errors.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The remaining money is to cover attorney's costs and litigation fees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The global settlement agreement also provides for any unclaimed funds to be split evenly between the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund and the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine the relief given to each class member, the agency hired a statistical consultant and reviewed all claims and personnel files. Notice at 5. The type of claim made by each class member was determined by the classification given by the class member on Claim Form 1, which had been distributed with notice of the initial settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> For advancement claims, it was assumed that advancement was denied to the class member in his or her first year of rehabilitation status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the class member was in a craft job, a figure from the back-pay "grid" from the initial settlement agreement was used, but if the class member was in a non-craft or non-grid craft job, the average raises of persons from the same grade held by the class member were compared with the class member's actual earnings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The class member's settlement share was increased by 25% if the class member had applied for a promotion but had not received it and was decreased by 50% if the class member had received a promotion while on rehabilitation status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the class member submitted multiple advancement claims, the claim which would have yielded the largest award was used. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> For all other claims, the value of the claim from the initial settlement agreement was used. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties provided notice to all potential class members, and allowed the potential class members to file objections to the global settlement agreement within 30 days. Originally, 107 objections were filed. On February 14, 2008, the Administrative Judge approved the global settlement agreement. Decision at 1. The Administrative Judge noted <span id="Page_1645"></span>that the fairness of settlements is generally analyzed in federal civil claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 23(e). Decision at 4. Although this rule does not technically apply to EEOC administrative proceedings, the Commission has held that the standards enunciated in FRCP 23(e) should be followed. <span class="Italic">See Modlin v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A24054 (February 20, 2003). In determining the fairness of the settlement under Rule 23, the Administrative Judge considered the following factors: 1) whether the proposed settlement was fairly and honestly negotiated; 2) whether serious questions of law and fact exist, placing the ultimate outcome of the litigation in doubt; 3) whether the value of an immediate recovery outweighs the mere possibility of future relief after protracted and expensive litigation; and 4) the judgment of the parties and their counsel that the settlement is fair and reasonable. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Nuclear Pharmacy, Inc.,</span> 741 F.2d 322, 324 (10th Cir. 1984). Additional factors which may be relevant include: (1) the risk of establishing damages; (2) the extent of discovery and the current posture of the lease; (3) the range of possible settlement; and (4) the reaction of class members to the proposed settlement. <span class="Italic">In Re New Mexico Natural Gas Antitrust Litigation,</span> 607 F. Supp. 1491 at 1504 (D. Colo.); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Hiram Walker &#x0026; Sons,</span> 768 F.2d 884 at 889 (7th Cir.). The Administrative Judge concluded that, considering the relevant factors, the settlement was fair and reasonable. Decision at 17. The Administrative Judge also found that there was no evidence the agreement was the product of fraud, collusion or overreaching. Decision at 7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We review an Administrative Judge's decision to approve a class action settlement under an abuse of discretion standard. <span class="Italic">See Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp.,</span> 150 F.3d 1011, 1026 (9th Cir. 1998). In adopting the abuse of discretion standard for reviewing an Administrative Judge's approval of a resolution under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.204, we recognize "that the decision to approve or reject a settlement is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge because he is exposed to the litigants, and their strategies, positions and proof." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, we consider whether the Administrative Judge abused his discretion when he determined that the settlement is "fair, adequate and reasonable to the class as a whole." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.204(g)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Claimant objects to the amount of money he is to receive under the settlement. The agency contends that the settlement shares given to all class members are fair, reasonable and adequate, and that the settlement should not be rejected merely because individual class members complain that they would have received more had they prevailed after a trial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Claimant fails to provide a compelling reason why the compromises reached in the settlement are not reasonable. While claimant may correctly argue that he has suffered a loss that is greater in value than the settlement share he is to receive, we recognize that the parties in making the settlement, and the Administrative Judge in approving it, considered the rights and relief of all eligible class members. That one class Member does not agree with his settlement share is not sufficient to reject the entire settlement as not fair, adequate or reasonable. It is certainly understandable that complainant wishes the agency to right what he believes a grave wrongdoing, but we are not persuaded that the amount of complainant's relief makes the entire settlement not fair, reasonable and adequate. We urge complainant to recognize that settlement necessitates compromise. Moreover, we note the injunctive relief and nationwide policy changes that will aid in achieving complainant's desires that the wrongs he may have suffered do not continue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, in his 2004 Order, the Administrative Judge concluded that objections concerning proposed monetary compensation were without merit. In reaching this conclusion, the Administrative Judge noted that the objectors, who represented .3 % of the potential class members, failed to appreciate: (1) the amount of money that thousands of others might be eligible to recover; (2) the potential for a decision in the agency's favor; (3) the retirement pay enhancement that might be available to some employees; and (4) the fact that the agreement also provides injunctive relief and nationwide changes to policies and procedures. Order at &#x00A7; IX at A. The Administrative Judge concluded that the reasonableness of the monetary settlement was supported by the additional non-monetary provisions of the settlement and that the monetary relief was not so "grossly inadequate" that it should be disapproved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Settlement agreements in class actions are directly enforceable. Alternatively, at the option of the class agent, reinstatement of the complaint may be requested. The class agent must notify the agency EEO director of any alleged breach within 30 days of the incident giving rise to the allegation. If the agency has not resolved the dispute within 30 days, the agent then may seek a determination on compliance from the EEOC. 29 CFR 1614.504(a).</p>
