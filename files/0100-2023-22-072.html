<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-72"><span class="space">E.</span> LANGUAGE FLUENCY</h3>
<p class="noindent">A requirement that employees be fluent in the English language is not <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> discriminatory, but must be scrutinized carefully to determine that such a requirement is significantly job-related, or that the person does not possess sufficient skill in the English language to function effectively in the position sought. <span class="Italic">Kim v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01832711 (1984). Fluency requirements have been upheld in positions requiring a large degree of public contact where it is essential that the employee be understood, such as by applicants for benefits. Under 29 CFR 1606.6(b), the Commission does not consider language fluency requirements to be an exception to the bottom line rule. In practice, though, the Commission does extend a more intensive level of review to such requirements because of their tendency to discriminate against foreign-born or foreign-educated employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Legitimate problems with language fluency also can occur in positions where the employee is required to have technical communication skills and an accent interferes with technical communication. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Park v. Department of Treasury</span>, 01862854 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "National Origin Discrimination," at pp. 10-12 sets forth some basic guidance on discrimination based on accent and language fluency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Title VII, distinctions based on accent are permissible <span class="Italic">only</span> when accent "interferes materially with job performance." The question for employers to ask themselves, therefore, is whether an individual's accent makes it substantially more difficult for him or her to perform the job duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A basic problem is that discrimination based on accent can be a "cover" for more overt discrimination based on national origin. As one court said, "it would be an easy refuge for an employer unlawfully discriminating based on national origin to state falsely that it was not the person's national origin that caused the problem but her inability to measure up to the communications skills required by the job."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;Furthermore, an employer can be liable even if it genuinely believes that accent poses a problem for adequate performance of a job, if the employer is mistaken and is requiring an unduly high ability to communicate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">So employers should ask themselves two questions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;Does the ability to communicate materially relate to the ability to perform the job?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;Does the individual's accent interfere with that necessary ability to communicate?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the answer to either question is no, and the employer has denied employment opportunities based on a person s accent, then the employer will be liable for national origin discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examples of jobs in which the ability to communicate in English has been found essential:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;Job requiring extensive contact with clients</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, the job of hotel desk clerk requires extensive contact with hotel guests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;Managerial job requiring clear communication of job requirements or standards to subordinates</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, the job of foreman at a construction site requires extensive communication with construction workers and other project managers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;Job requiring frequent response to emergency situations in which quick and succinct communication is necessary</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, hospital staff must deal with emergencies and often must be able to quickly and effectively communicate what is wrong with a patient or what needs to be done by other members of the staff.</p>
<p class="noindent">"An inference of discrimination based on national origin can be drawn when language ability is the reason for an adverse employment action." <span class="Italic">Kim v. USPS</span>, 01871975 (1987). In that case, the Commission found that the proffered reasons for the complainant's termination--his inability to understand English--were pretext for national origin discrimination where one of appellant's supervisors spoke with a heavy accent and could be difficult to understand and the complainant's coworker used a lot of slang.</p>
<p class="noindent">Section V, B of the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination</span> further elaborates on fluency requirements:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Generally, an English fluency or English proficiency requirement is permissible only if required for the effective performance of the position for which it is imposed. An individual's lack of fluency in English may interfere with job performance in some circumstances, but not in others. For example, an individual may be sufficiently proficient in English to qualify as a research assistant but, at that point in time, may lack the fluency to qualify as a senior scientific writer who must communicate complex scientific information in English.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the degree of fluency that may be lawfully required varies from one position to the next, employers are advised to assess the level of fluency required for a job on a case-by-case basis. Applying uniform fluency requirements to a broad range of dissimilar positions or requiring a greater degree of fluency than is necessary for a position may result in a violation of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 25</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No National Origin Discrimination Involving English Fluency</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Jorge, a Dominican national, applies for a sales position with XYZ Appliances, a small retailer of home appliances in an overwhelmingly English-speaking, non-bilingual community. Jorge has very limited skill with spoken English. XYZ notifies him that he is not qualified for a sales position because his ability to effectively assist customers who only speak English is limited. Under these circumstances, XYZ's decision to exclude Jorge from the sales position does not violate Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 26</p>
<p class="noindent-2">National Origin Discrimination Involving English Fluency</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Ender, whose first language is Turkish, works at Hotel's Registration and Concierge Desk. Hotel serves a largely English-speaking clientele. At the Concierge Desk, Ender provides local directions to restaurants, museums, theaters, and other destinations and otherwise helps guests plan their visits.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A guest complains that Ender gave him directions to a business appointment "in broken English." The guest, who was late for the appointment, demands that Hotel management remove Ender from the Concierge Desk. Two supervisors observe Ender at work. They conclude that he speaks English quickly, clearly, and precisely, albeit with a Turkish accent. They also find Ender's local directions to be accurate. The supervisors recommend against taking action against Ender. However, upper management decides to terminate Ender's employment and replace him with a native English speaker, because the guest who complained works for a company that is an established client of Hotel.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under these circumstances, there is reasonable cause to believe that Hotel's decision to terminate Ender was motivated by his national origin and violates Title VII. The Hotel's supervisors specifically found that Ender's accent did not affect his ability to communicate information accurately, and he was terminated to appease the preferences of an unhappy client. Where client preference is based on a protected basis such as national origin, the employment decision violates Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Fluency in Languages Other Than English</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With American society growing more diverse, employers have increasingly required some employees to be fluent in languages other than English. As with English fluency requirements, requiring fluency in a language other than English is only permissible if it is required for the effective performance of the position for which it is imposed. For example, a business that provides services to numerous Spanish-speaking customers may have a sound business reason for requiring that some of its employees speak Spanish.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A business with a diverse clientele may assign work based on an employee's ability to speak a language other than English. For example, an employer may assign bilingual Spanish-speaking employees to provide services to customers who speak Spanish, while assigning employees who only speak English to provide services to English-speaking customers. Additionally, employers are not required by Title VII to provide additional compensation for work that is performed in a language other than English, provided the employers do not require employees to work extra hours without compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 27</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Bilingual Job Requirement Not Discriminatory</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Andy, who is only fluent in English, applies for a custodial supervisor position with a school district in Texas. The job description states that a preferred qualification is that candidates speak fluently in Spanish and English in order to communicate effectively with the custodial staff, many of whom speak only English or only Spanish. <span id="Page_1031"></span>During Andy's job interview with a school district representative, Andy acknowledges that he does not speak Spanish. The school district does not hire Andy because he is not fluent in Spanish and English. Instead, the school district promotes Anne, a Hispanic woman who was employed as a custodial foreman for the school district, to the custodial supervisor position. Anne is fluent in both English and Spanish. The school district representative suggests to Andy that he should apply for a different custodial position that does not require fluency in Spanish. Under these circumstances, the school district's preference for a bilingual supervisory employee would not support a Title VII discrimination claim based on race or national origin by the non-bilingual applicant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Tsai v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span>, 0120035347 (2007), the Commission found that the complainant failed to demonstrate national origin discrimination where oral communication became an increasingly important element of her work over time and she produced no evidence to rebut the agency's contentions that her communications skills were weak and that she was not cooperative. Although the Commission found the record somewhat lacking in <span class="Italic">Tsai</span>, it found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that other factors appear to have affected complainant's communications with co-workers in the workplace. For example, following a 1998 counseling session regarding her refusal to perform a task, complainant refused to face her supervisor whenever he tried to provide her with instructions related to the performance of tasks, and she refused to communicate orally with him. Complainant thereafter "neither responded nor g[ave] any acknowledgment of understanding" the instructions. Moreover, complainant refused to communicate with co-workers over the telephone to resolve even minor problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that because most of the input functions had been transferred to the Dallas facility, and staff was limited in the Northeast Business Center, complainant's ability and willingness to communicate with the clients and staff became increasingly important. Indeed, the record reflects that "complainant's lack of communication with other members of the Business Center staff seriously limited her ability to learn and contribute" to the work of the Unit. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant was not discriminated against when she was rated a "1" for "Oral Communication."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although complainant asserts that her rating was based on her accent, nothing in the record reveals whether Supervisor-2 or complainant's co-workers had difficulty understanding her because of her accent. There is only a general reference to complainant not being understandable. The record is otherwise devoid of any evidence from either party describing the existence or extent of complainant's accent. An employment decision based on foreign accent does not violate Title VII if an individual's accent materially interferes with the ability to perform job duties. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 13--National Origin Discrimination, 13-19 (November 22, 2002). This assessment depends upon the specific duties of the position in question and the extent to which the individual's accent affects her ability to perform job duties.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We determine that the record is devoid of evidence that management officials ever considered complainant's accent or did so in a discriminatory manner. In this regard, the record does not show that officials made comments about complainant's accent, that she was ridiculed because of her accent, or that she was not selected for a position because of her accent. The record contains no evidence, other than the complainant's own assertion, that her performance rating was related to her accent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Supervisor-2 cites complainant's lack of fluency and command of the English language as contributing to her poor oral communication skills. Supervisor-2 stated that complainant "does not have the communication skills necessary to explain [answers] in clear understandable English that is required" and recommended that she take courses in conversational English. Furthermore, Supervisor-2 attributed her lack of fluency as the reason she does not communicate orally with others. The record is unclear whether Supervisor-2 found complainant's English to be lacking because he could not understand what she was saying due to her accent, whether he found her English grammar and proper word choice lacking, or whether her English was problematic for some other reason. A fluency requirement is permissible only if required for the effective performance of the position for which it is imposed.<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 13--National Origin Discrimination, 13-19 (November 22, 2002). While statements like those made by Supervisor-2 could be indicia of illegal ethnic or racial bias or stereotyping (<span class="Italic">e.g</span>., Asians do not speak, understand, and/or write English well), in the present case, complainant's annual performance appraisals for 1998 and 1999 clearly indicate that complainant refused to orally communicate with the clients and staff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the weight of the evidence supports the agency's assertion that complainant was unwilling to communicate with co-workers and the supervisor despite her position's requirement that she respond to questions. The record contains no evidence that contradicts the agency's explanation that complainant's rating was commensurate with her performance. Although complainant states that her English "is more than adequate to communicate with others," she did not submit any additional evidence regarding her English ability, nor does she deny that she refused to communicate with others or respond to questions that required an oral response.</p>
