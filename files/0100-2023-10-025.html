<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-26"><span class="space">2.</span> Management Directive 715</h4>
<p class="noindent">On October 1, 2003, the EEOC issued Management Directive 715 governing equal employment opportunity programs in the federal sector. MD-715 supersedes Management Directives 712 (March 29, 1983), and 713 and 714 (October 6, 1987), and all interpretive memoranda. MD-715 addresses affirmative employment responsibilities of federal agencies under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. There are no affirmative employment requirements in the provisions of the ADEA that apply to the federal sector.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-715 applies to "all executive agencies and military departments (except uniformed members) as defined in Sections 102 and 105 of Title 5 USC (including those with employees and applicants for employment who are paid from nonappropriated funds), the United States Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Smithsonian Institution, and those units of the judicial branch of the federal government having positions in the competitive service." MD-715 is divided into three subparts. Subpart A "provides policy guidance and standards for establishing and maintaining effective affirmative programs of equal employment opportunity" under Title VII. Subpart B provides policy guidance for "effective affirmative action programs" under the Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. Finally, Subpart C sets forth general reporting requirements of agencies on their efforts to achieve equal employment opportunity. When issued in 2003, the EEOC announced plans to issue further guidance and instructions on implementing the policies of MD-715, but as of 2015 no further guidance has been issued.</p>
<p class="noindent">The introduction to MD-715 sets forth the purpose of the directive:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States government employs over two million men and women across the country and around the world. The ability of our government to meet the complex needs of our nation and the American people rests squarely on these dedicated and hard-working individuals. Perhaps now more than ever before--with increasing public expectations of governmental institutions--federal agencies must position themselves to attract, develop and retain a top-quality workforce that can deliver results and ensure our nation's continued growth and prosperity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Equal opportunity in the federal workplace is key to accomplishing this goal. In order to develop a competitive, highly qualified workforce, federal agencies must fully utilize all workers' talents, without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex or disability. While the promise of workplace equality is a legal right afforded all of our nation's workers, equal opportunity is more than a matter of social justice. It is a national economic imperative. Federal agencies must make full use of our nation's human capital by promoting workplace practices that free up opportunities for the best and brightest talent available. All workers must compete on a fair and level playing field and have the opportunity to achieve their fullest potential.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Policies and practices that impede fair and open competition in the federal workplace cost the American economy millions of dollars each year. The most obvious costs are out-of-pocket costs borne by both agencies and federal workers in connection with workplace disputes. Perhaps less obvious--but just as expensive--are costs associated with decreased morale and productivity and the ineffective and inefficient use of human capital resources. These costs can--and should--be <span id="Page_13"></span>avoided. Agencies must make a firm commitment to the principles of equal opportunity and make those principles a fundamental part of agency culture.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) and Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act) mandate that all federal personnel decisions be made free of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, reprisal or disability and also require that agencies establish a program of equal employment opportunity for all federal employees and job applicants. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 and 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has adjudicatory responsibilities in the federal EEO complaints process and oversight responsibility for federal programs required by Section 717 of Title VII and Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act generally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Directive, which reflects recent and significant changes in the law, including recent Supreme Court decisions, supersedes earlier EEOC Management Directives and related interpretative memoranda on this subject and provides new guidance on the elements of legally compliant Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs. This Directive requires agencies to take appropriate steps to ensure that all employment decisions are free from discrimination. It also sets forth the standards by which EEOC will review the sufficiency of agency Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs, which include periodic agency self-assessments and the removal of barriers to free and open workplace competition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additional information concerning federal sector equal employment opportunity law and programs can be found at EEOC's website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">http://www.eeoc.gov/</a>. The EEOC will also supplement this Directive on an as-needed basis through the issuance of additional guidance and technical assistance. Questions concerning this Directive should be directed to EEOC's Office of Federal Operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are six essential elements of the Title VII and Rehabilitation Act model programs under MD-715. These are: 1) a demonstrated commitment from agency leadership; 2) integration of EEO into the agency's strategic mission; 3) management and program accountability; 4) proactive prevention of unlawful discrimination; 5) efficiency; and 6) responsiveness and legal compliance. Each of these elements is broadly defined in the introduction to MD-715:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Demonstrated Commitment From Agency Leadership</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Directive requires agency heads and other senior management officials to demonstrate a firm commitment to equality of opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment. Even the best workplace policies and procedures will fail if they are not trusted, respected and vigorously enforced. Agencies must translate equal opportunity into every day practice and make those principles a fundamental part of agency culture. This commitment to equal opportunity must be embraced by agency leadership and communicated through the ranks from the top down. It is the responsibility of each agency head to take such measures as may be necessary to incorporate the principles of equal employment opportunity into the agency's organizational structure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To this end, agency heads must issue a written policy statement expressing their commitment to equal employment opportunity (EEO) and a workplace free of discriminatory harassment. This statement should be issued at the beginning of their tenure and thereafter on an annual basis and disseminated to all employees. In addition, agency heads and other senior management officials may, at their discretion, issue similar statements when important issues relating to equal employment opportunity arise within their agency or when important developments in the law occur.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Integration of EEO Into The Agency's Strategic Mission</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Equality of opportunity is essential to attracting, developing and retaining the most qualified workforce to support the agency's achievement of its strategic mission. To this end, and in addition to the regulatory requirements found at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102(b)(4), as interpreted in Management Directive 110 at 1-1, agencies must:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Maintain a reporting structure that provides the agency's EEO Director with regular access to the agency head and other senior management officials for reporting on the effectiveness, efficiency and legal compliance of the agency's Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs. To emphasize the importance of the position, the agency head should be involved in the selection and performance review of the EEO Director.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Ensure EEO professionals are involved with, and consulted on, the management and deployment of human resources. The EEO Director should be a regular participant in senior staff meetings and regularly consulted on human resources issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Allocate sufficient resources to create and/or maintain Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs that: 1) identify and eliminate barriers that impair the ability of individuals to compete in the workplace because of race, national origin, sex or disability; 2) establish and maintain training and education programs designed to provide maximum opportunity for all employees to advance; and 3) ensure that unlawful discrimination in the workplace is promptly corrected and addressed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Attract, develop and retain EEO staff with the strategic competencies necessary to accomplish the agency's EEO mission, and interface with agency officials, managers and employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Recruit, hire, develop and retain supervisors and managers who have effective managerial, communications and interpersonal skills. Provide managers and supervisors with appropriate training and other resources to understand and successfully discharge their duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Involve managers and employees in the implementation of the agency's Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Use various media to distribute EEO information concerning federal EEO laws, regulations and requirements, rights, duties and responsibilities and to promote best workplace practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Management and Program Accountability</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A model Title VII and Rehabilitation Act program will hold managers, supervisors, EEO officials and personnel officers accountable for the effective implementation and management of the agency's program. In ensuring such accountability, the agency must:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Conduct regular internal audits, on at least an annual basis, to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs and to ascertain whether the agency has made a good faith effort to identify and remove barriers to equality of opportunity in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Establish procedures to prevent all forms of discrimination, including harassment, retaliation and failure to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evaluate managers and supervisors on efforts to ensure equality of opportunity for all employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Maintain clearly defined, well-communicated, consistently applied and fairly implemented personnel policies, selection and promotion procedures, evaluation procedures, rules of conduct and training systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Implement effective reasonable accommodation procedures that comply with applicable executive orders, EEOC guidance, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board's Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards and Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards. Ensure that EEOC has reviewed those procedures when initially developed and if procedures are later significantly modified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Be mindful of the agency's disability program obligations, including the provision of reasonable accommodations, when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with recognized labor organization(s) representing agency employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ensure effective coordination between the agency's EEO programs and related human resource programs, including the Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP), the Selective Placement Programs and the Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program (DVAAP).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Review each finding of discrimination to determine the appropriateness of taking disciplinary action against agency officials involved in the matter. Track these decisions and report trends, issues and problems to agency leadership for appropriate action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ensure compliance with settlement agreements and orders issued by the agency, EEOC, and EEO-related cases from the Merit Systems Protection Board, labor arbitrators, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Proactive Prevention of Unlawful Discrimination</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies have an ongoing obligation to prevent discrimination on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, reprisal and disability, and eliminate barriers that impede free and open competition in the workplace. As part of this on-going obligation, agencies must conduct a self-assessment on at least an annual basis to monitor progress, identify areas where barriers may operate to exclude certain groups and develop strategic plans to eliminate identified barriers. A more detailed explanation of this process follows at Part A (Title VII) and Part B (Rehabilitation Act) of this Directive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Efficiency</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies must have an efficient and fair dispute resolution process and effective systems for evaluating the impact and effectiveness of their EEO programs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Maintain an efficient, fair and impartial complaint resolution process. Agencies should benchmark against EEOC regulations at 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 and other federal agencies of similar size highly ranked in EEOC's Annual Report on the federal sector complaints process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ensure that the investigation and adjudication function of the agency's complaint resolution process are kept separate from the legal defense arm of the agency or other agency offices with conflicting or competing interests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_14"></span>Establish and encourage the widespread use of a fair alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program that facilitates the early, effective and efficient informal resolution of disputes. Appoint a senior official as the dispute resolution specialist of the agency charged with implementing a program to provide significant opportunities for ADR for the full range of employment-related disputes. Whenever ADR is offered in a particular workplace matter, ensure that managers at all appropriate levels will participate in the ADR process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Use a complaint tracking and monitoring system that permits the agency to identify the location, status, and length of time elapsed at each stage of the agency's complaint resolution process, the issues and the bases of the complaints, the aggrieved individuals/complainants, the involved management officials and other information necessary to analyze complaint activity and identify trends.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Identify, monitor and report significant trends reflected in complaint processing activity. Analysis of data relating to the nature and disposition of EEO complaints can provide useful insight into the extent to which an agency is meeting its obligations under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ensure timely and complete compliance with EEOC orders and the provisions of settlement/resolution agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Maintain a system that collects and maintains accurate information on the race, national origin, sex and disability status of agency employees.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.601 for further guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Maintain a system that tracks applicant flow data, which identifies applicants by race, national origin, sex and disability status and the disposition of all applications. EEOC will issue more detailed guidance on collecting and maintaining applicant flow data.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Maintain a tracking system of recruitment activities to permit analyses of these efforts in any examination of potential barriers to equality of opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Identify and disseminate best workplace practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Responsiveness and Legal Compliance</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal agencies must:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ensure that they are in full compliance with the law, including EEOC regulations, orders and other written instructions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Report agency program efforts and accomplishments to EEOC and respond to EEOC directives and orders in accordance with EEOC instructions and time frames.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ensure that management fully and timely complies with final EEOC orders for corrective action and relief in EEO matters.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-715, Section II, Subpart A deals with the obligation of federal agencies to develop "an affirmative program of equal employment opportunity" under Title VII. This means that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 717 of Title VII requires federal agencies to take proactive steps to ensure equal employment opportunity for all their employees and applicants for employment. This means that agencies must work to proactively prevent potential discrimination before it occurs and establish systems to monitor compliance with Title VII. Agencies must regularly evaluate their employment practices to identify barriers to equality of opportunity for all individuals. Where such barriers are identified, agencies must take measures to eliminate them. With these steps, agencies will ensure that all persons are provided opportunities to participate in the full range of employment opportunities and achieve to their fullest potential.</p>
<p class="noindent">The first requirement of Subpart A is that agencies must conduct an annual self-evaluation. This self-evaluation, described in Subpart A, Section II, requires agencies to</p>
<p class="noindent-1">monitor progress and identify areas where barriers may operate to exclude certain groups. A first step in conducting this self-assessment involves looking at the racial, national origin and gender profile of relevant occupational categories in an agency's workforce. Guidance on how to group occupational categories will be provided separately. This "snapshot" can serve as a diagnostic tool to help agencies determine possible areas where barriers may exist and may require closer attention.</p>
<p class="noindent">According to MD-715, this self-assessment provides a "statistical snapshot" that is a starting point for the identification of workplace barriers.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> That snapshot must then be evaluated in light of the "totality of the circumstances."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The self-assessment must, at a minimum, include the following data for each agency as of the end of each fiscal year:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Total workforce distribution by race, national origin and sex for both the permanent and temporary workforce;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Permanent and temporary workforce participation rates for each grade level by race, national origin and sex;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Permanent and temporary workforce participation rates for each of the agency's major occupational categories (divided by grade level) by race, national origin and sex;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Participation rates in supervisory and management positions by race, national origin and sex;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The race, national origin and sex of applicants for both permanent and temporary employment;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rates of selections for promotions, training opportunities and performance incentives by race, national origin and sex; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rates of both voluntary and involuntary separations from employment by race, national origin and sex.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Regarding the "rates of selections for promotions" portion of Part A, II, the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Casie S. v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0120100672 (2018), that nothing in that language requires the "agency to keep promotion applications categorized by national origin or Best Qualified Lists categorized by national origin."</p>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of gathering this information is to help the agency identify meaningful disparities in its workforce and to focus further self-assessment. As the Commission explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conducting its self-assessment, agencies shall compare their internal participation rates with corresponding participation rates in the relevant civilian labor force (CLF). Geographic areas of recruitment and hiring are integral factors in determining "relevant" civilian labor force participation rates. EEOC will provide appropriate civilian labor force data for use by agencies. With respect to positions typically filled through the internal promotion process or through transfers from other federal agencies, a self-assessment will involve looking at the racial, national origin and gender profile of the occupational categories and/or grade levels from which such promotions or transfers are typically made. EEOC will, from time to time, provide additional guidance on conducting the analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The directive requires agencies to collect and maintain race, national origin and gender data on employees in both the permanent and temporary workforce, as well as on applicants for employment. Collection of the data from both employees and applicants should be by voluntary self-identification. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.601.</p>
<p class="noindent">Section III of Subpart A addresses barriers to equal employment opportunity under Title VII. If an agency's self-assessment identifies racial, national origin or gender-based disparities, it must then identify the barriers creating those disparities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Workplace barriers can take various forms and sometimes involve a policy or practice that is neutral on its face. Identifying and evaluating potential barriers requires an agency to examine all relevant policies, practices, procedures and conditions in the workplace. The process further requires each agency to eliminate or modify, where appropriate, any policy, practice or procedure that creates a barrier to equality of opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, if a self-assessment revealed that Hispanics are virtually absent from the workforce in a facility, it would be logical for the agency to initially focus attention on its hiring and recruitment activities. The agency could rule out potential recruitment concerns if it determined that Hispanics were well represented among its applicants for employment. It would then be appropriate for the agency to examine all other aspects of the hiring process to identify the factor(s) responsible for the statistical disparity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission suggests several questions that an agency might consider in identifying workplace barriers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Are recruitment efforts resulting in a cross-section of qualified applicants? Is there a significant disparity between the proportion of a racial, national origin or gender group in the agency's applicant pools and the proportion of that group in the relevant labor markets from which applicants are drawn?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a workforce where employees of a particular group are virtually absent, to what extent are employment opportunities unnecessarily restricted to internal applicants?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Have supervisors, managers and executives been adequately trained on the agency's obligations under Title VII?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Are there decision makers whose employment decisions have excluded individuals on the basis of race, national origin or sex?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Are there any selection criteria that tend to screen out a particular racial, national origin or gender group?</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Subpart A, section III. Section IV of Subpart A discusses the evaluation and elimination of workplace barriers based on race, national origin or gender. The Commission provides the following example of how self-analysis might lead to identification of a workplace barrier that creates a racial disparity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, statistical disparities are identified in an agency's auditor occupational group and further examination of the situation reveals the following: In the past, the auditor occupational group was racially diverse, including at the higher grade levels. However, after the agency instituted a requirement that auditors must be certified public accountants (CPAs) in order to be promoted to the GS-14 level or higher, few internal candidates held CPAs and therefore did not qualify for promotional <span id="Page_15"></span>opportunities to the higher level grades. As a result, the agency recruited candidates for these positions from a local business school with a student population that primarily came from the same racial group. Over time, auditors at the grade 14 level and above did not reflect the racial diversity of auditors at the lower grade levels. Assuming the requirement for a CPA is justified by business necessity, the agency has several options to consider in designing a response to this situation. Most obviously, the agency should increase its applicant pool for positions at the grade 14 and above by recruiting at other business schools with more diverse student populations. As an additional option, the agency might take steps to encourage its own auditors at the lower grade levels to pursue a CPA.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to assess the appropriateness of any policy, practice or condition that is identified as creating a statistical disparity, the Commission requires that agencies consider:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether the agency head can do more to demonstrate to the workforce, his or her commitment to equal employment opportunity;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether there are budgetary or other restrictions governing a decision to limit recruitment to internal applicants;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether certain qualification standards are truly necessary to the successful performance in a position; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether selection criteria used to assess qualifications that have been found to exclude or adversely impact a particular racial, national origin or gender group truly measure the knowledge, skills and abilities that they purport to measure, and whether alternative criteria are available that do not disadvantage any particular group.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, subpart A, section IV. Where an identified barrier serves no legitimate purpose, it must be eliminated immediately. Even if a policy that poses a barrier can be justified by business necessity, agencies must evaluate whether there is an alternative, less exclusionary practice that would serve the same purpose. If the self-analysis identifies barriers that are not within an agency's control, this should be brought to the attention of the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-715 also suggests several measures that an agency can undertake to enhance and maximize opportunities for all employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Identifying career enhancing opportunities such as details, developmental assignments, mentoring programs, etc. Structuring details or developmental assignments to expose a broad range of employees to a variety of positions within the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assessing internal availability of candidates by identifying job-related skills, education, knowledge and abilities that may be obtained at lower levels in the same or similar occupational series.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Conducting a skills-building inventory of agency employees, including but not limited to, current and potential gaps in skills and the distribution of skills. Developing an action plan to address these gaps.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When appropriate, developing broad criteria for evaluating the knowledge, skills and abilities of applicants for particular positions that takes into account a range of experience and skills.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subpart A, section IV. Subpart B of the MD-715 addresses the proactive prevention of discrimination under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. In the Rehabilitation Act, Congress required the federal government to become a model employer of individuals with disabilities. The Rehabilitation Act requires each agency to establish and maintain "an affirmative action program plan for the hiring, placement, and advancement to individuals with disabilities." As the Commission explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The mandate to serve as a model employer requires several things. First, agencies may not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities. But non-discrimination alone is not enough. The Rehabilitation Act also requires agencies to take proactive steps to ensure equal employment opportunity for individuals with disabilities. This means agencies must attempt to prevent discrimination before it occurs and must establish systems to monitor their own compliance with the Act. Agencies must regularly evaluate their employment practices to identify barriers to equality of opportunity for individuals with disabilities. Where such barriers are identified, agencies must eliminate them. With these steps, agencies will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided opportunities to fully participate in employment opportunities and achieve to their fullest potential.</p>
<p class="noindent">By incorporating provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act into the Rehabilitation Act, Congress defined the term discrimination to include:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Making unlawful medical examinations or inquiries;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not providing reasonable accommodations to an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on its operations;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Denying job opportunities to an otherwise qualified applicant or employee because of the need for a reasonable accommodation;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Using qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out, or tend to screen out, individuals with disabilities unless shown to be job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Failing to select and administer employment tests in the most effective manner to ensure that when the test is administered, the test results accurately reflect the skills, aptitudes or other factors the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills of the employee or applicant;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Using standards, criteria, or methods of administration that have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability or that perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to common administrative control;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Limiting, segregating, or classifying a job applicant or employee in a way that adversely affects the opportunities or status of such applicant or employee because of the disability of such applicant or employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Participating in a contractual or other arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to prohibited discrimination; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Excluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a relationship or association.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Section I. Like Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act also includes protections against reprisal for participation in the EEO process or opposing any discriminatory practice under the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with Subpart A, MD-715, as it relates to the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies to conduct a self-assessment of policies, practices and procedures that, directly or indirectly, relate to the employment of individuals with disabilities. For the purposes of Subpart B:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he term "employment" refers to the full range of employment decisions, including (but not limited to) hiring, advancement, retention, and other general terms, conditions and privileges of employment. The term "conditions" is intended to refer to the full range of environmental circumstances within an agency, including the physical layout and design of the structure in which the agency is located. In this regard, agencies should be mindful of their obligation to ensure that their physical structures and facilities comply with the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4151 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.) and relevant titles of the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, agencies are reminded of their responsibilities to bring physical structures and facilities into compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with the self-assessment under Subpart A, the self-assessment of the agency's fulfillment of its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act is intended to provide a "statistical snapshot" as a starting point for the identification and elimination of employment barriers. However:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]gencies must be mindful that, while such numerical analyses can be useful as initial diagnostic and measuring tools, not all issues relating to their obligations under the Rehabilitation Act will lend themselves to such an analysis. Moreover, an agency can be liable for discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act if its practices exclude even one individual on the basis of that individual's disability. It is the responsibility of each agency to be sensitive to any employment circumstance or condition that may be relevant to its ability to meet its fundamental obligation to effect appropriate hiring, advancement and retention of individuals with disabilities, especially those with targeted disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies are required to conduct the self-analysis on an annual basis with respect to the end of the fiscal year and, at a minimum, must include the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Total workforce distribution of employees with disabilities for both the permanent and temporary workforce;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Representation and distribution of employees with disabilities, by grade, in both the permanent and temporary workforce;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Permanent and temporary workforce participation of employees with disabilities in major occupational groups by grades;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The representation of individuals with disabilities among applicants for permanent and temporary employment;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The representation of employees with disabilities among those who received promotions, training opportunities and performance incentives;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The representation of employees with disabilities among those who were voluntarily and involuntarily separated;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The effectiveness and efficiency with which the agency processes requests for reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The extent to which an agency is in compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act's requirement to provide employees with disabilities access to information and data that is comparable to that provided to those without disabilities; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Information and trend data reflecting the nature, status and disposition of complaints in the administrative process (EEOC, MSPB and FLRA) and in court alleging violations of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, subpart B, section III. Unlike protected categories covered by Title VII, <span id="Page_16"></span>there is no comparable census data on individuals with disabilities and, the Commission notes, this makes a reliable statistical analysis based on general workforce data difficult.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, a review of agency annual submissions to the EEOC reveals that some agencies favorably distinguish themselves (compared to the federal government in general) through the number of employees with disabilities in their workforce. Until such time as reliable data is developed and disseminated concerning the general availability of individuals with disabilities in the workforce, this Directive recommends agencies evaluate themselves against the workforce profile of the federal government in general and that of agencies ranked highly, in this respect, in the most recent EEOC annual report on the federal workforce. All agencies, regardless of their relative standing, are strongly encouraged to effect steady and measurable progress with respect to the employment and advancement of individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the absence of reliable availability data for individuals with disabilities, any statistical analysis is complicated by the fact that disabilities are individual in nature, making gross statistical comparisons of limited value. Notwithstanding these limitations, an agency's analysis of the above information can help facilitate an assessment concerning the extent to which individuals with disabilities, especially those with targeted disabilities, are provided equal employment opportunities. Statistical information may be a useful starting point for a more thorough examination of the agency's physical facilities, electronic and information processes, personnel policies, selection and promotion procedures, evaluation procedures, rules of conduct and training systems to ensure full accessibility for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The collection and maintenance of data for the self-analysis also poses special problems because of the ADA prohibitions on the collection and distribution of medical information. Agencies are required to adopt procedures that ensure the information for the self-analysis is collected and managed consistent with ADA requirements regarding confidentiality. Information on individuals with disabilities may be collected in the following ways:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies may use information obtained from Standard Form 256, the "Self-Identification of Handicap" form (SF 256) issued by the Office of Personnel Management, or other information that individuals choose to disclose about the existence of disabilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.601(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies tracking applications from individuals with disabilities, or considering the use of excepted appointing authorities or other special programs, may invite applicants to indicate if they have the types of disabilities that are covered by the program at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whenever an agency invites an applicant or employee to provide information about his/her disability, the agency must clearly notify such individual that: (a) response to the invitation is voluntary and refusal to provide the information will not subject the individual to any adverse treatment; (b) the information will be kept confidential and used only for affirmative action purposes; and (c) individuals may self-identify at any time during their employment and failure to complete SF 256 or to respond to pre-offer invitations will not excuse the agency from Rehabilitation Act requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> To ensure confidentiality, medical and disability-related information must be collected and maintained on separate forms, kept in separate files and treated as confidential medical records.</p>
<p class="noindent">The information collected may be put to limited, authorized uses:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For affirmative action purposes alone, medical and disability-related information may be disclosed to managers and others involved in a selection process, as well as to those responsible for affirmative action, where the information indicates that an applicant may be included under excepted appointing authorities or eligible to receive other affirmative action benefits. Moreover, disability-related information may be used to manage, evaluate, and report on EEO and affirmative action programs; data from SF 256 may, for example, be provided to those who will generate the statistics necessary for the workforce analyses required by this Directive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All persons to whom information is disclosed for Rehabilitation Act program purposes must be informed about the restrictions placed on use of the information and instructed not to disclose it further than necessary to satisfy those purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Subpart B also requires that agencies take steps to identify any potential workplace barriers. In identifying those barriers, the Commission suggests that agencies consider the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Are the agency's recruitment efforts resulting in sufficient numbers of applicants with disabilities, especially targeted disabilities?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Are there opportunities to re-survey the agency's workforce at least every other year to maintain accurate and updated statistics on employees with disabilities?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Is the physical structure and layout of the agency facility in compliance with applicable accessibility standards?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the agency is in compliance with accessibility standards, are there other physical barriers that remain?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Is there evidence in the workplace of actions or practices reflecting myths, fears and stereotyping regarding individuals with disabilities?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a workforce where employees with disabilities are virtually absent, to what extent are employment opportunities restricted to internal applicants? Could hiring be expanded to include external candidates?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Has the agency adequately trained its supervisors, managers and executives on the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act, including the duty to provide reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Does the agency have an adequately funded and effective procedure for providing reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Are there particular decision makers or groups of decision makers whose employment decisions consistently exclude qualified individuals on the basis of disability?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Do selection criteria tend to exclude individuals with disabilities, in general, or to exclude a person with particular types of disabilities? If so, are these standards necessary to the successful performance of a particular job? Does the selection criteria at issue truly measure the knowledge, skills and abilities it purports to measure and are there alternative criteria that would serve the same purpose?</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, subpart B, section IV. When an employment barrier is identified which is not job-related and consistent with business necessity, it must be eliminated immediately. Even if the policy or practice is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the agency must consider whether less exclusive policies or practices would serve the same purpose, including whether reasonable accommodation can be made. If the barrier is beyond the control of the agency, it must notify the EEOC immediately. Agencies are cautioned that any barriers associated with myths, fears or stereotypes must also be eliminated immediately.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies also are required to have written procedures for reasonable accommodation requests. These procedures were also previously required by Executive Order 13164. These procedures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Should address the scope of the agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation and the types of accommodations that must be considered. In addition, the procedures should address at least the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the personnel whom employees, selectees or applicants should initially contact to request a reasonable accommodation;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the personnel forms, if any, that an individual may be asked to complete in connection with a request for an accommodation;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the circumstances in which supervisors or others should initiate inquiries about the need for accommodation;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the personnel and/or offices that must approve an accommodation request;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the amount of time decision makers have to answer requests for accommodation;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">an explanation of when decision makers may request documentation of the existence of a disability or the need for an accommodation;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the resources, including technical assistance, available to decision makers to gain information about possible accommodations for particular disabilities;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the ways in which accommodations can be funded or effected;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the documentation, if any, that must be maintained concerning the consideration and disposition of requests for accommodation; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the process, if any, that individuals may follow to appeal denials of requests for accommodation or specific accommodations.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-715, subpart B, section V. The procedures also should ensure that requests for accommodation are processed expeditiously by knowledgeable personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unlike the procedures that apply to Title VII, Subpart B also requires, with respect to the Rehabilitation Act, that an agency establish goals. Section VI of Subpart B provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The steps described above--conducting work force analyses, reviewing agency policies, practices and facilities, and fulfilling obligations to people with disabilities under the Rehabilitation Act--should enable an agency to make substantial progress in promoting the employment of qualified individuals with disabilities. However, such efforts may well be insufficient to provide the adequate employment opportunities that are required by the Rehabilitation Act for individuals with disabilities. Indeed, Congress anticipated that the federal government, as a model employer of individuals with disabilities, would take additional steps to include individuals with disabilities at all levels of the federal workforce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Directive requires agencies with 1,000 employees or more to maintain a special recruitment program for individuals with targeted disabilities and to establish specific goals for the employment and advancement <span id="Page_17"></span>of such individuals. For these purposes, targeted disabilities may be considered as a group. Agency goals should be set and accomplished in such a manner as will effect measurable progress from the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To accomplish established goals, agencies should, as appropriate: 1) engage in outreach and targeted recruitment; 2) take advantage of excepted appointing authorities; 3) create training and development plans for individuals with disabilities; and 4) take disability into account in selection decisions where an individual with a disability is otherwise qualified with or without a reasonable accommodation. To achieve maximum impact through their Rehabilitation Act program, agencies are required, under this Directive, to give special attention to those with targeted disabilities in each of the activities discussed herein.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subpart C of MD-715 discusses EEOC oversight and technical assistance. For the most part, the oversight consists of setting forth the specific requirements for annual reports to the EEOC of the data collected by agencies under Subparts A and B. Agency reports must be submitted annually to the EEOC and, at a minimum, must include:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The name and location of the agency or reporting component;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The number of permanent and temporary employees employed;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The name of the head of the agency or reporting component;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The name, title, grade and qualifications of the principal EEO official(s) responsible for overseeing the program and preparing the report;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Copies of relevant EEO policy statements issued or reinforced during the previous fiscal year;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A narrative description of the agency's mission, mission-related functions, and a copy of the agency's organizational chart;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A description of how the agency's Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs measure up against the essential elements of a model program described in this Directive;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A description of activities undertaken during the preceding year in connection with the self-assessment and barrier identification and elimination under Parts A and B of this Directive;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A description of action items and plans to be implemented or accomplished by the agency during the upcoming year in connection with carrying out its responsibilities under this Directive;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A description of action items and plans to provide maximum opportunity for employees to advance to their highest level of potential under Parts A and B of this Directive;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Data required in connection with Form 462 reporting; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other information, in such format as EEOC may prescribe, required in the instructions supplementing this Directive.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, subpart C, section I. Agency reports must be submitted on an annual basis and "also include a plan that sets forth steps that [the agency] will take in the future to correct deficiencies or further improve efforts undertaken pursuant" to MD-715. Upon submission:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reports filed by agencies pursuant [to] this Directive will be evaluated for clarity and content by EEOC. EEOC will approve or disapprove specific plans as appropriate. In addition, EEOC will periodically conduct evaluations and program reviews to more closely assess whether the program elements of this Directive are being met and will be available on an ongoing basis as issues arise for agencies to consult with in facilitating program improvements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are many consequences associated with an agency's failure to fully implement effective EEO programs, including the out-of pocket costs that will be borne by the agency in connection with workplace disputes, especially after the passage of the No Fear Act, and the very real costs associated with decreased morale and productivity resulting from the ineffective and inefficient use of human capital resources. Moreover, where annual reports or information otherwise obtained by EEOC suggest that an agency is giving insufficient attention to its obligations under this Directive, EEOC will inform the President and appropriate Congressional committees.</p>

<p class="noindent">In September 2008, the Commission supplemented MD-715 with regard to the agencies obligations under the Rehabilitation Act with Questions and Answers: Promoting Employment of Individuals with Disabilities in the Federal Workforce, which is available on the EEOC's website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p>
