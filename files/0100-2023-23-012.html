<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-13"><span class="space">4.</span> Association With Persons With Disabilities</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under Title I of the ADA, it is illegal to discriminate against an employee because of his or her association with an individual with a disability. The provisions of Title I of the ADA were made applicable to the Rehabilitation Act and, thus, to the federal government through the 1992 Rehabilitation Act Amendments. An employee who alleges he is being discriminated against because of his relationship with a disabled spouse has stated a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120072415 (2007). As the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Gholston v. Secretary of Army, National Guard Bureau</span>, 01941796 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant alleges that the agency discriminated against him because of his association with his disabled spouse. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was recently amended to provide that the standards used to determine whether nonaffirmative action employment discrimination has occurred shall be the standards applied under Title I of the ADA<span class="Italic">. See</span> &#x00A7; 503(b) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, P.L. 102-569, 106 STAT. 4344 (October 29, 1992; 29 USC &#x00A7; 791(g)). Because the alleged discrimination in the instant case occurred in October 1993, we find that the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, which were effective on October 29, 1992, apply to the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has issued regulations under Part 1630 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations which implement Title I of the ADA. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.1(a). EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.8 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is unlawful for a covered entity to...discriminate against, a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a family, business, social or other relationship of association.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that appellant has stated a claim of discrimination on the basis of a relationship with an individual with a disability and that the agency improperly dismissed the basis of disability from appellant's complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">In a later companion case, <span class="Italic">Gholston v. Secretary of Army, National Guard Bureau</span>, 01945169 (1995), the Commission explained its basis for finding that the Rehabilitation Act reaches claims of discrimination based on association with a qualified person with a disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only issue on appeal is whether the agency properly dismissed disability (association with an individual with a disability) as a basis of discrimination in the instant complaint. The Commission has recently issued a decision which cited <span class="Italic">Gholston v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942787 (July 15, 1994), for the proposition that an appellant had standing to bring a claim of discrimination on the basis of his relationship with his wife, an individual with a disability<span class="Italic">. Polifko v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940611 (January 4, 1995). Accordingly, we REVERSE the agency's dismissal of this basis from the instant complaint. As we stated in our prior decisions, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was amended on October 29, 1992 to provide that the standards used to determine whether nonaffirmative action employment discrimination has occurred shall be the standards applied under Title I of the ADA<span class="Italic">. See</span> &#x00A7; 503(b) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, P.L. 102-569, 106 STAT. 4344 (October 29, 1992; 29 USC &#x00A7; 791(g)). Because the alleged discrimination in the instant case occurred in February 1994, we find that the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, which were effective on October 29, 1992, apply to the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has issued regulations under Part 1630 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations which implement Title I of the ADA. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.1(a). EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.8 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is unlawful for a covered entity to...discriminate against, a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a family, business, social or other relationship or association.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that appellant has stated a claim of discrimination on the basis of a relationship with an individual with a disability and that the agency improperly dismissed the basis of disability in connection with that relationship from appellant's complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">In October 2005, the EEOC issued "Questions and Answers About the Association Provision of the Americans with Disabilities Act," a fact sheet that is available on the Commission's website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>. As a general explanation of the purpose of the association provision, the fact sheet provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of the association provision is to prevent employers from taking adverse actions based on unfounded stereotypes and assumptions about individuals who associate with people who have disabilities. Thus, it makes unlawful actions such as refusing to hire an individual who has a child with a disability based on an assumption that the applicant will be away from work excessively or be otherwise unreliable, firing an employee who works with people who are HIV-positive or have AIDS based on the assumption that the employee will contract the disease, or denying an employee health care coverage available to others because of the disability of an employee's dependent. This document explains the requirements of the ADA's association provision and provides examples of how it applies to these and other employment situations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact sheet also provides several examples of prohibited conduct under the association provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may not terminate or refuse to hire someone due to that person's known association with an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example B: An employer is interviewing applicants for a computer programmer position. The employer determines that one of the applicants, Arnold, is the best qualified, but is reluctant to offer him the position because Arnold disclosed during the interview that he has a child with a disability. The employer violates the ADA if it refuses to hire Arnold based on its belief that his need to care for his child will have a negative impact on his work attendance or performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example C: A restaurant owner discovers that the chef's boyfriend is HIV-positive. The owner, fearing that the employee will contract the disease and transmit it to the customers through food, terminates the employee. This is a violation of the ADA's association provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may not deny an employee who has an association with a person with a disability a promotion or other opportunities for advancement due to that association.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example D: Tiffany, a part-time salesperson at a large appliance store, applies for a full-time position. The manager hiring for the position rejects Tiffany's application because, having heard that Tiffany's mother and sister had breast cancer, he concludes that Tiffany is likely to acquire the same condition and be unable to reliably work the hours required of a full-time salesperson. This is a violation of the association provision of the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may not make any other adverse employment decision <span id="Page_1102"></span>about an applicant or employee due to that person's association with a person with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example E: The president of a small company learns that his administrative assistant, Sandra, has a son with an intellectual disability. The president is uncomfortable around people with this type of disability and decides to transfer Sandra to a position in which he will have less contact with her to avoid any discussions about, or interactions with, Sandra's son. He transfers her to a vacant entry-level position in the mailroom which pays less than Sandra's present position, but will allow him to avoid interacting with her. This is a violation of the ADA's association provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may not deny an employee health care coverage available to others because of the disability of someone with whom the employee has a relationship or association.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example F: An employer who provides health insurance to the dependents of its employees learns that Jaime, an applicant for a management position, has a spouse with a disability. The employer determines that providing insurance to Jaime's spouse will lead to increased health insurance costs. The employer violates the ADA if it decides not to hire Jaime based on the increased health insurance costs that will be caused by his wife's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example G: In the previous example, it would also violate the ADA for the employer to offer Jaime the position without the benefit of health insurance for his dependents. The employer may not reduce the level of health insurance benefits it offers Jaime because his wife has a disability; nor may it subject Jaime to different terms or conditions of insurance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may not deny an employee any other benefits or privileges of employment that are available to others because of the disability of someone with whom the employee has a relationship or association.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example H: A company has an annual holiday party for the children of its employees. The company president learns that one of its newly hired employees, Ruth, has a daughter with Down Syndrome. Worried that Ruth's daughter will frighten the other children or make people uncomfortable, he tells Ruth that she may not bring her daughter to the party. Ruth has been denied the benefits and privileges of employment available to other employees due to her association with a person with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may not subject someone to harassment based on that person's association with a person with a disability. An employer must also ensure that other employees do not harass the individual based on this association.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example I: Martin and his supervisor, Adam, have had an excellent working relationship, but Adam's behavior toward Martin has changed since Adam learned that Martin's wife has a severe disability. Although Martin has always been a good performer, Adam repeatedly expresses his concern that Martin will not be able to satisfy the demands of his job due to his need to care for his wife. Adam has begun to set unrealistic time frames for projects assigned to Martin and yells at Martin in front of co-workers about the need to meet approaching deadlines. Adam also recently began requiring Martin to follow company policies that other employees are not required to follow, such as requesting leave at least a week in advance. Adam has removed Martin from team projects, stating that Martin's co-workers do not think that Martin can be counted on to complete his share of the work "considering all of his wife's medical problems." Though Martin has complained several times to upper management about Adam's behavior, the employer does nothing. The employer is liable for harassment on the basis of Martin's association with an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Stoltz v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A53899 (2005), the Commission found that complainant had stated a claim when he alleged that his use of sick leave was converted to annual leave even though he had previous approval for FMLA leave because of his association with his disabled daughter. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complaint did not state a claim because the complainant was seeking reasonable accommodation. The Commission affirmed its position that association with an individual with a disability does not entitle a complainant to reasonable accommodation, but found the complainant was alleging that a term or condition of employment had been adversely affected by his association with his daughter and was not seeking accommodation. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120131959 (2013) (failure to extend overseas tour because of son's disability); <span class="Italic">Meeks-Gales v. Postmaster General</span>, 01200637311 (2006) (FMLA leave denied to care for pregnant daughter with diabetes). The Commission similarly upheld an administrative judge's finding the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it subjected the complainant to a hostile work environment based on her association with a son with a disability in <span class="Italic">Eleanore M. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720160024 (2017):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have considered the Agency's extensive arguments. However, we concur with the AJ's determination that Complainant established that she was subjected to ongoing harassment sufficient to create a hostile work environment. We agree with the AJ's conclusion that a single parent with a disabled child being constantly uncertain whether or not she would be granted leave to deal with his medical emergencies, surgeries and hospitalizations, and having every leave request subject to heightened scrutiny despite management's full knowledge of her son's condition, is sufficient to establish a hostile work environment. We also disagree with the Agency's argument that some of the incidents were improperly relied upon by the AJ as they were untimely raised or not explicitly mentioned in the formal complaint. Here, Complainant has raised a hostile work environment claim unified by theme and actors. The Supreme Court has held that a complainant alleging a hostile work environment will not be time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period. <span class="Italic">See National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan</span>, 122 S. Ct. 2061 (June 10, 2002). Moreover, the AJ did not err in determining that, logically, the harassment established was motivated by Complainant's association with her disabled child as harassment centered on her need to use leave to care for her child's medical conditions. Therefore, we affirm the AJ's finding of discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">While the amendments of the Rehabilitation Act making certain standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act applicable prohibit an agency from discriminating against an employee based on the disability status of the employee's friends, associates or relatives, there is no companion provision under Title VII or the ADEA. In <span class="Italic">Holland v. Secretary of State</span>, 01963108 (1997), the complainant alleged that the agency discriminated against its employees based on the age, sex, and disability of their relatives in determining eligibility for Separate Maintenance Allowance (SMA) benefits. The Commission found that the complaint stated a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, but that the agency was correct in dismissing the Title VII and ADEA claims for failure to state a claim. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Holland</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was recently amended to provide that the standards used to determine whether nonaffirmative action employment discrimination has occurred shall be the standards applied under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). <span class="Italic">See</span> 503(b) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, P.L. 102-569, 106 STAT. 4344 (October 29, 1992; 29 USC &#x00A7; 791 (g)). Appellant's complaint reflects that the denial of his SMA benefits occurred in January 1993. Because the alleged discrimination occurred after the effective date of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, which were effective on October 29, 1992, the Amendments apply to the instant complaint. <span class="Italic">See Polifko v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940611 (January 4, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has issued regulations under Part 1630 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations which implement Title I of the ADA. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.1(a). EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.8 provides that it is unlawful for a covered entity to discriminate against a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a family, business, social or other relationship or association.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that appellant has stated a claim of discrimination on the basis of a relationship with an individual with a disability and that the agency improperly dismissed the basis of disability from allegation 3 of appellant's complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gholston v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942787 (July 15, 1994), request for reconsideration dismissed, EEOC Appeal No. 05940858 (May 23, 1996). Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss the basis of disability is REVERSED. Its dismissal of allegation 3 on the bases of age and sex is AFFIRMED, as there have been no such similar amendments to either the ADEA or Title VII. This matter is REMANDED to the agency for further processing in accordance with this decision and Commission regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though those who associate with individuals with disabilities are protected under the ADA, such individuals may not bring a claim for reasonable accommodation based on association. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A32247 (2003). The Commission rejected a claim of failure to provide reasonable accommodation in the form of a delay in a shift change to provide care for a disabled son in <span class="Italic">Helena v. Secretary of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30108.txt">07A30108</a> (2004), finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that summary judgment was appropriate, as no genuine dispute of material fact exists. Concerning complainant's claim that he and his son were not reasonably accommodated, the Commission determines that this matter is more appropriately analyzed under a Disparate Treatment analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Polifko v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940611 (January 4, 1995), the Commission observed that it is unlawful under the association provision to "exclude or deny equal jobs or benefits to, or otherwise discriminate against" an individual based on his or her association with an individual with a known disability. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.8. In the instant case, there is no dispute that the agency was aware of complainant's son's impairment. Here, complainant is not an individual with a disability, it is his son who has the disability. Nonetheless, the Rehabilitation Act extends jurisdiction to individuals who are not disabled, but who are associated with an individual who has a disability. <span id="Page_1103"></span>The association provision contained in the ADA states that it is a violation of the ADA for an employer to: exclude or deny equal jobs or benefits to, or otherwise discriminate against, a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a family, business, social or other relationship of association. <span class="Italic">See Polifko</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A plaintiff attempting to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of "association discrimination" under the Rehabilitation Act must establish: (1) that he was subjected to an adverse employment action; (2) that he was qualified for the job at that time; (3) that his employer knew at that time that he had a relationship with an individual with a disability; and (4) that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances which raised a reasonable inference that the disability of the individual with whom he had a relationship was a determining factor in [the employer's] decision. <span class="Italic">Den Hartog v. Wasatch Academy,</span> 129 F.3d at 1085 (10th Circuit 1997) (applying the ADA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the record clearly establishes that complainant meets the first three prongs of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of association discrimination, complainant has not shown that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances which raised a reasonable inference that his son's disability was a determining factor in the employer's decision. Specifically, the agency provided evidence that requests received in response to shift changes from employees without disabled relatives were denied, just as complainant's request was denied. Also, the agency provided a comparator who allegedly has a disabled child, and whose temporary request concerning a delay in the implementation of the new shift was granted, in order to allow the employee to find child care. Further, the record reflects that complainant lacked seniority and thus was not on equal footing when competing for his desired duty shift. We further note that the Rehabilitation Act does not require the agency to provide complainant with reasonable accommodation so that he may care for his son because the obligation to provide reasonable accommodation only applies to qualified applicants or employees with disabilities. Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.8. <span class="Italic">Simms v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01992195 (May 16, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record in its entirety, including consideration of all statements submitted on appeal, it is the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to affirm the agency's final decision because the preponderance of the evidence of record does not establish that discrimination occurred. The agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for their various actions. Further, construing the evidence to be most favorable to complainant, we note that complainant failed to present evidence that any of the agency's actions were motivated by discriminatory animus. Accordingly, the AJ's finding of disability discrimination on the basis of association discrimination is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120123517 (2013) (allegation that agency failed to provide complainant's husband with accessible housing failed to state a claim); <span class="Italic">Azakytu v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A62544 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">In bringing a claim based on association, the complainant does have to demonstrate that the agency's action is because of the association and not for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120092459 (2009), the complainant, an Army equipment specialist, alleged that he was subject to discrimination based on his child's learning disability where he was given a letter of warning after his wife had a confrontation with a teacher at an agency-run school. The Commission found that the agency presented legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its action, including that the wife's conduct was prejudicial to good order and discipline and that the complainant was a "sponsor" of his family and responsible for their conduct, and that the complainant had not demonstrated that the agency's reasons were pretextual.</p>
