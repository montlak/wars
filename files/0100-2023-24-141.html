<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-121"><span class="space">15.</span> Work-Related Injuries</h4>
<p class="noindent">Where the injury that leads to a disability was received is not relevant to a request for accommodation. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Barnett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951925 (1997), an employer is not relieved of any obligation to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee because the disability is not work-related:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to restructuring, reassignment and creating new positions for employees, the Commission has issued guidance concerning the relationship between workers' compensation and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 USC &#x00A7; 12111 <span class="Italic">et seq. See</span> EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Workers' Compensation and the ADA</span>, Notice No. 915.002 (September 3, 1996). The Enforcement Guidance provides that an employer may not avoid its obligation to accommodate an individual with a disability simply by asserting that the disability did not derive from an occupational injury. The Enforcement Guidance does not require an employer to create a light duty position for an employee with a disability as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Cole v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03960099 (February 10, 1997). However, subject to undue hardship, the Enforcement Guidance notes that reasonable accommodation includes reassigning an employee to an equivalent existing vacancy for which the individual is qualified, which encompasses "reassign[ing] a non-occupationally injured employee with a disability to an equivalent existing vacancy for which s/he is qualified." Enforcement Guidance at 21.</p>
<p class="noindent">To the extent that an agency creates a limited duty position for an employee while she is receiving workers' compensation benefits, the agency is not required to continue that position as a reasonable accommodation once compensation benefits are terminated. <span class="Italic">Light-Burks v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956422 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Santos v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985592 (2001), the Commission further clarified its position on light duty positions as an accommodation and the distinction between on-the-job injuries and other disabilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, much is made in the decision regarding the fact that complainant was requesting a permanent light duty position because his disability was not the result of an on-the-job injury. As the Commission has previously instructed, the distinction between light and limited duty has no bearing on the agency's duties under the Rehabilitation Act. While "an employer may not avoid its obligation to accommodate an individual with a disability simply by asserting that the disability did not derive from occupational injury," <span class="Italic">Bradley v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01962747 (October 22, 1998), an employer is permitted to create light duty positions for those injured on the job but not those injured off the job, as long as it does not make such a distinction between on and off the job injuries where it maintains reserved light duty positions<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC <span id="Page_1386"></span><span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Workers' Compensation and the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (September 3, 1996) at questions 27-28; <span class="Italic">McCutcheon v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A00408 (January 8, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wood v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A46073 (2006); <span class="Italic">Cabrera v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54897 (2006). A qualified individual with a disability is not required to compete for vacant positions, but must be given the vacant position as an accommodation if he or she is qualified. Moreover, the agency cannot show undue hardship by arguing that it would have no other light-duty jobs available for employees injured on the job if it accommodates a disabled employee. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Army</span>, 03A20073 (2003), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the supplemental hearing, held on June 5, 2001, the agency maintained that, from July 13, 1995, when petitioner first requested an accommodation through June 19, 1997, when he was removed, (1) there were no permanent light duty positions; and (2) there were no funded vacant positions in which petitioner could be placed. The Arsenal's Executive Officer, formerly the Industrial Management Specialist and identified as A-4 in the previous decision, testified that the Arsenal has never had a permanent funded light duty position. When an employee was unable to perform the essential functions of their permanent position, the employee could be assigned temporarily to perform a set of duties. These duties, however, did not constitute an authorized position, which would have been assigned a job number, title, series or grade. Therefore, petitioner was not placed in funded vacant positions when he was given light duty work in the Arsenal's Mail Service Center and the Training Office. He was merely performing a set of duties. We find that the agency was under no obligation to allow him to permanently perform nonessential duties<span class="Italic">. See Spry v. USPS</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03980078 (December 11, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also presented evidence regarding numerous positions that were vacant at the time, but for which it maintained the petitioner was not qualified. At the hearing, petitioner's attorney stipulated that, with two exceptions, petitioner did not claim to be qualified for any of the vacant funded positions that were provided by the agency. These positions were Boiler Plant Worker, WG-5402-5, and Material Expediter, WG-6910-6. With respect to the Boiler Plant Worker position, the agency correctly noted that the physical requirements of the position exceeded petitioner's limitations. The position description indicates that "constant noise and rotating machinery" were among the working conditions of the position. Petitioner's February 1996 medical restrictions indicate that he "must work in a noise free environment with less than 85 decibels." Additionally, petitioner was prohibited from lifting over 40 pounds or repetitive bending or stooping. The Boiler Plant Worker position required moderate lifting and carrying of 15-44 pounds. Based on the above, we agree with the agency that petitioner was not qualified for this position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Material Expediter position, however, we find that the petitioner was denied a reasonable accommodation. According to the record, this position fell under the agency's program for the placement of Returnees from Long Term Compensation Rolls. Initially, the program was created in order to reduce the agency's compensation costs by bringing employees, who had been on the agency's long-term compensation rolls, back to work. However, at some point, the agency made a decision to expand the program to include employees injured on the job with permanent medical limitations who were still on the agency's active employment rolls. These were employees who the agency anticipated would be separated and added to the long-term compensation rolls at some point. Pursuant to this, in November 1996, the agency referred the name of petitioner and four other employees (C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4) to an agency official for consideration for the Material Expediter position. On November 19, 1996, C-4 was selected. There is no dispute that petitioner was qualified to perform the essential functions of this position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Enforcement Guidance at Question 29 provides that, with respect to reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, a disabled employee is not required to compete for a vacant position. Reassignment means that the employee gets the vacant position if s/he is qualified. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's explanation for why petitioner was not entitled to the Material Expediter position in November 1996 is somewhat confusing. The agency maintained that petitioner's long term compensation claim was still pending; therefore, he did not meet the eligibility requirements for the program at the time of the selection. However, this ignores the fact that, according to the testimony of the Personnel Staffing Specialist and the post-hearing submission of the agency's representative, the program was expanded to include arsenal employees who were medically disqualified, but still on the active employment rolls. Consequently, an approved compensation claim would appear to have been unnecessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also maintained that the Material Expediter position was not a TDA (Table of Distribution and Allowances) position, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> an authorized position, because it was set aside only for participants in the long term compensation program. A Management Analyst, who testified at the hearing, stated that the Material Expediter position did not become "TDA authorized" until May 1997, when another position was abolished for that purpose. We note, however, the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Workers' Compensation and the ADA</span>, No. 915.002, Question 29 (September 3, 1996). This guidance provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employee with a disability who is not occupationally injured becomes unable to perform the essential functions of his/her job, and there is no other effective accommodation available, the employer must reassign him/her to a vacant reserved light duty position as a reasonable accommodation if (1) s/he can perform its essential functions, with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (2) the reassignment would not impose an undue hardship. This is because reassignment to a vacant position and appropriate modification of an employer's policy are forms of reasonable accommodation required by the ADA, absent undue hardship. An employer cannot establish that the reassignment to a vacant reserved light duty position imposes an undue hardship simply by showing that it would have no other vacant light duty positions available if an employee became injured on the job and needed light duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The guidance also provides the following example:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">R has light duty positions which it reserves for employees in its manufacturing department when they are unable to perform their regular job duties because of on-the-job injuries. CP, an assembly line worker, has multiple sclerosis (MS) which substantially limits a number of major life activities. Eventually CP is unable to perform the essential functions of her position, with or without a reasonable accommodation, because of the MS. As a reasonable accommodation, CP requests that she be reassigned to a vacant light duty position for which she is qualified. R says that the vacant light duty position is reserved for employees who are injured on the job and refuses to reassign CP, although it would not impose an undue hardship to do so. R has violated the ADA by refusing to reassign her to the vacant light duty position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, regardless of whether the Material Expediter position was "TDA authorized" or merely a vacant, funded light duty position, petitioner should have received it as a reasonable accommodation in November 1996. The agency's failure to do so was a violation of the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the agency argued that because all of the individuals on the November 1996 selection register were, like petitioner, medically disqualified from their positions, petitioner's non-selection could not have been based on discrimination. We disagree. The issue is whether petitioner, who besides being medically disqualified from his welding position and who is an individual with a disability, was denied a reasonable accommodation, not whether he was treated differently than someone outside of his protected group. Therefore, we find that he was discriminated against when he was denied a reasonable accommodation.</p>
