<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-43"><span class="space">G.</span> TIMELINESS OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once a possible reasonable accommodation or accommodations has been identified, it is incumbent upon the agency to provide the accommodation[s] unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on agency operations. The agency must complete the reasonable accommodation process and, if required, provide accommodation in a timely fashion. There are no specific time frames set for providing accommodation because of the very nature of individualized inquiries, but "time limits for processing requests for and providing reasonable accommodation should be as short as possible." <span class="Italic">Cathy M. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120142468 (2016). The more contact with the employee during the interactive process, the better for the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beatrice B. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020004288 (2021) (no unnecessary delay where "the entire process took less than two months, during which the Agency repeatedly interacted with Complainant and tried alternative accommodations.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The duration of time between the request for and provision of a reasonable accommodation can impact award amounts. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Randolph T. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 2020004200 (2021) (increasing agency award of $15,000 to $70,000 where the complainant went 16 months without accommodation); <span class="Italic">Elise S. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2020004019 (2021) (increasing agency award of $15,000 to $75,000 where the complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation for over seven years).</p>
<p class="noindent">As explained in the Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA</span>, "Requesting Reasonable Accommodation" at Question 10:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer should respond expeditiously to a request for reasonable accommodation. If the employer and the individual with a disability need to engage in an interactive process, this too should proceed as quickly as possible. Similarly, the employer should act promptly to provide the reasonable accommodation. Unnecessary delays can result in a violation of the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example A</span>:&#x2003;An employer provides parking for all employees. An employee who uses a wheelchair requests from his supervisor an accessible parking space, explaining that the spaces are so narrow that there is insufficient room for his van to extend the ramp that allows him to get in and out. The supervisor does not act on the request and does not forward it to someone with authority to respond. The employee makes a second request to the supervisor. Yet, two months after the initial request, nothing has been done. Although the supervisor never definitively denies the request, the lack of action under these circumstances amounts to a denial, and thus violates the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example B</span>:&#x2003;An employee who is blind requests adaptive <span id="Page_1321"></span>equipment for her computer as a reasonable accommodation. The employer must order this equipment and is informed that it will take three months to receive delivery. No other company sells the adaptive equipment the employee needs. The employer notifies the employee of the results of its investigation and that it has ordered the equipment. Although it will take three months to receive the equipment, the employer has moved as quickly as it can to obtain it and thus there is no ADA violation resulting from the delay. The employer and employee should determine what can be done so that the employee can perform his/her job as effectively as possible while waiting for the equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is envisioned that a timely reasonable accommodation would occur within weeks rather than months. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Joi J. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 2020002173 (2021) (a month to grant a reasonable accommodation, after the request was initially denied due to insufficient medical documentation, was not unreasonable); <span class="Italic">Goldie G. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 2019004032 (2020) (relocating an employee six months after requesting a reasonable accommodation was too long for it to be said that the agency acted responsibly under the Rehabilitation Act). The circumstances surrounding the interactive process will also be considered. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Zenobia P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2021000145 (2020) (finding that a month and half to provide a reasonable accommodation did not violate the Rehabilitation Act where there was a delay in the complainant's ability to provide the medial documentation). In order to respond "expeditiously," however, the agency must have reasonable accommodation procurement procedures already in place. The Commission made that point in <span class="Italic">Ronnie R. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0120161406.txt">0120161406</a> (2018), where the agency took 98 days to provide an ergonomic chair to the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not dispute that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. Complainant suffered from a knee impairment which caused back pain, affecting him in the major life activity of sitting. The record reveals that there was a three-month delay in providing Complainant with an ergonomic chair, which the circumstances illustrate was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency employees were trying to discern what their reasonable accommodation procedures were during the delay. Complainant submitted his request for reasonable accommodation of an ergonomic chair on December 1, 2014 and received the chair on March 25, 2015. While the request was approved by the Agency on December 17, 2014 shortly after Complainant submitted it, there were some delays associated with the acquisitions process for the chair. The Chief of Contracting, the Property Manager, and the Purchasing Agent for the Agency stated that there was no reasonable accommodation process in place at the Agency. As a result, these individuals attempted to schedule a meeting to find out what the procedures were. There was delay in scheduling this meeting for approximately three months, and the meeting was eventually held in March 2015. While the Chief of the Contracting Office seemed to indicate that the Manager of EEO/Diversity asked her not to order the chair until the meeting was scheduled, the record contains an e-mail from the Manager of EEO/Diversity instructing the Chief of the Contracting Office on the obligation to provide an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The e-mail states that Complainant produced medical documentation showing the need for the chair. However, it appears that the e-mail was met with resistance by the acquisitions department for reasons such as not having a headquarters approval number, and that they were not qualified to determine which chair was appropriate for Complainant. As a result, the acquisitions department placed procurement of the chair on hold until the March meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The delay of more than three months, was due solely to the actions of Agency employees, particularly those responsible for procurement of the chair. Complainant submitted all required documentation and established his need for the ergonomic chair as an accommodation at the time of his request in December 2014. It appears that the chair request was placed on hold to discern the Agency's own reasonable accommodation procedures, which the Agency should already have in place, and employees should be informed about. See Policy Guidance On Executive Order 13164: Establishing Procedures To Facilitate The Provision Of Reasonable Accommodation (10/20/00) (explaining the requirements of Executive Order 13164, which requires federal agencies to establish effective written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation). The delay for over three months under these circumstances was excessive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Priscila F. v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, Request No. 0520170177 (May 26, 2017) (finding that three-month delay in replacing ergonomic chair constituted denial of a reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, Complainant established that the Agency's undue delay of providing an ergonomic chair constituted a denial of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A lengthy delay in providing a reasonable accommodation, without a showing of undue hardship, is tantamount to a denial. <span class="Italic">Spencer T. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120162002 (2018). What qualifies as lengthy has been the subject of much discussion. In most instances, the process, including providing the accommodation, should be measured in weeks instead of months. For example, in <span class="Italic">Purl v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971894 (2000), the Commission found a delay of two months was unreasonable even where the initial medical documentation was unclear as to whether the impairment was temporary or permanent. The Commission found that the agency should have provided temporary light-duty while seeking clarification. However, a 17-day delay to locate a suitable position for an employee did not violate the Rehabilitation Act in <span class="Italic">Polly P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120162742 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After Complainant was excessed from the Leola Post Office, she was reassigned to a position at the Harrisburg P&#x0026;DC. When Complainant pointed out that the drive from her home to Harrisburg would violate her medical restrictions, the Agency told her not to report to Harrisburg and that she would be presented with an offer for a position at the Lancaster Plant. Complainant reported to the Lancaster Plant despite her contention that the position would violate her medical restrictions. The first time she reported to the Lancaster Plant, she was sent home for safety reasons because she did not have any documentation of her medical restrictions. When Complainant returned to the Lancaster Plant with documentation of her restrictions, Lancaster management reviewed the documentation and agreed that the available work would violate Complainant's medical restrictions. Complainant was out of work from June 3, 2013, until June 21, 2013, until she began her temporary detail at the Columbia Post Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, although the Agency may have neglected to consider the full extent of Complainant's medical restrictions before offering her positions at the Harrisburg P&#x0026;DC and at the Lancaster Plant, we find that the Agency appropriately worked with Complainant through the interactive process to locate a position within her restrictions. Although Complainant was sent home and told that there was no work available from June 3, 2013, to June 20, 2013, we find that, under the circumstances, this 17-day delay in providing Complainant with a reasonable accommodation did not constitute a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Christena H. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151354 (Oct. 25, 2017) (a 16-day delay in providing a reasonable accommodation was not unreasonable). Complainant contends that the temporary detail at the Columbia Post Office was inappropriate because of its temporary nature, but she has failed to establish that the Columbia detail was an ineffective reasonable accommodation. While Complainant is entitled to an effective reasonable accommodation, she is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice. <span class="Italic">Lynette B. v. Dep't. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720140010 (Dec. 3, 2015). The Agency attempted to find a position for Complainant in which she could perform and. We therefore agree that the Agency had fulfilled its obligation under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Berman v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, 01975726 (2000), the Commission found the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the complainant where there was a three-month delay between her request for accommodation and any agency action on the request. Even though the Commission found that the complainant was not entitled to the accommodation she requested, the agency's delay in even considering accommodation was unreasonable and there were other accommodations that could have been considered. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A34968.txt">01A34968</a> (2006), the Commission found that a six--month delay was a violation of the ADA where the complainant was entitled to the accommodation and the agency advanced no reason for the delay. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120122085 (2014), the Commission reversed summary judgment for the agency finding the record was not fully developed on the delay in accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the third issue concerns whether the delay in permitting Complainant to work from home violated the Rehabilitation Act. Nine months after denying Complainant her Friday request, the Agency authorized Complainant to work at home on Wednesdays. Complainant was provided with a printer and laptop, equipped with Dragon software, earphones and a microphone. It is unclear as to why the Agency did not provide in September 2008, that which it provided in June 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example is provided by <span class="Italic">Yessenia H. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070027 (2015), where the agency's efforts to provide lighting to reduce the complainant's migraine headaches spanned months:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency argues that the AJ erred in finding that Complainant had been denied a reasonable accommodation because it acted in good faith and provided her with an effective accommodation. Specifically, the Agency argues that our decision in EEOC Appeal No. 01A46121 determined that the Agency engaged in good faith efforts to accommodate Complainant and expressly refers to the Agency's efforts since April 21, 2003. The Agency further argues that, assuming that the period of liability is from March 2003 to September 2006, the Agency satisfied its obligations. Specifically, after receipt of the April 21, 2003, letter from Dr.1, Complainant refused to use the lamps because of the heat they produced. The Agency also argues that it undertook additional measures to accommodate her. Specifically, in October 2004, <span id="Page_1322"></span>Complainant was moved to a room with windows; in 2005, they installed non-fluorescent track righting, ordered shades and filters, and erected an office at the Tripler Army base for Complainant. The Agency argues that Complainant is not entitled to an accommodation of choice, just an effective accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, we find that the period of liability arose after April 21, 2003. In response to the Agency's argument that we previously determined that it acted in good faith, we note that the period after April 21, 2003 was not the subject of the complaint at issue in EEOC Appeal No. 01A46121. Accordingly, the determination that the Agency previously acted in good faith is not dispositive here because the question at issue is whether the Agency acted in good faith after April 21, 2003.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer should respond expeditiously to a request for reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Enforcement Guidance), Number 915.002 (October 17, 2002), Question 10. If the employer and the individual with a disability need to engage in an interactive process, this too should proceed as quickly as possible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, the employer should act promptly to provide the reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Unnecessary delays can result in a violation of the ADA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In determining whether there has been an unnecessary delay in responding to a request for reasonable accommodation, relevant factors would include: (1) the reason(s) for the delay, (2) the length of the delay, (3) how much the individual with a disability and the employer each contributed to the delay, (4) what the employer was doing during the delay, and (5) whether the required accommodation was simple or complex to provide. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. n.38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that Complainant repeatedly requested an accommodation in her workspace such that her migraine headache; would not be triggered or exacerbated by the lighting. Complainant provided a letter on April 21, 2003, from Dr.1 requesting that her lighting levels be "Ambient lighting: 30-50 foot-candles (300-500 lux) [and] task lighting (writing/reading/hard copy): 75 foot candles (750 lux)." Complaint file 1 at 227. On July 9, 2004, Dr.1 requested that Complainant have a minimum of 700 lux for her lighting for her work space, a standard desk of 30"<span class="Italic">-</span>48," and to replace fluorescents with full spectrum lighting." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 212. The record reveals that Complainant occupied Office 2 until she moved to Office 3 sometime in October 2004. HT1 at 24-25. In both Office 2 and 3, Complainant used four non-fluorescent lamps in a room that had windows with ambient lighting. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 73-74.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues on appeal that it made a good faith effort to accommodate Complainant. However, we find that the record reveals that the Agency unduly delayed providing Complainant with an effective accommodation. Specifically, the Agency failed to show that it took appropriate action after Complainant's April 21, 2003, and July 9, 2004 requests. We find it particularly troublesome that even as late as September 2005, Complainant's office was still not illuminated to the appropriate lax level as requested by Dr.1 on April 21, 2003, and again on July 9, 2004.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After receiving the April 2003 request from Dr.1, the Agency took temperature and light readings of Complainant's office on August 7, 2003. Complaint File 1 at 60. Thereafter, in a letter dated August 13, 2003, the Agency informed her that the light reading in her office showed her office "met VA guidelines, nothing more," and informed her that if she required additional accommodation, she was required to provide medical documentation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. S1 testified that she did not believe that the April 2003 letter was responsive to the Agency's previous request for more information regarding Complainant's need for an accommodation. HT2 at 330. However, there is nothing in the record to explain why the Agency took nearly four months to respond to Complainant's request. Further, the record reveals that, six months later, Complainant was still working in an office without adequate lighting when the Agency's PC determined, in January 2004, that Complainant's office was too dim for reading without the use of fluorescent lights. Complaint File at 245.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, we note that, in response to Dr.1's July 9, 2004, letter, S1 testified that light readings were taken in October 2004. HT2 at 75. Additionally, Complainant was moved into Office 3 as a result of an "interactive accommodation session" on September 9, 2004. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, nothing in the record adequately explains why it took, at the earliest, two months to respond to this request. Further, the record reveals that the lighting in Office 3 was problematic given that nearly one year later, in September 2005, S3 observed that Complainant was not using the fluorescent lighting in her office and wondered how Complainant could see in a dark office. HT1 at 200.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the record, we find that the Agency did not respond to Complainant's request for an accommodation within a reasonable period of time. We further find that the Agency unnecessarily delayed responding to Complainant's request and that the delayed response constituted a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Cruzan v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120071893 (Aug. 15, 2008) (finding that management's failure to advise complainant of its decision on his accommodation request for four months constituted unnecessary delay in violation of Rehabilitation Act); <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A34968 (August 10, 2006) (finding that agency's six month delay in processing complainant's accommodation request violated Rehabilitation Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues on appeal that Complainant declined to use the appropriate lighting because of the heat produced by the lamps, and that caused the delay in her being accommodated. We are not persuaded by the Agency's position. In analyzing whether Complainant or the Agency caused the delay, we find that Complainant complained to the Agency that the lamps were excessively hot and caused her second degree burns. HT1 at 67, 199, and 210; HT2 at 35, and 160-161. The Agency was obligated to continue seeking an effective accommodation that did not cause Complaint harm, in a timely manner. The record reveals that it failed to do so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the issue of whether the required accommodation was simple or too complex to provide, it appears from the record that installing track lighting with the appropriate shades and filters in an office with natural lighting would have provided Complainant with an effective accommodation. We find that the required accommodation was not too complex to provide for Complainant. The Agency argues on appeal that it had installed track lighting in order to accommodate Complainant. HT2 at 236-237. However, Complainant complained that the lights were too hot without shades and filters. HT1 at 67; 199. The Agency ordered shades for Complainant but discovered they were the wrong type. HT1 at 67-68. We note that the Agency has not proffered any evidence to demonstrate that ordering the correct shades would have been unduly burdensome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that, at the time of the hearing, the Agency still had not installed the proper shades so that Complainant could use the track lighting. HT1 at 69. S2 testified that the Agency was in the process of building an office specific to Complainant's needs. HT2 at 163. However, the future promise of an accommodation did not absolve the Agency of its responsibilities to provide Complainant with an effective accommodation after April 23, 2003.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find that the Agency has failed to put forth any evidence to demonstrate that the AJ erred in finding S1, S2, and S3's testimony to not be credible. Accordingly, we find substantial evidence to support the AJ's determination that the Agency unreasonably delayed in providing Complainant with an effective accommodation after April 21, 2003 and therefore failed to act in good faith when it did not provide her with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120132563 (2015) (two and half month delay in replacing ergonomic chair constituted failure to accommodate). However, in <span class="Italic">Beatriz P. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120151092 (2017), a two-month delay in implementing a telework request as a reasonable accommodation did not constitute an unnecessary delay where the agency granted the accommodation within two weeks of the request, but required more time before implementation to coordinate telework for the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">A delay of more than a year and a half to provide a quiet work space as a reasonable accommodation was considered egregious in <span class="Italic">Michelle G. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120132463 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120122882 (2014), the Commission found that a two-month delay in providing an appropriate computer monitor was not an unreasonable delay, particularly where the supervisor had reassigned work during the wait:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 18, 2009, the day that Zoom Text was installed on Complainant's computer, S1 notified the EEO Manager and the HIMS Chief that Complainant's monitor was not sufficient for the Zoom Text magnification. She asked for the Zoom Text telephone number because she wanted to determine the proper monitor size for the magnification. The record establishes that Complainant and the Zoom Text trainer suggested a 27-inch monitor on March 9, 2009, and that S1 notified other Agency officials of the request on the same day. IRM initiated a purchase request on March 19, the request was approved on April 30, and the Agency ordered the monitor on May 4, 2009. Although the 56-calendar-day period between the March 9 request and the May 4 order does not demonstrate a commendably efficient response to a legitimate request for reasonable accommodation, it likewise does not demonstrate a discriminatory delay in this case. S1 supported Complainant's request for a larger monitor and, as the AJ noted, reassigned some of Complainant's work.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120131377 (2015), where an outside entity had to approve the accommodation due to security concerns:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that in late September 2009, Complainant requested a videophone directly from the Defense Department's Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) without going through his chain of command. In early October 2009, CAP approved Complainant's <span id="Page_1323"></span>request and agreed to fund the videophone. The Agency's Information Security Officer (ISO), was notified that CAP was providing a videophone for Complainant. The ISO stated that the Agency's security procedures required him to obtain approval for the installation of the videophone from the Enterprise Security Configuration Control Board (ESCCB), which is a Department level entity that ensures that external connections to the Agency's network infrastructure are secure. The ISO said that he sent the request to the ESCCB on October 13, 2009. The request was approved on December 16, 2009, and the videophone installation was completed on December 17, 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that Complainant was provided a reasonable accommodation when the videophone was installed on December 17, 2009. We also find that the delay in installing the phone was not unreasonable, as the Agency's policies require that external connections to the Agency's internal infrastructure, such as videophones, meet all security requirements and get prior approval from ESCCB. As a result, we find that the Agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether the agency has in fact delayed implementation of an accommodation to the point that it constitutes a denial of accommodation is a merit question that depends on the facts of the case. <span class="Italic">Talavera v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120093513 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's obligation is to act promptly on a reasonable accommodation request, but that does not necessarily mean immediately. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Selzer-Kerr v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991011 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will assume, without deciding, that complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1630.9(a), an agency is required to make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability, unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. In the present case, complainant requested that she not work in the CFS location because the fumes aggravated her asthma. Although the record reveals there was some delay and initially some denial of the request, complainant was reassigned to location 043 on February 24, 1997 until her resignation. Complainant's main contention appears to be that her request was not immediately granted. However, we note that although an employer must act expeditiously when a request for reasonable accommodation is made, the employer and individual may need to engage in the interactive process<span class="Italic">. See Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the American's With Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 1, 1999) at p. 19. Here, there is testimony that complainant's second line supervisor requested complainant produce sufficient medical documentation in support of her request. Ultimately, complainant's request was approved without unreasonable delay. As such, we agree with the AJ's finding that complainant failed to establish there was a genuine dispute in the record as to whether complainant was reasonably accommodated.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01970727 (2000), the complainant sought accommodation of her disability--multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). She made specific accommodation requests of the agency. The agency knew of the complainant's disability and did not contest it. Nor did it contest the fact that she was a "qualified individual" under the Rehabilitation Act. The Commission found that the agency violated the Act by not reasonably accommodating the complainant in <span class="Italic">Roberts</span>, stressing the importance of the agency working with the complainant to achieve its goal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts of this case illustrate a complete breakdown of the interactive process necessary in formulating a reasonable accommodation. Here, the agency itself admits that complainant requested an accommodation to her MCS as early as May 1994, yet it failed to engage in any discussions whatsoever as to how to accommodate her disability. For example, the ATM averred in her affidavit that "[she] was aware that [complainant] was sensitive to [fragrances] and wanted accommodations made. It wasn't a direct request for me to stop wearing perfume. It was a request for how to accommodate her condition."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If there were any question as to whether complainant required a particular accommodation, the agency should have solicited additional medical information from her much earlier than it actually did<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Randel v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03960061 (August 8, 1996) (agency on notice of disability required to solicit necessary additional information from employee). Instead, the agency ignored its obligation until complainant submitted a "formal" request for an accommodation. At that time, agency officials maintained that they did not have medical documentation, despite the fact that she submitted documentation in June 1994, and despite testimony that they were "acutely aware" of her health problem and desire for a fragrance free environment. In that regard, we remind the agency that when requesting an accommodation, an individual may use "plain English" and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase "reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation &#x0026; Undue Hardship</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at p. 8 (March 1, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of these facts, we find that the agency failed to properly investigate whether an accommodation could be made. If it was determined that the requested accommodation, a fragrance free environment was impossible, it was incumbent on the agency to engage in an interactive process to determine, what, if any accommodations could be provided so that complainant could perform the essential functions of her job. Specifically, the record is devoid of any evidence as to whether the agency investigated whether complainant could have worked at home, been given the appropriate air filter, or could have had an office where contact with others could have been kept at a minimum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we find that complainant's request for an entirely fragrance free work environment would pose an undue hardship on the agency, the agency's responsibility did not end there, as discussed above. We further find the agency's argument that complainant failed to provide medical documentation in late 1995 to be disingenuous given the weight of evidence which reveals that the agency was well aware of complainant's illness and need for an air filter. As such, we find that the agency discriminated against complainant when it denied her a reasonable accommodation of an appropriate air filter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that some accommodation is ultimately provided does not remedy any delay in providing the accommodation, nor does it mean that accommodation is complete. In <span class="Italic">Ness v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981368 (2000), the Commission held that a light-duty position provided within four days of an arbitrator's order did not rectify the 10-month delay after the complainant requested accommodation. Likewise, it did not completely address the complainant's request for accommodation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ness</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency maintains that it fulfilled its duty under the Rehabilitation Act when it reassigned complainant to a light duty position, pursuant to the order of an Arbitrator, as stated herein. We disagree. The agency has failed to provide any evidence that from the time of his initial request, it engaged in the requisite, interactive process, and as a result of such process, concluded that complainant could not be reasonably accommodated in any position within the agency. It appears clear that prior to the Arbitrator's order, the agency refused to give meaningful consideration to complainant's request. Yet, when the Arbitrator ordered the agency to seek a light duty position for complainant within his medical restrictions, the agency was able to locate and offer complainant a light duty position within four days of the Arbitrator's decision. Moreover, even during that search, there is no indication that the agency attempted to engage in any interactive process with complainant or that it engaged in a good faith search to identify a position in complainant's grade, and within his medical restrictions<span class="Italic">. See Williams v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 019737 55 (September 11, 2000). Thus, while the agency may have complied with the Arbitrator's order by reassigning complainant to a vacant position ten months after he was denied a light duty position, this action cannot insulate the agency from its failure to provide complainant a reasonable accommodation at the onset. The Commission therefore concludes that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to consider complainant's initial request for reassignment to a light duty position, and ultimately terminating him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also reveals that while complainant's position prior to his termination entitled him to consecutive days off, he was placed in a light duty position with non-consecutive days off. Shortly thereafter, complainant requested consecutive days off as an accommodation in his new light duty position. Upon receiving this request, PM requested medical documentation to substantiate complainant's request. Complainant's physician provided the documentation requested by PM. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> footnote 4. PM, however, refused to grant the requested accommodation. The correspondence from PM provides no explanation as to why he did not accept complainant's physician's note. There is no record that PM or any other agency management official contested the sufficiency of the information justifying the need for two consecutive days off. To the contrary, it appears that PM did not believe complainant was impaired to any substantial degree, and he felt that complainant merely wanted his way and would reference his disability to avoid performing duties. Based on the record, the Commission concludes that PM failed to provide a reasonable accommodation when he refused to give complainant two consecutive days off. On remand, the agency shall confer with complainant in order to determine his various limitations, reexamine the available vacancies within complainant's grade, and, absent any undue hardship, place complainant in a position or arrange his existing schedule, such that he has two consecutive days off. Such a process shall be conducted in an expedited fashion, given the medical necessity for consecutive days off evident in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Pleasant v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01A52841 (2006). In that case, the complainant had requested a special chair as an accommodation for a back condition. In 18 months, the agency made only one attempt to provide a chair and, unfortunately, the complainant did not fit in the chair the agency purchased. The Commission concluded that "[w]hen that one effort failed, the agency gave up." The Commission had little difficulty in upholding the findings of its administrative judge that the agency had failed to provide reasonable accommodation or <span id="Page_1324"></span>make a good faith effort at accommodation. Interestingly, in <span class="Italic">Pleasant</span>, the Commission also upheld the judge's finding that the agency had discriminated against the complainant on the basis of race, color, sex and reprisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to issue (1), complainant's request for a chair, the AJ found that complainant was a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. The AJ found that complainant requested a reasonable accommodation, and yet the agency failed to provide her a chair for eighteen months. Specifically, the AJ found that the agency had not engaged in the interactive process with complainant in good faith. The AJ found that the record showed that complainant remained for over a year in a chair with protruding bolts. The AJ determined that the agency made only one real attempt to provide her a replacement chair, the "Aeron" chair, which unfortunately complainant did not fit into. When that one effort failed, the agency gave up. The AJ found that this did not satisfy the agency's obligation under the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, the AJ found that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act in imposing arbitrary and capricious limitations on the type of chair complainant could order (such as a $650.00 limitation, and the requirement that the chair be ergonomic, and the leather prohibition), and ultimately by giving up after only one actual effort to accommodate complainant. The AJ determined that no rational explanation was provided for the agency's course of action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to complainant's claim of failure to accommodate based on race, color, sex and reprisal, the AJ found that complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination as to all bases. The AJ determined that the agency's articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons were false or otherwise pretextual. Specifically, the AJ found the agency's reason to deny the chair, namely complainant's selection of a $995.00 chair from a catalogue, to be false. He found the agency's incorrect reliance on the supposition that the selected chair was leather was a pretext for discrimination since the chair was vinyl or cloth. Finally, the AJ found that the agency's statement that there was funding for only one choice of chair to be false, since the agency could have returned the "Aeron" chair and because the agency had allowed multiple choices for other employees. The AJ found that the agency's surrender to defeat after but one meaningful attempt to find complainant a chair denoted animus.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, there are cases where finding the appropriate accommodation can take a significant amount of time. In addition to examining the time that passes between the request for accommodation and the provision of accommodation, the Commission will also examine the agency's efforts during that time period. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01970394 (2000), the Commission found that nine months was not an inordinate delay in finding the appropriate accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the complainant takes issue with the fact that it took the agency some nine months, until January 1994, to find a reasonable accommodation. Under the Rehabilitation Act, it is anticipated that the search for a reasonable accommodation is an interactive process between the employer and the individual with a disability. When the parties are unaware of possible effective accommodations, there are outside sources to help find an answer<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, question 5. Here, the complainant initially asked for in-flight duties of his job to be eliminated, something which the agency explored but legally denied, and for reassignment. In compliance with the complainant's desire, the agency gathered information on his qualifications and promptly explored reassignment, but its repeated searches were unsuccessful. These repeated searches met the agency's Rehabilitation Act obligations to try to effectuate a reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the record establishes that the agency made appropriate efforts to find the complainant a reasonable accommodation, and when one was found, took timely action to implement it. As recounted in this decision, the agency never stopped trying to find a solution which would accommodate the complainant. It looked into restructuring his position, reassignment, held a Counseling Review Board meeting, prompted ATD to explore equipment modification, put the complainant in touch with another hearing impaired employee, contacted and worked with JAN, and tested the effectiveness of suggested equipment. Soon after the complainant obtained the molded hearing piece, the agency began the certification process with him using it. After the complainant was certified, he still did not return, citing problems unrelated to his hearing. Nevertheless, as the agency did throughout the process, it kept the complainant informed of its efforts while he was on sick leave for various reasons, including advanced sick leave.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Matthews v. EEOC</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30060.txt">07A30060</a> (2004), the Commission found that an administrative error in funding reasonable accommodation caused delay that should be attributed to the agency. However, in <span class="Italic">Matthews</span>, the Commission also found that the measures the agency took in the interim precluded that delay from violating the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the agency unduly delayed providing complainant with the funds so that an ergonomic study could have been conducted and changes implemented. Complainant requested an ergonomic study to be performed on her workstation in May 1999. The agency initially authorized that study the same month. The record is unclear what exactly happened, however, it is certain that money set aside for the ergonomic study became lost due to an administrative mix up. The record shows that the DC secured a second money transfer in November 1999. At that time, complainant could make an appointment with an ergonomic consultant and the study could be conducted. While the AJ found that the administrative error was understandable, she found that it was unclear as to why no agency officials took steps to uncover the problem earlier considering complainant's condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer should respond expeditiously to a request for reasonable accommodation. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (revised October 17, 2002) at question 10.

Id.</span> In determining whether there has been an unnecessary delay in responding to a request for reasonable accommodation, relevant factors would include: (1) the reason(s) for delay, (2) the length of the delay, (3) how much the individual with a disability and the employer each contributed to the delay, (4) what the employer was doing during the delay, and (5) whether the required accommodation was simple or complex to provide<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at n.38. Based on these factors, it is clear that the agency delayed in providing complainant with the funds necessary to conduct an ergonomic study. The only reason for the delay was an administrative error on the agency's part. The delay was for over eight months. The delay in providing such a simple request is completely attributed to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the analysis does not stop there. During the delay, as noted above, the agency provided other accommodations that would allow complainant to perform her position. The agency made available notetakers and other assistance. During the relevant time, the agency modified complainant's intake assignment. When it was complainant's turn to do intake, if she did not feel well, the agency would skip her name and just go to the next person on the list. The agency also provided complainant with advanced sick leave and the desk she requested. Therefore, although there was an unwarranted delay in conducting the ergonomic study, the agency worked with complainant in order to provide other reasonable accommodations. Accordingly, we conclude that the AJ erred in concluding that the delay amounted to a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Rabby v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120071659 (2008) (excusing the agency's delay in providing a reasonable accommodation where the delay resulted from the complainant's own insistence on the assistant having certain credentials, there was difficulty finding a qualified applicant, the ultimate selectee's security clearance was delayed because of questions about foreign influence and, in the interim, the agency had provided the complainant with assistive devices).</p>
<p class="noindent">In evaluating whether an agency timely provided reasonable accommodation, the Commission will look at the urgency of the need for accommodation and the difficulty of providing the accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Conner v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01996212 (2002), the Commission found the agency had not acted in a timely manner in providing accessibility to a restroom based, in part, upon the urgency of the complainant's need for accommodation. The Commission also found the agency's interim accommodation efforts were insufficient because they did not fully address the complainant's needs. The complainant, a paraplegic, could not enter the restroom without assistance because the door opened out. In addition to allowing the complainant to work at home as much as possible, the agency put a hook and chain on the restroom door so it could remain open. However, some employees would close the door for privacy and not fasten the hook and chain upon leaving. Although the agency ultimately provided a permanent accommodation by removing the door and installing a wall for privacy, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Connor</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the Flexiplace agreement that permitted complainant to work at home, along with the interim solution of the door hook and chain, reasonably accommodated complainant until the permanent solution to the access problem was reached. The agency stresses that the Flexiplace agreement was open ended and had in no way been rescinded as of the time in question in this matter (May 1995 to May 1996). Nevertheless, the agency concedes that as it became apparent that the door hook and chain was not a permanent solution, other solutions needed to be pursued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, the Commission finds that the focus must be on the agency's accommodation of complainant while he was at Building 5A. To this extent, the agency's focus on the Flexiplace arrangement is irrelevant. Complainant pointed out, on appeal, that even with the Flexiplace agreement, which had nothing to do with his accessibility accommodation request, he worked in Building 5A fairly frequently. He pointed out that from May 5, 1995, the day he first began reporting to <span id="Page_1325"></span>work at Building 5A, there were a total of 150 workdays for the remainder of the year. He was present in the office and in need of access to the restroom on 96 of those days. When complainant first came back to work for the months of May and June, he estimated he came to the office in Building 5A around three days per week. Similarly, during 1996 there were 96 workdays from the beginning of the calendar year until he injured his neck on May 20, 1996. Of those workdays, he worked at Building 5A on 71 days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next matter to be discussed is whether the hook and chain mechanism was an effective accommodation. First, complainant had access to the men's restroom only when the door was open and the chain was hooked. Complainant could not hook the door by himself. He could not access the men's restroom unless the hook was left attached with the door in the open position or he got someone to hook the door open, when he needed to get in. Complainant indicated that on the occasions that the door was not left open, even though the hook had been installed to leave the door open, the majority of the time it was because the people using the restroom wanted privacy that they could only have with the door closed. Sometimes complainant could not get in because no one was around to assist him. If it was fair weather, complainant would go outside and relieve himself in the parking lot. On days when he could not go outside, his catheter and drainage bag would end up wetting himself (due to overflow). Even the agency appears to concede that the hook and chain was not a permanent solution and was only an interim measure. Accordingly, in view of the above, especially since complainant was dependent on others for access to the men's restroom, the fact that others were not always available to assist him, ensuing consequences when this was the case, and the concern for privacy, we conclude that the hook and chain was not effective and thus not a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer should respond expeditiously to a request for reasonable accommodation. EEOC Reasonable Accommodation Guidance at 19.

Id.</span> at n.35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We thus note that the hook and chain appear to have been installed in the late summer of 1995. The agency states the date to be in July 1995. Therefore, complainant was without any accommodation for at least several months. The agency gave no reason for the delay. A person's need to eliminate waste is an immediate need and complainant's need for a reasonable accommodation, in terms of a readily accessible men's restroom, should have been correspondingly a necessary priority by the agency. The installation of the hook and chain could have been easily accomplished by the agency. Certainly, complainant cannot be blamed for the delay. Indeed, complainant argues that it was he who had the hook and chain installed with the help of a friendly Public Works Department employee. Even if the hook and chain were a method of reasonable accommodation and they were installed at the initiative of the agency, the agency's timing was not reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On or about January 16, 1997, complainant met with management and again discussed the men's restroom door problem. As a result of that January 1997 meeting, no later than February 1997, work was completed making the men's restroom accessible to complainant. Essentially, the door of the men's room was permanently removed and a privacy wall extended. Only then was the men's restroom readily accessible. However, the Disability Coordinator indicated he believed the Public Works Department, which was responsible for making the men's restroom accessible, just sat on the matter. He also stated that this was pursuant to a work order which they had for over a year. The agency acknowledged in its reply to complainant's appeal that a work order had been forwarded to the Public Works Department in June 1995 for various accessibility revisions to the fixtures inside the Building 5 men's restroom which included a line calling for "[u]pgrade bathroom door openings and closings to meet ADA requirements," but did not specify specific action for the door. Even if the hook and chain were an appropriate interim accommodation, the agency has in no way justified why it took until February 1997 to finally provide effective access for complainant to the men's restroom. Although complainant was on leave after May 1996, there is still insufficient justification why the agency could not have effectively accommodated complainant before that date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to provide complainant effective access to the men's restroom in a timely manner. We therefore find that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to provide complainant reasonable accommodation in a timely manner.</p>
