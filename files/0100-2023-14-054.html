<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-54"><span class="space">2.</span> Execution of Terms</h4>
<p class="noindent">When a settlement agreement does not provide a specific time period within which an agency will execute the terms, the Commission will find "that a provision without time periods is generally understood to require compliance within a reasonable amount of time." <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A21146 (2003); <span class="Italic">Allingham v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991423 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Siederman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986939 (2000) (a failure to implement the terms within two to three years of the agreement is a breach); <span class="Italic">Green v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963482 (1997) (finding that the agency should be required to comply with the terms of the agreement where the agreement was silent on the time for compliance and more than one year had passed); <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05930921 (1994) (it was not reasonable for the agency to delay for a year prior to providing the agreed-upon training). <span class="Italic">Cf. Woodlief v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01972937 (1997) (issuance of a performance award within 84 days of the settlement was compliance within a reasonable period of time).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission summarized its position of breach allegations involving time limits in agreements in <span class="Italic">Crutcher v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112172 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Failure to perform in accordance with deadlines specified in a contract does not necessarily constitute a breach of contract. Time is not ordinarily of the essence in a contract unless made so by express stipulation or unless there is something connected with the purpose of the contract and the circumstances surrounding it which makes it apparent that the contracting parties intended that the contract must be performed at or within the time named. <span class="Italic">Garzino v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120072847 (Sept. 27, 2007). Failure to satisfy a time frame specified in a settlement agreement does not prevent a finding of substantial compliance, especially when all required actions were subsequently completed, and the Complainant has not shown that she was harmed by the delay.<span class="Italic"> Lazarte v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01954274 (April 25, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">Absent a showing of bad faith, an agency will not be found in breach of an agreement where it complies with the terms of the agreement within a reasonable amount of time. In <span class="Italic">Funari v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01941807 (1994), the complainant alleged a breach of a settlement agreement providing that his performance appraisal would be upgraded, when the agency did not complete the upgrade in time for a subsequent promotion profile. The Commission found no breach of the plain language of the agreement because there was no provision specifying when the agency would complete the upgrade. It further found there was no evidence of bad faith in <span class="Italic">Funari</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case the agency agreed to upgrade appellant's performance appraisal, but did not specifically state that the upgrade would be in time for the next promotion profile. Under a "plain meaning" interpretation of the agreement the agency did not breach the agreement when it failed to upgrade the appraisal in time for the next profile. If appellant had wanted the upgrade to be accomplished by a particular time, he should have assured that such terms were to be included in the written agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, a requirement of acting in good faith on the part of the agency and appellant can be presumed as a part of this agreement<span class="Italic">. See generally Stringfield v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01914018 (February 28, 1992); <span class="Italic">Buckley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01913564 (September 17, 1991). Thus, if the agency had deliberately delayed the upgrade of the appellant's performance appraisal so as to deny him a promotion, then the agency would not have acted in good faith with respect to the terms of the agreement and would be in breach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the mediator by affidavit indicated that in the ordinary course of things, it takes thirty or more days to adjust a promotion profile based on a new appraisal. Under these circumstances, where the new appraisal was entered into the system in approximately 16 days, we do not find that the agency acted in bad faith and the agency was therefore not in breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In considering whether an agency complied within a reasonable amount of time, the Commission will review the agency's actions to determine whether efforts at compliance were made. For example, in <span class="Italic">Young v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01971013 (1997), the Commission found the agency was not in breach of an agreement providing that it would remove all references to the complainant's mental evaluations from its files. All references to the evaluations were removed from the complainant's personnel files, but the medical documents still existed in a sequestered file awaiting authorization for their destruction. The agreement provided for execution of its terms within 30 days. In response to the allegation of breach in <span class="Italic">Young</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the term of the settlement agreement at issue is that "all references involving mental evaluations [shall] be removed from Army files." The agency contends that it has complied with this provision by deleting all references to mental evaluations from appellant's files, notwithstanding that physical documents withdrawn from appellant's health file are still in existence in a secure location, awaiting authorization from the Medical Command for their destruction. Appellant contends that the continuing existence of these physical documents constitutes a breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency is not in breach of the settlement agreement. The references to mental evaluations have been removed from appellant's files, in conformance with the settlement agreement. As clearly intended by the settlement agreement, no third party perusing any of appellant's files would find references to mental evaluations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the continuing existence of medical documents pertaining to the mental evaluations, the settlement agreement does not expressly provide for their immediate destruction. Given the potential ramifications of the destruction of medical records, the Commission finds it neither unreasonable, nor a breach of the settlement agreement, for hospital personnel to remove these documents from appellant's file, secure them <span id="Page_377"></span>in another location, and await proper authorization from the Medical Command to destroy the documents.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another factor the Commission will consider in determining if the agency executed the terms of the agreement within a reasonable period of time is the ministerial nature of the acts required. For example, in <span class="Italic">Pezzillo v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A21394 (2002), the Commission found breach of the agreement where the agency delayed in expunging the records of the complainant's removal and replacing them with records reflecting a voluntary resignation. The Commission found that the delay of a year for "routine actions" was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lazarte v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01954274 (1996), the Commission rejected the complainant's contention that the agency breached his settlement agreement where the agency completed all of the agreed-upon actions, but not within the agreed-upon time frames. The Commission stated the agency was in "substantial compliance" and the complainant had not shown he was harmed by the missed deadlines. The <span class="Italic">Lazarte</span> case does leave one wondering about the point of negotiating deadlines for performance if they are to be disregarded. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">McBryde v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A11581 (2001) (finding "substantial compliance" where the agency did not make performance appraisal changes within the agreed upon 60-day time period); <span class="Italic">Owens v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01955828 (1996) (holding that the agency was in "substantial compliance" where the settlement check was issued after a 30-day time limit provided for in the agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, there are circumstances beyond an agency's control when it comes to complying with time limits in settlement agreements. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120140374 (2014), the Commission rejected an enforcement action where a government sequestration and mandated furloughs were responsible for the delay in compliance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency acknowledged unusual circumstances, noting that following execution of the settlement agreement, the Agency was subject to government-wide sequestration and mandated furloughs, delayed the payment of funds owed to Complainant. The record contains documentation from an Agency supervising accounting technician indicating that the 5175.00 payment to Complainant payment identified by tracking number 041036009637051 was processed on November 20, 2013. In addition, the record contains a copy of an Agency invoice confirming the payment of the sum of 5175.00 to Complainant on November 20. 2013. Under the circumstances, we find that the time period between the execution of the Agreement and the Agency's compliance was reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">It does appear there are some limitations that will be placed on agencies for failing to timely comply with settlement provisions. Interestingly enough, the case arises from a settlement agreement that did not contain a specific deadline for performance by the agency. But even in the absence of a specific time provision, the Commission found that failure to issue a determination of compensatory damages within 300 days of settlement constituted bad faith. In <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01961794 (1996), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the settlement agreement does not specifically state a date by which the agency shall issue its determination regarding compensatory damages. In the absence of a specific time frame, the agency is nonetheless required to act within a reasonable amount of time<span class="Italic">. See Gomez v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930921 (February 10, 1994) (where time frame for fulfillment of terms of settlement agreement is not specified, terms must be fulfilled within a reasonable amount of time); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Department of Defense</span> (DLA), EEOC Request No. 05910576 (August 29, 1991) (agreement that did not specify length of service for position to which appellant was promoted was not breached by the temporary detail of appellant two years after execution of the agreement). The Commission finds that the agency's failure to issue its determination within 300 calendar days after execution of the settlement agreement constitutes a failure to act within a reasonable amount of time and, therefore, also constitutes a breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, the bad news is that there is no real remedy for the breach. The Commission rejected the complainant's argument that he was entitled to the full amount of compensatory damages as relief. Instead, the complainant could choose "specific enforcement" or reinstatement of his complaint. The Commission did not explain how it could specifically enforce a provision that was already breached by failure to promptly implement it. And, as usual, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> was left in the position that he still had no decision on the amount of damages. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01966314 (1998) (the failure to issue a decision on damages after two years was considered a breach); <span class="Italic">Chae v. Secretary of Agriculture,</span> 01950563 (1997) (the agency breached the settlement agreement by not issuing a decision on compensatory damages by the agreed-upon time limit, but the only remedy was to remand to the agency for a decision); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01962834 (1996) (the failure to issue a decision on compensatory damages under the settlement agreement after one year was considered breach of the agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hall v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961112 (1996), the Commission held that the agency's failure to execute the terms of a settlement agreement within nine months constituted a breach. In that case, the agency agreed to designate a specific parking space for the complainant and erect a sign identifying it as restricted to parking for disabled individuals. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Stella K. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120160137 (2017) (15-month delay in crediting the complainant's sick leave pursuant to a settlement agreement constituted breach).</p>
<p class="noindent">Though the Commission has tended to liberal in its interpretation of what constitutes a reasonable amount of time for execution of settlement terms, there are occasions where that time period is not lengthy. For example, in <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A31834 (2003), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the language of provisions 1 and 2 is clear and unambiguous, and based on its "plain meaning," we find that each provision specifically requires the agency to submit a request for restoration of leave within ten days of the execution of the settlement agreement. The agency admits that it did not comply with this provision for nearly two months; however, the agency asserts that it excused its delayed performance on a referenced "mis-communication" between certain offices. However, lacking any sort of explanation to describe the claimed "mis-communication," we find that the agency did not justify its failure to timely submit the requests at issue. Moreover, we also disagree with the agency's view that it cured the breach when it ultimately submitted these requests two months late, given that as of March 11, 2003, nearly six months after execution, complainant submits evidence supporting a determination that her leave has not been restored as required by provisions 1 and 2. Notwithstanding the agency's arguments to the contrary, we find that under the circumstances of this case, neither a 124-day, nor for that matter an approximately six-month compliance period for provisions 1 and 2 may be deemed "reasonable." In particular, we find that the inclusion of a ten-day time limit for submission of the request for restoration by the agency may sensibly be construed as evidence that the parties intended that complainant's leave would be restored as quickly as administratively possible.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, the Commission found that the agency's failure to comply with a settlement provision by only a few days constituted breach because the Commission found that the terms of the agreement should be interpreted to mean that "time was of the essence." In <span class="Italic">McVeigh v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A33893 (2004), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding provision 1, we find that the settlement agreement was executed on December 30, 2002, and that this provision obligated the agency to tender a substantial payment to complainant the next day. While the Commission would normally concur with the agency that a slight delay in payment, beyond December 30, 2002, would still result in substantial compliance, or cure of a minor breach of the provision, we find that "time was of the essence," given that provision 1 states: "The first payment of $75,000.00 is to be made no later than December 31, 2002." (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we determine that because "time was of the essence," and the agency agreed to make this payment 'on time,' its failure to do so, by even a few days, constitutes a breach of provision 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, we find that while complainant contends that he incurred a tax liability associated with this payment, he does not quantify it, nor does he otherwise provide evidence to support his contention. We note that provision 2 designates the sums paid in provision 1 as a non-taxable award. While we find that provision 2 cannot guarantee how the Internal Revenue Service may treat these sums, without evidence to the contrary, we find that this designation, documented in the settlement agreement, further diminishes complainant's bare claim that he incurred tax consequences because of the agency's late payment of the first sum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, while we find that the agency breached provision 1, on the current record, we must conclude that it was a harmless breach. For this reason, we affirm the agency's determination that, to date, it substantially satisfied its obligations under provision 1.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the settlement agreement contains a provision that the complainant will be returned to work by a certain date, the proper remedy for breach is to award the complainant back pay from the date to that date of actual reinstatement to work. <span class="Italic">Rathburn v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05726 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that although there was no time frame specified in the settlement agreement, it was breached when the agency took over a year to implement two of the provisions in <span class="Italic">Keller v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01992447 (2000). Of significance to the Commission in <span class="Italic">Keller</span> was that implementation of the provisions should have been relatively simple, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the agency "merely had to change the performance standards of complainant and provide sensitivity training to all employees," and did not have to calculate complicated monetary damages or take other action where a delay might be unavoidable. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gladney v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996323 (2001) (there was no breach where the agency took five months to request and process a lump sum payment).</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Kessler v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962870 (1997), the Commission found that the agency had not breached its settlement agreement even though it still had not paid the agreed-upon back pay over four and a half years later:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 16, 1991, appellant and the agency entered into a settlement <span id="Page_378"></span>agreement to resolve appellant's pending EEO complaint. By letter dated October 26, 1995, appellant informed the agency that he believed the settlement agreement had been breached. Specifically, appellant contends that the agency breached the agreement because the monies which appellant was paid were not paid within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a thorough review of the record, the Commission finds that the agency did not breach the terms of the settlement agreement when "the monies which [appellant] was to be paid were not paid within a reasonable time." First, the agency noted in its final decision that a good portion of the delay in receiving the back pay award was caused by appellant's futile attempt to retain his retirement lump sum payment; it also admits that its own restructuring contributed to the delay. Further, we note that the agreement itself includes no time limit on the back pay award. The Commission determines that, to the extent that appellant had an expectation as to the time frame for such an award, it should have been reduced to writing as part of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In recent cases, the Commission has held that an award of interest may be appropriate when an agency does not execute the terms of an agreement within the time specified. See "<a href="0100-2023-14-082.html#sec5-82">Interest as Sanction</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, the Commission has held that an agreement is not voided by the complainant's failure to meet a time frame in the complaint where there is substantial compliance. For example, in <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60084 (2006), the settlement agreement called for the complainant to submit a clearance for return to duty by a date certain. The agency refused to comply with the agreement when the complainant was eight days late in submitting the form. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we have held that when an agency fails to comply within the time frames contained in a settlement agreement, the failure to satisfy a time frame specified in a settlement agreement does not prevent a finding of substantial compliance of its terms, especially when all required actions were subsequently completed. <span class="Italic">Lazarte v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01954274 (April 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Sortino v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950721 (November 21, 1996), <span class="Italic">citing Baron v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05930277 (September 30, 1993) (Two week delay in transfer of official letter of regret rather than letter of apology found to be substantial compliance); <span class="Italic">Centore v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> Appeal No. 01A04637 (November 2, 2000) (A few days after sixty day time period for compliance not a material breach of settlement agreement). Therefore, in this context, we decline to hold complainant to a stricter standard than we enforce when agencies fail to satisfy a specified time frame and find that complainant substantially satisfied the conditions of the agreement when she submitted a CA-17 form clearing her to work full regular duty without restrictions on April 26, 2005...</p>
