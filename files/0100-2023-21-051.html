<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-47"><span class="space">18.</span> "Reasonable Person" vs. "Reasonable Woman"</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sexual harassment, like beauty, may be in the eyes of the beholder. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals came very close to adopting such a standard in sexual harassment cases. In <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872 (9th Cir. 1991), the court adopted a so-called "reasonable woman" standard in evaluating whether the plaintiff's factual allegations, if proved true, would be deemed to create a hostile environment. Although the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> adopted an objective requirement in the hostile environment test, it used a "reasonable person" standard. The Court made no reference to the <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> decision and specifically indicated that the test it was articulating "need not answer today all the potential questions it raises...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> But, ultimately <span class="Italic">Harris</span> made clear that in applying the objective test, the reasonable person takes on the characteristics of the victim. Is there a difference between a test that employs a "reasonable woman" standard and one that uses a "reasonable person" with the characteristics of the victim? Probably not, but the "reasonable woman" test adopted by the <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> court, as well as a few other courts, is discussed below. Whether it is truly different from the reasonable person standard is difficult to determine. Several courts have held that the reasonable person standard is to be applied from the victim's perspective. It would seem the reasonable person standard would take into account the gender of the victim. But, the <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> court rebuffed the reasonable person standard as having a built-in male bias.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, a federal employee, attracted the attentions of an unwanted admirer. On several occasions, she was asked out by a coworker and declined. Next came written messages and letters. The employee complained to her supervisor and the offending coworker was counseled. The plaintiff then left for four weeks of training during which the coworker sent her a card and a lengthy letter that stated, in part, that she was worth knowing "with or without sex." The employee again brought the matter to the attention of her supervisor and the coworker was transferred to another office.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the coworker filed a grievance and was returned to the original worksite. The plaintiff then filed a sexual harassment complaint and obtained a temporary transfer. During that transfer, she received one additional letter from the coworker.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency found no discrimination and the Commission upheld that finding. The employee filed suit in U.S. district court. The district court granted summary judgment to the agency, finding that the plaintiff had not alleged a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of hostile environment harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a 2-1 decision, a panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court in <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> and remanded the case for trial, stating whether a hostile environment existed had to be assessed from the point of view of the "victim." The majority in <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 924 F.2d at 876-80, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e believe that in evaluating the severity and pervasiveness of sexual harassment, we should focus on the perspective of the victim. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 898 F.2d at 537; EEOC Compliance Manual (CCH) &#x00A7; 615, &#x00B6; 3112, Ch. at 3242 (1988) (courts "should consider the victim's perspective and not stereotyped notions of acceptable behavior.") If we only examined whether a reasonable person would engage in allegedly harassing conduct, we would run the risk of reinforcing the prevailing level of discrimination. Harassers could continue to harass merely because a particular discriminatory practice was common, and victims of harassment would have no remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore prefer to analyze harassment from the victim's perspective. A complete understanding of the victim's view requires, among other things, an analysis of the different perspectives of men and women. Conduct that many men consider unobjectionable may offend many women. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico</span>., 864 F.2d 881, 898 (1st Cir. 1988) ("A male supervisor might believe, for example, that it is legitimate for him to tell a female subordinate that she has a 'great figure' or 'nice legs.' The female subordinate, however, may find such comments offensive"); <span class="Italic">Yates</span>, 819 F.2d at 637, n.2 ("men and women are vulnerable in different ways and offended by different behavior"). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Ehreneich</span>, "Pluralist Myths and Powerless Men: The Ideology of Reasonableness in Sexual Harassment Law," 99 Yale L.J. 1177, 1207-1208 (1990) (men tend to view some forms of sexual harassment as "harmless social interactions to which only overly-sensitive women would object"); <span class="Italic">Abrams</span>, "Gender Discrimination and the Transformation of Workplace Norms," 42 Vand. L.Rev. 1183, 1203 (1989) (the characteristically male view depicts sexual harassment as comparatively harmless amusement). We realize that there is a broad range of viewpoints among women as a group, but we believe that many women share common concerns which men do not necessarily share. For example, because women are disproportionately victims of rape and sexual assault, women have a stronger incentive to be concerned with sexual behavior. Women who are victims of mild forms of sexual harassment may understandably worry whether a harasser's conduct is merely a prelude to violent sexual assault. Men, who are rarely victims of sexual assault, may view sexual conduct in a vacuum without a full appreciation of the social setting or the underlying threat of violence that a woman may perceive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to shield employers from having to accommodate the idiosyncratic concerns of the rare hyper-sensitive employee, we hold that a female plaintiff states a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of hostile environment sexual harassment when she alleges conduct which a reasonable woman would consider sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment. <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1482 (sexual harassment must detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex as the victim); <span class="Italic">Yates</span>, 819 F.2d at 637 (adopting "reasonable woman" standard set out in <span class="Italic">Rabidue</span>, 805 F.2d 611, 626 (Keith, J. dissenting)); "Comment, Sexual Harassment Claims of Abusive Work Environment Under Title VII," 97 Harv. L.Rev. 1449, 1459 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">State v. Wanrow</span>, 88 Wash.2d 221, 239-241, 559 P.2d 548, 558-559 (1977) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (adopting reasonable woman standard for self defense).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We adopt the perspective of a reasonable woman primarily because we believe that a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-biased and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women. The reasonable woman standard does not establish a higher level of protection for women than men. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Co.</span>, 444 F.2d 1219, 1225-1227 (9th Cir. 1971) (invalidating under Title VII paternalistic state labor laws restricting employment opportunities for women). Instead, a gender-conscious examination of sexual harassment enables women to participate in the workplace on an equal footing with men. By acknowledging and not trivializing the effects of sexual harassment on reasonable women, courts can work towards ensuring that neither men nor women will have to "run a gauntlet of sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living." <span class="Italic">Henson v. Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 902 (11th Cir. 1982). We note that the reasonable victim standard we adopt today classifies conduct as unlawful sexual harassment even when harassers do not realize that their conduct creates a hostile working environment. Well-intentioned compliments by co-workers or supervisors can form the basis of a sexual harassment cause of action if a reasonable victim of the same sex as the plaintiff would consider the comments sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a condition of employment and create an abusive working environment. That is because Title VII is not a fault-based tort scheme. "Title VII is aimed at the consequences or effects of an employment practice and not at the...motivation" of co-workers or employers. <span class="Italic">Rogers</span>, 454 F.2d at 239; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 432, 91 S. Ct. 849, 854, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971) (the absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem an otherwise unlawful employment practice). To avoid liability under Title VII, employers may have to educate and sensitize their workforce to eliminate conduct which a reasonable victim would consider unlawful sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(f) ("Prevention is the best tool for the elimination of sexual harassment.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot say as a matter of law that Ellison's reaction was idiosyncratic or hyper-sensitive. We believe that a reasonable woman could have had a similar reaction. After receiving the first bizarre note from Gray, a person she barely knew, Ellison asked a co-worker to tell Gray to leave her <span id="Page_849"></span>alone. Despite her request, Gray sent her a long, passionate, disturbing letter. He told her he had been "watching" and "experiencing" her; he made repeated references to sex; he said he would write again. Ellison had no way of knowing what Gray would do next. A reasonable woman could consider Gray's conduct, as alleged by Ellison, sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter a condition of employment and create an abusive working environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sexual harassment is a major problem in the workplace. Adopting the victim's perspective ensures that courts will not "sustain ingrained notions of reasonable behavior fashioned by the offenders." <span class="Italic">Lipsett</span>, 864 F.2d at 898, quoting <span class="Italic">Rabidue</span>, 805 F.2d at 626 (Keith, J., dissenting). Congress did not enact Title VII to codify prevailing sexist prejudices. To the contrary, "Congress designed Title VII to prevent the perpetuation of stereotypes and a sense of degradation which serve to close or discourage employment opportunities for women." <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1483.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hope that over time both men and women will learn what conduct offends reasonable members of the other sex. When employers and employees internalize the standard of workplace conduct we establish today, the current gap in perception between the sexes will be bridged.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a dissent to the <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> opinion, 924 F.2d at 883-84, Judge Stephens wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nowhere in section 2000e of Title VII, the section under which the plaintiff in this case brought suit, is there any indication that Congress intended to provide for any other than equal treatment in the area of civil rights. The legislation is designed to achieve a balanced and generally gender neutral and harmonious workplace which would improve production and the quality of the employees' lives. In fact, the Supreme Court has shown a preference against systems that are not gender or race neutral, such as hiring quotas. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.</span>, 488 U.S. 469, 109 S. Ct. 706, 102 L. Ed.2d 854 (1989). While women may be the most frequent targets of this type of conduct that is at issue in this case, they are not the only targets. I believe that it is incumbent upon the court in this case to use terminology that will meet the needs of all who seek recourse under this section of Title VII. Possible alternatives that are more in line with a gender neutral approach include "victim," "target," or "person."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "reasonable man" as it is used in the law of torts, traditionally refers to the average adult person, regardless of gender, and the conduct that can reasonably be expected of him or her. For the purposes of the legal issues that are being addressed, such a term assumes that it is applicable to all persons. Section 2000e of Title VII presupposes the use of a legal term that can apply to all persons and the impossibility of a more individually tailored standard. It is clear that the authors of the majority opinion intend a difference between the "reasonable woman" and the "reasonable man" in Title VII cases on the assumption that men do not have the same sensibilities as women. This is not necessarily true. A man's response to circumstances faced by women and their effect upon women can be and in given circumstances may be expected to be understood by men.</p>
<p class="noindent">Judge Stephens believed the case should be remanded for trial on the facts, but the question of whether sexual harassment occurred should be evaluated under a gender-neutral standard.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Frick v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920272 (1992), the Commission reaffirmed its use of the "reasonable person" standard without reference to the <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> decision or a "reasonable woman" standard. However, it should be noted that the conduct in that case did not require assessment by any special standard.</p>
<p class="noindent">The courts have split on whether a jury must be instructed on the "reasonable person" or "reasonable woman" standard. In <span class="Italic">Crowe v. Wiltel Communications Systems</span>, 103 F.3d 897 (9th Cir. 1996), the court held that it was error for the district court to instruct the jury under a "reasonable person" standard. However, in <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Bowden</span>, 105 F.3d 1344 (11th Cir. 1997), the court held that it was not error for the district court to rescind a "reasonable woman" instruction and instead advise the jury to use a "reasonable person" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent">The debate, however, may largely be one of semantics since the courts seem to be in agreement that where a "reasonable person" standard is used, that theoretical person must have the same fundamental characteristics as the plaintiff. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gillming v. Simmons Industries</span>, 91 F.3d 1168 (8th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">DeAngelis v. El Paso Municipal Police Officers Ass'n</span>, 51 F.3d 591 (5th Cir. 1995). It is hard to imagine that the fundamental characteristics of a person do not include his or her sex. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services</span>, 523 U.S. 75, 118 S. Ct. 998, 1103, 140 L. Ed.2d 207 (1996) (citing<span class="Italic"> Harris, supra</span> ("We have emphasized, moreover, that the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering 'all the circumstances.'")).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pierson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120063611 (2007), the Commission demonstrated how viewing the conduct under the reasonable person standard from the victim's perspective factors into the hostile environment analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no question complainant is a member of a statutorily protected class. There is also no question that she was subjected to unwelcome conduct related to her sex. Despite being put on notice in October 2003 that the hair brushing incident was inappropriate, S1 continued his misconduct by sitting so close to complainant that their arms and legs would touch. S1 denies doing this, but three eyewitnesses testify that S1 would sit very close to complainant and "hover" over her constantly in a way that would make any woman feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. Complainant further claims that S1 would reach across her desk for things in such a manner that he would always touch her shoulders or other body parts, again causing her to feel uncomfortable. Eyewitnesses corroborate this claim as well. According to these witnesses, S1 would often reach across complainant's desk, even though he did not do so with his other subordinates. Finally, complainant claims that S1 twice brushed complainant's back and buttocks while passing her down a very narrow hallway. Once more, a witness corroborates this claim, testifying that she observed S1 pass complainant down the narrow hallway without trying to clear space to avoid touching her. Based on this evidence and on the sexual nature of his actions, we conclude that S1's unwelcome conduct towards complainant was based on her sex. Accordingly, the first three prongs of a sexual harassment claim are met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning now to the fourth prong, we note that whether or not an objectively hostile or abusive work environment exists is based on whether a reasonable person in complainant's circumstances would have found the alleged behavior to be hostile or abusive. The incidents must have been "sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the conditions of complainant's employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.,</span> 23 U.S. 75 (1998). To ascertain this, we look at the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; whether it was hostile or patently offensive; whether the alleged harasser was a co-worker or a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See Harris,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, EEOC Notice No. N-915-050 (Mar. 19, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the agency that S1's conduct did not have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with complainant's work performance. Quite the contrary, a reasonable person would find that the cumulative effect of S1's actions created a hostile work environment. S1 tested the limits of acceptable workplace behavior with a female subordinate, undeterred by any of the agency's efforts to stop him. It is not surprising or unreasonable to expect that such frequent, imprudent behavior would interfere with a female subordinate's work performance. Moreover, we reject the agency's excuse that S1's behavior was inadvertent. His particular actions were too targeted to be unintentional. As discussed <span class="Italic">infra,</span> management's further compounded the severity of S1's conduct by not putting an end to the offensive behavior. In light of these circumstances, we conclude the alleged harassment created a hostile work environment for complainant.</p>
