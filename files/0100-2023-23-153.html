<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-149"><span class="space">C.</span> MEDICAL DISCLOSURES AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Information obtained by agencies through medical inquiries and examinations must be kept confidential. Release or disclosure of such information is limited to certain persons and situations. Under 29 CFR 1630.14(c):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Information obtained under paragraph (c) of this section regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and be treated as a confidential medical record, except that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;Government officials investigating compliance with this part shall be provided relevant information on request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;Information obtained under paragraph (c) of this section regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with this part.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similar restrictions on information collected from applicants for employment are set forth at 29 CFR 1630.14(b).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary that the details of an employee's medical condition be shared. A disclosure can be as simple sharing that an employee is on leave due to medical reasons. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Shaniqua W. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019005129 (2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this matter, RMO1 acknowledged that he disclosed Complainant's absence as due to medical reasons. It was also clear that he disclosed this information during a meeting with seven directors. RMO1 also informed the EEO Investigator that he felt an obligation to explain Complainant's detail and absence to senior leadership. RMO1 attempts to explain the disclosure as only relaying information that Complainant had allowed him to relay in her September 16, 2015 email. However, there is nothing implicit in Complainant's email that allows RMO1 to release any medically related information about Complainant's status to anyone beyond the four individuals she had listed. The record demonstrated that Complainant had previously emailed RMO1 indicating that it would be acceptable to disclose her absence as medically related to just the four individuals that she most frequently worked with, and not the additional individuals present at the December 2015 staff meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge RMO1's statement that he did not provide explicit details of her condition, and that he only intended to relay what he believed Complainant wanted him too. However, there was no indication that the release of any medically related details regarding Complainant's absence was qualified under the limited exceptions to the confidentiality requirement. As such, we determine that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act with respect to claim 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant established that the Agency committed a violation of the Rehabilitation Act with respect to claim 6. However, Complainant failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that, more likely than not, the Agency subjected her to discrimination or retaliation in her remaining claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary for a complainant claiming a violation of the ADA <span id="Page_1247"></span>proscriptions against disclosure of medical information to prove that he or she is a qualified individual with a disability, or has any disability at all. <span class="Italic">Higgins v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A13571 (2003). "[T]he Rehabilitation Act does not limit the prohibitions against improper disclosure of confidential medical information to individuals with disabilities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">However, the disclosure of information must be specific. The disclosure of a complainant's medical diagnosis and symptoms to managers who do not need to know because of restrictions on the complainant's work or duties constitutes a prohibited medical disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Tyson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992086 (2002). But a general disclosure indicating that an employee is medically disqualified for a position does not constitute a disclosure of confidential medical information. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Dozbush v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01983929 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the agency told its managers that complainant was "medically disqualified" for the specialist position. In addition, after coworkers asked why complainant was not performing the duties of his position, they were also told that complainant was medically disqualified from performing those duties. By stating that he was medically disqualified, complainant alleged that the agency violated his rights under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our regulations provide that information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall be treated as a confidential medical record<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> However, insofar as complainant challenges the information given to the management employees in question, our regulations provide that supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as complainant challenges the managers' statements to fellow coworkers that complainant was not required to perform his usual duties because he was medically disqualified from doing so, under the particular facts of this matter, we find that such a statement did not violate the confidentiality provisions of the Rehabilitation Act. We note that not all such information falls within the proscription of a confidential medical record<span class="Italic">. Hampton v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A00132 (April 13, 2000). For example, we have previously concluded that a notation that an individual has taken sick leave or had a doctor's appointment is not confidential medical information. Here, we find that the phrase "medically disqualified" is used at the Federal Aviation Administration to refer to many types of conditions. Unlike a disclosure that someone is receiving a reasonable accommodation, the disclosure in this case does not indicate that complainant had a disability, since an individual may be "medically disqualified" from performing the duties of an air traffic controller for reasons unrelated to a disability. Therefore, under the facts of this matter, the use of the term "medically disqualified" did not even reveal that complainant had a particular condition, whether or not the condition constituted a disability. Of course, documentation of the individual's diagnosis or symptoms would be medical information. ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations"</span> (October 10, 1995) at 22 n.26. However, in the instant case, the term "medically disqualified" merely referred to complainant's work status. Finally, while we note that the managers' statements did not precisely conform with the responses suggested in subsequently-issued Commission Guidance on this issue, after a careful review of the record, we are unpersuaded that a violation of the confidentiality provisions of the Rehabilitation Act has occurred in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Timika O. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019005075 (2019) (postmaster openly discussing the complainant's request for extended leave did not state a claim where no medical information was disclosed); <span class="Italic">Cathy M. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120140008 (2016) (supervisor's statement to a prospective employer that the complainant was out on medical leave, without discussing the diagnoses, symptoms, or the specific nature of the complainant's impairment, did not violate the Rehabilitation Act); <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01997032 (2002) (disclosure of a complainant's light-duty status is not specific enough to constitute prohibited disclosure); <span class="Italic">Yanez v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 02980017 (2001) (noting an employee's continuation of pay status is not a specific disclosure of a medical record).</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether the disclosure of information is specific enough to violate the Rehabilitation Act may turn less on the actual words and more on the surrounding circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Becki P. V. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720180004 (2018), for instance, the Commission found a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act when, after a heated discussion the with complainant, a supervisor disclosed to a contract employee that the complainant was "on medication." The Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Becki P</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that S2 made a comment to a contract employee that Complainant is "on medication." We acknowledge that this statement did not disclose a specific diagnosis. We concur, however, with the AJ that the specific circumstances in the instant matter, along with the statement that Complainant is "on medication," implied that Complainant had a psychiatric or mental health condition. The record contains an affidavit from S2. Regarding the incident, S2 asserts that Complainant's behavior on the date in question (December 4, 2014) was "unstable and irrational." ROI at 222. Specifically, S2 asserts that "[Complainant] was clearly out of control and hysterical. By way of trying to calm her highly emotional state and to make an excuse for her unprofessional, irrational behavior, swearing and yelling, I ask[ed] [a named contractor] to overlook her behavior since she had taken some medication.... It was clear from her behavior that whatever medication she was taking was not working properly." ROI at 223.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record further reflects that Complainant provided S2 a note from her physician dated December 3, 2014. ROI at 154-155, 358. The note from Complainant's physician set forth that Complainant was excused from work for a specified period due to "reactive depression/anxiety and family grievance/stress." S2 drafted a "Memo [To the] File] dated December 4, 2014 regarding this incident. ROI at 358-360. Therein, he asserts that Complainant came to the office the afternoon of December 4, 2014 and that Complainant stated that she had received medication from her doctor and she had "taken one pill and then fallen asleep for the whole day. Just before coming into [S2's office], she said she had taken another pill...." Based on the specific circumstances set forth herein, we find that the AJ's properly found that S2's disclosure to a contractor that Complainant was "on medication" was a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act. We find that S2 by disclosing to the contractor (who did not have a need to know) that the Complainant was on medication given the specific circumstances in the instant matter and S2's own description of Complainant's behavior, that she was out of control and hysterical, was sufficient to constitute a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether a disclosure was made may also turn on the credibility and consistency of the testimony. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Felton A. v. Postmaster General, 0120182134 (2019), alleged that his supervisor disclosed his medical condition</span> to the union steward. The supervisor maintained that she was not aware of the complainant's medical condition. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Felton A.</span> found the supervisor's testimony and the evidence in the record unreliable on this point:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, Complainant asserted that the Union Steward informed him that he was being barred from the facility because he was on the "Threat Assessment List" due to his medical condition. He averred that the Union Steward was made aware of his medical condition based on comments made by the Supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the instant allegation, the Manager averred, "I was aware that the [S]upervisor advise the Union Steward that [Complainant] was not able to enter the Denbigh Station. I do not recall if the steward was told it was because of his medical condition." The Supervisor was asked about whether she informed the Union Steward of Complainant's medical condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">She averred, "I was the management official who told the Union [Steward] who the Complainant was representing not to have the Complainant come to Denbigh Station due to threat assessment. I did not mention his medical condition because I did not know the Complainant's medical condition." When asked again by the Agency investigator, the Supervisor stated, "No medical condition was mentioned. Medical condition Unknown."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency conducted the investigation. However, the Union Steward was not questioned about the incident even though he would have been in the best position to state whether or not the Supervisor informed him of Complainant's medical condition. In the absence of this evidence, we have to rely on the statements provided by Complainant and the Supervisor. Complainant has clearly asserted that management released his medical information to the Union Steward. The Manager was not sure whether the medical information was provided. As such, the Agency's argument relies on the statement by the Supervisor who indicated that she did not mention Complainant's medical condition. She appears to assert that she could not have done so because she was not aware of Complainant's medical condition. We find that the Supervisor's statement is not reliable. The Agency's final decision found that the record did not support the Supervisor's assertion that she was not aware of Complainant's medical condition. Further, we note that the Supervisor's affidavit was very limited in terms of providing information. Many of her responses were "No," "Unknown," or "N/A." Based on the lack of information and inconsistencies in the record, the Commission is skeptical of the responses provided by the Supervisor. <span class="Italic">See Sallie M. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172430 (Oct 16, 2018) (finding that management officials statements were not reliable based on similar lack of information and inconsistencies in the record). As such, we find that Complainant has shown that the Supervisor released his medical condition to the Union Steward. There is no indication that the release of Complainant's medical condition qualifies under the limited exceptions to the confidentiality requirement. As such, we determine that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act with respect to claim 1.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies must take every precaution to ensure the confidentiality of the employee's medical information. The Commission impressed the importance <span id="Page_1248"></span>of that rule on the agency in <span class="Italic">Matt B. v. Secretary of the Air Force</span>, 0120150332 (2017), where the complainant alleged that agency officials subjected him to discrimination based on disability by forcing him to disclose his personal medical information to emergency personnel in a break room filled with coworkers. In that case, the complainant complained to his supervisor of back pain and asked to go home. The shop lead told the complainant to go to the break room and wait for emergency medical technicians, which was the agency's standard operating procedure when injuries were reported. In the breakroom and in the presence of coworkers and management, the EMTs asked medical related questions of the complainant, which the complainant answered. Though the Commission did not find a violation of the Rehabilitation Act, it seems that the agency's only saving grace was that no one was able to overhear the complainant's answers to the EMTs. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Matt B</span>., explained and cautioned:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant told S1 that he wanted to go home because he was having back pain. S1, therefore, had a reasonable belief that Complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of his position would be impaired by a medical condition. Accordingly, the Agency was entitled to receive the information necessary to determine whether Complainant could perform his essential job functions without posing a direct threat. To the extent that Complainant is arguing that the Agency engaged in an impermissible inquiry or examination by calling 911 and asking EMTs to administer medical care to Complainant, his argument fails. Complainant has stated that the EMTs asked for his medical history, but he has not identified the specific questions that they asked him. In the absence of such information, we cannot say that the questions exceeded the permissible scope of inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we cannot say that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act's confidentiality provisions. Complainant has argued that S1 and S2 must have heard his conversation with the medical personnel because they were standing at the table, but S1 and S2 have denied that they heard what Complainant told the EMTs. The record does not establish that S1 or S2 received information that they should not have received. Further, there is no evidence that confidential medical information was shared with any of the other employees in the break room. PW stated that he was seven or eight feet away from Complainant and that other employees might have heard Complainant's conversation, but he did not state that he heard the conversation. Complainant has not identified any employees who heard what he said to the EMTs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the evidence of record does not establish that the Agency violated its confidentiality obligations in this case, we are concerned that, as the Agency noted in its final decision, "the circumstances were certainly undesirable for maintaining confidentiality." We urge the. Agency to reconsider its practice of sending employees to the break room while awaiting medical personnel. The Agency should take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of medical information.</p>
<p class="noindent">Discriminatory intent is not a necessary finding to an improper medical disclosure. Even inadvertent disclosures can violate the Rehabilitation Act. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mario G. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120150193 (2017), a supervisor left a printed-out email between another supervisor and the civilian personnel office that detailed the complainant's medical condition and restrictions on a table next to a hard drive in his office. A coworker of complainant's saw the email when he entered the supervisor's office to use the shared hard drive. The administrative judge found that, though the supervisor was careless, the evidence did not reflect that his actions were discriminatory. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mario G</span>. corrected the administrative judge's flawed analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA and its implementing regulations list the following limited exceptions to the confidentiality requirement: supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations; first aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and government officials investigating compliance with this part shall be provided relevant information on request. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12112(d)(3)(B), (4)(C); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14; Guidance I, at 4. The Commission has also interpreted the ADA to allow employers to disclose medical information to state workers' compensation offices, state second injury funds, workers' compensation insurance carriers, and to health care professionals when seeking advice in making reasonable <span id="Page_1249"></span>accommodation determinations. Guidance I, at 4 n.10. Additionally, employers may use medical information for insurance purposes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the AJ improperly analyzed claim 11. As noted earlier, the Agency's obligation to keep certain medical information of its employees confidential applies to all employees regardless of disability status. Although not all medically related information falls within the confidentiality provision, "documentation or information concerning an individual's diagnosis is without question medical information that must be treated as confidential except in those circumstances described in 29 C.F.R. Part 1630." <span class="Italic">Lampkins v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720080017 (Dec. 8, 2009) (citations omitted). As noted above, the ADA only allows for the release of an applicant or employee's medical information in limited circumstances. Here, the record reflects that S2 left email correspondence dated April 3, and March 27, 2012, between S1 and the Civilian Personal Office about Complainant's request for light duty face-up on a table next the hard drive in his office. In the email, S1 specifically wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We have an individual, [Complainant], who was injured on the job back on November 9, 2011. The result was surgery on his knee which has left him on light duty with no kneeling or climbing, and limited walking and standing. This prohibits him from most activities in his regular job. His return to work and subsequent term of light duty is past the 40 day mark and we are fast running out of assignable light duty work for [Complainant]. Can you provide us with some suggestions on what option are available to us?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, a Machinist entered S2's office to use the shared hard drive that everyone uses, and he saw the above email sitting next the hard drive. We note the Machinist mentioned that employees regularly enter S2's office to go for items. The Machinist was concerned that Complainant's personal medical information was out-in-the open for everyone to see.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the Agency's disclosure of information about Complainant's medical condition, we find that the Agency has violated the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c). Although such disclosure may have been inadvertent, it nevertheless constitutes a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Forde</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12670 (citing <span class="Italic">Valle v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05960585 (Sep. 5, 1997)). We do not find any persuasive evidence that the Agency's disclosure was based on reprisal for Complainant's prior protected EEO activity or his national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission found that a coworker's accidental email to 118 recipients disclosing that the complainant was "transported to a medical center after experiencing rapid heartbeat and tightness in his chest and left hand" violated the Rehabilitation Act in <span class="Italic">Alan N. v. Secretary of Homeland Security,</span> 2020001528 (2021).</p>
<p class="noindent">The medical information disclosed must be about the complainant. Restated, complainants do not have standing to lodge medical confidentiality claims on behalf of other employees. However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Latonya D. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120161314 (2017), cautioned the agency to ensure that supervisors "and other management officials do not violate employees' entitlement to medical confidentiality," where the complainant alleged that his supervisor discussed another employee's medical condition and reasonable accommodation with other employees. The Commission further noted in <span class="Italic">Latonya D</span>. that disclosing that an employee is receiving a reasonable accommodation may also rise to the level of an improper disclosure because "this usually amounts to a disclosure that the individual has a disability."</p>
<p class="noindent">A good summation of the Commission's interpretation of the disclosure provision of the ADA is provided in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120123252 (2013). The complainant became aware that her confidential medical information was included in the Postal Service's Enterprise Resource Management (eRMS) database. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) requires that all information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of an applicant or employee must be maintained on separate forms and in separate files and must be treated as confidential medical records. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12112(d)(3)(B), (4)(C); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14. These requirements also extend to medical information that an individual voluntarily discloses to an employer. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span>, No. 915.002, at 4 (July 26, 2000) (Guidance I). The confidentiality obligation imposed on an employer by the ADA remains regardless of whether an applicant is eventually hired or the employment relationship ends. <span class="Italic">See</span> ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span>, at 18 (October 10, 1995) (Guidance II). These requirements apply to confidential medical information from any applicant or employee and are not limited to individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See Higgins v.

<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find the Agency improperly analyzed Complainant's complaint. As noted earlier, the Agency's obligation to keep certain medical information of its employees confidential applies to all employees regardless of disability status. Although not all medically related information falls within the confidentiality provision, "documentation or information concerning an individual's diagnosis is without question medical information that must be treated as confidential except in those circumstances described in 29 C.F.R.

As noted above, the ADA only allows for the release of an applicant or employee's medical information in limited circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we found in <span class="Italic">Long</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120558, Complainant is alleging a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act. In her complaint, Complainant states that her medical diagnosis was improperly accessed and available in the eRMS database to any employee with access to the database including all supervisors and temporary supervisors (204b), and was subject to being openly displayed on computer screens where other, nonmanagement employees could see it. The statements of H1 and H2 are not inconsistent with Complainant's assertions. We find that the statements of H1 and H2 do not dispute that a violation of the Agency's responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act regarding the recordkeeping of confidential medical information in the Agency's eRMS database prior to December 11, 2008 (when changes to the eRMS database access rights were made) occurred as alleged. We find that the preponderance of evidence shows that a violation of the Rehabilitation Act occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Myrah v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A52157 (2006), the complainant alleged a violation of the ADA where her former employing agency disclosed to a prospective employer that she had been on extended sick leave and had resigned for health reasons. The Commission determined that there was no violation of the ADA where the statements did not disclose a particular condition. The Commission similarly concluded in <span class="Italic">Louise S. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120161534 (2018), that a supervisor's comment that the complainant, a physician, "experienced a 'medical problem' caused by taking Benadryl" was not a prohibited disclosure of medical information as it "was not tantamount to disclosing a medical diagnosis because the over-the-counter medication is taken for a wide array of medical conditions and symptoms." The context in which the comment was made was also probative in <span class="Italic">Louise S</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 4, S1 stated that at a May 6, 2015 management meeting, S5 said that Complainant had a "medical problem" while on duty in the Emergency Room that was caused by taking too much Benadryl. S5 stated that "we discussed her medical condition in the sense that she was unable to work, and what was the plan to deal with this." S5 further stated that the purpose of the discussion was to determine how to deal with situations wherein a health care provider is unable to work when they become seriously ill, and the process to deal with these rare, but significant events. He stated that in Complainant's incident, the Emergency Room was uncovered, and the Agency had to bring a resident physician in to cover the Emergency Room because there was no other physician there. He stated that it was a very serious situation, and he had to inform the medical system that they could not take any ambulances until the staffing situation was addressed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of this matter, we find that S5 did not disclose Complainant's medical information. In so finding, we note that there is no evidence that S5 disclosed Complainant's medical diagnosis or symptoms. Instead, S5 vaguely stated that Complainant experienced a "medical problem" caused by taking Benadryl. Disclosing that Complainant took Benadryl was not tantamount to disclosing a medical diagnosis because this over-the-counter medicine is taken for a wide array of medical conditions and symptoms. As such, it was not possible to identify Complainant's diagnosis or symptoms from S5's remarks at the meeting. Further, we note that S5's comment was made in the context of training discussions on how to respond when Emergency Room physicians experience medical emergencies while on duty. We find that the Agency had a legitimate business necessity to discuss Complainant's incident in the manner it did under these particular circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, disclosure of a specific diagnosis is a violation of the ADA. In <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Secretary of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05a50210.txt">01A32251</a> (2004), the Commission found the agency violated the confidentiality of medical records provisions of the ADA through disclosure of a specific diagnosis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we do find that the agency violated our regulations when complainant's supervisor left out complainant's sick leave request and attached medical documentation in the break room for four days. ADA regulations provide for the confidentiality of medical records, in pertinent part as follows: Information obtained...regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall...be treated as a confidential medical record, except that: (I) supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restriction on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Valle v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960585 (September 5, 1997), <span class="Italic">Short v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01980456 (October 7, 1999). By its terms, this requirement applies to confidential medical information obtained from "any employee," and is not limited to individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See Hampton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00132 (April 13, 2000). Although not all medically-related information falls within this provision, documentation or information of an individual's diagnosis is without question medical information that must be treated as confidential except in those circumstances described in 29 C.F.R. Part 1630. <span class="Italic">See Hampton, supra; see also</span> ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> (October 10, 1995), at 22; EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans With Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span> (March 25, 1997) at 17 &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reveals that during 2001, complainant submitted medical documentation attached to his sick leave request related to his Hepatitis C, as well as from a licensed clinical social worker due to stress he was experiencing as a result of the treatment he received at work. We find the supervisor's disregard for complainant's privacy and confidentiality of medical records to be tantamount to a disclosure. Accordingly, the agency's impermissible disclosure of complainant's medical condition to anyone who happened to see it in the break room constitutes disability-based discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Voile v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960585 (September 5, 1997) (disclosing medical information pertaining to complainant in a manner that does not conform to the conditions prescribed in the regulations, constitutes a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Manns v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A53044 (2006), the Commission found that the agency made a prohibited medical disclosure when a supervisor made comments about the complainant's medical restriction and weighed garbage in front of coworkers and customers. The garbage was allegedly weighed to ensure that the complainant did not exceed her medical restrictions. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Manns</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, as to issue (1), PI conceded that she made comments related to complainant's lifting restriction and weighed garbage in front of co-workers and customers on May 30, 2002. PI explained that due to complainant's restrictions she had been instructed by the Injury Compensation Specialist to weigh items to ensure that they did not exceed complainant's five-pound limitation. Complainant does not specifically object to PI' s act of weighing items, and we note that this certainly was not a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. What is significant is that this took place in front of others. The record also contains a letter from a customer attesting to the fact that this incident occurred in her presence and in the presence of other customers, and that this was inappropriate and appeared to cause complainant embarrassment. PI attested that the customer who wrote the letter of complaint about the incident was a friend of complainant's. We find the fact that the customer was a friend of complainant's, to be immaterial, as what is significant is that PI weighed items and discussed whether they were too heavy for complainant in front of other employees and customers who were not entitled to have such knowledge unless complainant herself chose to disclose the information to them. In an attempt to explain why she weighed the garbage in front of customers and other employees, PI stated that complainant only worked during times when the service counter was open. We find that this explanation does not justify PI's conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also in <span class="Italic">Manns</span>, the Commission found that the supervisor's disclosure of the complainant's condition and medical restrictions to an acting officer-in-charge was not a violation of the Rehabilitation Act because the acting OIC had a need to know about the restrictions. However, the OIC did violate the Act when he disclosed the condition to a trainee working with the complainant. The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Mack v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120121298 (2013), finding that the disclosure of the complainant's medical condition to a branch manager was job-related and consistent with business necessity where the purpose of the disclosure was to get advice from the manager on how to proceed with the complainant's accommodation request.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132973 (2015) (supervisor disclosed complainant's medical condition to labor relations manager and reasonable accommodation coordinator in request to accommodate complainant).</p>
<p class="noindent">In two cases involving emails, the Commission had the opportunity to make some distinctions between what constitutes an impermissible disclosure under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that medical records kept confidential and disclosed to only those with a need to know as defined by the Statute, and a permissible disclosure. In <span class="Italic">Goelling v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120074030 (2007), the Commission found that the complainant stated a claim under ADA where her supervisor sent an email to the complainant and several others responding to a leave request. The complainant had requested leave to attend her divorce proceedings and also for the purposes of a medical <span id="Page_1250"></span>procedure that the Commission described as "immensely personal." Although the Commission did not make a finding on the merits of the claim, in <span class="Italic">Goelling</span>, it did note that "the record contains no statements explaining why there was a need to send the email, why it was necessary to include all of the people listed, or why the supervisor had to go into such detail" about the nature of the medical procedure. The Commission also noted that at least some of the individuals to whom the email was sent were not in the complainant's chain of command.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Pritchard v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120060946 (2007), the Commission found that there was no violation of the ADA where an email was circulated to complainant's supervisors discussing her medical restrictions. In finding no violation, the Commission explained that the "email did not contain any specific information regarding complainant's diagnosis or symptoms, but deals strictly with complainant's medical restrictions and necessary accommodations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission further found that the email was distributed only to those individuals supervising the complainant who had a need to know of medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Skarica v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120073399 (2010), the Commission found no ADA violation where the complainant's supervisor disclosed a bladder condition to a human relations specialist and agency physician to help evaluate whether the complainant was entitled to a reasonable accommodation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Skarica</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that S2 improperly disclosed his medical information to a personnel official and the agency physician. The Commission's regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act provide for the confidentiality of medical records. Specifically, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c)(1) provides, in pertinent part, that: "Information obtained...regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall...be treated as a confidential medical record, except that: (i) [s]upervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations." By its terms, this requirement applies to confidential medical information obtained from "any employee," and is not limited to individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See Hampton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00132 (April 13, 2000). Although not all medically-related information falls within this provision, documentation or information concerning an individual's diagnosis is without question medical information that must be treated as confidential except in those circumstances described in 29 C.F.R. Part 1630. <span class="Italic">See Hampton, supra</span>; ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> (October 10, 1995), at 22: EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span> (March 25, 1997) at question 15; EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Disability Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (July 27, 2000) at p. 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, S2 consulted with a personnel official and an agency physician so that he could ascertain how to accommodate complainant's medical condition. We find that the agency did not violate the confidentiality provisions of the Rehabilitation Act because the personnel official and agency physician are persons with a legitimate "need to know" complainant's medical information by virtue of their medical and personnel expertise. Complainant argues that the agency physician was not qualified to review his medical documentation because he is not a urologist; however, we find that the agency's reliance on its general physician to assess complainant's accommodation needs was reasonable in this case. Complainant further alleges that he believes that everyone in the office knows about his condition because there are so many rumors in the office. However, this general assertion does not identify how the agency impermissibly disclosed his medical information. We note that the Commission has held that the party opposing a decision without a hearing must identify the disputed facts in the record with specificity. <span class="Italic">See Patton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930055 (July 1, 1993) (summary judgment proper where complainant made only a general assertion that his job performance was good, but set forth no specific facts regarding his performance). Thus, we find that there is no evidence from which a fact-finder could conclude that the agency improperly disclosed complainant's medical information.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission found no violation of the disclosure provisions of the ADA where information about the complainant's medical condition was shared with the Local Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator. In <span class="Italic">Carlton v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0120073540 (2010), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that the LORAC, S1, and the agency's Associate Regional Counsel (ARC) were given access to the FORS physician's report, even though they did not have authorization to review his information. Complainant's Aff., at 7. To the extent that complainant alleges a violation of his privacy rights under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(g)(1), we find that this is outside the Commission's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Department of Education</span>. EEOC Request Nos. 05890289, 05890290, 05890291 (April 12, 1989). We note, however, that the Rehabilitation Act also provides that information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall be treated as a confidential medical record. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, the Commission determines that the weight of the evidence does not support complainant's contention that the agency improperly disclosed his confidential medical information. Although the LORAC had access to complainant's report, we find that LORAC had implicit authorization to review this information by virtue of his role as the main point of contact in the agency's reasonable accommodation process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c). The LORAC's main responsibility is to "assist in coordinating the processing and provision of reasonable accommodation." ROI, at Exh. F-23, 7. The record shows that the agency interpreted a statement in complainant's March 4, 2004 letter to S1 as a request for reasonable accommodation. ROI, at 138. Accordingly, the agency requested further medical information from complainant and complainant complied by signing a March 25, 2004 medical disclosure authorizing the FOBS physician to consult with his personal physicians. ROI, at Exh. F-14. The LORAC attested that he did not disclose the information in the report to any management officials. ROI, at Exh. F-4, 3.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found no violation in the disclosure to agency counsel as that disclosure was actually made by complainant's counsel in a whistleblowing complaint and there was no evidence that agency counsel had revealed the information to anyone else.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency does not violate the ADA's disclosure provisions when it communicates work restrictions to supervisors, but does not communicate any medical information. <span class="Italic">New v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120080269 (2010). Similarly, an agency does not violate the ADA when an EAP psychologist who examined the complainant's medial information sends an email informing the complainant and her managers that her request for accommodation has been denied where the email does not disclose the complainant's medical condition, symptoms, diagnosis or prognosis. <span class="Italic">Pleasant v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0120083195 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120131372 (2014), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint where the complainant alleged that his supervisor took a photo of his medical information on his personal cellphone. The supervisor maintained that he did so while filling out an injury form for the complainant and was going to use the photo as an attachment to the report. The Commission did not make a determination on the merits, noting it was unclear exactly what "medical information" was involved but also noting there was a potential violation of the ADA and/or GINA.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Price v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120070997 (2008), the Commission found a violation of the disclosure provisions of the ADA where the supervisor told the complainant in front of coworkers that he should not be smoking because of his heart condition. The Commission noted that the complainant was not required to show harm to establish a violation of the ADA's confidentiality provisions. The Commission also found that the complainant stated a claim for relief in <span class="Italic">Meadows v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120101541 (2010), where he alleged that his supervisor had announced during a open forum with coworkers that the complainant had been disqualified as an air traffic controller because of "psychological problems."</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency violated the confidentiality provisions of the ADA when it disclosed medical information about the complainant in a predisciplinary meeting with the complainant, a union steward and a supervisor. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Lampkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080017 (2009), provided medical information to his supervisor in support of an FMLA request. Initially, the complainant submitted medical documentation that he created himself and he later submitted medical information that was heavily redacted because he was "uncomfortable" giving it to his supervisor. The supervisor turned the information over to the Inspector General because he considered it suspicious. The information was included in the IG report that was distributed and discussed at the predisciplinary meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent">While disclosure of medical information to supervisors may not violate the ADA in certain circumstances, disclosures to coworkers will virtually always violate the ADA. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120101339 (2011), the complainant alleged that his psychiatrist disclosed to his supervisor the fact that he was undergoing treatment and had threatened to kill one of his coworkers. The complainant was immediately placed on emergency suspension. In response to questions by another coworker about why the complainant was not at work, the supervisor disclosed the complainant had been diagnosed as "very nervous" and had threatened to kill the first coworker. The Commission found the disclosure in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> to the coworker violated the ADA explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, S1 told CW2 that Complainant was being treated by a psychiatrist who had diagnosed Complainant as "very nervous." S1 also repeated to CW2 what the psychiatrist had said about Complainant threatening CW1's life. According to Complainant, after the disclosure by S1, the information about his medical condition was disseminated widely among his co-workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1's disclosure to CW2 of this information violated the Rehabilitation Act's medical confidentiality provisions. The fact that Complainant was undergoing treatment by a psychiatrist and that he had been diagnosed <span id="Page_1251"></span>with a nervous condition was medical information the Agency was obliged to keep confidential. The disclosure of that information by a manager to a line employee who had no need for that information in connection with performing his duties was improper. <span class="Italic">See Griffin v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120073832 (May 15, 2009) (finding that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when management officials discussed Complainant's medical information in a public chat forum); <span class="Italic">Higgins v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A13571 (May 27, 2003) (finding a violation of the Rehabilitation Act when the Agency placed confidential medical information from a physician documenting Complainant's diagnosis in a non-medical work file). Therefore, we find that the Agency's release of Complainant's confidential medical information constituted a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant voluntarily disclosed medical information does not mean the information is exempt from the confidentiality provisions of the ADA. In <span class="Italic">Humphries v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120083870 (2012), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that it did not violate the ADA when a supervisor disclosed medical information about the complainant because the complainant voluntarily disclosed that information to the supervisor. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Humphries</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After holding a hearing in the second complaint, the AJ found that at the time Complainant resigned from the Agency in October or November 2004, he informed his supervisor of his learning disability (ADD or ADHD). The AJ further found, based on the report by Global Verification Service, that Complainant's former supervisor relayed this confidential medical information when Global Verification Services called for a reference. However, according to the AJ, this did not constitute a violation of the Rehabilitation Act because the information was not obtained through a medical examination or an employee health program. Rather, the AJ found that Complainant voluntary disclosed this information, and was therefore not protected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) requires employers to treat as confidential medical records all information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of an employee. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12112(d)(3)(B), (4)(C); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14. Such information includes any medical information obtained from a disability-related inquiry or medical examination (including medical information from voluntary health or wellness programs), as well as any medical information voluntarily disclosed by an employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span>, No. 915.002, at 4 (July 26, 2000). Improper Agency disclosure of such medical information constitutes a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Vale v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960585 (Sept. 5, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find the AJ erred when she found that the disclosure that occurred in the instant complaint was not prohibited because it was voluntarily made, and outside of an agency wellness or medical program. The Commission has long recognized that the employer's confidentiality obligation extends to medical information voluntarily disclosed. <span class="Italic">See</span> ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Pre-employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span>, EEOC Notice No. Number 915.002, (October 10, 1995). Accordingly, we REVERSE the agency's final action with respect to Complaint/Issue No. 2 and REMAND the matter in accordance with the ORDER below.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, there is no violation of the confidentiality provision when the complainant gives the agency permission to release the covered information. For example, in <span class="Italic">Celinda L. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130846 (2015), the complainant gave the FBI permission to access her records for a background check. The Commission found that the permission covered a disciplinary letter that referenced a shoulder injury and, as a result, there was not violation of the ADA.</p>
