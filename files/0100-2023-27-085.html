<h3 class="h3" id="sec18-84"><span class="space">C.</span> COMMON WORKPLACE OCCURRENCES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Supervisors must be allowed the discretion to make everyday operational decisions. Common workplace occurrences, such as assigning work and every-day instruction on how that work is to be performed, do not affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment unless it can be shown that such actions were taken with the intention of harassing that employee because of his or her membership in a protected class. In <span class="Italic">Tod P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161529 (2016), the complainant alleged discrimination on the bases of sex, race, color and reprisal when his supervisor pulled him off a bid position and reassigned him to work in a different section. The supervisor explained that he was simply following protocol, and the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Tod P</span>., credited the agency's explanation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the regulations set forth at 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, an agency shall accept a complaint from an aggrieved employee or applicant for employment who believes that he or she has been discriminated against by that agency because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disabling condition. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.103, .106(a). The Commission's federal sector case precedent has long defined an "aggrieved employee" as one who suffers a present harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (April 21, 1994). If complainant cannot establish that s/he is aggrieved, the agency shall dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has stated that adverse actions need not qualify as "ultimate employment actions" or materially affect the terms and conditions of employment to constitute retaliation. <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05930410 (Nov. 4, 1999). Instead, claims based on statutory retaliation clauses are reviewed "with a broad view of coverage. Under Commission policy, a complainant is protected from any retaliatory discrimination that is reasonably likely to deter...complainant or others from engaging in protected activity." <span class="Italic">Maclin v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120070733 (Mar. 29, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency properly identified Claim 1 as a common workplace occurrence, a supervisor reassigning an employee's work duties. Unless it is reasonably established that the actions were somehow abusive or offensive, and were taken in order to harass complainant on the basis of any of his protected classes, such everyday events are not sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to offend the general sensibility of an individual experiencing such occurrences in the workplace. <span class="Italic">See Wolf v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01961559 (July 23, 1993); <span class="Italic">see also Long v. Veterans Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01950169 (Aug. 14, 1997). While an employee may prefer to perform certain duties, among others, or may have a different idea about how operations should be run, these are not issues which should be pursued in the EEO complaint process since decision makers in the complaint process cannot substitute their judgment on how to run the day to day operations of an Agency for that of the managers involved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, Claim 2, when viewed in the light most favorable to complainant, also describe; a common workplace occurrence; specifically, a supervisor discussing work duties with an employee. <span class="Italic">See Carver v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01930522 (Feb. 13, 2000) As for the alleged personnel action in Claim 2, a written letter of warning, we find the Agency provided sufficient proof that such a letter was never issued to Complainant However, in claims of reprisal, this Commission has previously found that a non-personnel action, such as proposed or verbal warning, may still deter a person from engaging in protected EEO activity, and therefore state a claim. We have thoroughly reviewed the record and find the discussion described in Claim 2 unlikely to deter EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">Ken M. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020004868 (2021), the complainant alleged discrimination based on his national origin, sex and disability when:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Between March 2018 and May 2018, his second level supervisor ("S2") subjected him to a hostile work environment/harassment by: constantly threatening to fire him, raising accusations about statements he made to her, having negative reports made against him, and subjecting him to "constant badgering," accusing him of not working while sitting at his desk, and, treating him differently than female employees by making demeaning comments to make him seem less intelligent, and speaking to him in a condescending manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;On May 8, 2018, he was terminated from the Federal Service during his probationary period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his affidavit, Complainant testified that the performance standards he was being held to "had more to do with me as a person than they did with my assigned duties. I was treated more as a mentally disabled individual rather than a member of a team." He alleged that S2 did all the talking at their performance meetings, and her tone and language were condescending. He testified, "[m]ost of the information and instructions I received were verbal and the frequency of the instructions and information made it difficult to retain or implement any useful part of the information." Complainant indicated that he was set up to fail at his assignments because he would receive conflicting instructions. For instance, he was told to answer the phone, but when several veterans became aware of his direct extension and called him repeatedly, he was instructed not to answer the phone. Alternately, he would be accused of not working, yet the work he was provided had already been completed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 27, 2018, Complainant emailed an EEO counselor, stating, "I would like to file a complaint for hostile work environment." He explained that the president and vice president of the Union, who he notified oriGINAlly, suggested he contact EEO, as he attributed the hostile work environment to his sex. He recounted S2's conflicting instructions and alleged that S2 "repeatedly threatened and reprimanded [him] for things [he] often have no control over." When he reported S2's treatment to S3, he was threatened with termination, and S3 allegedly responded that Complainant "simply needed to do what [S2] says." According to Complainant, management raised concerns regarding his performance that were "artificial and superficial" and tended to "focus so much on micromanagement and control of every minutiae that I do not feel that my job is safe." On April 30, 2018 the EEO Manager emailed Complainant with information about reporting harassment and stating that she is awaiting a return call from S2 to schedule a meeting with her. Thus, S2 was aware of Complainant's EEO activity by April 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 1, 2018, Complainant emailed the EEO Counselor, while copying the president and vice president of the Union, three times with respect to an incident where S2 asked Complainant why he had a walkie talkie in a staff meeting. Complainant first emailed at 11:00 am, requesting a meeting with the Director, and accusing S2 of "attacking" him again by asking him to explain why he had a walkie talkie. Complainant explained that he objected to the request because S2 "refused to tell me who said it and why they were concerned. She believes that people have the right to be concerned and I have an obligation to explain myself." This is "absurd. As an employee or as a veteran at a veterans hospital I should not be treated like this." Ten minutes later, he emailed again, stating that S2 called S3, and asked Complainant to have a closed door meeting with them. S2 and S3 denied Complainant's demands to have a witness present at the meeting, another supervisor noted that Complainant had the right to have a union official present.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Around 2:00 pm, the president and vice president of the Union, S2, S3, a supervisor from another office, and Complainant met. Complainant followed up in an email to the EEO Counselor, and the union president and vice president, explaining that he encountered S3 in the hallway after the meeting and apologized. According to Complainant's email, S3 informed him that he spoke with S2 and to "just let the dust settle" S3 allegedly made a comment that they were under the impression Complainant was starting from a "clean slate," however, Complainant states, "I was not notified of this clean slate and have been under constant pressure, stress, and anxiety that I would lose my job. And I have been doing everything I could to include showing my supervisors that I have been doing my job as the information has been falling on deaf ears...threats and badgering continued daily." Complainant was informed he could work in the other Manager's section until another job within the agency, for which he had been selected, was available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The May 1, 2018 incident was documented by multiple reports of contact, including two witnesses that were not identified by Complainant as responding management officials in this complaint. The Lead Document Recovery MSA's report of contact recalled that around 11:00 AM on May 1, 2018, she could hear CP from S2's office, "in an almost sarcastic but aggressive tone ask [S2] several times "who was concerned or was worried" [Complainant] then, very aggressively and loud shouted "I am a Veteran, in a Veteran hospital, what do you think I am going to do bomb the F[ ]ing place" and then stomped back to his work station." An MSA supervisor who shared an office with S2 and was present for the incident, reported Complainant's language as "vulgar and aggressive," and his tone as "extremely threatening and [it made her] feel extremely uncomfortable both during and following the conversation." She recounted that "the purpose of the discussion was to ask [Complainant] if he had a walkie talkie with him. He indicated that he did not, [S2] asked if he did that morning as other staff recognized this and were concerned." Complainant responded by asking who was concerned, and when S2 wouldn't say, he "indicated to her that it was none of their business and that he didn't have to answer the question." She also confirmed that Complainant "made a comment about others potentially thinking he "had a bomb or something" Then, Complainant "storm[ed] out of the office telling [S2] that he didn't need to "fucking deal with it."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notably, S3's report of contact indicates awareness of Complainant's EEO activity, stating, "I also told [Complainant] that the fact that he disagreed with [Management's] assessment of his performance did not <span id="Page_1597"></span>constitute him being discriminated against." S3 laments in the record that Complainant did not simply explain what happened. Complainant had a reasonable explanation, as he found the walkie talkie in the men's restroom, but before he could return it, he had to attend a team meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A May 3, 2018, email from Complainant to the EEO Counselor, with the president and vice president copied, reveals that Complainant was told to no longer communicate with S2, or the Lead MSA. Instead, Complainant would report to S1 going forward. Complainant's testimony in the record indicates that he had a more cordial working relationship with S1, who, according to Complainant, agreed with Complainant's observations that he was given assignments where the work had already been completed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 7, 2018, S3 submitted a Request or Removal to Human Resources, having previously discussed the matter with an HR Specialist a few weeks earlier. His stated reason for the termination was that S2 and the Lead MSA brought "numerous reports of poor performance and conduct" to his attention, that Complainant's "performance and conduct were consistently below a respectable level," and that Complainant admitted to falling asleep at his work station. S3 explained that while typically, MSAs learn from one on one instruction with an MSA Lead, S2 stepped in to train Complainant, as he "struggles following directions and repeatedly deviates from established department processes." S3 listed examples of undesirable conduct, including the May 1, 2018 incident, and how, on April 20, 2018, Complainant and a coworker were discussing the community refrigerator in the common area, within earshot of workstations where conversations between Business Office staff and Veterans took place to coordinate Veterans' care. Complainant's "vulgar and unprofessional language could be easily overheard" by a Veteran during a phone call with an MSA, to such an extent that S2 had to intervene. Later that day, when S2 counseled Complainant that the conversation was unprofessional, Complainant told S2 that she could not tell him what he can and cannot say based on freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 8, 2018, S3 handed Complaint a Memorandum entitled Termination during Probationary period, for, among other things, failure to follow directions, repeatedly deviating from established department processes, and exhibiting undesirable conduct and behavior, including freely using profanity and vulgar language. The May 1, 2018 incident was listed in Complainant's termination memo as an example of Complainant's "unacceptable behavior," specifically, verbally abusive remarks directed toward his supervisors. According to the memo, when S2 asked Complainant about the walkie talkie, he "immediately became defensive and hostile, saying, "I am a Veteran in a Veteran's Hospital, what do they think I am going to bomb this fucking place?" or words to that effect. When she attempted to explain to you that it was her responsibility to address staff concerns you became angry and said, "Fuck you--no It's not, this is bullshit." or words to that effect. When [S1] arrived in an attempt to deescalate the situation, you said to him, "/ don't give a fuck what you want, this Is bullshit." or words to that effect." (emphasis oriGINAl).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="italic">Ken M</span>. reiterated that "instances of a supervisor questioning an employee with respect to their duties, even if done in a confrontational manner, is a 'common workplace occurrence.'" Declining to find harassment, the Commission provided examples of cases with similar fact patterns:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]sking an employee who does not typically carry a walkie talkie, and does not require one as part of their work duties, why they brought a walkie talkie to a meeting does not constitute harassment. Likewise, it does not constitute harassment if a supervisor declines to explain why they are directing an employee to complete a task within the scope of their work duties. <span class="italic">Id</span>, <span class="italic">see also, Dewitt L. v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120160682 (May 3, 2016) (While an employee may prefer certain assignments over others, or have a different idea about how operations should be run, "these are not issues which should be pursued in the EEO complaint process since decision makers in the complaint process cannot substitute their judgment on how to run the day to day operations of an Agency for that of the managers involved.")</p>
