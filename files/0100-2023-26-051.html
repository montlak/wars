<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-52"><span class="space">3.</span> Types of Materially Adverse Actions</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004, B.2. is careful to note that agency actions do not necessarily have to be "work-related" to be materially adverse:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Work-Related Actions</span>. The most obvious types of adverse actions are denial of promotion, refusal to hire, denial of job benefits, demotion, suspension, and discharge. Other types of adverse actions may include work-related threats, warnings, reprimands, transfers, negative or lowered evaluations, transfers to less prestigious or desirable work or work locations, and any other type of adverse treatment that in the circumstances might well dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity. For example, as one appellate court observed, "[a]formal reprimand issued by an employer is not a 'petty slight,' 'minor annoyance,' or 'trivial' punishment; it can reduce an employee's likelihood of receiving future bonuses, raises, and promotions, and it may lead the employee to believe (correctly or not) that his job is in jeopardy." Another court of appeals reasoned that the same can be said of lowered performance appraisals:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the Supreme Court views excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch that contributes significantly to the employee's professional development as materially adverse conduct, <span class="Italic">see Burlington</span> [<span class="Italic">Northern &#x0026; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White</span>, 548 U.S. 53, 69 (2006)], then markedly lower performance-evaluation scores that significantly impact an employee's wages or professional advancement are also materially adverse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Actions That Are Not Work-Related</span>. A materially adverse action may also be an action that has no tangible effect on employment, or even an action that takes place exclusively outside of work, as long as it might well dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity. Prohibiting only employment-related actions would not achieve the goal of avoiding retaliation because "an employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace." The Supreme Court in Burlington Northern observed that, although the substantive anti-discrimination provisions seek elimination of discrimination that affects employment opportunities because of employees' racial, ethnic, or other protected status, the anti-retaliation provisions seek to secure that objective by preventing an employer from interfering in a materially adverse way with efforts to enforce the law's basic guarantees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"> <span class="Italic">Additional Examples</span>. Other examples of materially adverse actions may include:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> disparaging the person to others or in the media;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> making false reports to government authorities;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> filing a civil action;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> threatening reassignment;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> scrutinizing work or attendance more closely than that of other employees, without justification;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> removal of supervisory responsibilities;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> abusive verbal or physical behavior that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity, even if it is not sufficiently "severe or pervasive" to create a hostile work environment;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> requiring re-verification of work status, making threats of deportation, or initiating other action with immigration authorities because of protected activity;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> terminating a union grievance process or other action to block access to otherwise available remedial mechanisms;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> taking (or threatening to take) a materially adverse action against a close family member (who could bring a claim as an aggrieved individual in addition to the person who engaged in protected activity); and</p>
<p class="list"><span id="Page_1504"></span><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> any other action that might well deter reasonable individuals from engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A fact-driven analysis applies to determine if the challenged employer action(s) in question would be likely to deter participation or opposition. To the extent some lower courts applying <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> have found that some of the above-listed actions can never be significant enough to deter protected activity, the Commission concludes that such a categorical view is contrary to the context-specific analysis, broad reasoning, and specific examples endorsed by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Matters are not actionable as retaliation if they are not likely to dissuade an employee from engaging in protected activity in the circumstances. For example, courts have concluded on the facts of given cases that a temporary transfer from an office to a cubicle consistent with office policy was not a materially adverse action and that occasional brief delays by an employer in issuing refund checks to an employee that involved small amounts of money were not materially adverse. Such actions were not deemed likely to deter protected activity, as distinguished from the transfer to harder work, the exclusion from a weekly training lunch, or the unfavorable schedule change described by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> as materially adverse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the employer's action would be reasonably likely to deter protected activity, it can be challenged as retaliation even if it falls short of its goal. The degree of harm suffered by the individual "goes to the issue of damages, not liability." Regardless of the degree or quality of harm to the particular complainant, retaliation harms the public interest by deterring others from filing charges. An interpretation of Title VII that permits some forms of retaliation to go unpunished would undermine the effectiveness of the EEO statutes and conflict with the language and purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Determining whether an action is reasonably likely to deter protected activity under <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern</span> is fact-dependent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example 13</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Exclusion from Team Lunches</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A federal agency employee filed a formal complaint with her agency EEO office alleging that she was denied a promotion by her supervisor because of her sex. One week later, her supervisor invited a few other employees out to lunch. She believed that her supervisor excluded her from lunch because of her complaint. Even if the supervisor chose not to invite the employee because of her complaint, this would not constitute unlawful retaliation because it is not reasonably likely to deter protected activity. By contrast, if her supervisor invited all employees in her unit to regular weekly lunches, and she is excluded because she files the sex discrimination complaint, this might constitute unlawful retaliation since it could reasonably deter her or others from engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example 14</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Workplace Surveillance</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee filed an EEOC charge alleging that he was racially harassed by his supervisor and coworkers. He also alleged that, after he had complained to management about the harassment, his supervisor asked two coworkers to conduct surveillance on the employee and report back about his activities. The surveillance constitutes a materially adverse action because it is likely to deter protected activity, and it is unlawful if it was conducted because of the employee's protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example 15</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Threats to Report Immigration Status</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A contractor employs farm workers and other laborers whom it places in rural agricultural and manufacturing facilities operated by its corporate clients. Together, the contractor and these facilities are joint employers under the EEO laws. The contractor and its clients suspect that many of the employees may be undocumented workers but, in order to meet their staffing needs, they do not attempt to verify their authorization to work as required by the immigration laws. Several of the female farm workers and laborers, who are in fact undocumented, complain to a client supervisor and to the contractor about sexual harassment by male coworkers, including physical assaults and persistent unwelcome sexual remarks and advances. The client supervisor and the contractor threaten to expose the workers' immigration status if they continue to complain about the harassment. Threatening to report the workers' suspected immigration status to government authorities, or actually reporting the workers, is materially adverse and actionable as retaliation against workers who have engaged in protected activity under the EEO laws because it is likely to deter them from engaging in protected activity. If an EEOC charge is filed, both the contractor and the facility owner can each be found liable for retaliation. Neither the workers' undocumented status, nor the fact that they were placed by a contractor acting as a staffing firm, is a defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example 16</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Workplace Sabotage, Assignment to Unfavorable Location, and Abusive Scheduling Practices</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After an employee cooperated in a workplace investigation of a coworker's race discrimination complaint, a supervisor intentionally left a window ajar to prevent the employee from setting the building alarm (one of his job duties) and thereby subjected him to discipline. The supervisor also engaged in punitive scheduling, including shortening off-duty time between workdays and changing the employee's work schedule in a way that would require him to work alone at a more dangerous facility than the one at which he usually worked. These acts of workplace sabotage, his assignment to an unfavorable location, and the punitive scheduling constitute materially adverse actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Example 17</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disclosure of Confidential EEO Information and Assignment of Disproportionate Workload</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Three weeks after a federal employee sought EEO counseling regarding her complaint of disability and gender discrimination, her supervisor posted the EEO complaint on the agency's intranet where coworkers accessed it. The supervisor also increased her workload to five or six times that of other employees. Both of the supervisor's actions are materially adverse and actionable as alleged retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Citing to the 2016 Enforcement Guidance, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Valentine S. v. Secretary of the Interior</span>, 0120170221 (2017), held that the complainant raised a materially adverse action where the agency required him to relocate his manufactured home off agency property. The administrative judge had dismissed the complaint, noting that the agency's decision to terminate the occupancy agreement with the complainant did not have "a concrete effect on his employment status, and his living arrangement was not a term or condition of his employment." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Valentine S</span>., disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has a policy of considering reprisal claims with a broad view of coverage. <span class="Italic">See Carroll v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970939 (April 4, 2000). Under Commission policy, claimed retaliatory actions which can be challenged are not restricted to those which affect a term or condition of employment. Rather, a complainant is protected from any discrimination that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity. Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), at 5-19 (Revised Aug. 5, 2015); <span class="Italic">Carroll</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004, at 35 (Aug. 25, 2016) provides that an actionable retaliatory materially adverse action need not be work-related or have a tangible effect on employment and can even take place exclusively outside work as long as it might well dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity. Examples given include setting fire to an employee's car and threatening to "kill the bitch," taking or threatening to take a materially adverse action against a close family member, or any other action that might well deter reasonable individuals from engaging in protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at n.118 and p. 126.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant lived on the same Agency pad with his family for 25 years in two successive manufactured homes. He viewed this location as his home, and was emotionally attached thereto. Complainant wrote that his grandson lived with him, and because of the country location was able to attend a well credited country school. Complainant indicated that the process of moving his manufactured home is an ordeal and financially stressful. We find that Complainant's complaint states an actionable claim of reprisal because forcing him to relocate his family is something that would reasonably likely deter protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Alejandrina L. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120152145 (2017), further elucidated what constitutes a "materially adverse action." <span class="Italic">Alejandrina L.</span> involved a claim of reprisal based on a reasonable accommodation request. The complainant, who suffered from Lupus, asked for an increase in her telework allowance from one day to two days a week. While her request was pending, management created a new team, to which the complainant was reassigned and which, in turn, delayed an agency decision on her telework request. The complainant expressed concern that her new "work commitments," which included the phrases "face to face" and "physically available," would negatively impact on her accommodation request. The agency initially denied her request for a second telework day, but ultimately allowed her the one core telework day that she had already been using and one situational telework day. After being denied a subsequent request for a situational telework day, the complainant filed a complaint of disability discrimination and "reprisal for prior protected EEO activity under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Alejandrina L.</span> concluded that changing the complainant's work commitments and reassigning her were materially adverse actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was subjected to materially adverse treatment in having her work commitments changed to include "face to face" interaction and being "physically available." Also, while Complainant does not <span id="Page_1505"></span>specifically assert this point, her reassignment to a new team or subgroup prompting the new work commitments similarly constitutes a materially adverse action. This is because the reassignment and the revised work commitments occurred shortly after Complainant's request for an accommodation to allow her to work from home so that she would not exacerbate her ailment. These changes could have amounted to Complainant not being able to work, and viewed in the context of the extensive discussions pursuant to her accommodation request, they seemed to run in direct contravention of the accommodation request. This is especially true given the fact that telework was initially prohibited for members of the newly created team when Complainant was previously allowed to partake in the administrative policy of allowing employees to telework one day a week. The accommodation request therefore not only prompted a change in work commitments, but threatened to remove the critical work place flexibility of one day a week telecommuting which Complainant was partaking in. Further, the new assignment and commitments were clearly less favorable to Complainant because they seemed to contravene the ability to engage in part-time telecommuting. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., White</span>, 548 U.S. at 70 (finding that reassignment to a position with less desirable duties could constitute a materially adverse action). The circumstances Complainant experienced would dissuade a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity and therefore constitute a materially adverse action.</p>
