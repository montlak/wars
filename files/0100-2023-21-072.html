<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-65"><span id="Page_866"></span><span class="space">D.</span> HARASSMENT OF BOTH SEXES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that alleged harassment might be directed at employees of both genders does not, by itself, mean that the sexual conduct is not actionable. As the Commission stated in <span class="Italic">Wild v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01984101 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he law does not require complainant to demonstrate that his supervisor's behavior was directed only at men in order to prove his case. The AJ was apparently of the view that S1's conduct could not be found to be harassment in violation of Title VII if she was shown to have subjected both males and females to her inappropriate sexual conduct. Although there is authority for that view[2], neither the Supreme Court nor this Commission has endorsed it.[3] The fact that S1 may have been, in some respects, an "equal opportunity harasser" would not immunize her behavior.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Holman v. Indiana</span>, 211 F.3d 399 (7th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co</span>., 805 F.2d 611 (6th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert denied</span>, 481 U.S. 1041 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (March 19, 1990) at 9, criticizing majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Rabidue, supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Not all courts have agreed with the Commission's position. In other cases, such as <span class="Italic">Pasqua v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</span>, 101 F.3d 514 (7th Cir. 1997), courts have found that there is no harassment of a male employee where the supervisor directs his behavior at males and females equally. As the court in <span class="Italic">Pasqua</span>, 101 F.3d 516-17, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment also requires a showing that, but for the plaintiff's sex, he or she would not have been the subject of harassment. <span class="Italic">See McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.</span>, 427 U.S. 273, 282 n.10, 96 S. Ct. 2574, 2580 n.10, 49 L. Ed.2d 493. Harassment that is inflicted without regard to gender, that is, where males and females in the same setting do not receive disparate treatment, is not actionable because the harassment is not based on sex. As the Eleventh Circuit explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]here may be cases in which a supervisor makes sexual overtures to workers of both sexes or where the conduct complained of is equally offensive to male and female workers. In such cases, sexual harassment would not be based on sex because men and women are accorded like treatment.... [and] the plaintiff would have no remedy under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Henson</span>, 682 F.2d at 904 (citations omitted). <span class="Italic">See also Vandeventer v. Wabash Nat'l Corp.</span>, 887 F. Supp. 1178, 1180-81 (N.D. Ind. 1995); <span class="Italic">Goluszek v. H.P. Smith</span>, 697 F. Supp. 1452, 1456 (N.D. Ill. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pasqua's claim falls short of establishing the elementary requirement in this circuit that the alleged harassment was based upon the plaintiff's sex. There is not even a hint in the record that any rumors or vulgar statements concerning an illicit relationship between Pasqua and Vukanic were made because Pasqua was a male. By the very nature of such gossip, both Pasqua and Vukanic were made the subject matter as is evidenced by Vukanic being the first to utter a threat to sue over the matter. Moreover, both men and women alike were talebearers. Such rumors spread, irrespective of the truth, for any number of reasons having nothing to do with gender discrimination. In addition to what commonly motivates gossip of this type--a fascination with the prurient--perceptions of favoritism on Pasqua's part added fuel to the fire in this case. Although it is not inconceivable that someone might spread slanderous rumors in the workplace for the simple motivation that someone else was of a particular gender, this case, however, is not one of those rarities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pasqua argues that the district court erred in failing to consider whether harassment by someone of the same sex, which is actionable in other circuits, should be recognized in this circuit, and in overlooking the pervasive and severe impact of the rumors which he argues created a hostile and intimidating work environment. We need not consider these issues for Pasqua has failed to meet the most basic element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination. Moreover, with respect to the first claimed error, we note that Pasqua failed to raise the same-sex issue before the district court. He argued before the district court that, because Mulvey stated to Vukanic that he took her complaints seriously and would, therefore, investigate her complaints, his complaints were taken less seriously and this disparity was on account of gender. Pasqua abandons this argument on appeal in lieu of the same-sex harassment argument. Not having raised the same gender issue before the district court, he has forfeited appellate review of this issue. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Olano</span>, 507 U.S. 725, 730-32, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L. Ed.2d 508 (1993); <span class="Italic">Cheek v. W. &#x0026; S. Life Ins. Co.</span>, 31 F.3d 497, 505 (7th Cir. 1994). In any event, it is immaterial in this case whether the alleged harassment came from someone of the same gender because, as we have already concluded, the rumors were neither initiated nor perpetuated because of Pasqua's sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">How a supervisor can treat both sexes unfavorably and still engage in discrimination on the basis of sex seems to present an anomaly. A cogent explanation of this phenomenon was given in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Henderson</span>, 257 F.3d 246, 252-56 (2nd Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is axiomatic that mistreatment at work, whether through subjection to a hostile environment or through such concrete deprivations as being fired or being denied a promotion, is actionable under Title VII only when it occurs because of an employee's sex, or other protected characteristic<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.</span>, 523 U.S. 75, 79-80, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed.2d 201 (1998). In determining whether an employee has been discriminated against "because of <span class="Italic">such individual's...</span>sex," 42 USC 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added), the courts have consistently emphasized that the ultimate issue is the reasons for <span class="Italic">the individual plaintiff's</span> treatment, not the relative treatment of different <span class="Italic">groups</span> within the workplace<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Connecticut v. Teal</span>, 457 U.S. 440, 453-54, 102 S. Ct. 2525, 73 L. Ed.2d 130 (1982) ("The principal focus of the statute is the protection of the individual employee, rather than the protection of the minority group as a whole."); <span class="Italic">City of Los Angeles, Dep't of Water and Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 708, 98 S. Ct. 1370, 55 L. Ed.2d 657 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, discrimination against one employee cannot be cured, or disproven, solely by favorable, or equitable, treatment of other employees of the same race or sex<span class="Italic">. See Teal</span>, 457 U.S. at 455, 102 S. Ct. 2525 ("Congress never intended to give an employer license to discriminate against some employees...merely because he favorably treats other members of the employees' group."); <span class="Italic">Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 579, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1978) ("A racially balanced work force cannot immunize an employer from liability for specific acts of discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Carson v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.</span>, 82 F.3d 157, 158 (7th Cir. 1996) (rejecting the argument that plaintiff's replacement by a worker of the same race precluded the establishment of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination). Similarly, the application of discriminatory policies to individuals cannot be justified by their even-handed effects on women and men as classes or in the aggregate<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. at 708-09, 98 S. Ct. 1370 (rejecting employer's argument that requiring female employees to make larger pension contributions than male employees is not discriminatory because, "unless women as a class are assessed an extra charge, they will be subsidized, to some extent, by the class of male employees"). And, whether an employer discriminates against only a subset of a protected class, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">UAW v. Johnson Controls</span>, 499 U.S. 187, 111 S. Ct. 1196, 113 L. Ed.2d 158 (1991) (considering a policy applicable only to unsterilized women of child-bearing age), or discriminates inconsistently, Title VII nevertheless protects any individual so long as that individual is mistreated because of her sex<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Pivirotto v. Innovative Sys. Inc.</span>, 191 F.3d 344, 354 (3d Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Discrimination may, of course, also confer an illegal blanket advantage on members of one group over another--men for example over women. Indeed, the mechanisms by which discrimination occurs within the workplace are often such that they systematically do just that. For this reason, and to underscore such cases, courts have sometimes spoken of the "because of sex" requirement loosely in global terms. Thus, we ourselves have on occasion said that "an environment which is equally harsh for both men and women...does not constitute a hostile working environment under the civil rights statutes." <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Metropolitan Opera Ass'n</span>, 192 F.3d 310, 318 (2d Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, 523 U.S. at 80, 118 S. Ct. 998 ("The critical issue, Title VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.") (internal quotation marks omitted). But, when we have focused on the issue, we have also made clear that it is discriminatory treatment of a given individual that matters. Thus, though it is helpful in proving sex discrimination, we have held that it is not strictly necessary for a plaintiff to identify an employee who was treated more favorably than the plaintiff and who was similarly situated to the plaintiff, except for being of the opposite sex<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 239 F.3d 456, 467-68 (2d Cir. 2001) (applying this analysis to age discrimination); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Gerdom v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc.</span>, 692 F.2d 602, 607-08 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>) ("The statute is not limited in its protection to those job classifications which include both genders.") And the Supreme Court has likewise consistently found that it is the use of an individual's sex (or race, etc.) in setting the terms or conditions of employment that is Title VII's touchstone, regardless of whether such discrimination is part of a broader discriminatory pattern<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Teal</span>, 457 U.S. at 453, 102 S. Ct. 2525; <span class="Italic">Furnco Constr. Corp.</span>, 438 U.S. at 579, 98 S. Ct. 2943; <span class="Italic">Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. at 708-09, 98 S. Ct. 1370. In other words, what matters in the end is not how the employer treated <span class="Italic">other</span> employees, if any, of a different sex, but how the employer <span class="Italic">would have</span> treated <span class="Italic">the plaintiff</span> had she been of a different sex<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Carson</span>, 82 F.3d at 158.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An example makes clear why this is so. Two workers share the same supervisor. A new supervisor takes over who despises women and Southerners. One of the two employees is a woman from New York; the other is a man from Georgia. The new supervisor fires both employees, explaining to the woman "I just don't want any women working for me," and telling the man "I just don't want any Southerners working for me." It is obvious that the woman was discriminated against <span class="Italic">because of her sex</span>, and this fact is in no way negated merely because the supervisor also fired the male co-worker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_867"></span>That being said, in the absence of evidence suggesting that a plaintiff's sex was relevant, the fact that both male and female employees are treated similarly, if badly, does give rise to the inference that their mistreatment shared a common cause that was unrelated to their sex<span class="Italic">. Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Abdu-Brisson</span>, 239 F.3d at 468 (noting that identifying disparities in treatment between similarly situated employees who differ only with regard to a protected characteristic is "a common and especially effective method of establishing the inference of discriminatory intent"); <span class="Italic">Pivirotto</span>, 191 F.3d at 354 ("The fact that a female plaintiff claiming gender discrimination was replaced by another woman might have some evidentiary force, and it would be prudent for a plaintiff in this situation to counter (or explain) such evidence."). And this inference is not necessarily eliminated even if some of the harassment has sexual content<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. Ysleta Ind. Sch. Dist.</span>, 161 F.3d 263, 270-71 (5th Cir. 1998) (upholding summary judgment for defendants where a school principal sent lewd and insulting anonymous letters to both men and women); <span class="Italic">Pasqua v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.</span>, 101 F.3d 514, 517 (7th Cir. 1996) (rejecting a Title VII claim arising out of rumors of a workplace affair, where both a male and a female employee were the subject of the rumors and "[t]here [was] not even a hint in the record that any rumors or vulgar statements" about the relationship "were made <span class="Italic">because</span> [plaintiff] was a male").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the inquiry into whether ill treatment was actually sex-based discrimination cannot be short-circuited by the mere fact that both men and women are involved. For it may be the case that a co-worker or supervisor treats both men and women badly, but women worse<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. First Union Nat'l Bank</span>, 202 F.3d 234, 238-39, 242 (4th Cir. 2000) (rejecting the argument that a female plaintiff could not have been harassed on account of her sex because both men and women complained about the alleged perpetrator, where the supervisor in question subjected plaintiff "to a barrage of threats and gender-based insults"); <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Cisneros</span>, 84 F.3d 256, 260 (7th Cir. 1996) ("It would be exceedingly perverse if a male worker could buy his supervisors and his company immunity from Title VII liability by taking care to harass sexually an occasional male worker, though his preferred targets were female."). Or, as in the example discussed earlier, a woman might be abused in ways that cannot be explained without reference to her sex, notwithstanding the fact that a man received treatment at least as harsh, though for other--non-sexual--reasons<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co.</span>, 25 F.3d 1459, 1464 (9th Cir. 1994) (finding adequate evidence of sex discrimination where, "while [a supervisor's] abuse of men [was] in no way related to their gender, his abuse of female employees, especially [plaintiff], centered on the fact that they were females"). Finally, there might even be circumstances that are actionable under Title VII when both men and women suffer sexually discriminatory harms in the same workplace, but for different reasons. This could occur, for example, if an employer discriminated against women, but not men, who were overweight, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.</span>, 567 F.2d 429, 454 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Gerdom</span>, 692 F.2d at 606-08, and against men, but not women, who dated overweight people<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co.</span>, 791 F.2d 888, 891-92 (11th Cir. 1986) (holding that an employer had discriminated against a white employee, based on his race, when it refused to hire him because of his interracial marriage, and finding that such discrimination against the white employee was consistent with the possibility that the employer also discriminated against African-Americans generally); <span class="Italic">cf. Loving v. Virginia</span>, 388 U.S. 1, 11, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed.2d 1010 (1967) (striking down law prohibiting marriage between whites and non-whites because it imposed an unconstitutional racial classification on both partners).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;Application to the Facts on Appeal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, and turning to the case at hand, we do not find dispositive the fact that much of the challenged conduct had Parrett as its most immediate victim and audience. To the extent that co-workers' conduct toward Parrett, or other men in the workplace, revealed their hostility toward Brown, or was part of a campaign to isolate her from workplace allies, <span class="Italic">on account of her sex</span>, such conduct could contribute to the creation of an actionably hostile work environment for plaintiff<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Schwapp v. Town of Avon</span>, 118 F.3d 106, 111 (2d Cir. 1997) ("Just as a racial epithet need not be directed at a plaintiff in order to contribute to a hostile work environment, the fact that a plaintiff learns second-hand of a racially derogatory comment or joke by a fellow employee or supervisor also can impact the work environment." (internal citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Corroon &#x0026; Black Corp.</span>, 845 F.2d 104, 105-06 (5th Cir. 1988) (finding sex discrimination where plaintiff's entire case rested on the placement in men's restrooms of cartoons that "depict her engaged in crude and deviant sexual activities," where the cartoons could interfere with plaintiff's ability to "deal with her fellow employees and clients with professional dignity and without the barrier of sexual differentiation and abuse"). And this remains so whether or not Parrett also suffered as a result of that harassing conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, we conclude that in the case before us Brown has not carried her burden of showing--even for purposes of avoiding summary judgment--that the harassment she faced was rooted in her sex. The bulk of the behavior she cites, though often highly cruel and vulgar, related either to her union-related conflict with Nelson or to her purported affair with Parrett. Most importantly, both in the statements she made in support of her EEO complaint and in her deposition, plaintiff repeatedly explained that Nelson and the others were harassing her as an outgrowth of their dispute over the union election. And she never suggested that their antagonism toward her was related to her being a woman. Instead, until her affidavit in opposition to summary judgment, Brown gave every indication that, in her view, what made her tormentors' conduct "sexual harassment" was the fact that the behavior touched on matters of sexuality, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> her purported sexual relationship with Parrett, and not that it was a form of sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only basis for linking the harassers' conduct to Brown's sex is the fact that the bathroom cartoon and one of the pictures posted near Parrett's mail route both relied for their effect upon a depiction of a naked female body. In some cases, this connection to plaintiff's sex has sufficed to support the inference that there was a sex-specific character to the course of conduct<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Winsor v. Hinckley Dodge, Inc.</span>, 79 F.3d 996, 1000 (10th Cir. 1996) (finding sufficient evidence of sex discrimination where harassment took the form, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, of a "cartoon directed at plaintiff, depicting a woman pulling up her skirt and spreading her legs"); <span class="Italic">Bennett</span>, 845 F.2d at 106; <span class="Italic">cf. Steiner</span>, 25 F.3d at 1463 (holding that a reasonable jury could find discrimination based on sex where the harassment in question "relied on sexual epithets [and] offensive, explicit references to women's bodies and sexual conduct"). Here, however, there is overwhelming evidence that the hostility toward Brown was grounded in workplace dynamics unrelated to her sex and that even these pictures did not reflect an attack on Brown <span class="Italic">as a woman</span>. Moreover, and crucially, this overwhelming evidence derives substantially from Brown herself, and her own view, clearly expressed, that the harassment was fundamentally the product of a workplace dispute stemming from the union election, and not from her being a woman. Given her repeated statements to that effect, we are reluctant to allow her to rescue her claim with a last-minute conversion to the position that, instead of what she had consistently said before, she faced adverse conditions because she is a woman<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Bickerstaff</span> 196 F.3d at 455 ("It is beyond cavil that a party may not create an issue of fact by submitting an affidavit in opposition to a summary judgment motion that contradicts the affiant's previous deposition testimony." (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted)); <span class="Italic">Raskin</span>, 125 F.3d at 63. Accordingly, we agree with the district court's conclusion that, as a matter of law, Brown cannot show that she suffered the harassment in question because of her sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pepoy v. Attorney General</span>, 02A45576 (2006), the Commission found that the complainant had not shown that a supervisor's constant use of profanity in the office created a hostile environment because she had not heard at least some of the comments until two years after they occurred and, thus, they could not have created a hostile environment at the time. The Commission did, however, in <span class="Italic">Pepoy</span> comment on the defense of the "equal opportunity harasser":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant failed to demonstrate that the incidents as alleged rendered her work environment hostile. Significant to our analysis is the fact that complainant heard of the comments nearly two years after the incidents occurred. Additionally, complainant admitted in her affidavit that she witnessed the ADD using profanity "out on the open floor." Complainant's Affidavit at 19. Complainant heard the ADD say "shit, and goddam it, fuck out on the open floor. He has publically berated people...in front of their own colleagues."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> There are also numerous witnesses who corroborate complainant's statements that the ADD regularly used profanity. The ADD does not dispute that the incident occurred as alleged and also admitted to the fact that he also calls males the "p-word." ADD's Affidavit at 4, 5. The fact that ADD may have been, in some respects, an "equal opportunity harasser" would not necessarily immunize his behavior. We have explicitly rejected the theory that an "equal opportunity harasser" cannot be found to have committed sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See Wild v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01984101 (September 12, 2000). In addition, we note that the use of the term "cunt" in particular, is an extremely derogatory term for women. However, we find, that due to the fact that complainant heard these comments two years after the ADD stated them, she failed to establish that at the time she heard these comments they created a hostile work environment. We recognize that the ADD engaged in inappropriate and unprofessional conduct, which we do not condone, but given these circumstances, we find that complainant has not proffered enough evidence to establish that the environment at work was sufficiently hostile. As such, we affirm the agency's finding of no discrimination with regard to complainant's hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Trina C. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120131971 (2017) (reiterating that "a finding of discrimination based on gender is not precluded simply because the Agency mistreated both males and females," and noting that, while the evidence indicated that management had issues with male members of their staff, "the overwhelming evidence establishes that female staff members were subjected to greater and more targeted mistreatment.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_868"></span>In <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120080375 (2008), the Commission distinguished the facts from <span class="Italic">Pepoy</span> in reversing the agency's dismissal of the claim as not rising to the level of a hostile environment. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> claimed her supervisor has said, "fuck you, you fucking cunt," and raised his middle finger as he walked away. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant matter is distinguishable from that in <span class="Italic">Pepoy</span>. First, that case was adjudicated on the merits, while here the agency is dismissing for failure to state a claim prior to any investigation. Second, the Commission, in finding no discrimination in <span class="Italic">Pepoy</span>, took into account that the complainant in that case did not learn about the offensive comments until two years after the responsible agency official made them. In that instance, while we concluded that the agency official's conduct was inappropriate, unprofessional and not condoned, there was no showing that the work environment was sufficiently hostile at the time that complainant learned of the comments.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120132351 (2015), the Commission essentially approved the equal opportunity offender defense in finding that the supervisor's behavior, while boorish, was directed at both males and females and, therefore, could not be based on sex:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the record reflects that S1 was harsh and abrasive to both female and male employees in the office. Specifically, the Administrative Support Services Specialist (ASSS) (female) averred that Si, in addition to belittling Complainant and another female employee, mistreated a male student intern also. ROI, at 796. According to the ASSS, S1 said about the male intern when he did not return from lunch, "He better be dead or in the hospital," when surprisingly he was, in fact, in the hospital. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The ASSS also averred that she "witnessed [S1] yelling at Contractors in the front lobby...[I] was very embarrassed about her unprofessional behavior." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Based on the above, the record reflects that S1's sharp and abrasive management style was directed at multiple workers, both male and female.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Title VII does not protect an employee against adverse treatment flowing from a supervisor's personality quirks or autocratic attitude. <span class="Italic">See Bouche v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01990799 (Mar. 13, 2002); <span class="Italic">Ferrall v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01994603 (Oct. 16, 2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Schaulis v. CTB/McGraw Hill, Inc.,</span> 496 F. Supp. 666, 670 (N.D. Cal. 1980)); <span class="Italic">See also Jackson v. City of Killeen</span>, 654 F.2d 1181, 1186 (5 th Cir. 1981) ("Title VII is not a shield against harsh treatment at the workplace; it protects only in instances of harshness disparately distributed. The essence of the action is, of course, discrimination.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, assuming that the conduct alleged was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment, we find that Complainant has not shown that any of the alleged incidents were motivated by discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span> based on her sex. While Complainant may have been treated in a negative manner by S1, there is no evidence that S1 did so because of Complainant's sex. <span class="Italic">See Bouche</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01990799 (harassment of complainant had nothing to do with age or sex, but rather were due to management style and problems in the office); <span class="Italic">Ferrall</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01994603 (no discriminatory animus found when supervisor used profanity and yelled at everyone, not just complainant). We note that the record reflects that Complainant was removed from the VLTP because she returned to work and management believed that her medical emergency was over. ROI, at 736-40. There is no evidence that management removed her from the VLTP or engaged in any actions related to her workload or performance due to her sex. We note also that Complainant does not dispute that S2 ultimately approved her request for advanced leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 518-20.</p>
