<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-25"><span class="space">15.</span> Personal Protective Equipment</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cleveland C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020003894 (2021), the Commission rejected the agency's "direct threat" defense where police officers who could not shave without significant discomfort and pain (Pseudofolliculitis Barbae) alleged that an agency policy requiring them to be clean shaven in order to wear respirators constituted disability discrimination. The agency countered that facial hair prevented the respirator from properly sealing onto the skin and police officers were "required to defend themselves and others against possible exposure to explosives, chemicals, or other weapons of mass destruction." The agency issued final decision found that</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainants were not individuals with a disability because their skin disorder did not substantially limit their employment. Additionally, the Agency concluded it did not discriminate against Complainants or deny them reasonable accommodation because it acted within the safety and health regulation guidelines on facial hair and respirator fit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission vacated the agency decision on appeal, finding that: 1) "Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is a physical impairment that substantially limits Complainants in the operation of major bodily functions, including the immune system and skin"; 2) the agency improperly failed to analyze whether the policy was a potentially discriminatory qualification standard; 3) the agency erred in finding that the complainants were a direct threat to themselves and others; and 4) the agency failed to consider relevant OSHA regulations. The class complaint was remanded for supplemental investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following the second appeal, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Cleveland C</span>. found that the policy was job related and consistency with business necessity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our prior appellate decisions in this matter (EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120170405 <span class="Italic">et al</span>.) we have already determined that Complainants are individuals with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. Complainants have each been diagnosed with a serious skin condition, PFB, which causes various painful symptoms when shaving, such as pustules, stinging, irritation, bleeding, infection, a burning sensation, and scarring. The symptoms result from ingrown hairs that occur when facial hair is completely shaven. In Appeal Nos. 0120170405 <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, we found that Complainants were individuals with a disability because "Pseudofolliculitis Barbae is a physical impairment that substantially limits Complainants in the operation of major bodily functions, including the immune system and skin."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainants must also show that they were "qualified" individuals with a disability. A qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a disability who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency does not dispute that Complainants satisfied the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position of Police Officer. Instead, the Agency asserts that Complainants are unable to meet its safety-related qualification standard that requires that all Police Officers, without exception, to have clean-shaven facial skin at all times in order to wear a specifically identified respirator mask. As such, it is undisputed that the Agency's qualification standard has and will continue to screen out Complainants, and others with PFB who cannot be clean shaven, from the Police Officer position because of their disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated in our underlying decision in EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120170405 <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, the question of whether Complainants are "qualified" to perform the job of Police Officer hinges on whether the qualification standard they are unable to meet (wearing the Avon C50 respirator with clean-shaven facial skin) has been justified by the Agency and, if it has been justified, whether there is a reasonable accommodation that would enable them to meet the standard. In other words, to defend itself against the charge that the application of the qualification standard screens out or tends to screen out an individual or class of individuals because of disability violates the Rehabilitation Act, the Agency must establish that:</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G. v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (December 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When determining if a qualification standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the central question is whether the standard is "carefully tailored to measure [an individual's or individuals'] actual ability to [perform] the essential function of the job." H.R. Rep. 101-485(11) at 36, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess. 1990, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 353-5. Here, Complainants' disability prevents them from being clean shaven, which the Agency maintains disqualifies them from wearing the required tight-fitting respirator masks because, in the Agency's opinion, the masks could not create an adequate protective seal with their facial skin. Therefore, the Agency asserts Complainants' disability prevented them from meeting the Agency's respirator mask/clean-shaven standard. This resulted in Complainants being stripped of their Police Officer duties and placed on light duty until they chose to comply and fully shave <span id="Page_1300"></span>their faces or face disciplinary action including removal. Complainants, however, argue that prior to the Agency's new standard they held medical waivers to have facial hair up to 1/4 inch long and they were able to pass respirator fit tests with the facial hair. They also argue that the Agency refused to consider alternatives to the tight-fitting masks, such as the hood-or helmet-type (loose fitting) masks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its supplemental investigation in response to the Commission's Order in EEOC Appeal No. 0120170405 <span class="Italic">et al</span>., Agency witnesses stated that Police Officers need to use a respirator: (1) for annual OSHA required fit-test, (2) for a training exercise, or (3) when in contact with or in response to an incident with hazardous materials. The Agency witnesses stated that the Avon C-50 that is able to operate as a negative-pressure or positive-pressure air purifying respirator. They stated the Avon C-50 offers protection against chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological agents and toxic industrial chemicals/materials and proper fitting respirator equipment is essential for the duties of the PFPA Police Officer position, to prevent acute incapacitation or illness, and enable escape.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency noted that OSHA regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134(g)(1)(i)(A) prohibits tight-fitting face masks being worn by employees with facial hair that comes between the sealing surface and face or interferes with valve function, regardless if use is routine or occasional. The Agency stated that its policy that Officers be able to properly use the Avon C-50 mask is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the evidence of record, we conclude that the Agency has established that the ability to wear a respirator mask by its Police Officers is job-related and consistent with business necessity. As first responders, wearing a mask that works properly is an essential function of their position, and the issue is not the frequency in which Officers wear the mask but the ability to wear it properly in an emergency, when needed. The question to be determined, however, is whether or not Officers whose disability impacts their ability to be completely clean shaven can be provided with an accommodation such as a waiver of the rule to permit closely cropped facial hair like the 1/4 inch they were previously permitted or the provision of another type of respirator that is not impacted by facial hair?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we conclude that the Agency has failed to make this showing. The Agency acknowledged, in some instances, tight-fitting respirators (negative or positive pressure masks) can achieve an adequate seal with faces that have a small degree of facial hair between the sealing surface of the mask and face. However, the Agency stated that studies have shown that fit factors are reduced by facial hair and/or there is a higher probability for leakage. The Agency added that OSHA's position is that a respirator fit achieved with facial hair is unpredictable and subject to change depending on facial hair length, density, and position. In response to the question of alternative equipment, the Agency stated that the respirators that do not require a facial seal and can usually be worn by bearded employees (such as positive-pressure respirators of the hood-and helmet-type) do not provide the visual field and dexterity needed for an Officer to fulfill PFPA requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to exclude an individual with a disability based on the possibility of future injury, the Agency must prove through evidence that there is a significant risk of substantial harm. A speculative or remote risk is insufficient, and the Agency must show more than that an individual with a disability stands some slightly increased risk of harm. The burden of showing a significant risk is on the Agency. <span class="Italic">Selix v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000). Here, we find that the general conclusory statements by the Agency as to a potential risk of a mask seal failure in an emergency situation for Officers with closely cropped facial hair are without adequate evidentiary support despite its opportunity to collect such evidence during the supplemental investigation. We particularly note that prior to the passage of the current rule requiring all Police Officers, without exception, to be clean shaven, the Agency had a 2002 regulation that allowed for a medical waiver for a small amount of facial hair (1/4 inch) for its Officers. The Complainants all qualified for the waiver, passed their annual mask fit tests, and there is no evidence that they were unable to perform the essential functions of their position with the waiver or that any incident occurred where they were in danger or risked danger to others due to a respirator mask failure in an emergency situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the record shows that OSHA's regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134 contemplates providing Powered Air-Purifying Respirators to those who cannot use a negative pressure mask due to a medical condition. While arguing alternative masks would interfere with the ability of Officers to perform their essential duties, beyond these general contentions, the Agency has again not adequately substantiated its claims with evidence. In sum, the Agency has failed to meet it burden of proving that there is no accommodation that would enable the Complainants to meet the existing standard or no alternative approach (itself a form of accommodation) through which the employer can determine whether the person can perform the essential function involved. Under these circumstances, the Agency's imposition of a blanket policy requiring all Officers to be clean-shaven regardless of their medical condition violates the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2022, the Commission granted petitions for enforcement brought by the complainants in <span class="Italic">Cleveland C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2022003567 (2022), when the agency refused to comply with the Commission's orders because "providing alternate equipment [was] not a viable option for its mission":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these cases, the Agency states that it will not comply with the orders to provide reasonable accommodation alternative options (waiver or alternative equipment) for those with appropriate medical documentation to the clean-shaven rule; and post a notice regarding the finding of discrimination. In support, the Agency rehashes its position that it cannot comply. Additionally, the Agency stated its position that it would not be in the best interest of the Agency to adhere to the "Posting Order" requirement because the PFPA Director does not believe the Agency actions were discriminatory. However, we remind the Agency that a Petition for Enforcement is not the forum to reargue the merits of a case. When a request for reconsideration is denied, as is the case here, the agency shall provide the relief ordered and there is no further right to delay implementation of the ordered relief. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.502(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's response is a blatant disregard for the Commission's authority to ensure compliance with its orders pursuant to a finding of discrimination. Moreover, the opinion of the PFPA Director regarding whether acts of discrimination occurred does not override the Commission's authority under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.103. To be clear, the Commission is tasked with determining whether the Agency has acted in a discriminatory manner and not the PFPA Director.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we caution the Agency that the ongoing non-compliance with Commission orders will result in the requirement to issue a written report to the Director, Federal Sector Programs, Office of Federal Operations regarding deficiencies in compliance and a detailed action plan for addressing its failure to comply with Commission orders. <span class="Italic">See Iesha G. v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Petition No. 2019004319 (Jan. 31, 2020), <span class="Italic">see also Chastity L. v. Dep't of the State</span>, EEOC Petition No. 2021004652 (June 27, 2022).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless otherwise noted, within sixty (60) calendar days of the date this decision is issued, the Agency shall take the following actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.	To the extent Complainant(s) were removed from their PFPA Police Officer positions due to failure to comply with the qualification standard at issue, the Agency shall offer Complainant(s) reinstatement into the position of Police Officer from which they were removed. The Agency shall afford Complainant(s) fifteen (15) calendar days to determine whether to accept reinstatement. Should Complainant(s) reject the offer of reinstatement, their entitlement to back pay shall terminate as of the date of the rejection.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.	If Complainant(s) accept the reinstatement offer, the Agency shall place Complainant(s) in the Police Officer position retroactive to the date they were removed, for the purpose of seniority and other employment benefits (including within-grade salary increases and career ladder promotions) tied to seniority.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.	Consistent with reinstatement from paragraph (1) above, the Agency shall determine the appropriate amount of back pay, with interest, and other benefits due to Complainant(s), pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501. Complainant(s) shall cooperate in the Agency's efforts to compute the amount of back pay and benefits due and shall provide all relevant information requested by the Agency. If there is a dispute regarding the exact amount of back pay and/or benefits, the Agency shall issue a check to Complainant(s) for the undisputed amount within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the Agency determines the amount it believes to be due. Complainant(s) may petition for enforcement or clarification of the amount in dispute. The petition for clarification or enforcement must be filed with the Compliance Officer, at the address referenced in the statement entitled, "Implementation of the Commission's Decision."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.	Provide reasonable accommodation alternative options (waiver or alternative equipment) for those with appropriate medical documentation to the clean-shaven rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.	Remove record of disciplinary action related to failure to comply with the qualification standard from official personnel records of Complainant(s).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.	Conduct supplemental investigations on entitlement to compensatory damages and provide Complainant(s) an opportunity to submit evidence of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages. For guidance on what evidence is necessary to prove entitlement to pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages, the parties are directed to EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and Punitive Damages <span id="Page_1301"></span>Available under &#x00A7; 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, EEOC No. 915-002 (July 14, 1992) (available at eeoc.gov) and <span class="Italic">Carle v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (Jan. 5, 1993). The Agency shall complete the investigation and issue a final decision, appealable to this Commission, determining the appropriate amount of damages within 120 calendar days of the date of this decision. Complainant(s) shall cooperate with the Agency's investigation. If there is a dispute regarding the exact amount of compensatory damages, the Agency shall issue a check to Complainant(s) for the undisputed amount within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the Agency determines the amount it believes to be due.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">7.	The Agency shall provide eight (8) hours of EEO training for the responsible management official(s) involved herein. The training shall emphasize the Rehabilitation Act's requirements with respect to the Agency's medical/physical standards and medical waiver programs to ensure that similar violations do not occur.</p>
