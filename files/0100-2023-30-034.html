<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-35"><span class="space">g.</span> Thrift Savings and 401(k) Plans</h5>
<p class="noindent">Many federal employees participate in a Thrift Savings Plan where automatic contributions are deducted from their paychecks. When a discriminatory action eliminates or reduces these contributions, make-whole relief includes not only the contributions themselves, but the interest that would have been earned but for the discriminatory action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0420120003 (2013); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15026 (2003); <span class="Italic">Henley v. Attorney General</span>, 01A22186 (2002); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 04980006 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Fiene v. Postmaster General</span>, 04920009 (1992). However, a complainant is not entitled to an award of interest based on the delay in making the contributions. <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120111944 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Zarbo v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 04A10021 (2001), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner seeks reimbursement for the contributions that the agency would have matched or contributed to petitioner's TSP account. TSP is a tax-deferred investment retirement plan for federal employees. Petitioner contends that the agency must reimburse her TSP account for the five percent matching funds the agency would have contributed to match her own contribution during the back pay period at the rate of the back pay awarded in the prior decision. We construe petitioner's contention to be that when she received her back pay award, the agency had deducted amounts for her employee contribution to her TSP account, but had not, as part of her back pay award, deposited funds into her account representing the additional matching contribution the agency would have made to her account during the back pay period if she had received the promotion in question and been contributing to TSP based on the higher salary level of that position. As noted above, the agency's response to petitioner's petition for enforcement makes no reference to this contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that "make whole" relief requires the agency to make retroactive tax-deferred contributions to a petitioner's TSP account during the back pay period<span class="Italic">. Howgate v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04990031 (February 4, 2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Fiene v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04920009 (September 3, 1992)). The Commission has also held that, to the extent an employee would have received government contributions to a retirement fund as a component of salary, the employee is entitled to have retirement benefits adjusted as part of the back pay award, including receiving the earnings which the account would have accrued during the relevant period<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04980006 (July 2, 1998); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04980020 (October 1, 1998); <span class="Italic">Korchnak v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04960028 (December 19, 1996) (petitioner who was terminated before becoming eligible for TSP entitled to enrollment in the program); <span class="Italic">Wrigley v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04950005 (February 15, 1996)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in order to comply with the prior order that the agency provide "back pay and other benefits" due to petitioner, the agency shall compute the amounts that should be placed in petitioner's TSP account to compensate her for any agency matching contributions which would have been made based on the rate of pay to which she was entitled during the back pay period, as well as earnings which would have been accrued. The agency shall then pay into petitioner's TSP account all amounts owed. All calculations shall be fully explained and provided to the Commission's Compliance Division with supporting, patently clear, and precise documentation. Documentation, unaccompanied by clarification, shall not be deemed sufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120053035 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee, however, is not entitled to interest on the thrift savings contributions because the requirement that the agency pay earnings on the amounts that would have accrued makes the complainant whole for any losses. <span class="Italic">Munno v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 04A10042 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant has set either a dollar or percentage amount as a regular payment into the thrift savings plan, he cannot increase that amount as part of any back pay calculations. In <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0420060017 (2007), the complainant received a retroactive promotion as part of his relief. In a petition for enforcement, he contended that the agency had not allowed him to make additional contributions to his account. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Wagner</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency responded to complainant's Petition, stating that pursuant to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board regulation, an employee is not allowed to make additional TSP contributions from a back pay award under complainant's circumstances. The agency submitted a Memorandum, dated September 26, 2005, from the Office of Benefits Services. The Memorandum states that the law allows an employee "to make additional TSP contributions from back pay award only when the employee had either elected to contribute a percentage of basic pay to TSP or when the employee had elected to contribute a dollar amount which equaled the maximum percentage allowed for TSP contributions." The record reveals that petitioner had elected to contribute $25.00 to the TSP each pay period and that this amount was deducted from his pay and contributed to the TSP each pay period. Accordingly, the agency concluded that because petitioner elected a specific dollar amount ($25.00) it would be against regulations to allow him to make additional contributions as a result of a back pay award. The agency also submitted a copy of complainant's "Supplemental Code Sheet for TSP Contributions" which indicated that the agency had appropriately adjusted the 1% matching TSP contribution to petitioner's TSP account. Accordingly, we are satisfied that complainant was not qualified for additional contributions to his TSP account. The record shows that he would not have received additional TSP contributions in the absence of discrimination. We are also satisfied that the agency provided appropriate documentation concerning its decision to not allow complainant additional contributions to his TSP account. Therefore, the agency is in compliance with the Commission's previous Order.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the case involved a breach of settlement claim, in <span class="Italic">France v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span>, 0120072125 (2007), the Commission held that the employee was entitled to a tax-deferred deposit into her 401(k) retirement plan and not a check for the next amount of the deposit minus taxes. The settlement agreement called for the agency to make a 401(k) deposit slightly in excess of $5,000. Instead, the agency issued the complainant a check for a net amount of slightly less than $4,000. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">France</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The settlement agreement states the agency will pay "40IK savings contributions." In light of the characterization of the payment as "40 IK savings contributions," the plain meaning of this is it would go into complainant's FDIC 40IK account. This was not done, and the FAD concedes such direct payment would have been made tax deferred. At this point, the question becomes the proper remedy. We find that it is to give complainant the option of keeping the net payment of $3,735.57, or returning to the agency the gross amount of $5,509.70 for the tax deferred payment by the agency of $5,509.70 into her 401K FDIC account.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an employee who is reinstated is entitled to lost thrift savings plan contributions and loss of income on those contributions, she is not entitled to be reimbursed for withdrawals she made from the plan during her termination or for the tax consequences of those withdrawals. In <span class="Italic">Martinelli v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120072930 (2008), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that she was required to withdraw her Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) funds early due to the termination. As a result, she claims she was required to pay federal and state taxes on the money. Complainant argues that she should be reimbursed the tax, as well as the money she was required to withdraw from her account. The Commission has no precedent for requiring a complainant to be reimbursed for the amount withdrawn from a TSP account during the period of unemployment, in order to grant "make whole" relief. <span class="Italic">Gause v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972427 (March 8, 2000) (stating that borrowed money used for expenses during a complainant's period of unemployment is covered by an award of back pay and not subject to reimbursement through compensatory damages). As such, we find that complainant is not entitled to reimbursement for the sums which she withdrew from her TSP account. Furthermore, we find insufficient evidence that complainant withdrew her money as a result of the discrimination, rather than due to the problems surrounding her house.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission has held that make whole relief requires the agency to make retroactive tax-deferred contributions to the petitioner's retirement account for the relevant period. <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. TVA,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01976157 (August 22, 2001); <span class="Italic">Fiene v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04920009 (September 3, 1992). Thus, to the extent complainant would have received agency contributions to a retirement fund as a component of her salary, she is entitled to have her retirement benefits adjusted as part of her back pay award, including sums which the account would have earned during the relevant period. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A00528 (June 1, 2000); <span class="Italic">Howgate v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04990031 (February 4, 2000). The agency is reminded of this obligation when it calculates complainant's back pay award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Barrington v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120101822 (2011), the Commission accepted the agency's argument that it could not make matching contributions to the complainant's thrift savings plan because of a prohibition on such contributions after a hardship loan. In ordering the agency to pay the contribution amount directly to the complainant, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Barrington</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that she is entitled to make and receive credit for TSP catch-up contributions for the six month period following withdrawal of a hardship loan. Complainant recovered her share of the <span id="Page_1722"></span>catch-up contributions when the Agency paid her back wages, but yet to be awarded are the Agency's matching contributions. The matching contributions are equitable relief because they are job benefits that Complainant would have received if she had not been unlawfully terminated. <span class="Italic">See Padilla v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 04970010 (October 2, 1997) (noting that "benefits" is construed broadly to include everything that Complainant would have been entitled to in the absence of discrimination). The record indicates that the matching contributions for the six month period would have been $1,140 ($190 per month). The Agency claims that it is unable to make matching contributions because TIB mandates a six-month "non-contribution period" following withdrawal of a hardship loan. While there may be no mechanism to place matching contributions for the relevant period into Complainant's TSP account, the Agency can make the $1,140 payment directly to Complainant. Complainant is entitled to receive this amount because the Agency's discrimination led to the loss of TSP matching contributions.</p>
<p class="noindent">As important as making the lost contributions and earnings is documenting the calculations for those losses. For example, in <span class="Italic">Yovan v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 021011290 (2013), the Commission found that the agency failed to adequately document its calculations when it submitted an affidavit indicating the calculations were made according to agency regulations. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Yovan</span> remanded the matter back to the agency explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The supplemental investigation contains an affidavit from the Director, Office of Participant Services, at the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (DOFPS). The DOFPS provided in her affidavit that the "TSP breakage provided in [the Thrift Savings Plan Participant Transaction History Report for Complainant] was calculated in accordance with the Agency's regulations." The record contains a document titled "Transaction Detail By Source" with transactions dated December 18, 2007, that show that "late contributions" for the time period February 2, 1995 to January 25, 2001 were provided to Complainant's TSP account. Further, the record contains a Transaction History Report for Complainant dated December 9, 2010. This report details the transactions from January 13, 2000 to January 25, 2001. This report also details the 46 late contributions, as well as 46 "breakage" amounts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that the Agency failed to clearly delineate how it determined the amounts to be paid and how it calculated the breakage for each of these periods. Although the Agency provided an affidavit stating that it calculated the amounts according to Agency regulations, we find that the information provided does not clearly explain how these figures were reached. The record is lacking an affidavit from the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board "specifically indicating how it calculated these amounts," as required by the Commission's previous order. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the Agency for additional supplementation of the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">On reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Yovan v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520130302 (2013), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that it could not provide calculations because that was the province of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board noting the agency had an obligation to secure the calculations from the FRTIB. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Deidra D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120132487 (2015) (remand for how agency calculated thrift savings contributions).</p>
