<p class="noindent">Of course, the objective of all EEO complainants is to gain some form of relief for the perceived discrimination. The particular relief granted in any case is dependent upon the underlying personnel action, term, condition, or privilege of employment that formed the basis of the complaint. For example, it stands to reason that one cannot expect to be granted relief in the form of a promotion unless a failure to promote is involved in the alleged discriminatory act of the agency. Because the EEOC fashions relief on a case-by-case basis, employees, and sometimes agencies, are often confused about exactly what is at stake in an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA are remedial in nature. The goal of the statutes is to put the victim of discrimination where he or she would have been but for the prohibited discrimination or, to state it another way, to make the victim of discrimination whole. The remedies that existed prior to 1991 are the so-called "equitable remedies." The Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, effective November 21, 1991, enhanced the remedies available to victims of intentional discrimination under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. The 1991 civil rights legislation authorizes both punitive and compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sec. 102(b), codified at 42 USC 1981a(b). However, the federal government is exempted from the provision authorizing punitive damages. There is a cap of $300,000 on compensatory damages. The Act further insulates federal agencies from compensatory damages under the Rehabilitation Act, if they can demonstrate good faith efforts to provide an employee with reasonable accommodation even when those efforts fall short of what is legally required. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sec. 102(a)(3), codified at 42 USC 1981a(a)(3). The 1991 Civil Rights Act also provides that, in cases where an employee demonstrates that discrimination occurred and the agency demonstrates it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination, the employee may obtain injunctive relief, as well as recover attorney fees and costs. However, the employee is not entitled to reinstatement or back pay as a remedy. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sec. 107, codified at 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2). Finally, the Act contains an express waiver of sovereign immunity, so that interest on back pay awards is now recoverable against federal agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sec. 114, codified at 42 USC 2000e-16(d). These provisions are discussed below and also in Chapter 13 subheading "<a href="0100-2023-22-150.html#sec13-149">Interest on Back Pay Awards</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Equal Pay Act, which prohibits sex-based wage discrimination, is part of the Fair Labor Standards Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 206(d). When a complainant establishes that he or she meets the jurisdictional requirements of both Title VII and the EPA, any EPA violation is also a violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01943457 (1995). A complainant may recover under both statutes, but may not receive duplicative relief. As discussed below, the EPA, at 29 USC 206(d)(1), provides for liquidated damages for willful violations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Initially, the courts of appeals were split on the issue of whether the EEOC could award compensatory damages against a federal agency in the administrative process. One circuit held that the EEOC had such authority, and two circuits held that only the U.S. district courts had the authority to award compensatory damages. In <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed.2d 196 (1999), a divided Supreme Court held that the EEOC did have the authority to award compensatory damages against federal agencies in the administrative process.</p>
<p class="noindent">As of October 30, 1987, the Commission significantly revised its regulations with respect to the scope of relief in EEO complaints. The Commission also promulgated a policy statement on relief at Appendix A of 29 CFR Part 1613, which offered some additional guidance. The revisions were much needed and went a long way toward clarifying the type and extent of relief to which the successful complainant is entitled. It must be kept in mind that relief still is granted on a case-by-case basis. No doubt, questions on relief will continue to arise. But, at least the Commission developed a comprehensive policy that provides the basis for resolving those questions. Although Part 1613 has been superseded by Part 1614, the appendix to Part 1613 remains a valid statement of the Commission's position on relief, except that it does not account for compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic relief policies of the Commission were reaffirmed in 29 CFR Part 1614, which became effective October 1, 1992. The Commission did resolve two significant questions regarding relief in the 1992 regulations. First, the Commission adopted the clear and convincing evidence standard for application in cases where the agency attempts to avoid granting a remedy for a victim of discrimination by proving it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(c)(2). The Commission specifically rejected the application of the preponderance of the evidence standard in such cases and distinguished these cases from the so-called mixed motive cases. See <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 10</a>. Also, the Commission placed the burden of proof on agencies with respect to mitigation of damages. Agencies must prove failure to mitigate by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(d). These changes are discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, effective November 9, 1999, the Commission amended Part 1614 by making several revisions that are discussed throughout the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> and summarized in Chapter 1 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-10-022.html#sec1-23">Organization of Part 1614</a>." The provisions of the Commission's regulations on relief were not changed by the 1999 amendments. However, the procedures for granting relief upon a finding of discrimination were affected by the 1999 amendments. In complaints that are subject to a decision by an administrative judge, an agency may no longer issue a final agency decision accepting, rejecting, or modifying the decision of the judge. If the agency determines that it will not fully implement the decision, the agency must appeal the decision to the Office of Federal Operations. In conjunction with that procedural change, the administrative judge's decision will address the issue of relief. As with decisions on the merits, the judge's findings on relief are binding on the agency unless it appeals the decision to OFO. See <a href="0100-2023-16-001.html#sec7-1">Chapter 7</a>. Also in the 1999 amendments, the Commission adopted a regulation addressing interim relief in cases where a removal, separation, or suspension continues beyond the date of the agency appeal. In those cases, the agency will be required to grant prospective relief to the complainant pending appeal, but will not be required to provide retroactive relief unless the appeal decision is unfavorable to the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.505. See Chapter 8 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-17-020.html#sec8-21">Interim Relief</a>." Finally, the Commission adopted a regulation that allows agencies to make offers of resolution to complainants that, if rejected, will limit the recovery of attorney fees if the complainant does not obtain more in relief than what was offered by the agency. See Chapter 5, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-14-122.html#sec5-122">Attorney Fee Issues</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Relief for individual complainants is predicated, of course, upon a finding that the employee was discriminated against and is entitled to relief. The scope of relief that legally is available should not be overlooked, though, in negotiating settlements. Because settlement involves concessions by both parties, the full scope of legal relief is the yardstick against which the parties can assess the desirability of any particular settlement. This is important because often complainants and agencies alike do not understand the limits that are placed upon the statutory relief available. Having a firm grasp on what is at stake if the case proceeds to litigation will assist all parties in achieving settlement, if possible.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are two competing principles to keep in mind in terms of remedies and damages. The first is that doubts as to the appropriate remedy are generally resolved in favor of the victim of discrimination. If there is a "windfall" to be had, it will not go to the wrongdoer. The object of relief, as noted above, is to the put the victim of discrimination as nearly as possible in the position that he or she would have been in but for the discrimination. The second principle is really a corollary to that rule. The victim of discrimination does not get put in a better position than he or she would have been in but for the discrimination. Though not always mentioned in decisions, these two principles are at the heart of the many permutations and applications of specific remedies discussed throughout this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec21-2"><span class="space">I.</span> ELEMENTS OF EQUITABLE RELIEF</h2>
<p class="noindent">Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA are known as "remedial" or "make whole" statutes. "As a general rule, when discrimination is found, the appropriate remedy to which the victim of discrimination is entitled is that remedy which, as nearly as possible, places him/her in the situation which he/she would have been had the discrimination not occurred." <span class="Italic">Trader v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01852871 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975)). The object of these statutes is not to punish the offending employer, but to place the employee in the position he or she would have been, had there been no prohibited discrimination. As noted above, the 1991 Civil Rights Act authorized awards of compensatory damages against the federal government in cases of intentional discrimination under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. Compensatory damages further the remedial purpose of those statutes by allowing additional compensation for the injuries suffered by victims of discrimination, including compensation for emotional distress. Even with the 1991 Civil Rights Act, in the federal sector relief is still premised on the "make whole" concept that focuses on compensating the victim rather than punishing the offender because federal agencies are exempt from the Act's provision on punitive damages. Just as the object of relief for discrimination is not punishment of the offending agency, the object is not to place the victim of discrimination in a better position than he or she would otherwise have occupied but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00180 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">The remedies that existed prior to the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act are the so-called "equitable remedies." Equitable remedies include injunctive relief, back pay and front pay. Injunctive relief includes interim relief, discussed below, and such things as orders for an agency to cease discriminatory behavior and refrain from such behavior in the future. Back pay is, as the name suggests, restoration of the pay, as well as the benefits, that an individual has <span id="Page_1698"></span>lost as a result of discrimination. Front pay is a limited remedy and is discussed in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-30-069.html#sec21-67">Other Forms of Equitable Relief</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where compensatory damages are not an issue, make-whole relief for discrimination may consist of as little as the posting of a notice of violation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01941684 (1995), the Commission, in a case involving a sex-based epithet, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, within a few days of the incident, Supervisor A issued to Employee 1 a letter of reprimand which was placed in Employee 1's official personnel file. Although Employee 1 declined to apologize, the letter of reprimand was sufficient to impress upon him that his behavior was inappropriate and should not recur. The record reflects that this was a first-time offense and a one-time occurrence; therefore, the penalty selected by Supervisor A was appropriate under the agency's Table of Penalties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When discrimination is found, the agency must provide the complainant, appellant herein, with an equitable remedy that constitutes full, make-whole relief to restore her to the position she would have occupied absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.</span>, 424 U.S. 747, 764 (1976); <span class="Italic">Adesanya v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933395 (July 21, 1994). In this case, the complainant no longer works for the agency and the harm found was a single incident of being called by a moderately offensive epithet. Therefore, make-whole relief consists of the agency posting a notice of the finding of discrimination....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although relief in discrimination cases is not meant to be punitive, the Commission places an emphasis on preventative relief in the form of orders against offending agencies to take measures to avoid similar violations in the future. Perhaps such relief is not of major concern to the individual complainant who already suffered from some discriminatory action, but it is consistent with the purposes of Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA to eliminate prohibited forms of discrimination in the workplace, and it is within the authority of the Commission to order such relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">At times, the precise relief to be granted has a degree of speculation to it and a general principle of fashioning relief is that the benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer. The effect of that principle is that it often works to shift the burden of proof to the agency to limit the remedy. For example, as discussed more fully below, the complainant has a duty to mitigate damages by taking such actions as looking for alternative employment, but the burden of proof is on the agency to demonstrate that the complainant has failed to mitigate damages. However, a complainant, while entitled to be placed as nearly as possible in the position he or she would have been in but for the discrimination, is not entitled to be placed in a better position. In <span class="Italic">Riddick v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720110011 (2011), the Commission found the administrative judge erred in ordering the reinstatement of the complainant where he found retaliation in placing her on AWOL but also found her subsequent termination for being on duty under the influence of an illegal drug was not discriminatory. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Riddick</span>, found that the remedy ordered by the judge would have placed the complainant in a better position than she would have been in but for the discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of its argument, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Godwin v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A40973 (December 15, 2005). In <span class="Italic">Godwin,</span> the Commission rejected Complainant's argument that she was entitled to reinstatement where an AJ found she not subjected to a hostile work environment and her resignation was not a constructive discharge. The Commission held that grounds for reinstatement did not exist in the absence of a finding that the Complainant's departure from the agency was due to discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In opposition to this argument, on appeal Complainant generally argues that the AJ found that she was subjected to various actions since March 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The object of Title VII remedies is to make the complainant whole for the injuries suffered, i.e., place the complainant in the position she would have been in absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</span> 422 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975). A complainant is not entitled to be placed in a better position than she would have occupied absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Garde v. Department of Commerce,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01850545 (Nov. 3, 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only matters the AJ found to be discriminatory were the Agency charging Complainant with AWOL for May 23, 2008, and thereafter repeatedly asking her to settle both her EEO complaints in exchange for the AWOL charge being dropped after she rejected this deal. The AJ explicitly found that Complainant was not subjected to retaliatory harassment, and this covered 2007 (even though her complaint did not include 2007). Complainant had a prior EEO complaint, filed in August 2007, that alleged retaliatory disparate treatment and harassment for events occurring from March 2007 to August 2007, including a August 2007 admonishment that was prior discipline used by the Agency to support the removal. The Agency found no discrimination on this complaint, and Complainant did not appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the remedy of reinstatement places Complainant in a better position than she would have been absent discrimination. She was terminated effective December 5, 2008, for being on duty while under the influence of an illegal drug on September 12, 2008. The AJ found this removal was not discriminatory, i.e., it was not discriminatory to remove Complainant for reporting to work under the influence of an illegal drug.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ faulted the Agency for not addressing Complainant's abuse of alcohol and or cocaine. Complainant did not allege she was discriminated against based on disability, and the AJ did not find the Agency discriminated against her by not addressing her alcohol and or cocaine use. Given the discrimination found, reinstatement places Complainant in a better position than she would have been in absent the discrimination. Accordingly, the AJ's decision to conditionally reinstate Complainant is reversed.</p>
