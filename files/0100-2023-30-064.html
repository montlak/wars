<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-62"><span class="space">6.</span> Priority Consideration</h4>
<p class="noindent">The exact status of priority consideration as a remedy was in question after the Commission revised its regulations in 1987. Priority consideration was a potential remedy for discrimination under the Commission's former regulations. In essence, priority consideration meant the employee should be considered for promotion to a position for which he is qualified before other candidates are considered for the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.271(b)(2) (1986). Under the old regulations, priority consideration was much like a concession prize. Often, it was granted when a finding of discrimination had been entered, but the agency had demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would not have promoted the employee even absent discrimination. The Commission's 1987 regulations made no mention of priority consideration as a remedy and for some time it was not clear whether the Commission had abandoned its use.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since the 1987 amendment of its regulations, the Commission has granted priority consideration as relief without any discussion of its omission. In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01870235 (1988), the Commission granted one-time priority consideration for a future promotion to a job for which the employee was qualified, where the agency had demonstrated that it would not have selected him even absent discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in 1989, the Commission directly confronted the question and held that priority consideration was still an appropriate remedy in certain circumstances and that its change in regulatory language was not meant to narrow the available remedies. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01891916 (1989), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not agree, however, with the FAD's rejection of the AJ's recommendation to award priority consideration. As the agency noted, the EEOC Regulations in effect prior to November 30, 1987 specifically provided priority consideration as a remedy under these circumstances. 29 CFR 1613.271(a)(2). (Old Regulations). The change in language in the new Regulations no longer referred to priority consideration. However, the language of the new regulations, directing the agency "to eliminate any discriminatory practice and ensure that it does not recur," should be read as broadening the remedies available, not eliminating them. In this respect 29 CFR 1613.271(c)(2) must be read in conjunction with the language of 29 CFR 1613.271(c), that "the agency shall take remedial actions which shall include one or more of the [actions listed], but need not be limited to [the actions listed]." The Commission has continued to award priority consideration under the new Regulations under appropriate circumstances....</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no mention of priority consideration as a remedy under Part 1614. But there also is no indication that the Commission intends to depart from its previous case law with respect to priority consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">Priority consideration is a term of art. It means the complainant must be considered for a vacant position or positions, for which he or she is qualified, prior to consideration of any other applicants. The complainant may only be rejected for legitimate reasons. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hightower v. Postmaster General</span>, 04A10018 (2001); <span class="Italic">Ausberry v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01994833 (2001). It is unlikely that the parties to a settlement agreement would use the phrase "priority consideration" if a guaranteed placement was contemplated. <span class="Italic">Aiken v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01893357 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">Though many complainants would like to believe otherwise, priority consideration is not a guarantee for selection. For example in <span class="Italic">Pereira v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A30663 (2003), the Commission found that the agency fulfilled its obligations under a settlement agreement to grant priority consideration to the complainant. In that case, the selecting official interviewed the complainant and tested him of 15 skills questions related to the job. Based on the complainant's score of answering only seven of 18 questions correctly, the supervisor rejected the complainant and then sought outside applicants for the job. The Commission found that the complainant had received priority consideration and was rejected for legitimate reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the term is defined in the settlement agreement, however, then the Commission will enforce that definition, and the selecting official must consider the complainant prior to considering any other applicant for the position and may not compare the qualifications of the complainant with any other applicant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shield v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01954317 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Shield</span>, the Commission found there was evidence suggesting that the selecting official had considered the complainant's application along with those of other candidates. At the very least, it appeared the selecting official had the applications of other candidates in his possession while reviewing the qualifications of the complainant. This gave the selecting official the opportunity to "subvert" the settlement agreement and, with this as an alternative basis, the Commission found the agency was in violation of the agreement. Similarly, the term "priority consideration" was not given its usual meaning in <span class="Italic">Peters v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A14142 (2003), where the terms of the settlement agreement made clear that the complainant had to apply for specific positions in order to receive priority consideration. However, in <span class="Italic">Garibay v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01950936 (1996), the Commission enforced the use of priority consideration as a term of art even where it was not specifically defined in the settlement agreement. Clearly, the better practice is to specifically define the term in any settlement agreement to avoid future disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Priority consideration is accepted as a term of the art by the Merit Systems Protection Board, also. In <span class="Italic">Biggar v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01964674 (1997), the Commission described how the MSPB defines priority consideration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final agency decision found that the agency had complied with the terms of the settlement agreement which provided that the agency would:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">afford complainant priority consideration, as defined in ATF-o-2335.1A, Merit Promotion, or in an applicable successor merit promotion order, for the next GS-1854-12 Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Specialist (Management Analyst) position in Compliance Operations announced in the Southeast Regional Office of the ATF. Should the parties disagree as to the meaning of "priority consideration," they shall look to the decisions of the MSPB [Merit Systems Protection Board] and the courts for guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB has held that "priority consideration" is a term of art which means that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">an employee will receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration by the selecting official before any other candidate is referred for consideration and that the employee will not be considered in competition with other candidates and will not be compared with them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 69 MSPR 268, 271 (1996); <span class="Italic">Myers v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 29 MSPR 395, 397 (1985); <span class="Italic">Accord Eleanor H. Pakele v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931008 (July 7, 1994) (promise to give the complainant "priority consideration" for the next available position for which she qualified was satisfied when the agency referred the complainant's name to the selecting official on a candidate referral list that contained only the complainant's name).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission may look to other terms of the agreement to determine what the parties intended by use of the term "priority consideration." In <span class="Italic">Cleveland v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01960428 (1997), the agency agreed that the appellant would receive priority consideration for positions for which the vacancy announcements had already closed. Under these circumstances, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Cleveland</span> found that the appellant understood that she would not receive traditional priority consideration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of her contention that the agency breached the settlement agreement, the appellant contends that the agency failed to comply with the "priority consideration" procedure discussed in our decision in <span class="Italic">Mary Johnson v. Dept. of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941916 (December 20, 1994), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span> in EEOC Request No. 05950331 (March 21, 1996). For the following reasons, we reject the appellant's contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> settlement, the appellant was to receive a priority consideration for the first vacancy in one of the specified positions which arose after the settlement agreement was executed. The Commission found that the agency failed to give the complainant in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> priority consideration because it announced the vacancy in question and solicited applications for the same before reviewing and making a determination on the complainant's application. Further, the selecting official in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> actually considered not only the complainant but also other qualified applicants before deciding that the complainant was not the best qualified candidate. For those reasons, the Commission found that the complainant was inappropriately subjected to a competitive consideration rather than a consideration on her own merit without competition from other potential candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant situation is very different from that in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>. Here, the settlement agreement provided that the appellant would receive a priority consideration for positions for which she had already applied pursuant to vacancy announcements that had closed almost two months earlier, and for which the appellant had already been ranked and interviewed. At the time the parties negotiated the settlement agreement, they were fully aware of the fact that the agency had already solicited applications for the positions in question and the appellant had already been interviewed for them by the interview panel. Nothing in the agreement precluded the selecting official from considering information developed by the interview panel when he gave the appellant priority consideration for the positions. The only thing the agreement specified was that the appellant would be considered for the positions "before other candidates are considered," and that is precisely what the agency did in referring the appellant's name alone to the selecting official for priority consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1761"></span>As noted in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, a priority consideration does not guarantee selection. A selecting official may reject a priority consideration candidate if, upon a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration, he or she determines that the candidate is not the best qualified for the position. We reject the appellant's contention that the selecting official's determination that she was not the best qualified candidate implies his improper consideration of the qualifications of other candidates in competition with her. There is no such evidence in the record. Moreover, even though the selecting official relied upon the interview panel's conclusion that the appellant did not "best fulfill" the organization's needs and objectives, he did not know whether the panel had found any other candidate who did "best fulfill" those needs. It is not unimaginable for a panel to conclude that none of the applicants qualified as being the "best." And it is not unusual for an agency to reopen a vacancy announcement in those circumstances and invite other applications. Therefore, a declaration that a candidate is not the "best" qualified does not necessarily imply that the declarant has considered others in competition with that candidate and found any of the others as the "best" qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a settlement agreement provides for priority consideration, the complainant can be rejected for legitimate reasons. However, that reason cannot involve the superior qualifications of another candidate, because there are no other candidates in priority consideration. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bobian v. Government Printing Office</span>, 01A10920 (2001), the complainant was given priority consideration for a position and rejected. The complainant was subsequently a candidate for competitive promotion to the position. In evaluating the complainant's claim for breach, the Commission found that the selecting official's memorandum documenting the selectee's qualifications did not provide a justification for rejecting the complainant during priority consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless otherwise specified in an agreement, the term priority consideration applies to promotional opportunities and a lateral reassignment does not satisfy an agency's priority consideration obligation. <span class="Italic">Sykes v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0420060012 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01881467 (1988), the Commission found that priority consideration was an appropriate remedy where disparaging comments made by the selecting official about the complainant's foreign accent discouraged her from applying for a claims representative position. The Commission ruled that it could not order the agency to place the complainant in the position because that would have been more than a "make whole" remedy, since she was never actually denied the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Priority consideration can be an alternative remedy in a situation where it is determined that the agency discriminated against more than one job applicant. In <span class="Italic">Mike v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05880410, 05880411 (1988), the Commission determined that the agency discriminated against two candidates on the basis of sex in selecting a male applicant. As relief, the Commission ordered the agency to determine immediately which of the two female candidates who were unsuccessful was most qualified and to retroactively promote that employee. The Commission further directed the agency to grant priority consideration for the female candidate who was not promoted. In response to an untimely request for clarification of the decision in <span class="Italic">Mike</span>, the Commission explained its current policy on priority consideration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such a directive both provides equitable relief to the victim of discrimination and advances the Commission's mission of requiring that "curative...action will be taken...to ensure that similar violations of the law will not recur." 29 CFR 1613.271(a)(2). In addition, the Commission notes that remedial relief must be appropriately tailored in light of the particular facts of the matter in question. The agency misconstrues the Commission's reasons for deleting the discussion of priority consideration in the course of the revisions to 29 CFR 1613.271. No regulation could be fashioned which would adequately state the appropriate equitable relief under every possible situation. Accordingly, as observed by appellants, Commission regulations specifically state that the remedial actions to be ordered when discrimination is established "need not be limited to" those actions discussed in the Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because Title VII is a remedial statute intended "so far as possible [to] eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future," priority consideration is not an appropriate remedy where the employee, through his own efforts, has obtained the sought-after promotion prior to resolution of his EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Joines v. Department of Army</span>, 01832141 (1984). "Such a remedy would, in effect, place appellant in a better position than the one he would have occupied absent discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The rationale is that the employee should not be placed in a better position for future promotions than he would have been in, had he originally been granted the sought after promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where an agency was ordered to grant priority consideration as a remedy for past discrimination and the employee alleges such consideration has not been granted, the burden is on the agency to show by clear and convincing evidence that it complied with the ordered remedy. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of Army</span>, 01830749 (1984). An agency does not fulfill this burden when the positions for which the employees were considered were a grade level above the positions for which the employees originally applied.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission has held that promotion and back pay are not appropriate remedies for failure to accord priority consideration in satisfaction of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Batchelor v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01997215 (2000). Presumably, this also holds true when priority consideration is the result of a decision by the Commission. In <span class="Italic">Batchelor</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under EEOC Regulations, the remedies available for breach of the agreement are specific performance of the agreement, or reinstatement of complainant's underlying complaint<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(a). Complainant cannot obtain damages and a promotion as requested on appeal<span class="Italic">. See Metts, et al. v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970935 (June 11, 1998) (in breach finding for failure to provide priority consideration, promotion, back pay, and increase in salary not available). In its final decision, the agency essentially offered to specifically enforce the agreement. On appeal, it appears that complainant may wish to have her underlying complaint reinstated (so that she may seek damages), and have the agency's failure to select her as a Program Analyst considered as a complaint of discrimination, not merely as a breach of the agreement. The agency must allow complainant an opportunity to choose future priority reconsideration, or reinstatement of her complaint on remand....</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not entirely clear from <span class="Italic">Batchelor</span> how the Commission would remedy an agency's failure to grant priority consideration as ordered in a final decision, other than to order future compliance. However, it appears that the complainant would be able to bring a separate complaint of discrimination over any nonselections that occurred because of priority consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Commission orders an agency to give an employee priority consideration, it is not incumbent upon the employee to apply for the positions subject to the order. It is incumbent upon the agency to give the employee priority consideration, regardless of whether he requests it. <span class="Italic">Cardon v. USPS</span>, 01842258 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Priority consideration is not an appropriate remedy unless the agency shows by clear and convincing evidence that it would not have promoted the complainant even absent discrimination. This is true even though the agency subsequently corrects its discriminatory selection practice and grants the complainant priority consideration under the new procedure. <span class="Italic">See In re Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 05870551 (1988). "[T]he mere fact that the agency corrected its selection procedures does not exonerate the agency of liability in the previous selection process. The relief must be tailored to fit appellant's particular circumstances in order that she be made fully whole...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
