<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-78"><span class="space">11.</span> Reassignment or Transfer</h4>
<p class="noindent">The transfer of an employee during the pendency of an EEO proceeding does not negate the relief ordered in that proceeding. The fact that the employee had transferred his work location is irrelevant to the relief ordered. <span class="Italic">See Polk v. USPS</span>, 01842157 (1985) ("Appellant can be made whole in Seattle as easily as he could be in Dallas.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's broad powers to fashion equitable relief extend to ordering an employee reinstated to a different work location when the Commission is persuaded that the complainant cannot be returned to his original work location. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Kubiak v. Postmaster General</span>, 01891205 (1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon a finding of discrimination, Title VII provides in relevant part for the order of such affirmative action as may be appropriate, and may include but is not limited to reinstatement or hiring of employees or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, &#x00A7; 706(g) 42 USC 2000-5(g), as amended in 1972. The primary purpose of a Title VII remedy is to make the victims of unlawful discrimination whole. The achievement of this goal rests upon the elimination of the unlawful practice complained of in addition to the restoration of the discriminatee to the position he would have been in were it not for the unlawful discrimination. (Citation omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant offered persuasive argument in his appeal brief that a return to the Detroit General Mail facility would constitute a return to the same type of conditions which led to appellant's resignation because of the harassment to which he was subjected on the basis of his physical handicap. The appellant's subjection to the intolerable working conditions occurred while he worked on the ground floor of the agency's Detroit General Mail facility. After appellant requested and was granted a transfer to another area because of the working conditions his supervisor threatened as a punitive measure to return appellant to the hostile environment even though she claimed to be unaware of the harassing conditions to which appellant was subjected by his coworkers when he worked on the ground floor. Therefore, the Commission does not find that the AJ's recommendation to transfer appellant to a different location outside the Detroit General Mail facility was an unreasonable one and it was consistent with the Commission's remedial policy. Where appropriate, the Commission may order remedial measures that are designed to prevent the recurrence of similar unlawful employment practices. Further, the agency does not claim, nor does the record reflect that such a transfer would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the agency's business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The remedy of transfer is reserved for exceptional cases, for example, when the agency has so undermined the authority of the complainant that it would be impossible for her to continue to function in her previous location. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stith v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 04960019 (1996). However, in <span class="Italic">Stith</span>, the Commission also made it clear that such an order is not "<span class="Italic">carte blanch</span>" for the employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so ruling, we note that the transfer order constitutes a severe sanction, and one that should be applied only in the most limited of circumstances. We find that the record in this case supports the AJ's recommended decision and the decision made in the prior decision that directing that the agency cease from engaging in harassment would be insufficient. Specifically, the record supports the AJ's determination that the environment in which appellant was forced to work was "chaotic and charged with, highly charged with bias and hostility." It further supports the AJ's finding that the agency undermined appellant's efforts to supervise subordinate employees. Testimony from agency personnel outside of the Charleston NFSC denotes the problems appellant had in seeking to manage her staff and provide supervision. Affidavits from members of appellant's staff clearly note that they disliked her management style and found the environment within which they were forced to work hostile and stressful. Although appellant's subordinates did not necessarily attribute work place stress to race discrimination or reprisal, the AJ found, and the record supports, that the agency's actions created a hostile working environment for appellant that was race and reprisal-based. We note that there is no evidence of wholesale staff changes going up and down from appellant's position. Based on the unique facts of this case--which include the race and reprisal-based undermining of appellant's authority from above and hostility in the ranks below--we find the AJ's recommended remedy of a transfer appropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we deny the agency's request, we further have determined to reopen the prior decision on our own motion (see 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.407(a)) to provide further explication and slight modification of the order contained therein. In both the agency's request for reconsideration and appellant's response, the parties focused on the order's reference to Jacksonville and argued whether the Commission properly could mandate appellant's transfer to a facility in which the only two positions in appellant's job series and at her grade level were filled. We note, however, that the order clearly directed the agency to transfer appellant to Jacksonville "or some other mutually agreeable location." We find implicit in the order an obligation on both parties to work cooperatively and in good faith in identifying positions and facilities to which appellant may be transferred. Although the prior decision specifically referenced Jacksonville, and appellant may prefer that location, the agency need not displace incumbent employees nor create a new position in order to accommodate appellant's preference. In the absence of vacancies in appellant's job series and grade in Jacksonville, the agency should identify <span id="Page_1774"></span>other vacant positions in Jacksonville and in other agency facilities for which appellant is qualified (including positions outside of her current job series) that are comparable to the grade level of her current position, and permit her to select the position and facility into which she seeks to transfer. As the revised order further provides, appellant's transfer should be effected as soon as possible, but no later than six months from the date this decision becomes final. At the end of the six month period, the agency's obligation to transfer appellant as a remedy for the finding of discrimination in this case will expire.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The agency will have met its obligation under the order set forth below if, during the six month period, it identifies positions responsive to the order and appellant declines to accept a transfer. If prior to the end of the six month period appellant believes that the agency has failed to comply with the order in good faith, she may seek enforcement of the order in accordance with 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.503(a). The parties should take notice that the Commission has deleted the requirement that the agency offer appellant a transfer to a job in her current job series in order to enlarge the number of positions to which she may be transferred. We also have deleted the "mutually agreeable" clause from the order set forth in the prior decision. We have done this so as to prevent either party from rejecting an appropriate transfer opportunity by arguing that it was not "mutually" agreeable. The Commission thus may find, should this matter come before us in the future, that the agency made a reasonable transfer offer or appellant made a reasonable transfer request, to which the other party, in good faith, should have acceded; and we may issue a further order in accordance with this finding.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Shaffer v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20081 (2003), the Commission found that transfer to another facility was appropriate where the discrimination consisted of a supervisor grabbing the complainant by the breasts and attempting to pull her back to a table to have sex with her. Ironically, in the same case, the Commission awarded only $2,000 in compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720120040 (2013), the Commission found that transfer to another facility was an appropriate part of the relief order where there was systemic opposition to the complainant's EEO activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that Complainant stated during the hearing that she would like to be transferred to a position outside of Fort Jackson. A review of the record supports the AJ's ordered relief of a transfer. The record establishes that Complainant has filed numerous EEO complaints, and as a result the management officials at Fort Jackson and her coworkers have begun to respond to her out of reprisal for her protected EEO activities. We agree with the AJ when he stated that this case is "a clear example of responsible management officials retaliating against an employee who serially engaged in protected activity." The evidence in the record supports the AJ's determination that Complainant's relationships with her supervisors and coworkers are severely compromised to the extent that her continued presence will likely cause the relationships to continue to deteriorate. As a result, we find that this relief is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090050 (2013), the Commission found that reassignment to another facility was an appropriate remedy where the complainant suffered panic attacks at her previous facility as a result of the retaliation she suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mohar v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100019 (2011), the Commission found that the agency did not fail to comply with the judge's relief order where she was not transferred to the facility of her choice away from the discriminating managers. In so doing, the Commission noted that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering this matter, we note that the purpose of this remedy is to remove Complainant from the hostile work environment created by the discriminating managers. This is most fairly accomplished by reassigning managers. Alternatively when agreeable to a complainant, the complainant can be reassigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reflects that Complainant no longer works under the supervision of any of the identified discriminating managers, so the purpose of this remedy has already been accomplished. However, because of the circumstances of this case, we also find that the Agency should be ordered to ensure that Complainant never works under the supervision of these individuals, which we will include in our Order, at the end of this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission has also held that transfer or reassignment is a remedy for hostile environment harassment when the complainant requests that as part of the remedy. In <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120103446 (2012), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also requests that the Commission order the Agency to reassign her to a lateral position in a different branch so that she would not have any interaction with the management officials involved in her complaint. Upon review of this matter, we note that when discrimination is found, the Agency must provide Complainant with a remedy that constitutes full, make-whole relief to restore her as nearly as possible to the position she would have occupied absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Franks v. Bowman Transport. Co</span>., 424 U.S. 747, 764 (1976). In this case, Complainant was harassed by her supervisor, who is the Chief of the EFMB Branch. Complainant stated that the Chief sent her hostile e-mails; ridiculed Complainant's voice; claimed that other employees complained about Complainant; accused Complainant of engaging in improper conduct; and asserted that she had a tape recording of Complainant using foul language at work. Complainant further asserted that a friend of the Chief suggested that Complainant could join the Chief's "team" if Complainant supported the Chief's EEO case by testifying that a management official harassed the Chief. Additionally, at least eight witnesses testified that the Chief treated her subordinates in a tyrannical manner by engaging in extraordinary acts of harassment against subordinate employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, it is clear that the retaliatory harassment cannot be remedied as long as the Chief remains in Complainant's chain of command. Complainant requests that the Agency reassign her to another branch in order to remedy the harassment. The Commission has held that, unless the transfer of the harassment victim is voluntary, it cannot constitute effective remedial action. <span class="Italic">See Philips v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01985285 (June 28, 2001); <span class="Italic">Van Wolken v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30134 (May 11, 2004) (upholding an AJ's order for the agency to offer a harassed complainant a lateral reassignment to another facility because Complainant had specifically requested a transfer as part of her make whole relief.). Here, allowing Complainant to have the opportunity to accept or decline an offer of reassignment to another branch is appropriate because she specifically requests to be reassigned from to a "lateral position in another branch with no interaction with the management official(s) in my complaint" as one of her remedies. <span class="Italic">Smith-Riggins v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120093837 (Aug. 31, 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant is discriminatorily transferred to a new work location, he is not entitled to recover child-care costs resulting from the transfer if it is not a benefit otherwise provided by the agency. <span class="Italic">Alford v. Postmaster General</span>, 019002011 (1990). However, such costs may now be recoverable under the 1991 Civil Rights Act as compensatory damages.</p>
