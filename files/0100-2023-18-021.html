<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-21"><span class="space">A.</span> CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</h3>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, the Commission uses the term disqualification to refer to two separate things. Under 1614.605(c), a representative can be disqualified for a conflict of interest. The Commission, as noted above, also uses disqualification to refer to the permanent exclusion from Commission proceedings of a representative who engages in contumacious conduct. This section deals exclusively with disqualification due to a conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">Section 1614.105(c) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where the representation of a complainant or agency would conflict with the official of collateral duties of the representative, the Commission, or the agency, may after given the representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify the representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unlike exclusion or disqualification for contumacious conduct--actions that can be taken only by an administrative judge--disqualification for a conflict of interest can be done by the judge or the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The regulation does not specify what constitutes a conflict of interest, but MD-110 provides indirect insight into the meaning of the regulation. The primary restriction on the agency is that its EEO personnel cannot serve as representatives of the agency. This restriction also applies to complainants, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, EEO personnel may not serve as complainants' representatives. <span class="Italic">See</span> MD-110 at 1-10.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC also requires a separation of the agency's EEO and legal defense functions. MD-110 at 1-9. As a result, any component of the agency that gives legal advice to the EEO function cannot serve in a representative capacity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps not surprisingly, it would present a potential conflict for a union official to represent a management employee where the complainant, if reinstated, would supervise union employees, creating the potential for the representative and the complainant to be on opposite sides of the table in future dealings. <span class="Italic">Reiss v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05880243 (1988). The Commission found the establishment of a representational relationship later could hamper the individuals in the performance of their respective duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, it is a conflict of interest where the complainant is a currently employed management official and the representative is a union official. <span class="Italic">Fretheim v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A44531 (2006). Interestingly, in that case, the Commission also noted that the complainant, upon being advised of the agency's proposal to disqualify his representative and his opportunity to respond, changed his representative. The Commission noted that the complainant voluntarily switched representatives and that the union president was not disqualified. However, it went on to find that the complainant had not demonstrated that having the union president as his representative did not constitute a conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Harvey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a32210.txt">01A32210</a> (2005), the Commission found it was a conflict of interest for a union president to represent a human relations specialist. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues that her designated representative should not have been disqualified by the agency for what the agency asserts is a "conflict of interest." We note the agency's position is that it would be inappropriate for complainant's designated representative (a union official, currently serving as a president), to represent complainant (a Human Resource Specialist dealing with compensation claims), because of the potential of complainant being assigned to controvert a compensation claim made by an employee represented by her representative. Complainant's position, however, is that she does not make any decisions on employees' requests for compensation and that this function rests with the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. The Commission is unpersuaded by this assertion. It is the obligation of an agency, through its Human Resources department, to controvert an OWCP claim when there is a dispute as to an employee's entitlement. It is not the obligation of the Department of Labor to controvert a claim, as asserted by <span id="Page_661"></span>complainant. Complainant has not satisfactorily demonstrated that a conflict of interest would be absent on those occasions when, as a Human Resources Specialist, she would be required to work on the controversion of an OWCP claim of an employee whose representative would be the identical union official who has represented complainant in the instant case. We therefore determine that the agency's action in disqualification of the union official as complainant's designated representative in the instant matter was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">It also is a conflict of interest for EEO officials to serve as agency representatives in any capacity at a hearing. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01880608 (1988). In that case, the EEO investigator served as the agency's technical representative at the hearing. Although the Commission determined this was an impermissible conflict of interest, it refused to remand the case where the complainant had not attended the hearing and the investigator's only function was to assist the agency representative in locating exhibits in the investigation reports. The Commission found the complainant was not prejudiced sufficiently in these circumstances to warrant a remand.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is a conflict of interest for an EEO official to serve as the complainant's representative even where that official resigns his EEO duties. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Attorney General</span>, 0120080661 (2008), the complainant's representative had served as his EEO counselor, but had resigned from those duties at the time he represented the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is improper for the agency to be represented at the EEO hearing by a representative and technical advisor who are subordinate to the responding management official. "The AR is placed in a position of potential divided loyalties: to the agency on the one hand and to the RO on the other. The interests would seem to be consistent, but their interests diverge to the extent that the responsible official has illegally discriminated against an employee." <span class="Italic">Tichenor v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01930342 (1993). However, there was no harm found because the EEO investigator was from a different facility and the complainant was granted an impartial EEOC hearing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">It is a conflict of interest where the complainant's representative was a supervisor and complainant was a union representative. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01976849 (1999); <span class="Italic">Keays v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01963164 (1997). However, it is not a conflict of interest for a team leader to represent a complainant where the complainant works outside of the team leader's chain-of-command and for a different unit of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Teeters v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A04724 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Swart v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A43601 (2005), the Commission remanded a case where the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> to disqualify a bargaining unit employee from representing a supervisor in the same facility. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Swart</span> maintained that his chosen representative was not in his chain of supervision and was familiar with his case because he had previously handled a case for the complainant's daughter. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Swart</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.605(c) states that "[i]n cases where the representation of a complainant. . .would conflict with the official or collateral duties of the representative, the Commission or the agency may, after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify the representative." The agency argued that it denied the representative because it is inappropriate to allow a bargaining unit employee to represent a supervisor in the same facility. Allowing a subordinate to represent a supervisor may cause a conflict of interest.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Letters from Manager, EEO Compliance and Appeals to Complainant dated 2/21/03 &#x0026; 3/18/03, attached to Affidavit A as Exs.4j-41. The AJ agreed and cited <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01976849 (Jan. 28, 1999). However, that case stands for the proposition that an impermissible conflict of interest exists where a supervisor represents a subordinate, and the supervisor "signs [the subordinate's] time card and approves his leave," and the subordinate is a union representative. We do not have enough information on the record to determine whether those facts apply here. Complainant argues that his chosen representative is not within his chain of command.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Complainant's Brief; Complainant's Brief in Opposition to Summary. The agency does not seem to dispute this assertion. Furthermore, there is no information on the record as to whether the representative is a union official as in Jacobs, or whether complainant is a non-bargaining unit supervisor. Thus, we find that this matter must be remanded for further processing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note as an aside that complainant has presented understandable reasons for wanting the representative in question to handle his EEO claim. This representative handled his daughter's claim, helping her achieve a substantial settlement. Furthermore, the representative is among the few employees with experience handling EEO claims. Lastly, as complainant alleges that the agency retaliated against him for his involvement in his daughter's EEO claim, complainant wants a person who is knowledgeable about both his daughter's case and the extent of his involvement in the case. We further note that management denied complainant's representative at a special meeting for junior supervisors adjourned specifically to discuss his reassignment to Tour 1. As complainant explains, prior to this meeting, management had not taken issue with the representative. The representative advised him during the pre-complaint processing (of his reassignment claim) and even appeared alongside complainant as his representative during Redress/mediation talks with agency officials. We find these are matters that deserve closer scrutiny in the context of a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that a complainant's chosen representative has also filed an EEO complaint on his own behalf is not a conflict of interest for purposes of disqualifying the representative. <span class="Italic">See Gutierrez v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A23431 (2003) "[T]he agency's disqualification rests on the notion that the representative, in his own EEO matter, may hold an interest adverse to complainant's interest while advocating her position in the present complaint. We find this type of competing interest does not fall within the scope of the proscribed conflicts on interest in 29 C.F.R. 1614.605(c)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Conversely, the fact that an agency representative has filed his own EEO complaint does not constitute a conflict of interest that disqualifies him or her from continuing to represent the agency in EEO complaints filed by others. <span class="Italic">See Winters v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A40571 (2006); <span class="Italic">Downey v. Social Security Administration</span>, 07A30078 (2003); <span class="Italic">Monroig v. Commission on Civil Rights</span>, 07A10012 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Disqualification of an employee as a representative does not state a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">See DuBois v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01974627 (1998). "[S]erving as a representative for another employee is not a term, condition, or privilege of employment; rather, the right to representation is a privilege of employment given to the complainant, not to the representative." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> See also section on "<a href="0100-2023-18-033.html#sec9-33">Use of Official Time</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations and MD-110 do not prescribe any procedure for seeking disqualification of a representative on the basis of a conflict of interest. As a result, it is unclear who, at the agency level, has the authority to disqualify a representative. Presumably, any requests for disqualification should be directed to the agency's EEO director.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the hearing level, the administrative judge has the authority to disqualify a representative due to a conflict of interest. Although no procedure is prescribed, a request for disqualification should take the form of a motion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In either instance, the representative must be given an opportunity to respond prior to a ruling on the request.</p>
<p class="noindent"> The Commission's regulations do not specifically provide for appeals from agency decisions to disqualify a representative. However, the Commission has the authority to exercise its discretion and take jurisdiction over such matters. <span class="Italic">Celmar v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01903408 (1990).</p>
