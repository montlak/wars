<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-50"><span class="space">1.</span> The History of the Adverse Treatment Requirement</h4>
<p class="noindent">The adverse treatment requirement involves, fundamentally, the question of the employee's standing to bring a claim. As discussed fully in Chapter 3 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-12-194.html#sec3-182">Standing: Failure to State a Claim--Reprisal Complaints</a>," in order to have standing a plaintiff must allege both injury in fact and that he or she comes within the zone of interest protected by the Statute. As a result, many courts have adopted the material change in working conditions test enunciated in <span class="Italic">Spring v. Sheboygan Area Sch. Dist.</span>, 865 F.2d 883 (7th Cir. 1989). Under the <span class="Italic">Spring</span> test, some actions of an employer are excluded as being too insignificant to cause harm. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Connell v. Bank of Boston</span>, 924 F.2d 1169 (1st Cir. 1991) (order to vacate the office is not actionable where the employee was given full pay and benefits until day of termination); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Passer v. American Chemical Society</span>, 935 F.2d 322 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (cancelation of a testimonial is actionable).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cullom v. Brown</span>, 209 F.3d 1035 (7th Cir. 2000), the court held that an overrated performance appraisal was not an adverse action, regardless of why it was issued. In <span class="Italic">Cullom</span>, the employee filed numerous EEO complaints, and in an attempt to placate him, the agency gave him an artificially high performance rating. The employee then sued the agency, "claiming that by overrating him, it made him ineligible for a remedial program that supposedly would have accelerated his advancement to a higher grade." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The district court held that unwarranted ratings, even though positive, constituted retaliation. The court of appeals in <span class="Italic">Cullom</span> reversed, holding that, although the agency's actions may have been dishonest, they did not constitute retaliation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a policy matter, the VA's behavior is indefensible. It certainly would have been better if the VA had had the fortitude to rate Cullom accurately (although in doing so it would have probably been risking another EEO complaint). But Title VII liability does not turn on ill-advised personnel decisions<span class="Italic">. Mechnig v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 864 F.2d 1359, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988). And while honesty may be, as the district court put it, "the best policy," it is not for a federal court to say that for job evaluations it is "the required policy." <span class="Italic">Cullom</span>, 27 F. Supp.2d at 1090 (emphasis added)<span class="Italic">. See Wallace v. SMC Pneumatics, Inc.</span>, 103 F.3d 1394, 1398 (7th Cir. 1997) (performance evaluations "serve a variety of purposes, only one of which is objective evaluation. They are also morale-builders and motivators.") Thus overrating Cullom so he would not be placed on probation, while giving him substantial training and oversight, was not "retaliatory" discrimination under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Meanwhile, the Ninth Circuit held that an adverse action in a retaliation case was one that "is reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in protected activity." <span class="Italic">Ray v. Henderson</span>, 217 F.3d 1234 (9th Cir. 2000). This was also the position taken by the Commission. In <span class="Italic">Ray</span>, the court expanded on a position it took in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto v. Dalton</span>, 118 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 1997)--a case that is cited with approval in the Commission's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 at II.B.2. (2016). Under the view of the Ninth Circuit and the EEOC, the degree of harm in a reprisal case does not go to the issue of standing. Instead, the degree of harm is considered only in the damage portion of the case. Because it articulates its own and the Commission's view, as well as the opposing view of several courts, <span class="Italic">Ray</span> is substantially produced below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee in <span class="Italic">Ray</span> complained about the treatment of women at the Willits, CA post office to the postmaster at that facility. After the oral complaints failed to have any effect, the employee and two of his coworkers wrote a letter to the postmaster's supervisor complaining about the treatment of women. The postmaster reacted negatively to the letter, and the court was faced with the question of whether the postmaster's actions rose to the level of adverse employment actions. The court in <span class="Italic">Ray</span>, 217 F.3d at 1240-43, began its analysis with a helpful review of the positions of the various circuits on the issue of what constitutes an adverse employment action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The circuits are currently split as to what constitutes an adverse employment action. Although we have yet to articulate a rule defining the contours of an adverse employment action, our prior cases situate us with those circuits that define adverse employment action broadly. Other circuits that define adverse employment action broadly are the First, Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh and D.C. Circuits. An intermediate position is held by the Second and Third Circuits. The most restrictive view of adverse employment actions is held by the Fifth and Eighth Circuits. Below, we set forth the Ninth Circuit's position within this split, and explain the case law in the other circuits. Then, we examine what guidelines we should follow in analyzing whether an action constitutes an adverse employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have found that a wide array of disadvantageous changes in the workplace constitute adverse employment actions. While "mere ostracism" by co-workers does not constitute an adverse employment action, <span class="Italic">see Strother v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group</span>, 79 F.3d 859, 869 (9th Cir. 1996), a lateral transfer does. In <span class="Italic">Yartzoff v. Thomas</span>, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987), we held that "[t]ransfers of job duties and undeserved performance ratings, if proven, would constitute adverse employment decisions.'" The <span class="Italic">Yartzoff</span> decision was in line with our earlier decision in <span class="Italic">St. John v. Employment Development Dept.</span>, 642 F.2d <span id="Page_1500"></span>273, 274 (9th Cir. 1981), where we held that a transfer to another job of the same pay and status may constitute an adverse employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto v. Dalton</span>, 118 F.3d 671, 676 (9th Cir. 1997), we found that the dissemination of an unfavorable job reference was an adverse employment action "because it was a 'personnel action' motivated by retaliatory animus." We so found even though the defendant proved that the poor job reference did not affect the prospective employer's decision not to hire the plaintiff: "That this unlawful personnel action turned out to be inconsequential goes to the issue of damages, not liability."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Strother</span>, we examined the case of an employee who, after complaining of discrimination, was excluded from meetings, seminars and positions that would have made her eligible for salary increases, was denied secretarial support, and was given a more burdensome work schedule. 79 F.3d at 869. We determined that she had suffered from adverse employment actions<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">These cases place the Ninth Circuit in accord with the First, Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh and D.C. Circuits. These Circuits all take an expansive view of the type of actions that can be considered adverse employment actions<span class="Italic">. See Wyatt v. City of Boston</span>, 35 F.3d 13, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1994) (adverse employment actions include "demotions, disadvantageous transfers or assignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted negative job evaluations and toleration of harassment by other employees"); <span class="Italic">Knox v. Indiana</span>, 93 F.3d 1327, 1334 (7th Cir. 1996) (employer can be liable for retaliation if it permits "actions like moving the person from a spacious, brightly lit office to a dingy closet, depriving the person of previously available support services...or cutting off challenging assignments"); <span class="Italic">Corneveaux v. CUNA Mutual Ins. Group</span>, 76 F.3d 1498, 1507 (10th Cir. 1996) (employee demonstrated adverse employment action under the ADEA by showing that her employer "required her to go through several hoops in order to obtain her severance benefits"); <span class="Italic">Berry v. Stevinson Chevrolet</span>, 74 F.3d 980, 986 (10th Cir. 1996) (malicious prosecution by former employer can be adverse employment action); <span class="Italic">Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</span>, 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998) (adverse employment actions include an employer requiring plaintiff to work without lunch break, giving her a one-day suspension, soliciting other employees for negative statements about her, changing her schedule without notification, making negative comments about her, and needlessly delaying authorization for medical treatment); <span class="Italic">Passer v. American Chemical Soc.</span>, 935 F.2d 322, 330-331 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (employer's cancellation of a public event honoring an employee can constitute adverse employment action under the ADEA, which has an anti-retaliation provision parallel to that in Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Second and Third circuits hold an intermediate position within the circuit split. They have held that an adverse action is something that materially affects the terms and conditions of employment<span class="Italic">. See Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh</span>, 120 F.3d 1286, 1300 (3d Cir. 1997) ("retaliatory conduct must be serious and tangible enough to alter an employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment...to constitute [an] 'adverse employment action' "); <span class="Italic">Torres v. Pisano</span>, 116 F.3d 625, 640 (2nd Cir. 1997) (to show an adverse employment action employee must demonstrate "a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment") (quoting <span class="Italic">McKenney v. New York City Off-Track Betting Corp.</span>, 903 F. Supp. 619, 623 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Fifth and Eighth Circuits, adopting the most restrictive test, hold that only "ultimate employment actions" such as hiring, firing, promoting and demoting constitute actionable adverse employment actions<span class="Italic">. See Mattern v. Eastman Kodak Co.</span>, 104 F.3d 702, 707 (5th Cir. 1997) (only "ultimate employment decisions" can be adverse employment decisions); <span class="Italic">Ledergerber v. Stangler</span>, 122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir. 1997) (transfer involving only minor changes in working conditions and no reduction in pay or benefits is not an adverse employment action).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government urges us to turn from our precedent, and to adopt the Fifth and Eighth Circuit rule that only "ultimate employment actions" such as hiring, firing, promoting and demoting constitute actionable adverse employment actions. But we cannot square such a rule with our prior decisions. Actions that we consider adverse employment actions, such as the lateral transfers in <span class="Italic">Yartzoff</span> and <span class="Italic">St. John</span>, the unfavorable reference that had no affect on a prospective employer's hiring decisions in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span>, and the imposition of a more burdensome work schedule in <span class="Italic">Strother</span> are not ultimate employment actions. Nor, for that matter, does the test adopted by the Second and Third Circuits comport with our precedent. While some actions that we consider to be adverse (such as disadvantageous transfers or changes in work schedule) do "materially affect the terms and conditions of employment," others (such as an unfavorable reference not affecting an employee's job prospects) do not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC has interpreted "adverse employment action" to mean "any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity." EEOC Compliance Manual Section 8, "Retaliation," P 8008 (1998). Although EEOC Guidelines are not binding on the courts, they "constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance." <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 65 (1986) (quoting <span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Co.</span>, 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)); <span class="Italic">see also Gutierrez v. Municipal Court</span>, 838 F.2d 1031, 1049 (9th Cir. 1988). We find the EEOC test to be consistent with our prior holdings, and with the holdings in the First, Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh and D.C. Circuits. The EEOC test covers lateral transfers, unfavorable job references, and changes in work schedules. These actions are all reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in protected activity. Nonetheless, it does not cover every offensive utterance by co-workers, because offensive statements by coworkers do not reasonably deter employees from engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we stated in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span>, the severity of an action's ultimate impact (such as loss of pay or status) "goes to the issue of damages, not liability." 118 F.3d at 676. Instead of focusing on the ultimate effects of each employment action, the EEOC test focuses on the deterrent effects. In so doing, it effectuates the letter and the purpose of Title VII. According to 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a), it is unlawful "for an employer to discriminate" against an employee in retaliation for engaging in protected activity. This provision does not limit what type of discrimination is covered, nor does it prescribe a minimum level of severity for actionable discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Knox</span>, 93 F.3d at 1334 ("There is nothing in the law of retaliation that restricts the type of retaliatory act that might be visited upon an employee who seeks to invoke her rights by filing a complaint."). We agree with the D.C. Circuit, which noted in <span class="Italic">Passer</span> that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The statute itself proscribes "discriminat[ion]" against those who invoke the Act's protections; the statute does not limit its reach only to acts of retaliation that take the form of cognizable employment actions such as discharge, transfer or demotion......"[T]o establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under section 704(a) [42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a)], a plaintiff must show: 1) that he or she engaged in activity protected by the statute; 2) that the employer...engaged in conduct having an adverse impact on the plaintiff; and 3) that the adverse action was causally related to the plaintiff's exercise of protected rights."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">935 F.2d at 331 (emphasis in original) (citing <span class="Italic">Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201</span>, 843 F.2d 1395, 1423 (D.C. Cir.) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), <span class="Italic">supplemented on other grounds on reh'g</span>, 852 F.2d 619 (D.C. Cir. 1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the EEOC standard is consistent with our prior case law and effectuates the language and purpose of Title VII, we adopt it, and hold that an action is cognizable as an adverse employment action if it is reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted). The court rejected the agency's reliance on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed.2d 633 (1998), as requiring a tangible employment action. The <span class="Italic">Ray</span> court declined to apply the analysis of <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, a case involving vicarious liability for sexual harassment, in the retaliation context. The <span class="Italic">Ray</span> court, 217 F.3d at 1241 n.5 explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government relies on <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 761 (1998) for the proposition that only ultimate employment actions such as "hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities [and] a decision causing a significant change in benefits" constitute adverse employment actions. But the discussion in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> cited by the government concerns the types of employment actions which, if taken by a supervisor, would subject the employer to vicarious liability for harassment<span class="Italic">. See</span> 524 U.S. at 760-761. Although the Supreme Court cited to circuit-level Title VII cases that defined "adverse employment actions," the Court specifically declined to adopt the holdings of those cases: "Without endorsing the specific results of those decisions, we think it prudent to import the concept of a tangible employment action for resolution of the vicarious liability issue we consider here."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 761. Therefore, we reject the contention that <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> set forth a standard for adverse employment actions in the anti-retaliation context.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court in <span class="Italic">Ray</span>, 217 F.3d at 1244, examined the actions taken by the postmaster in response to the employee's complaint and found that they constituted adverse employment actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e conclude that Ray suffered cognizable adverse employment actions when his employer, in retaliation for Ray's complaints concerning management's treatment of women employees, eliminated employee meetings, eliminated its flexible starting time policy, instituted a "lockdown" of the workplace, and cut Ray's salary. We also hold that Ray has a cognizable claim for retaliation based on his supervisors' creation of a hostile work environment.</p>
