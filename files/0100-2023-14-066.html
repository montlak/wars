<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-66"><span class="space">Q.</span> COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">In agencies with collective bargaining agreements, a common refrain is that the agency is restricted from doing some things in settlement of an EEO case because it would violate the contract. However, the Commission has cautioned agencies about attempting to void or ignore agreements on the premise that they violate a collective bargaining agreement. In <span class="Italic">Rathbone v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902274 (1990), the Commission noted the agency can avoid these situations by submitting the agreement to a labor relations specialist prior to signing it. In that case, the Commission warned the agency that EEO settlement agreements are binding and noted that this was not the first occasion where the agency had entered agreements it later argued were unenforceable because of collective bargaining commitments.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in 1992, the Commission held that a complainant may not enforce a settlement agreement against an agency that violates its collective bargaining agreement. In <span class="Italic">Pyles v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920044 (1992), the Commission signaled its change in direction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission's previous decision did not address the issue of the union grievance and its effect on the settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">Bena v. Frank</span>, 55 F.E.P. 1571 (D. Md. 1991), the federal district court concluded that the United States Postal Service properly had withdrawn from a settlement agreement with an EEO complainant and reinstated her administrative complaint after learning that the agreement's terms violated the collective bargaining agreement. The <span class="Italic">Bena</span> court, quoting <span class="Italic">W.R. Grace &#x0026; Co. v. Local 759</span>, 461 U.S. 757, 771 (1983), reasoned that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Absent a judicial determination,...the (employer) cannot alter the collective-bargaining agreement without the Union's consent. Permitting such a result would undermine the federal labor policy that parties to a collective-bargaining agreement must have reasonable assurance that their contract will be honored.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Bena v. Frank</span>, 55 F.E.P. at 1572. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Southbridge Plastics Div. v. Local 759</span>, 565 F.2d 913 (5th Cir. 1978). Thus, although settlement agreements normally are binding on the parties, an agency may not be required to specifically perform on the agreement if it later learns that the agreement's terms violate a collective bargaining agreement. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency contended that the union filed a grievance because appellant's placement in the PS-3 Custodian position was in violation of the union's contract with the agency. Appellant, on the other hand, contended that the grievance is unrelated to the settlement agreement. Neither of the parties provided any evidence to support their respective positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because there is no evidence in the record from which we can determine whether the parties' settlement agreement, in fact, violated the union's contract, we remand the case back to the agency for an investigation. During the investigation, the agency must establish both the nature of the grievance and the outcome of the grievance procedure, and then determine how the resolution of the grievance affects the terms of the settlement agreement. If the agency determines that the settlement agreement violated the terms of the union's contract, then it must reinstate appellant's complaint and begin processing from the point at which processing ceased when the parties entered into the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bena</span>, 55 F.E.P. at 1572; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR 1613.217(b). If, however, the agency determines that the settlement agreement did not violate the union's contract, then it must reinstate appellant to the PS-3 Laborer/Custodian position, with appropriate backpay, benefits, and interest, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result of <span class="Italic">Pyles</span>, it was unclear whether the Commission would still follow <span class="Italic">Rathbone</span> in a situation where an agency repeatedly fails to determine in advance if its EEO settlement agreements run afoul of its collective bargaining agreements. It is significant to note that the <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> decision places substantial emphasis on the point in time at which the agency learns the settlement agreement violates the collective bargaining agreement: "[A]n agency may not be required to specifically perform on the agreement if it <span class="Italic">later</span> learns that the agreement's terms violate a collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> does not specifically address the situation where an agency fails to make reasonable efforts to determine if a settlement agreement would violate the collective bargaining agreement before entering the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Celinda L. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120180263 (2018), the Commission seemed to hold that the agency has an affirmative obligation to figure out whether a settlement provision would violate the collective bargaining agreement prior to signing the settlement agreement. Relying on both <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> and <span class="Italic">Rathbone</span> to enforce a provision that the agency later argued was invalid as violative of the collective bargaining agreement, the Commission wrote in <span class="Italic">Celinda L</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An Agency generally cannot enter into settlement agreements that would violate any applicable CBA. <span class="Italic">Pyles v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05920044 (April 22, 1992). We are reluctant to permit EEOC settlement agreements to obviate a CBA without a union's consent because "such a result would undermine the federal labor policy that parties to a CBA have a reasonable assurance that their contract would be honored." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, we have previously cautioned the Agency regarding its failure to have labor relations personnel properly review settlement agreements in order to avoid conflicts with relevant CBAs. <span class="Italic">See Rathbone v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05910050 (March 7, 1991); <span class="Italic">Iglesias v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520110503 (March 30, 2012); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120133172 (Jan. 29, 2014).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we acknowledge that the record contains an affidavit from a Labor Relations Specialist that the provision of the settlement agreement pertaining to backdating Complainant's seniority date violates the applicable CBA, the record is devoid of evidence that the Agency properly reviewed the settlement agreement prior to its execution. The Agency carries the burden of ensuring that settlement agreements are in compliance with its CBA and the proper time, under the circumstances of this case, for the Agency to have raised its concerns about the CBA was before the EEO Agreement was executed. EEOC Appeal No. 0120133172 (Jan. 29, 2014) (reversing the Agency's final decision and remanding this matter to the Agency to adjust complainant's seniority date noting that the Agency did not carry its burden of ensuring that the settlement agreement was in compliance with the CBA prior to its execution). In the instant matter, the record reflects that the settlement agreement was not signed by a Labor Relations Specialist. In addition, even though this settlement agreement requires the Agency to take action with respect to Complainant's seniority date, the record is devoid of evidence that an Agency's Labor Relations Specialist reviewed the settlement agreement prior to its execution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we REVERSE the Agency's final decision and REMAND this matter to the Agency in accordance with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within thirty (30) calendar days from the date this decision is issued, the Agency shall implement the terms of the January 5, 2017 settlement agreement, including adjusting Complainant's seniority date to November 12, 2016 for custodial maintenance.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brockington v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931054 (1993), the Commission followed <span class="Italic">Bena</span> and <span class="Italic">Pyles,</span> taking the analysis one step further. In <span class="Italic">Brockington</span>, the Commission held it would not examine an agency's claim that a settlement agreement violates the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, unless the complainant alleged that the failure to abide by the agreement was discriminatory:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that the parties entered into a valid agreement on April 7, 1992, and that the Commission should uphold such a settlement agreement. Furthermore, appellant provides several reasons to show why the Union President's statements regarding whether implementation of the settlement agreement would violate the collective bargaining agreement are politically and personally motivated. As noted earlier in this decision, the Supervisor of Employment and Placement stated in an affidavit that appellant's seniority cannot be adjusted to January 23, 1984, because to do so would be a violation of Article 37.2.D.3 of the National Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a similar situation the Commission relied on <span class="Italic">Bena v. Frank</span>, 55 F.E.P. 1571 (D. Md. 1991), which found that an agency had properly withdrawn from a settlement agreement with an EEO complainant and reinstated her administrative complaint after learning that the agreement's terms violated the collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. Pyles v. United States Postal <span id="Page_390"></span>Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920044 (Apr. 22, 1992); <span class="Italic">contra Flores v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01892552 (Aug. 9, 1989) (holding that the agency must comply with the terms of a settlement agreement even if enforcement of the settlement agreement violates the collective bargaining agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Bena</span> court found:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]bsent a judicial determination,...the [employer] cannot alter the collective-bargaining agreement without the Union's consent. Permitting such a result would undermine the federal labor policy that parties to a collective-bargaining agreement must have reasonable assurance that their contract will be honored.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Bena</span>, 55 F.E.P. at 1572 (quoting <span class="Italic">W.R. Grace &#x0026; Co. v. Local Union 759</span>, 461 U.S. 757, 771 (1983) (citations omitted)). Thus, although settlement agreements normally are binding on the parties, an agency may not be required to specifically perform on the agreement if it later learns that the agreement's terms violate a collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. Pyles</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920044. Nevertheless, if an agency were to determine that the settlement agreement violated the collective bargaining agreement, then it must reinstate appellant's complaint and begin processing the complaint from the point at which processing ceased<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>; Bena, 55 F.E.P. at 1572; 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Commission in <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> did not examine whether the agency correctly interpreted the collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, we shall not, in the instant case, examine whether the Union President's assertions are suspect because of her alleged political and personal concerns. We note that appellant has not alleged that the agency's interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement was influenced by any discriminatory motive which is in the purview of EEOC regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the <span class="Italic">Brockington</span> decision parrots the <span class="Italic">Bena</span> language requiring that an agreement be set aside when the agency <span class="Italic">later</span> discovers that it violates the collective bargaining agreement. It does not discuss the <span class="Italic">Rathbone</span> solution of requiring an agency to submit an agreement to labor relations prior to its signing to determine if it is consistent with the agency's collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984535 (2000) ("[A]gency may not specifically perform on the agreement if it later learns that the agreement's terms violate a collective bargaining agreement.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brockington</span>, the Commission also held that when a settlement agreement does conflict with a collective bargaining agreement, the only appropriate remedy is reinstatement of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Iglesias v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520110503 (2012), the Commission revisited <span class="Italic">Pyle</span> and <span class="Italic">Brockington</span> and held that it would examine a settlement agreement to determine if it violated the collective bargaining agreement and that the agency had the burden of proving the alleged violation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Iglesais</span> also admonished the agency again for failing to have the settlement agreement reviewed by a labor relations specialist before entering into it:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case raises an issue regarding which party has the burden of proof when there is a dispute over whether a settlement agreement violates a pre-existing CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that our prior decision in EEOC Appeal No. 0120103030 erred when it cited to <span class="Italic">Pyles v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05920044 (April 22, 1992), and <span class="Italic">Brockington v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01931054 (Aug. 26, 1993), for the proposition that the Commission may set aside a settlement agreement and order reinstatement of an underlying EEO complaint without examining whether the settlement agreement actually violates the CBA. Closer examination of the holding in <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> shows that the Commission did not decline to examine whether the settlement agreement violated the CBA. Rather, it found that it was unable to determine from the record whether the applicable settlement agreement violated the CBA and remanded the matter for a supplemental investigation. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Brockington</span> misinterpreted the meaning of <span class="Italic">Pyles</span>, we now reverse that error and clarify that <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> stands for the principle that the Commission will examine whether a settlement agreement violates a relevant collective bargaining agreement before setting aside the settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its June 16, 2011 Order, the Commission, in accordance with <span class="Italic">Pyles</span>, ordered the parties to supplement the record with information/documentation as to whether the Agreement was in violation of the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the Agency has failed to meet its burden of establishing that the Agreement is in violation of the CBA and should be set aside. The record contains a copy of an affidavit from the Manager, Labor Relations for the Agency's South Florida District. Therein, the Manager asserts, "yes, the settlement [agreement] does violate the CBA as enforcing this settlement would deny other qualified applicants for these positions their contractual rights." However, Complainant asserts that the Agreement does not violate the CBA. Rather, Complainant claims that the Agency violated the CBA when he was not initially awarded the position in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency provides that the settlement agreement violates the CBA because the subject position should have been posted for bid, the record does not clearly support this assertion. Complainant states that he received the highest score for position #95223000, when he initially applied, and that due to a calculation error, he was not awarded the position. Complainant asserts that when the less qualified selectee (S1) vacated this position, the Agency should have awarded the position to him (rather than reposting the position for bid) because he was initially the best qualified applicant and should have been awarded the position initially. Significantly, the record also contains an affidavit from the Secretary/Treasurer of the APWU Miami Area Local who asserts that the agreement is not in conflict with the CBA "and it mirrors the union's position in the grievance resolution." The Secretary/Treasurer further asserts that the union is prepared to testify to its position that Complainant is entitled to this position. Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has not met is burden that the Agreement violates the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Commission has previously warned the Agency regarding its failure to have Labor Relations personnel properly review settlement agreements in order to avoid conflicts with relevant CBAs. <span class="Italic">See Rathbone v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05910050 (Mar. 7, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It appears that the Agency did not properly review the Agreement before its execution. The Agreement contains the following boilerplate language, "[t]he agreement does/does not need to be approved by _____ (e.g., union official, management official, labor relations etc.)." However, the Agreement does not contain any notations indicating that it was reviewed or even needed to be reviewed by a Labor Relations official. The proper time, under the circumstances of this case, for the Agency to have raised its concerns about the CBA was before the EEO Agreement was executed. We once again admonish the Agency in the future to have its Labor Relations personnel conduct a review of such agreements prior to their execution.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reiterated its admonition in <span class="Italic">Iglesais</span> in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General,</span> 0120133172 (2014), that the time for an agency to review an EEO settlement agreement for conflict with the collective bargaining agreement is before entering the EEO agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An Agency generally cannot enter into settlement agreements that would violate any applicable collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">Pyles v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920044 (April 22, 1992). We are reluctant to permit EEOC settlement agreements to obviate a collective bargaining agreement without a union's consent because "such a result would undermine the federal labor policy that parties to a collective-bargaining agreement must have reasonable assurance that their contract would be honored." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., <span class="Italic">quoting Bena v. Frank</span>, 55 F.E.P. 1571, 1572 (D. Md. 1991). However, we have previously cautioned the Agency regarding its failure to have labor relations personnel properly review settlement agreements in order to avoid conflicts with relevant CBAs. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, Rathbone v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910050 (Mar. 7, 1991); <span class="Italic">Iglesias v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520110503 (March 30, 2012),</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains no evidence that the Agency properly reviewed the settlement agreement prior to its execution. The Agency carries the burden of ensuring that settlement agreements are in compliance with its CBA and "the proper time, under the circumstances of this case, for the Agency to have raised its concerns about the CBA was before the EEO Agreement was executed." <span class="Italic">Iglesias</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520110503. We once again admonish the Agency I to have its labor relations personnel conduct a review of such agreements prior to their execution. Further, the record reflects that both the Agency and the union were involved in the negotiation of the instant settlement agreement, and Complainant's union representative was a signatory to the settlement agreement in his union capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency does claim that it cannot execute the terms of a settlement agreement because they violate the collective bargaining agreement, it must include in the complaint file a copy of the contract provision allegedly violated. In <span class="Italic">Sadzinski v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A44653 (2005), the Commission held that, in the absence of such evidence, it cannot determine whether a term of settlement violates a contract provision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Malone v. Postmaster General</span>, 01914088 (1992), the Commission upheld the validity of a settlement agreement that provided the complainant would be reinstated retroactive to a certain date unless any other employee challenged the reinstatement date through the grievance or EEO procedure. The Commission found the agency was justified in reinstating the complainant as of the date of settlement after a union grievance was filed. In so doing, the Commission noted the complainant had not presented any evidence to support her allegation that the agency and union had conspired to deprive her of retroactive reinstatement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Malone</span>, the Commission also found it was proper to impose a new probationary period on the complainant where the agreement was silent on any probationary period but the collective bargaining agreement provided that any reinstated employee would be required to serve a new probationary period.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_391"></span>The Commission adheres to its position that a settlement agreement is not enforceable if it violates terms of the collective bargaining agreement, without any reference to the <span class="Italic">Rathbone</span> case. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962555 (1996), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the agency acknowledges that it has not complied with the terms of the SA, but argues that to do so would violate the terms of the CBA. In addressing this situation on previous occasions, the Commission has relied on the rationale set forth in <span class="Italic">Bena v. Frank</span>, 55 F.E.P. 1571 (D. Md. 1991), which found that an agency, upon learning that the terms of a settlement agreement violated its collective bargaining agreement, had properly withdrawn from the agreement and reinstated the complainant's EEO complaint<span class="Italic">. Pyles v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920044 (Apr. 22, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, although settlement agreements normally are binding on the parties, an agency may not be required to specifically perform on the agreement if it later learns that the agreement's terms violate a collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, because it appears that the primary provision of the SA violates the CBA, the agency should not be required to specifically perform on the SA. However, we find that the agency is required to reinstate appellant's complaint and begin processing the complaint from the point at which processing ceased<span class="Italic">. See Blackburn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930798 (August 26, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Redmon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A33721 (2003) (declaring settlement void because terms violated collective bargaining agreement); <span class="Italic">Murray v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12143 (2001) ("The agency may not be required to implement the terms of a settlement agreement that violates the CBA.").</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Silldorff v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985933 (1999), the Commission held that the agency breached a settlement agreement where it agreed to place the complainant in a full-time mail handler position, and a subsequent grievance decision found the placement was improper because it violated seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. It is difficult to determine if <span class="Italic">Silldorff</span> represents a departure from the Commission's view that it cannot require specific performance where a settlement agreement violates a collective bargaining provision because, while the case was on appeal, the complainant was again appointed to a full-time mail handler position. As a result, the Commission ordered the agency to cure the breach by awarding the complainant any loss of pay that occurred. It is unclear what remedy, if any, the Commission would have ordered if the complainant had not been converted back to a full-time position. In <span class="Italic">Romero v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A62566 (2006), the Commission essentially upheld the validity of a settlement clause that provided if it was subsequently determined that any clause violated the collective bargaining agreement, the entire agreement would be null and void and the complainant would be allowed to either renegotiate an agreement or proceed with her complaint. A grievance resulted in a decision that the agreement did violate the collective bargaining agreement. On appeal, the complainant argued that the grievance decision was extrinsic evidence that could not be used in interpreting the agreement and that its terms should be enforced. However, the Commission found the agreement, by its own terms, was null and void.</p>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that settlement of a union grievance was discriminatory constitutes a collateral attack on the negotiated grievance process and does not state a claim. <span class="Italic">Tanner-Ward v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995288 (2001). In that case, the complainant alleged that she was converted to a flat-sorter machine clerk instead of being awarded a competitive bid as a mail processor letter machine sorting clerk because the latter position was awarded to a white employee as the result of a grievance settlement.</p>
