<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-113"><span class="space">H.</span> OLDER WORKERS' BENEFIT PROTECTION ACT</h3>
<p class="noindent">Under the Older Workers' Benefits Protection Act, 29 USC 626(f)(2), any settlement agreement that purports to settle a claim under the ADEA must meet certain requirements. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Nease v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01944381 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To meet the standards of the OWBPA, a waiver is not considered knowing and voluntary unless, at a minimum; it is clearly written from the viewpoint of the complainant; it specifically refers to rights under the ADEA; the complainant does not waive rights or claims which arise following execution of the waiver; valuable consideration is given in exchange for the waiver; the complainant is advised, in writing, to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement; and the complainant is given a "reasonable" period of time in which to consider the agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that any agreement that does not meet these standards is void. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A02318 (2002) (agreement advised the complainant of the right to consult an attorney and rescind the agreement, but did not contain a clear waiver of age discrimination claims); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A13960 (2002); <span class="Italic">Healey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966598 (1997) (settlement agreement did not specifically waive ADEA rights and complainant was not given an opportunity to consult with an attorney); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Bret E. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120160286 (2016) (agreement void where it did not specifically advice complainant of right to consult with an attorney prior to signing and record did not establish he was given a reasonable period of time to consider the agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Woychik-Brown v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05960768 (1999), the Commission set aside an agency agreement that did not comply with the OWBPA and, in the process, highlighted some of the reasons why the legislation was enacted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under OWBPA standards, a waiver would not be considered knowing and voluntary unless, at a minimum: it is clearly written from the viewpoint of the complainant; it specifically refers to rights or claims under the ADEA; the complainant does not waive rights or claims arising after execution of the waiver; valuable consideration is given in exchange for the waiver; the complainant is advised, in writing, to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement; and, the complainant is given a "reasonable" period of time in which to consider the agreement<span class="Italic">. See Runge v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 01941234 (June 30, 1994); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1625.22(b)-(d) &#x0026; (g). Under the regulations, a "reasonable time within which to consider the settlement agreement" means reasonable under all the circumstances, including whether the individual is represented by counsel or has the assistance of counsel<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1625.22(g)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the July 1994 settlement agreement did not meet the criteria for a valid waiver under OWBPA. The waiver standards for a waiver under the OWBPA differ from those under other statues, which require that the waiver be knowing and voluntary. First, the agreement did not specifically refer to appellant's claims under the ADEA<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1625.22(b)(6) (waiver agreement must refer to the ADEA by name in connection with the waiver). Second, the agency failed to advise Appellant A, in writing, to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1625.22(b)(7). Finally, appellant was given a twenty-four hour period in which to sign the agreement. Record evidence showed that appellant was not represented by counsel at the time and that the agency would not permit her to negotiate the terms of the settlement agreement. Further, shortly before signing the agreement, appellant was emotionally distraught--she was crying and asking why she was being forced to leave when it was Appellant B that the agency had a problem with. Under these facts, the Commission finds that appellant was not given a reasonable period of time in which to consider the agreement<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1625.22(g)(4). The Commission also notes, that under the circumstances of this case, it appears that appellant likewise did not knowingly and voluntarily waive her rights under Title VII. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds the July 1994 settlement agreement to be invalid.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has set aside settlement agreements where the complainant is not given a reasonable period of time to consider the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Weldon v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113841 (2012), the Commission summarized some of these cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the OWBPA, the Commission ruled that less than an hour is an unreasonable period of time in which to consider a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Love v. Department of Defense (DOD-Office of Dependents Education),</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952642 (Oct. 18, 1996). In another case, the Commission ruled that where a complainant was not represented by an attorney and was emotionally distraught shortly before signing the settlement agreement, a 24 hour period to sign the settlement agreement was not a reasonable period of time. <span class="Italic">Woychik-Brown v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960768 (July 16, 1999). The Agency unexpectedly called Complainant into a meeting where it presented him with a written settlement offer, he did not have an attorney present, he asked for a week, then four days, then a day to consider the offer and the Agency told him he must sign the offer now/today to have an agreement, and immediately after signing the settlement agreement Complainant asked to have it rescinded. The Agency does not contest this. We find that given these circumstances, the evidence shows that the Agency did not give Complainant a reasonable amount of time to consider the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement is invalid because it does not meet a requirement of the OWBPA.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agency dismisses a claim that a settlement agreement contains an invalid OWBPA waiver, it must specifically address in its response why it believes the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Leech v. Postmaster General</span>, 05990787 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, if the complainant alleges that he or she did not have a reasonable period of time to consider the agreement prior to entering it, the agency must sufficiently develop the record on that issue to permit review by the EEOC. In <span class="Italic">Banzon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A32703 (2003), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that when complainant pursued the EEO complaint process that led to the settlement agreement, age was one of the bases of alleged discrimination that he identified. The Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) amended the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), effective October 16, 1990, and provides the minimum requirements for waiver of ADEA claims. To meet the standards of the OWBPA, a waiver is not considered knowing and voluntary unless, at a minimum: it is clearly written from the viewpoint of the complainant; it specifically refers to rights or claims under the ADEA; the complainant does not waive rights or claims arising following execution of the waiver; valuable consideration is given in exchange for the waiver; the complainant is advised, in writing, to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement and the complainant is given a "reasonable" period of time in which to consider the agreement. 29 U.S.C. 626(f)(2)<span class="Italic">. See Swain v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05921079 (June 3, 1993) (settlement agreement upheld which was found to meet the waiver provisions of the OWBPA); <span class="Italic">Juhola v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01934032 (June 30, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the settlement agreement language meets five of the six requirements set forth in the OWBPA, as identified above. However, the Commission determines that there is insufficient evidence in the record to determine if complainant was given a "reasonable" period of time in which to consider the agreement. The record contains two <span id="Page_424"></span>letters from complainant to the Administrative Judge (AJ) assigned to his case dated days after the agreement was entered, January 30, 2001 and February 1, 2001. Therein, complainant claimed that he was not provided with enough time to consider the terms of the agreement. According to complainant, he signed the settlement agreement because he was "pressed and pressured." The agreement was entered at 5:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on January 29, 2001, while the hearing was scheduled for 9:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> the next day. Complainant stated that the AJ "had to be informed before the hearing." Complainant contended that he "found the terms onerous" and he did not have sufficient time to "consider it well" and "understand it better." Similarly, on appeal, complainant asserts that he did not understand some of the settlement terms, and "[t]here was not even enough time to discuss item # 11 alone, because the [settlement agreement] was faxed to me at 4:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, Jan 29 just before the scheduled hearing...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we find that complainant's arguments are such that the agreement may be void under the OWBPA, the Commission notes that the agency has not addressed the issue of whether complainant was provided with reasonable time to consider the settlement. Therefore, we remand the matter to the agency to conduct a supplemental investigation concerning the matter of reasonable time.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agreement settles both Title VII and ADEA claims, the failure to comply with the OWBPA does not negate the agreement. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">McMahon v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120112007 (2012), only the settlement agreement is void only as to the complainant's ADEA claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the underlying complaint contains an allegation of age discrimination, the Commission will analyze the impact Complainant's allegation of age discrimination has on the settlement agreement. The Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) provides the minimum requirements for a waiver of age discrimination claims under the ADEA. Under OWBPA, a waiver is not considered knowing and voluntary unless, at a minimum: (1) it is clearly written from the viewpoint of complainant; (2) it specifically refers to rights or claims under the ADEA; (3) complainant does not waive rights or claims arising in exchange for the waiver; (4) valuable consideration is given in exchange for the waiver; (5) complainant is advised, in writing, to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement, and (6) Complainant is given a "reasonable" period of time in which to consider the agreement. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(2). <span class="Italic">See Swain v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05921079 (June 3, 1993). Here, the settlement agreement does not mention the ADEA. The agreement is silent as to Complainant's rights or claims under the ADEA, Additionally, the record does not support a finding that Complainant had been given a reasonable period of time in which to consider the settlement agreement. Therefore, we find that the settlement agreement did not comply with the OWBPA's waiver requirements for agreements settling age claims. <span class="Italic">See Sheehy v. National Security Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520100403 (February 27, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to remedy Complainant, the Commission voids the settlement agreement with respect to Complainant's ADEA claims only. <span class="Italic">See id. (citing Oubre v. Entergy Operations Inc</span>., 522 U.S. 422, 428 (1998) (failure to comply with the OWBPA's stringent waiver safeguards will void the settlement agreement only with regard to the ADEA claims)). Because the evidence does not support a finding that Complainant's waiver of her Title VII claims was defective, the settlement agreement, including all payments made to or owing Complainant, remains in effect with regard to those non-age based claims. <span class="Italic">See id. (citing Campo v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03A20012 (August 27, 2002)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant is entitled to have her age based claim processed from the point where processing ceased in June 2009. Therefore, this claim is remanded for adjudication to the Hearings Unit of the New York District Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If Complainant eventually prevails on her ADEA claim, the Agency may seek to reduce her award by the benefits she received under the settlement agreement. This Commission notes, as did the Supreme Court, that this "may be complex where a release is effective as to some claims but not as to ADEA claims." <span class="Italic">Oubre</span> at 428. We remind the parties that compensatory damages and attorney's fees and costs are not available under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See Falks v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960250 (September 5, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120140396 (2015), where an MSPB settlement did not include OWBPA rights and the Commission allowed an age discrimination complaint to proceed but not the complainant's Title VII complaints:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was represented by an attorney who engaged in a settlement discussion with the Agency representative. Complainant was subsequently included in the discussion and she signed the agreement. Upon review of the MSPB settlement agreement, we note that the terms make no specific reference to rights or claims under the ADEA. Moreover, we note that the MSPB settlement agreement does not indicate that Complainant was provided a reasonable period of time in which to consider the agreement. Therefore, we find that under the OWBPA, Complainant did not knowingly or voluntarily waive her ADEA claim. Thus, Complainant's age shall be reinstated but not her claims arising under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Sheehy v. National Security Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520100403 (February 27, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regards to the claims of sex and reprisal discrimination under Title VII, we find that Complainant has not established that she was coerced into signing the MSPB settlement agreement. Complainant was represented by an attorney that she had designated as her representative. Complainant received consideration as specified above for her agreement not to pursue her rights under Title VII. The MSPB settlement agreement provided that it would be enforceable by application to the AJ. Thus, there are sufficient grounds to maintain the validity of the MSPB settlement agreement as to the claims arising under Title VII, but not those claims arising out of the ADEA, for the reason discussed above.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hester S. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 0120121983 (2016) (finding claims of discrimination raised under Title VII were properly dismissed by the agency as to the complainant's non-age related claims).</p>
<p class="noindent">But, where there is a mutual mistake on the part of the parties in the formation of the agreement, the settlement agreement is voidable. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Francesca V. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120170632 (2017), where the settlement agreement provided that the agency would restore a certain amount of sick leave so that the complainant could retire with a balance of one year. The agency was later advised that it could not grant the complainant more sick leave than that to which she would have otherwise been entitled, and that the provision presented a regulatory violation. The complainant filed a breach claim when the agency failed to implement the agreed upon leave restoration. The agency found that the provision violated the law and was void and unenforceable, but concluded that the remaining terms of the agreement were valid and enforceable. The complainant appealed. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Francesca V</span>., agreed that the provision was void, but also found that the OWBPA was violated, in part, because the parties' mutual mistake meant that the complainant did not "knowingly and voluntarily" enter into the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant does not dispute that term 3(c) violates federal law and the parties made a mutual mistake regarding this, and hence this term is unenforceable. For this reason, she does not seek to specifically enforce term 3(c). Given this, and the information in the record, we will not disturb the Agency's finding that term 3(c) is void.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The applicable portion of the OWBPA, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(2) [Section 7(f)(2)] provides in part that a waiver of age discrimination claims under the ADEA is not considered knowing and voluntary unless, at a minimum, certain facial requirements are met such as the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims under the ADEA, it is clearly written from the viewpoint of the complainant, the complainant is advised in writing to consult an attorney prior to executing the agreement, the complainant does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the waiver is executed, and so forth. <span class="Italic">Sheehy v. National Security Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520100403 (Feb. 27, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency in the settlement agreement listed the facial language required by the OWBPA, the OWBPA was violated in two ways. First, the requirement in term 11 that Complainant tender back all benefits and money paid under the terms of the settlement agreement to the Agency before ORM reinstated her complaints violates the OWBPA. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1625.23(b) (no ADEA waiver agreement may require an employee to tender back consideration received as a condition precedent to challenging the settlement agreement). In commentary on this regulation, the Commission wrote that it believed there was a strong argument that a tender back clause in an ADEA waiver agreement makes the agreement misleading in a material sense and thus violates the OWBPA's requirement that waivers be calculated to be understandable by the individual or by the average individual eligible to participate. 65 FR 77438, 77441 (Dec. 11, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the OWBPA requires that a waiver of age discrimination claims under the ADEA be knowing and voluntary. In its commentary on 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1625.23(b), the Commission determined that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress contemplated that the OWBPA's standard for "knowing and voluntary" would incorporate both the enumerated statutory requirements and the requirement that the waivers be adopted "in the absence of fraud, duress, coercion, or mistake of material fact." If the "no tender back" rule is necessary to effectuate the OWBPA's enumerated requirements, then it also must be applicable to enforce the fundamental requirement that OWBPA waivers be free of fraud, duress, coercion, or mistake of material fact. <span class="Italic">Id. See also, Bennett v. Coors Brewing Company</span>, 189 F.3d 1221, 1229 &#x0026; 1234 (10th Cir. 1999) (interpreting OWBPA as recounted above). The Commission has explicitly agreed with the interpretation set forth in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span>. 65 FR 77438, at footnote 24.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Depending on the circumstances, the Commission recognizes that an otherwise valid settlement agreement may be void, voidable, or reformable depending on the circumstances: <span class="Italic">Gorman v. National Science Foundation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932369 (May 26, 1993). For <span id="Page_425"></span>example, the Commission found a settlement agreement void where a material mistake occurred during its formation, making assent to the agreement impossible. <span class="Italic">Schmidt, Jr. v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081775 (the parties agreed that the complainant would continue to be a manager who supervised the same people he currently supervised. This was based on the parties assumption that an impending reorganization would not impact the positions under the complainant's supervision but it eliminated them, resulting in him becoming non-supervisory. The parties made a material mutual mistake in the formation of the settlement agreement and it was unenforceable based on their erroneous assumption. Because of this mutual mistake, the settlement agreement was void).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the parties erroneous assumption that term 3 of the settlement agreement was lawful and enforceable was a mutual mistake in the formation of the settlement agreement. Because this mutual mistake was material and the settlement agreement contained other valuable consideration, we find that the entire settlement agreement is voidable. This will be addressed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the waiver in the settlement agreement violated the OWBPA, if Complainant decides to void the agreement and ask that her complaints be reinstated, the Agency must do so without requiring her to tender back to the Agency the benefits and money she received from the Agency, and the payment of fees her attorney received. This does not include, however, any action OPM may take to recoup overpayments of pension benefits it determines violated the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If Complainant decides that she wants to void the settlement agreement and eventually prevails on her ADEA or Title VII claims, the Agency may seek to reduce her award by the benefits she received under the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Sheehy</span>.</p>
