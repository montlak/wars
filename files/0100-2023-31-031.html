<h4 class="h4" id="sec22-32"><span class="space">6.</span> Discount Rates</h4>
<p class="noindent">Agencies may find it difficult to believe, but many private attorneys who practice in the area of federal employment law do not do so for purely economic reasons. Some believe there is a public interest aspect to their work in ferreting out prohibited discrimination in the federal workplace, just as agency representatives no doubt believe they serve the public interest by defending their agency against unwarranted complaints. Some private counsel even go a step further and charge their federal employee clients a rate that is less than the rate charged for private sector clients. The obvious question becomes at what rate shall the agency compensate the services of those attorneys--the rate actually charged the client, or the attorney's customary rate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hatfield v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01892909 (1989), the Commission found that attorneys who can demonstrate they charge reduced rates to federal employees in discrimination cases, based on public interest motives, are entitled to be compensated at their higher customary rate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, in a lengthy <span class="Italic">en</span> <span class="Italic">banc</span> decision, the United States Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, expressly rejected the view that the reduced profit public interest lawyer would be limited to be compensated for his or her below market "actual" rates should his or her clients prevail in cases which allow statutory fees. <span class="Italic">Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel</span>, 857 F.2d 1516 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (footnote omitted). Instead, the Court held, the attorney will be entitled to a fee award based upon the higher, prevailing market rates. <span class="Italic">Cumberland</span>, 857 F.2d at 1524. While <span class="Italic">Cumberland</span> was a statutory fee case involving federal environmental statutes, its holding has been expressly applied since to both Title VII and age discrimination cases. <span class="Italic">American Ass'n of Retired Persons v. EEOC</span>, 873 F.2d 402, 405 (D.C. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Kennickell</span>, 710 F. Supp. 1, 3 (D.D.C. 1989; <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Barry</span>, 704 F. Supp. 705, 708 (D.D.C. 1989). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Missouri v. Jenkins</span>, No. 88-64, slip op. (U.S. June 19, 1989) at 10 (finding that in a school desegregation case which involved attorney's fees, the work of paralegals should be compensated at their market rates rather than their cost to the prevailing attorney).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Cumberland</span> outlined important policy reasons for their holding. The Court observed that to hold differently would force the "privately practicing but public interest motivated attorneys" to either refuse to engage in <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">bono</span> work by directing those potential clients to the larger, traditional-for-profit law firms or to legal aid organizations, if either of those entities was available and willing to undertake the representation. Or, the attorney would quote fictitious but market-based rates, which neither the attorney nor the client had any intention of actually seeing totally collected unless court-awarded fees are ultimately available. <span class="Italic">Cumberland</span>, 857 at 1520. However, neither of these alternatives is consistent with the policies behind fee shifting statutes or accepted principles of legal ethics. An even more negative impact, the Court found, would result on the client as reduced profit public interest lawyers often acquire particular experience and expertise in specific public interest areas. Without these practitioners, expertise in these areas is likely to be found only in those attorneys who regularly litigate against public interest groups (or in the case of federal sector EEO complaints, those attorneys who regularly represent the agencies [sic]). The reduced profit public interest lawyer is also often willing to take on unpopular cases and to carry the costs of protracted cases that is indispensable to the full enforcement of federal law such as the anti-discrimination statutes. <span class="Italic">Cumberland</span>, 857 F.2d 1521. For all of these policy reasons, the <span class="Italic">Cumberland</span> Court concluded that "Congress did not intend the private but public-spirited rate-cutting attorney to be penalized for his public spiritedness by being paid on a lower scale than either his higher priced fellow barrister from an established firm or his salaried neighbor at a legal services clinic." <span class="Italic">Cumberland</span>, 857 F.2d at 1524.</p>
<p class="noindent">The law firm in <span class="Italic">Hatfield</span> established that it routinely charged less than the applicable prevailing market rate to federal sector clients with discrimination claims. It was entitled to fees at the actual prevailing market rate. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lampkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080017 (2009) (approving rates of $425 and $375 per hour instead of $200 approved by administrative judge because <span id="Page_1998"></span>lawyers charged reduced rates to federal employees based on public interest motives).</p>
<p class="noindent">As with any case involving the determination of a reasonable hourly rate, the attorney in a reduced fee case must present specific evidence to establish the prevailing market rate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Atias v. General Services Administration</span>, 01911747 (1991). Such evidence should be presented at the time the fee request is submitted and not on appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gatewood v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01976511 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">The assertion that the law firm offers reduced rates for "non-economic" reasons must be supported. The law firm must show that it consistently offers reduced rates for public interest reasons. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. General Services Administrator</span>, 05910549 (1991). The showing can be made by presenting specific evidence that the law firm has charged less than the prevailing market rate for federal sector EEO cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01910674 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720140022 (2015), the Commission upheld the application of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate by the administrative judge noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that in his fee petition, Complainant's attorney explains that he charges less in cases such as Complainant's because of the financial burden they entail for most clients in Complainant's position. We find Complainant's attorney has demonstrated that he entered into an agreement at a lower than market hourly rate because he knew that Complainant would otherwise be financially burdened. We find that the AJ's use of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is appropriate under the circumstances where the attorneys have entered into a fee agreement at a lower hourly rate that takes into consideration the financial burden that market rates would impose upon an employee in Complainant's position, even those compensated at the GS-15 rate, in order to provide skilled representation to employees employed in public service. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720120002 (Sept. 19, 2014), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520150063 (December 5, 2014). Therefore, we shall affirm the AJ's award of attorney's fees and costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the prevailing market rate is the general standard the Commission uses to determine the hourly rate in a fee award, it may decline to apply that rate when the actual retainer agreement with the client provides for a much lower rate and the attorney does not exhibit the "public spiritedness" referred to in <span class="Italic">Cumberland Mountains</span>. In <span class="Italic">Erickson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01944011 (1996), the Commission failed to approve a rate of $150 per hour for the attorney even though it agreed the attorney had proved this was the prevailing market rate. Instead, the Commission focused on a retainer agreement that provided for services at roughly $75 per hour. The Commission also noted the attorney was not one who regularly charged a reduced rate for federal sector EEO cases. Finally, the Commission noted that the attorney failed to submit any evidence that he actually billed fee paying clients at the prevailing market rate. In <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission will first address the matter of attorney B's hourly rate. In his verified affidavit, attorney B represented that his usual and customary hourly rate was $150.00. He further supplied the agency with affidavits from three other attorneys (including attorney A) practicing in the relevant geographical area, who stated that customary fees for civil rights cases ranged from $100 to $175 per hour. Attorney B further stated that "$6,000.00 of [his] fee was a fixed retainer fee, and the remainder was contingent." The agency then requested that attorney B submit copies of his retainer agreement with appellant. Attorney B never did so; however, a copy was submitted by appellant. A retainer agreement dated April 26, 1993, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Appellant] hereby convey[s] $2500.00...with $2500.00 due after 33 hours of work, to [attorney B] for legal services [for the instant complaints, including] preparation for, and representation at, the upcoming hearing, including writing the trial brief and through a conclusion by the EEOC. Total legal fees shall not exceed $6000. The estimated required time necessary in carrying out the above-referenced case is 66 hours which put forth [sic] in exchange for the above $5000 retainer fee. In the event the case requires more than 66 hours, the client will be billed hourly at the rate of $75. per hour. Costs shall be paid separately....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 9, 1993, several weeks after the hearing was held, another agreement was entered into by appellant and attorney B. Pursuant to this agreement, appellant paid attorney B an additional $1,407.59 and he and attorney B agreed that, if appellant "was awarded attorney's fees, then after [appellant was reimbursed for the fees previously paid by him, attorney B] will be entitled to receive additional fees and costs out of the award,...[and appellant would] have no further responsibility to [attorney B] for any fees or costs."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Observing that the retainer agreement was not contingent in nature, that it provided that appellant would pay $2500 for the first 33 hours of attorney B's time, and $2500 for the additional 33 hours the case was estimated to require, the agency calculated that attorney B's hourly rate was no more than $75.76, a rate in accordance with the retainer's further provision that any time in excess of the 66 hours estimated would "be billed hourly at the rate of $75. per hour." Accordingly, in its decision on the fee request, the agency found that attorney B had established only an entitlement to hourly fees of $75.76 for his first 66 hours of service and $75.00 for any additional hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, attorney B argues that his customary hourly rate is $150, that he had submitted affidavits from other attorneys who supported this rate as reasonable, and that the "retainer agreement only concerned the set fee [while the later agreement provided for the] contingent recovery of attorney's fees at [his] customary rate." In general, reasonable hourly rates are measured by the "prevailing market rates in the relevant community." <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984). The applicable rate for fee awards to public interest attorneys is the prevailing hourly rate for the community in general. For private attorneys, the best evidence of a reasonable hourly rate is the hourly rate customarily charged by the attorney or law firm for fee-paying clients. <span class="Italic">National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1325 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920057 (April 23, 1992). An attorney's customary billing rate for fee-paying clients is the best evidence of a reasonable attorney's fee for that individual. <span class="Italic">See Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Educ.</span>, 773 F.2d 677, 683 (6th Cir. 1965) <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 474 U.S. 1083 (1986); <span class="Italic">Ohio-Sealy Mattress Manuf. Co. v. Sealy Inc.</span>, 776 F.2d 646, 654 (7th Cir. 1985). In <span class="Italic">Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel</span>, 857 F.2d 1516 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court held that the prevailing market rate should also be used to determine fee awards to private, for-profit attorneys who represent certain clients at reduced rates, which reflect "non-economic" goals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, attorney B, who is a for-profit attorney, has offered affidavits establishing that the prevailing market rate is $150.00 an hour for attorneys of his experience. The Commission agrees that the record as a whole, including the material filed by attorneys A and C, evidences that the prevailing market rate is at least $150.00 per hour. However, attorney B has not offered an adequate reason why in determining his hourly rate, the agency erred in relying on the hourly rate set forth in attorney B's retainer agreement. Attorney B never claimed that the billing rate agreed to between him and appellant was a reduced rate or that he charges a reduced rate for Federal sector EEO cases. Attorney B does not exhibit the "public spiritedness" recognized in the <span class="Italic">Cumberland</span> decision, and which was found worthy of compensation at the prevailing market rate. Therefore, the best evidence of a reasonable hourly rate in the present case is attorney B's customary billing rate as reflected in the retainer agreement. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910549 (August 29, 1991). Accordingly, we find that the agency reasonably determined the proper hourly rate for attorney B. In doing so, the Commission finds that any higher prevailing market rate is not available in this case, for the best evidence of a reasonable hourly fee is attorney B's customary billing rate for fee-paying clients. Since attorney B failed to produce evidence that he in fact customarily bills at a rate higher than that set forth in the retainer agreement, we find that the retainer establishes that he and appellant agreed to a rate of approximately $75.00 per hour for his services and that the retainer itself serves as a sufficient basis for determining attorney B's customary rates. <span class="Italic">Atias v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920094 (April 14, 1992). The Commission is not persuaded that the second agreement, executed after the hearing (and, in fact, after the performance of all services for which attorney B seeks payment), establishes that attorney B accepted appellant's case at a reduced rate on a contingency basis. The Commission simply finds insufficient evidence to substantiate attorney B's entitlement to an hourly rate of $150.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not appropriate to award an hourly rate based on the attorney's current rate as punishment for agency delay in processing the case if the attorney does not otherwise meet the criteria for obtaining his current hourly rate. With the exception of meeting the standard of routinely providing a reduced fee criterion, the attorney is only entitled to the rate he actually billed for the applicable time periods. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01944999 (1996), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the AR submitted an itemized bill for professional services and an affidavit dated October 19, 1993, stating that his hourly rate generally charged for services during the period encompassed by the complaints were: $150.00 per hour for services rendered in 1988; $160.00 per hour for services rendered in 1989 and 1990; $175.00 per hour for services rendered in 1991; $185.00 per hour for services rendered in 1992; and $200.00 per hour for services rendered in 1993. The AR's affidavit also contained a brief explanation of his professional background, which listed intellectual property law as his area of expertise. In addition, the AR submitted an affidavit from a practitioner in the same geographical area in an effort to establish rates of comparable service. The Commission notes that the agency accepted the hourly rates submitted by the AR in his fee petition dated October 19, 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding, the Commission notes that, in subsequent correspondence, the AR amended the initial fee petition and requested <span id="Page_1999"></span>an "across the board" application of an hourly rate of $200.00 for all professional services rendered on the complaints from 1988 to 1993. The AR did not request "enhancement" of the "lodestar" figure in this case. Rather, the AR specifically argued that an "across the board" application of an hourly rate of $200.00 was appropriate compensation, due to the agency's repeated delays in appointing an investigator in the initial complaint; due to management officials' alleged interference with potential witnesses; the agency's delay in concluding the investigation of three complaints; and the agency's delay in issuing its final decision. However, the Commission finds that the AR has failed to meet the burden of producing persuasive evidence to justify his claim for the requested hourly rate of $200.00 for all hours claimed in this case, other than his mere assertions that an increase in his hourly rate is justified due to the agency's delay. The Commission further finds that the AR's assertions relating to the agency's delay in processing the complaints do not establish that the agency's actions were intentional or calculated to deter his client's efforts in pursuing her complaints. Moreover, we find that the AR's request actually constitutes an indirect request to penalize the agency for its untimely issuance and/or completion of documentation at certain stages of the administrative process. We decline to do so. Again, we find no evidence demonstrating that the agency's actions or failure to act in a timely manner were deliberate. Therefore, due to the AR's failure to meet the burden of justifying the "across the board" application of an hourly rate of $200.00, the Commission finds that the hourly rates set forth in the AR's fee petition dated October 19, 1993, are reasonable and will be utilized in our attorney's fees analysis discussed herein.</p>
