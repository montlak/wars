<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-74"><span class="space">F.</span> CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND PRETEXT</h3>
<p class="noindent">In reality, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> formula is, as the Court noted, a tool to aid in analyzing whether there is a connection between the basis of discrimination alleged and the adverse personnel action taken when there is no, or insufficient, direct evidence of motive. The same rationale applies to reprisal cases. Two of the key factors the EEOC will review in making an assessment of nexus are the proximity in time between the protected activity and the action taken, and the knowledge of the RMOs who took or recommended the action.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 at II.C.3. (2016), elaborates:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Different types or pieces of evidence, either alone or in combination, may be relevant to determine if the above causation standard has been met. In other words, different pieces of evidence, considered together, may allow an inference that the materially adverse action was retaliatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence may include, for example, suspicious timing, verbal or written statements, comparative evidence that a similarly situated employee was treated differently, falsity of the employer's proffered reason for the adverse action, or any other pieces of evidence which, when viewed together, may permit an inference of retaliatory intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Suspicious timing</span>. The causal link between the adverse action and the protected activity is often established by evidence that the adverse action occurred shortly after the plaintiff engaged in protected activity. However, temporal proximity is not necessary to establish a causal link. Even when the time between the protected activity and the adverse action is lengthy, other evidence of retaliatory motive may establish the causal link. For example, actions related to the continued processing of a complaint may remind an employer of its pendency or stoke an employer's animus. Moreover, an opportunity to engage in a retaliatory act may not arise right away. In these circumstances, a materially adverse action might occur long after the oriGINAl protected activity occurs, and retaliatory motive is nevertheless proven.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Oral or written statements</span>. Oral or written statements made by the individuals recommending or approving the challenged adverse action may reveal retaliatory intent by expressing retaliatory animus or by revealing inconsistencies, pre-determined decisions, or other indications that the reasons given for the adverse action are false. Such statements may have been made to the employee or to others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Comparative evidence</span>. An inference that the adverse action was motivated by retaliation could also be supported by evidence that the employer treated more favorably a similarly situated employee who had not engaged in protected activity. For example, where a disciplinary action was taken for alleged retaliatory reasons, evidence of selective enforcement (i.e., that infraction regularly goes undisciplined in that workplace, or that another employee who committed the same infraction was not disciplined, or was not disciplined as severely) could be sufficient to infer retaliatory motive. Similarly, absent evidence of new performance problems, a retaliatory motive might be inferred where an employee had higher performance appraisals prior to engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Inconsistent or shifting explanations</span>. If the employer changes its stated reason for the challenged adverse action over time or in different settings (e.g., reasons stated to employee in termination meeting differ from reasons employer cites in position statement filed with the EEOC), pretext may be inferred. The inference of discrimination drawn from such changes, however, will be undermined to the extent the inconsistencies are innocuous or can be credibly explained by the employer (e.g., additional information is discovered).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Other evidence that employer's explanation was pretextual</span>. There may be other evidence that the employer's justification for the challenged action is not believable and that the explanation is a pretext to hide retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 19</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence of Retaliatory Intent--Manager Advised No-Hire Based on Prior EEO Activity</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee files a suit against company A, alleging that her supervisor sexually harassed and constructively discharged her. The suit is ultimately settled. She applies for a new job with company B and receives a conditional offer subject to a reference check. When B calls A, the employee's former supervisor says that she was a "troublemaker," started a sex harassment lawsuit, and was not anyone B "would want to get mixed up with." B then withdraws its conditional offer. These statements support the conclusion that because of the employee's prior sexual harassment allegation, A provided a negative job reference and B rescinded its job offer. Both A and B can be liable for retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 20</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence of Retaliatory Intent? Manager Departed from Practice</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Jane, a saleswoman, has been employed at a retail store for more than a decade, and has always exceeded her sales quota and received excellent performance appraisals. Shortly after the company learned that Jane had provided a witness statement to the EEOC in support of a coworker's sexual harassment claim, it terminated Jane, citing her failure to provide 48-hours advance notice to her supervisor about a shift swap with a coworker. She alleges retaliatory termination, and evidence reveals that same-day notice of shift swap was a widespread company practice that had commonly been permitted. This evidence, in combination with the proximity in time of her discharge to the company's learning of her protected activity, could support the conclusion that the discharge was retaliatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if protected activity and a materially adverse action occurred, evidence of any of the following facts alone or in combination may be credited by the factfinder in a given case and, as a result, lead to the conclusion that the action was not in retaliation for the protected activity under the applicable causation standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Employer Unaware of Protected Activity</span>. Retaliation cannot be shown without establishing that the employer (either the decisionmaker or someone who influenced the decisionmaker) knew of the prior protected activity. Absent knowledge, there can be no retaliatory intent, and therefore no causal connection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1526"></span><span class="Italic">Legitimate Non-Retaliatory Reason for Challenged Action</span>. An employer may proffer a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the challenged action. Examples of non-retaliatory reasons include:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> poor performance;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> inadequate qualifications for position sought;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> qualifications, application, or interview performance inferior to the selectee;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> negative job references;</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> misconduct (e.g., threats, insubordination, unexcused absences, employee dishonesty, abusive or threatening conduct, or theft); and</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x00B7;</span> reduction in force or other downsizing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Though the employer does not have the burden to disprove retaliation, the employer may have evidence supporting its proffered explanation for the challenged action, such as comparative evidence revealing like treatment of similarly situated individuals who did not engage in protected activity, or supporting documentary and/or witness testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 21</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Negative Reference Was Truthful, Not Retaliatory</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee alleges that his former private sector employer gave him a negative job reference because he had filed an EEO discrimination claim after being terminated. The employer produces evidence that it usually provides information about previous employees' job performance and that its negative statements to the prospective employer were honest assessments of the former employee's job performance. Unless it can be concluded that the negative reference was because of the discrimination claim, retaliation would not be found.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 22</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Action Not Motivated By Retaliation</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Plaintiff, the office manager of a service company, believed her non-selection for various managerial positions was due to sex discrimination, and she posted on an online social media platform, "anyone know a good EEO lawyer? need one now." Management saw this and shared it with human resources. Plaintiff was subsequently discharged and alleged it was retaliatory. However, the evidence showed the termination was due to Plaintiff's extensive unauthorized use of overtime and her repeated violations of company finance procedures, which were enforced for other employees, and for which Plaintiff had been previously issued written discipline. Even though management was aware of Plaintiff's protected activity (her intention to take action on a potential EEO claim), Plaintiff cannot prove retaliatory discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">A showing of pretext is generally composed of a variety of factors none of which, standing alone, would result in such a finding. Although <span class="Italic">Ouverson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120114084 (2012), involves review of a summary judgment decision and, as such, resulted in a remand of the case instead of a finding of reprisal, it still gives a good example of how pretext can be demonstrated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that the AJ erred when he found that there were no genuine issues of material fact in this case. In concluding that there was no retaliation in this case, the AJ found simply that Complainant had the proper motive and the opportunity to leave the obscene message and had admitted that she telephoned the construction company on the day of the incident. Based on these factors, the AJ found that the Postmaster was justified in believing that Complainant left the offensive message and should be fired for it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, Complainant has unequivocally asserted that she did not leave a message on the answering machine, and that the Postmaster had no justifiable reason to believe she did. She states that she asked for and received a copy of the telephone message, which she states is unintelligible. She further asserts that she and the construction owner had resolved the incident amicably without the intervention of the Postmaster, which the Postmaster confirmed the next day. Moreover, the notes prepared by the Postmaster regarding her conversation with the company owner on August 14, 2009, do not report the alleged use of profanity by Complainant on the answering machine. Complainant contends that the fact that the Postmaster contacted the company owner following the incident but failed to document the alleged use of profanity on the answering machine is evidence of that the Postmaster later recast the incident to use as an excuse to fire her in retaliation for her prior EEO complaint involving the Postmaster. She notes that the settlement agreement in her prior EEO complaint was signed just a few weeks before the Postmaster issued her the notice of removal. She further suggests that the Postmaster knew the removal had to be proposed before a prior 14-day suspension was expunged from her record pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement. According to Complainant, removal could not have been justified in this case without that prior disciplinary record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further argues that the Al erred in finding she was not similarly situated to the comparators she named. Complainant argues that although the AJ found the comparators engaged in off-duty misconduct, Complainant points out that it is undisputed that the employee who received only a job discussion by the Postmaster missed four days of work because he was in jail following a conviction for driving a vehicle while intoxicated. Complainant contends that according to Agency rules intoxication alone can constitute just cause for discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">In reviewing an MSPB decision, the Commission picked up on the judge's use of the "convincing mosaic" standard which has been articulated by some federal courts and elaborated on its interpretation of that standard in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0320110050 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we determine that the MSPB AJ erred in insisting that petitioners "must" provide evidence showing a "convincing mosaic" of retaliation in order to prove retaliation using circumstantial evidence. Our view is that when an employer in a federal sector case identifies a lawful reason for an adverse action, the employee will have to produce enough evidence to either discredit the employer's explanation or prove that the real reason was retaliation. One way that the employee "may" discredit the defendant's explanation and demonstrate a causal connection between the prior protected activity and the challenged adverse action is by presenting a 'convincing mosaic" of circumstantial evidence that would support the inference of retaliatory animus. The pieces of that "mosaic" may include a variety of types of evidence, such as suspicious timing, verbal or written statements, comparative evidence that a similarly situated employee was treated differently, falsity of the employer's proffered reason for the adverse action, or any other "bits and pieces" from which an inference of retaliatory intent might be drawn. <span class="Italic">Cloe</span>, 712 F.3d at 1181.</p>
<p class="noindent">Discussed below are the factors that can result in a finding of pretext.</p>
