<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-105"><span class="space">2.</span> Depositions</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the principal methods of discovery is oral depositions. In an oral deposition, the witness is placed under oath and asked questions relevant to the lawsuit. In most cases, a verbatim transcript of the deposition is kept. Written transcripts are not necessarily required, but the testimony must be preserved in some way that allows for its verbatim reproduction. Depositions are useful for many purposes. They can assist a party in determining, in advance, what the testimony of a witness will be. They lock in the testimony of a witness and provide a means for impeaching the testimony of that witness if the testimony subsequently changes. They are also a method of preserving the testimony of witnesses who might not be available for trial or hearing. Depositions can be particularly useful in situations where a witness is scheduled to depart from agency employment prior to the scheduled hearing and in those cases where, unfortunately, the witness is expected to depart this mortal life prior to the hearing. As a general rule, depositions are not generally admitted in lieu of live testimony without good cause, nor is it necessary to designate deposition transcripts as a hearing exhibit. The transcripts can be used at the hearing during the examination of witnesses without admitting them into evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit depositions of "any person," regardless of whether he or she is a party to the litigation. However, in federal sector EEO cases, as discussed above, the administrative judges have no authority to issue subpoenas to private citizens. The rule on depositions must be read, for EEO administrative purposes, as applying only to employees of the federal government. Of course, nothing prevents either the agency or the complainant from taking the deposition of a private citizen. Rather, there is no means of compelling the attendance of a private citizen who does not choose to voluntarily appear for deposition. Rule 30 of the Federal Rules provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Notice of Examination: General Requirements; Method of Recording: Production of Documents and Things; Deposition of Organization; Deposition by Telephone</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;A party desiring to take the deposition of any person upon oral examination shall give reasonable notice in writing to every other party to the action. The notice shall state the time and place for taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the person to be examined, the designation of the materials to be produced as set forth in the subpoena shall be attached to, or included in, the notice.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The party taking the deposition shall state in the notice the method by which the testimony shall be recorded. Unless the court orders otherwise, it may be recorded by sound, sound-and-visual, or stenographic means, and the party taking the deposition shall bear the cost of the recording. Any party may arrange for a transcription to be made from the recording of a deposition taken by nonstenographic means.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;With prior notice to the deponent and the other parties, any party may designate another method to record the deponent's testimony in addition to the method specified by the person taking the deposition. The additional record or transcript shall be made at that party's expense unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request made in compliance with Rule 34 for the production of documents and tangible things at the taking of the deposition. The procedure of Rule 34 shall apply to the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(6)&#x2003;A party may in the party's notice and in a subpoena name as the deponent a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency and describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In that event, the organization so named shall designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person designated, the matters on which the person will testify. A subpoena shall advise a non-party organization of its duty to make such a designation. The persons so designated shall testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the organization. This subdivision (b)(6) does not preclude taking a deposition by any other procedure authorized in these rules.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(7)&#x2003;The parties may stipulate in writing or the court may upon motion order that a deposition be taken by telephone or other electronic means. For the purposes of this rule and Rules 28(a), 37(a)(1), 37(a)(1), and 37(b)(1), a deposition taken by such means is taken in the district and at the place where the deponent is to answer questions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Examination and Cross-Examination; Record of Examination; Oath; Objections</span>. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as permitted at the trial under the provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence except Rules 103 and 615. The officer before whom the deposition is to be taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation and shall personally, or by someone acting under the officer's direction and in the officer's presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically or recorded by any other method authorized by subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, to the manner of taking it, to the evidence presented, to the conduct of any party, or to any other aspect of the proceedings shall be noted by the officer upon the record of deposition; but the examination shall proceed, with the testimony being taken subject to the objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination, parties may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the deposition and the party taking the deposition shall transmit them to the officer, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Schedule and Duration; Motion to Terminate or Limit Examination</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Any objection to evidence during a deposition must be stated concisely and in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive manner. A party may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation directed by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Unless otherwise authorized by the court or stipulated by the parties, a deposition is limited to one day of seven hours. The court must allow additional time consistent with Rule 26(b)(2) if needed for a fair examination of the deponent or if the deponent or another person, or other circumstance, impedes or delays the examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;If the court finds any impediment, delay, or other conduct that has frustrated the fair examination of the deponent, it may impose upon the persons responsible an appropriate sanction, including the reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred by the parties as a result thereof.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;At any time during the taking of the deposition, on motion of a party or of the deponent and upon a showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, the court in which the action is pending or the court in the district where the deposition is being taken may order the officer conducting the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the deposition as provided in Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no specific limitation on the number of depositions that a party can take in an EEOC proceeding. However, the administrative judge has the authority to limit the parties to "a reasonable number of depositions." <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 4-2.</p>
<p class="noindent">Depositions can quickly become very expensive for both the complainant and the agency. Court reporters are not cheap. There are, however, some ways to reduce the expenses. Notably, the rules provide that the parties may stipulate that a deposition be taken by means other than stenographic. For example, the parties can agree that the depositions be tape recorded. Particularly where the depositions are for informational purposes and not impeachment purposes, tape recording can be a very cost effective means of conducting depositions. The Commission encourages the parties to engage in informal methods of discovery, including the tape recording of depositions. MD-110 at 7-22. Moreover, it is possible to dispense with the need for an independent party to administer oaths to the witnesses by making the witnesses aware of the provisions of 18 USC 1001, which make it a criminal offense to knowingly give a false statement in connection with a federal administrative proceeding. The testimony given has the effect of being under oath in that the witness gives the testimony subject to penalty for perjury.</p>
<p class="noindent">Rule 31 of the federal rules also provides for deposition by written questions. For the purposes of EEO administrative litigation, there is little difference between deposition by written questions and interrogatories, as discussed below. One difference worth noting is that, technically, interrogatories may only be submitted to a party. If the rule is strictly enforced by the administrative judge, this means that written interrogatories submitted by a complainant cannot be directed to a particular individual at the agency. They must be submitted to the opposing party--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the agency. The agency can then designate who will respond on its behalf. Depositions by written questions are not restricted to the parties under the federal rules. As a result, they can be directed to specific individuals for a response.</p>
<p class="noindent">To expedite the taking of depositions, it is possible for the parties to stipulate that they will withhold all objections, except as to the form of questions, until the hearing. If the witness will otherwise be available to testify at the hearing and the deposition is being taken for informational purposes, such a stipulation can expedite the deposition.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an administrative judge issues an order for the taking of a deposition, <span id="Page_495"></span>a party violates that order at significant risk. The administrative judge may impose sanctions as provided in 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3). In appropriate cases, the administrative judge may decline to hear the case when a complainant refuses to comply with an order to appear for a deposition. In <span class="Italic">Schneider v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05940298 (1994), the Commission upheld the actions of an administrative judge in remanding the case to the agency with instructions to either issue a final decision without a hearing or dismiss the complaint for failure to prosecute. The Commission further upheld the agency's decision to dismiss the complaint, noting that it would normally require a final decision on the record. However, given that the complainant refused to appear for the deposition and offered no legitimate excuse for failing to appear, the Commission found dismissal was warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to depose a witness, the requesting party must submit an advance written notice of the deposition. The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 4-2 to 4-3 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Judge, the party noticing the deposition pays for the deposition. EEO MD-110, 7-17. Deponents are required to appear for properly noticed depositions. Agencies are required to make current federal employees available for depositions and to grant the deponent official time. EEO MD-110, 7-18. Failure to appear may result in the non-appearing party bearing the expense for the missed session, or more severe sanctions. EEO MD-110, 7-17. However, the attendance of witnesses who are not current federal employees is voluntary and cannot be compelled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A notice of deposition must specify the date, time, and place of the deposition. Depositions may be taken by any method upon which the parties agree, provided the deposition is recorded by a court reporter. The opportunity for cross examination must be provided. In some circumstances where the deponent is unavailable for the hearing, the deposition transcript may be admitted in lieu of live testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, it is worth noting that the guidance of MD-110, suggesting that the Commission can impose monetary sanctions against agencies that do not produce witnesses for deposition, has been placed into question by the Department of Justice. See section on "<a href="0100-2023-15-122.html#sec6-120">Discovery Sanctions</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The single most significant problem with depositions is objections. There are two problems with objections. First, there is the so-called "speaking objection" where the party asserting the objection not only states the grounds, but goes on to argue the merits of the objection. There is no need to argue the merits of the objection because, unless the question calls for the disclosure of privileged information, the deponent is required to answer the question subject to the objection. The other difficulty with "speaking objections" is that such objections are often used as a form of witness coaching. By the time the representative has finished his or her soliloquy, the witness knows the answer to the question. The second problem with depositions involves the objection that is followed by an instruction to the witness not to answer the question. Situations where a witness can be legitimately instructed not to answer a question are rare and such an instruction should be given sparingly.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 4-3, the Commission gives some guidance on how its judges should address these problems:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the course of a deposition, the parties may note appropriate objections on the record, but, notwithstanding the objection, the deponent is required to respond unless the objection is based on a privilege. In those situations where the parties cannot resolve the dispute themselves, they may request the Administrative Judge to rule on the objection. The parties may telephone the Administrative Judge during a deposition to request a ruling on an objection or regarding a dispute over a procedural concern such as the conduct of counsel or the length of a deposition. If the Administrative Judge is not available, another Administrative Judge may be designated to handle the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge should attempt to resolve the dispute during the deposition by ruling on the objection or, if possible, by helping the parties reach a compromise on the scope of the questioning. The Administrative Judge should make the ruling "on the record" of the deposition to ensure that the court reporter transcribes it. If the dispute involves too complex a question to permit an immediate ruling, the Administrative Judge may instruct the parties to brief the issue. The Administrative Judge should notify the parties that if he/she overrules the objection, he/she will provide an opportunity to exchange the information at issue, either by allowing the deposition to continue at a later date, interrogatory, or other suitable means.</p>
