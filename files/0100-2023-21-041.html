<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-38"><span class="space">8.</span> Isolated or One-Time Incidents</h4>
<p class="noindent">An employer may rebut a charge of sexual harassment by showing that the conduct or practice complained of was "isolated or genuinely trivial." <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 01853167 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d 251 (4th Cir. 1983)). Showing the conduct was isolated or trivial represents a defense insofar as if the agency can show the incidents were isolated or trivial, such a showing will prevent the complainant from showing the conduct was severe or pervasive and, in turn, a term or condition of employment bearing in mind that the complainant always has the burden of proof.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the <span class="Italic">Smith</span> case, the Commission found that an incident where a supervisor had flicked off the light momentarily while the complainant was in his office was an isolated incident and there was no evidence of any other incidents. The Commission went on to note that even if some sexual connotation could be ascribed to the incident, it would be erroneous to characterize it as anything other than trivial. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Tassey v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01972025 (1998) (one incident of a male momentarily walking into a women's locker room was not sufficient to support a hostile environment claim). A one-time incident where a supervisor yelled at the complainant, instructing him to stop talking to a coworker, was also not sufficiently severe or pervasive to set forth an actionable claim of harassment. <span class="Italic">Bryon F. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161358 (2016). Even a supervisor telling the complainant to "show some leg" and saying "I don't mind pimping you out" did not rise to the level of actionable harassment in <span class="Italic">Amina W. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020003804 (2021).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Stephani G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142877 (2016), the Commission found a one-time incident sufficiently severe to unreasonably interfere with the complainant's work environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant attested that on August 30, 2013, she and a co-worker (Employee B) were working in Scan Where You Band (SWYB); and that their Acting MDO, pulled out a chair, took a seat, and said "Come here you bitches." According to Complainant, he said "I wanted to tell you all how mad I was at you all for what you did to me" and "I see you are Flo's bitches now." He proceeded to tell Complainant that he hated her, others hated her, and "everything was fine before I left and you messed it up." He accused Complainant of going to her supervisor and saying "lies about not getting treated fairly." Complainant believed that the Acting MDO was intoxicated, and considered his behavior to be "intimidating and threatening." He instructed Complainant to apologize to the Lead Clerk, then stated "Now I want ya'll to give me a lap dance. I've never had one before." Thereafter, Complainant stated that she and her colleague walked out of the SWYB area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[G]iven the nature of the comments we do find that a nexus to Complainant's sex has been shown. Complainant states that Acting MDO "would not have made sexual remarks to members of the same sex as himself." Moreover, Complainant asserts that "he targeted us as females who were under his authority" and "did not seem to think that it was inappropriate or unwelcome."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further noted in <span class="Italic">Stephani G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142877 (2016), that after-the-fact evidence that the harassment was not repeated or that others had not complained of harassment is not relevant to the question of whether the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to state a claim, but it will inform the Commission as to the ultimate question of liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also reasoned that there was no evidence that the Acting MDO's conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive that it unreasonably interfered with Complainant's work environment and/or created an intimidating, hostile or offensive workplace. The Agency emphasizes that there have not been additional incidents with the Acting MDO, and that other employees have not complained about his remarks. However, we find the management official's remarks, referring to Complainant as "Flo's bitches" and asking for a lap dance, would unreasonably interfere with the work environment of a reasonable person in Complainant's position. Based on the instant record, we find that Complainant has established prong (4).</p>

Postmaster General</span>, 0120161917 (2016) (characterizing as a "few isolated incidents" complainant's allegations that on two occasions her supervisor yelled at her in front of coworkers and at "some point in the past" commented that he "hates women"; unaccompanied by a concrete agency action, the complainant's allegations were insufficient to state a claim of harassment). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Majorie J. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120151103 (2017) (a single incident where employees were allowed to celebrate the transfer of a female supervisor and serve a cake inscribed "The b**** is gone" was not severe conduct).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Rich P. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2021003273 (2021), found that a single comment--"ladies first and that does not include you"--directed at a male, LGBTQ+ subordinate, did not constitute actionable harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we have generally found that allegations of isolated incidents of alleged harassment are not sufficient to state a viable harassment claim, we have concluded that a limited number of highly offensive slurs or comments may in fact state a claim or support a finding of discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Couch v. Dep't of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131136 (Aug. 13, 2013) (the term "fag" or "faggot" is sufficiently severe to state a claim of harassment because it was historically used in the United States as a highly offensive, insulting and degrading sex-based epithet against LGBTQ+ individuals or individuals who are perceived as failing to conform to gender stereotypes); <span class="Italic">Bryon F. v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120133382 (Feb. 11, 2015) (allegation that complainant's coworker called him a "homo" and told him that he was "living in sin and would be going to hell" sufficiently severe to state a claim of sex-based harassment because of the "hateful nature" of the comments, coupled with the lack of management response).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that AD's comment was tantamount to calling him a "faggot" by publicly singling him out based on his sexual orientation in front of others in a manner that caused him emotional harm. Complainant also alleged that AD subjected him to additional harassment when he couched his apologies with explanations that attempted to validate the comment and indications that Complainant was offended because of Complainant's own misunderstanding of the intent, rather than the comment itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we do not question that Complainant was deeply offended by the "ladies first" comment and subsequent apologies, this was an isolated event with no allegations of impropriety by AD prior to the comment. We conclude that Complainant's claim lacks the requisite severity necessary to state a viable claim involving a single incident. Unlike past cases, where complainants were subjected to denigrating language specific to LGBTQ+ status and gender, the comment in this instance was a single fleeting remark without an overt reference to Complainant's sexual orientation or gender identity. As inadequate as Complainant may <span id="Page_838"></span>have found AD's apologies, he does not allege any further harassing or offending incident.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary that the offender direct repeated incidents of sexual harassment at the same individual. One incident could form the basis for a claim of sexual harassment where the complainant further alleges that the offender sexually harassed other female employees and the agency was aware of that fact. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Angeli v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920342 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of the alleged incident, appellant believed that the Postmaster had sexually harassed other employees in the past and that the agency, although aware of these incidents, had taken no action to stop them. According to appellant, the Postmaster closeted himself with her in a small, windowless room. He closed the door to the room, telling appellant that he wanted to be alone with her, that he did not want to be disturbed. When she asked for a union steward to be present, the Postmaster informed her that the matter was between the two of them. Appellant asserted that the Postmaster never told her that the purpose of the meeting was an official discussion until appellant was on her way out the door and already quite upset. She alleged that she interpreted the Postmaster's behavior as a subtle overture that was both uninvited and unwanted. Appellant stated that the Postmaster's actions resulted in her crying and shaking, and otherwise being psychologically and emotionally upset. Appellant filed her complaint because she believed that the Postmaster acted as he did to intimidate and harass her, and that he had behaved in that manner solely because she was a female employee, i.e., he would not have acted similarly with a male employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has established that sexual harassment in the workplace violates Title VII and is actionable as a form of sex discrimination. <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986). Although the agency in its final decision found that nothing of a sexual nature had transpired between the Postmaster and appellant, a determination on the merits of appellant's allegation of conduct in violation of Title VII can only be made by the agency following a thorough investigation and complete processing of appellant's complaint. Moreover, even if the agency's investigation shows that the Postmaster's conduct toward appellant was not sexual in nature, it is well-established that harassment based on sex (gender) which is not sexual in nature also constitutes unlawful discrimination in violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 (D.C. 1985) ("any harassment or other unequal treatment of an employee...that would not occur but for the sex of the employee...may, if sufficiently patterned or pervasive, comprise an illegal condition of employment under Title VII"); <span class="Italic">see also Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co</span>., 833 F.2d 1406, 1416 (10th Cir. 1987). On its face, appellant's complaint has raised a claim of sexual harassment and, in the alternative, a claim of harassment based on gender.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also concluded that appellant had not alleged any personal harm as a result of the incident. We disagree. Appellant stated that the Postmaster's actions upset her so much that she sought medical treatment as a result. Because an employee's state of psychological well-being constitutes a "term, condition, or privilege of employment" within the meaning of Title VII, (see, e.g., <span class="Italic">Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 903 (11th Cir. 1982)), we find that appellant has stated a personal harm or loss that arose directly from the alleged discriminatory behavior. Consequently, the agency erred when it rejected appellant's complaint because she was not aggrieved and therefore had failed to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that appellant is an aggrieved employee within the meaning of the regulations and that she has stated a cognizable claim. Accordingly, we vacate the agency's decision to reject the complaint and remand the complaint to the agency for further processing in accordance with our regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hillier v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120150248 (2016) (one time incident where transgender complainant was not permitted to make a presentation as a female at an agency employee organization meeting; "[w]e find that not allowing someone to dress as the gender with which they identify is severe enough to constitute a hostile work environment, as a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive.").</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission also has found that a series of sexual comments made over the course of a day was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Rizzo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A53970 (2005), the Commission found that comments such as, "I'd do her," "mmmm-mmmm good, good enough to eat," and "my dick-it's getting hard," were not sufficient to create a hostile environment where the comments all allegedly occurred on one day. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120061682 (2007) (holding that a single incident where during a birthday party a male maintenance worker engaged in a "sexually inappropriate dance" was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to state a claim of hostile environment harassment). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Hoodenpyl v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064656 (2007) (single instance where complainant alleged coworker urinated on the driver's door of her vehicle sufficient to state a claim for hostile environment harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps influenced that the agency would have avoided liability through prompt and effective corrective action, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Madrid v. Attorney General</span>, 0120073321 (2008), found the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment where on one day the complainant was subjected to several romantic advances by one of her supervisors. The supervisor asked the complainant to escort him on rounds and then told her to go to his office so he could be alone with her. When she instead went to the staff lounge, the supervisor called her on the phone and told her she was required to follow his order. He also told her how much he loved her, waited for her in the lobby at the end of her shift and accompanied her to the parking lot where she got into a car with her brother. By the next day, the supervisor had left several messages on the complainant's cellphone apologizing for his behavior. The Commission found that the behavior was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment but, in any event, the agency took prompt and effective action in placing the supervisor on another shift where he would not have contact with the complainant. The Commission appeared to place significant emphasis on the supervisor's immediate apologies for his actions in finding the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive.</p>
<p class="noindent">The comments of an investigator looking into allegations of sexual impropriety lodged by an inmate against a corrections officer were found to be sufficiently severe or pervasive in <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Attorney General</span>, 0120093141 (2009). The investigator told the complainant that "'[y]ou're not ugly by no means and you have a target on your back working here.'" The investigator also told the complainant that she was attractive and it would be in the best interest of her and her family for her to resign. The complainant further alleged that she had been made to feel uncomfortable as a woman in her profession and that the agency changed her duty post and denied overtime opportunities after she filed her EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when a single incident is extremely serious, the Commission will look at other factors in evaluating a hostile environment claim. In <span class="Italic">Padin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931775 (1994), the complainant was told, third-hand, of a threat allegedly made against her. The threat involved a nationally publicized incident where several men raped a woman on a barroom pool table at "Big Dan's" in New Bedford, MA. The threat, as related to the complainant, was that if she returned to her former duty post there would be another "Dan's" incident. (For reasons which the Commission does not fully explain, the incident came to be referred to as the "Band" threat.) Although noting the severity of the incident, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Padin</span> found a hostile environment was not created because the alleged threat was related third-hand and did not specifically indicate that the complainant was the target of the threat:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For reasons somewhat different from the agency's, we conclude that appellant has not shown that the "Band" threat subjected her to hostile environment sexual harassment. The agency in determining that there was no hostile environment relied in part on a finding that the "Band" threat was at most an isolated incident. The Commission's position is that even a single incident, if it is unusually severe, is enough to establish a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">See EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment</span>, Notice N-915-050 (March 19, 1990). The extreme seriousness of the alleged "Band" threat, and particularly its violent nature, would cause it to be deemed severe enough to constitute a hostile environment. However, the alleged incident was too remote from appellant to satisfy the above elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. As the Postal Inspection Service concluded, the threat was not made directly to appellant but was rather a second- or third-hand reference to an implied threat. The telephone call as reported in appellant's affidavit, quoted above, suggests that the alleged threat was directed at the female letter carrier in Moosup, while appellant was located in New Haven. We note that the quotation also indicates that the caller told appellant that she feared for appellant's safety, but the language of the threat, as appellant reported it, contains no direct threat toward appellant. Moreover, any connection between appellant and the alleged threat was attenuated even more because the caller apparently did not hear the alleged threat, and was merely reporting what she had been told by another employee. We find that appellant has not shown that she was subjected to a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Wolfe v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01971417 (2000) (an incident of complainant's helicopter panel being drawn with a silhouette of a woman with a male genital by her mouth with the words "[Complainant's] Best Friend" was found sufficient to create a hostile environment); <span class="Italic">Anders v. Postmaster General</span>, 01970893 (2000) (single incident of a supervisor engaging in a sexual act on himself in front of complainant was sufficiently severe to constitute harassment); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11939 (2001) (single incident of supervisor accusing complainant of being lesbian insufficient to rise to the level of a hostile environment).</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, the Commission held that an allegation that the complainant was berated on one occasion where his physical appearance and work knowledge were criticized in front of his subordinates was sufficient to state a claim of hostile environment harassment. In <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01983186 (1999), the Commission relied upon the fact that the complainant also alleged that the criticism undermined his authority as a supervisor in finding the allegations were sufficient to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_839"></span>The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an argument that crotch-grabbing and vulgar language are so prevalent in society today that they could not, as a matter of law, create a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Markham v. White</span>, 172 F.3d 486 (7th Cir. 1999), the court, relying on <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, noted the plaintiff "may well have heard the language and been exposed before to the kinds of images her harassers had used. But the court's opinion makes it clear that it is one thing to know about these things in the abstract, and it is quite another to be the target on a more personal level."</p>
<p class="noindent">In what would seem to present a bit of an enigma, the Commission has held that one incident of sexual harassment can be severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile working environment, but that an agency can avoid liability by taking prompt and effective action to avoid any further harassment. In <span class="Italic">Schott v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953533 (1996), the complainant was accosted by a coworker, who was intoxicated at the time. The coworker held her tightly and pressed his lips and genitals against hers. After finding the conduct occurred and was unwelcome, the Commission determined that the single incident was sufficient to create a hostile environment. However, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Schott</span>, found the agency had taken sufficient remedial action to avoid liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we must address the agency's liability for the conduct at issue. When an employer becomes aware of alleged sexual harassment, the employer has the duty to investigate such charges promptly and thoroughly. EEOC "<span class="Italic">Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex</span>," p. 30; <span class="Italic">see also Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d 251, 255 (employer is on notice of alleged harassment once an employee lodges a complaint and is liable unless it then takes prompt and adequate remedial action); <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 641 F.2d 934, 947 (D.C. Cir 1981) (an employer is responsible for sexual harassment by nonsupervisory employees unless it takes immediate and appropriate action when it learns of the conduct). The employer should not only take immediate and appropriate corrective action to end the harassment, but also make the victim whole by restoring lost benefits and prevent the misconduct from recurring. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The remedial action taken by the agency must be prompt and reasonably calculated to end the harassment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. And, as we have previously observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">What is appropriate remedial conduct will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case--the severity and persistence of the harassment, and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194, at 6-7 (July 8, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the totality of the evidence, we conclude that the agency took such prompt and effective remedial action in the present case. As soon as appellant made her allegations known to the agency, it immediately investigated those allegations. Thereafter, notwithstanding the agency's assessment that appellant's allegations were not sufficiently corroborated to discipline coworker 1 for the incident at issue, it took disciplinary action against coworker 1 for his conduct during the investigation of appellant's allegation and took immediate action to effectively separate appellant and coworker 1 on an on-going basis, which ultimately culminated in coworker 1's detail to another worksite. Clearly, the actions taken by the agency proved effective as there is no evidence of any recurrence of the subject harassment. The record further indicates that posters and policy statements indicating the agency's position that sexual harassment would not be tolerated in the work place were posted throughout the facility communication centers and communicated to both employees and agency management officials. Management officials stated and appellant did not dispute that the subject has been covered in agency service talks. Appellant further does not dispute that she did not see coworker 1 in the work environment for a six week time period after the incident. While appellant asserts that she should have been contacted in person by the Assistant Tour Administrator during the investigation, she does not dispute that her supervisor urged her to submit a statement providing her version of events for that investigation and provided her with ample opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, although appellant indicated her impression that certain agency officials were not sufficiently sensitive to her concerns over the incident, we do not find sufficient evidence that appellant was treated in an insensitive manner. Appellant was clearly asked by her supervisor on at least one subsequent occasion whether coworker 1 had done anything more to offend her. Appellant also admits that her assignment on one occasion to the same machine as coworker 1 was inadvertent and immediately remedied by her supervisor. While appellant claims that her supervisor improperly asked her on occasion if she wanted to switch machine assignments to avoid coworker 1 instead of moving him, the record indicates that he was so moved on numerous occasions. Also, while the agency failed to accede to appellants request for a transfer, coworker 1 was ultimately transferred. Finally, we find that no restoration of lost benefits was required in this case as appellant never informed the agency that she took sick or annual leave or lost other benefits of employment as a result of the harassment incident.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Trina C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142617 (2016) (finding that a one-time incident of a management official grabbing the complainant around the waist and kissing her constitutes "overtly sexual bodily contact that rises to the level of harassment" and holding the agency liable for same). See also the section on "<a href="0100-2023-21-073.html#sec12-66">Overview of Liability for Harassment</a>," later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sztukowski v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01960956 (1997), the Commission found that a single remark was "so disturbing" that it should be considered as part of a pattern of harassment, even where other alleged incidents of harassment were not timely raised. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Sztukowski</span>, found the remark was an implicit threat:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e note that one of the subject incidents, appellant's assertion that in March 1995, her manager told she and three other female employees that they "better not plan on getting pregnant in the near future," is timely raised. Our review of this incident, which was raised as part of allegation 3, indicates that, in the absence of the other untimely raised alleged remarks, it is only one isolated instance of such alleged discriminatory conduct. Normally, one such incident considered on its own would be insufficient to render an individual aggrieved for purposes of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Simon v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900866 (October 3, 1990). However, we find this alleged remark to be so disturbing, in that it represents an allegation of a threat based implicitly on the recipient's gender, that we find that it should be considered in concert with appellant's remaining allegation of discriminatory harassment (allegation 7). Moreover, we are also mindful that appellant has referred to the alleged harassment as continuing on a "daily basis" up until the date of her complaint. Therefore, the agency is directed to identify and consolidate for further processing with allegation 7, the timely aspect of allegation 3, and any specific incidents of alleged sexual harassment which occurred from the 45-day time period prior to appellant's EEO Counselor contact until the date of her formal EEO complaint.</p>
