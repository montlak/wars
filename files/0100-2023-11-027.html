<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-28"><span class="space">4.</span> Posting Requirements</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency is required, by Commission regulations, to post a list of EEO counselors and the time frames for filing EEO complaints. According to 29 CFR 1614.102(b)(7) agencies are required to:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Publicize to all employees and post at all times the names, business telephone numbers and business addresses of the EEO Counselors (unless the counseling function is centralized, in which case only the telephone number and address need be published and posted), a notice of the time limits and necessity of contacting a Counselor before filing a complaint the telephone numbers and addresses of the EEO Director, EEO Officer(s) and Special Emphasis Program Managers.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency demonstrates that it has met the EEOC posting requirements, it does not matter that the employee was actually unaware of the time limit. The complainant will be deemed to have constructive notice of the time limit. The converse also is true. Even where the agency has not posted the required notices, untimely counselor contact will not be excused where the complainant otherwise had knowledge of the time limit. <span class="Italic">Shenkan v. Postmaster General</span>, 2003 WL 21649506 (3rd Cir. 2003) (knowledge imputed to complainant where he was represented by his brother who was an attorney).</p>
<p class="noindent">The location of the poster is important. If the poster is hung in an area to which the complainant does not have access, constructive knowledge will not be imputed. In <span class="Italic">Doria D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019005073 (2019), for example, the complainant alleged that she was constructively discharged. The agency dismissed the complainant for untimely EEO counselor contact, defending the dismissal on appeal with a sworn affidavit that an EEO poster containing the time limits for counselor contact and contact information was posted where the complainant was employed. The complainant countered that she was still at the training academy when she was constructively discharged and never made it to her assigned work area where the poster was displayed. The Commission agreed and reversed the dismissal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has long held that the agency's failure to demonstrate when and how such posting requirements have been met can lead to reinstatement of an otherwise untimely complaint if the employee maintains he was not aware of the time frames. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Malloy v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01830791 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">Over the years, the Commission has become more stringent in requiring agencies to prove that notices were posted, the exact contents of the notice, and the accessibility of those notices. As discussed more fully below, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded a decision of the U.S. Court of <span id="Page_56"></span>Appeals for the Fourth Circuit after the Solicitor General of the United States took the position that the agency should be required to prove the content of its posted notices. Agencies should take particular note of the evidentiary requirement of supporting its decision to dismiss. In <span class="Italic">Pinckey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993836 (2000), the agency suffered the repercussions of failing to meet that requirement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the agency's final decision refers to a poster outlining EEO filing procedures located just outside the agency's Personnel Office. The agency decision also refers to an affidavit from the Human Resources Specialist attesting to the location of this poster. We note that neither the affidavit from the Human Resources Specialist nor a copy of the poster itself was included in the record. In the absence of this evidence, we find that the record is insufficient to impute complainant with constructive knowledge of the time limitations for contacting an EEO Counselor. Thus, the agency has failed to substantiate the bases for its final decision<span class="Italic">. See Marshall v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910685 (September 6, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kendra W. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120152150 (2016) (posting requirements were not met where the agency failed "to provide evidence from someone other than the alleged discriminating official showing that an EEO poster containing the applicable time limits was displayed during the time Complainant was working....").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the agency is required to post EEO information, the Commission has held that the agency is not required to post detailed information about the EEO process. When the information posted includes information about disability discrimination, it is not grounds for waiving time limits that the information did not indicate that a perceived disability can form the basis of a complaint<span class="Italic">. Scafa v. USPS</span>, 01832182 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">At a minimum, EEO information provided to new employees must contain the time limits for the EEO process, location of EEO posters, and location of the EEO Office. In <span class="Italic">Dearstein v. Postmaster General</span>, 05970400 (1997), the Commission found that the EEO information provided by the agency was too superficial to impute knowledge of the EEO process upon the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his request for reconsideration, appellant argues that the information given during the new employee orientation was superficial. Based on the information in the record, the Commission agrees. Merely reading a short paragraph which does not contain information about any time limits, the location of posters, or even the location of the EEO office was insufficient. As appellant points out, this portion of the training was "superficial, overly brief, perfunctory, vague...." There is nothing in the record that shows that appellant was given any materials to go with this portion of the training that would have informed him of time limits or at the least the location of the EEO office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, there is nothing in the record to show that the facility where appellant was employed had the requisite posters on display. The Commission has held that to establish constructive notice an agency must post EEO information containing notice of the time limits for EEO counselor contact and provide independent evidence of record supporting such<span class="Italic">. Pride v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930134 (August 19, 1993). The agency did not respond to appellant's assertion that there were no posters. Rather the agency relies solely on the statement of the HRA. Having found that the information given to appellant during training was inadequate and that there is no evidence that posters were actually on display, the Commission finds appellant's assertion that he was not informed of the procedures for filing an EEO complaint credible, grants appellant's request for reconsideration, reverses the previous decision, and remands the matter for further processing.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mixon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11674 (2002); <span class="Italic">Derian v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11218 (2001) (evidence submitted by the agency must include specific evidence that time limits were posted; mere reference to an EEO poster, without such specific evidence, is not sufficient); <span class="Italic">Farris v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994831 (2001) (no evidence that EEO training included time frames for the complaint process). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Romanition v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12020 (2001) (counselor contact was untimely where the agency produced evidence that the complainant received training on EEO complaint process); <span class="Italic">Gerolamo v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05970634 (1997) (the failure of a temporary employee to read agency materials given to him with EEO information does not excuse untimely contact with the counselor).</p>
<p class="noindent">Keeping notices up to date is important. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120140346 (2014), the Commission reversed dismissal of the complaint for untimely counselor contact where the posted materials listed the facility's EEO manager as a proper contact, but the agency had changed procedures to require contact with the Office of Resolution Management:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that she met with her facility's EEO Officer/Manager (EE01) in November 2012, and was not informed that she would need to contact ORM (Office of Resolution Management) to initiate an EEO complaint. In addition, Complainant submits Agency materials (a copy of the facility's EEO poster and a copy of a portion of the facility's employee handbook) indicating that EE01 is one of the proper contacts to initiate the EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency improperly dismissed Complainant's formal complaint for untimely EEO Counselor contact. We are not persuaded by the Agency's assertion that Complainant's contact in November 2012, with EEO1 does not constitute the date on which Complainant initiated EEO contact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We strongly advise the Agency to consider revising the EEO facility poster and the EEO facility employee handbook at issue to clearly indicate the proper contact for initiating the EEO complaint process. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120140863 (May 6, 2014), we also advised the Agency to consider revising this facility's EEO poster. The complainant in EEOC Appeal No. 0120140863 was the co-worker of the Complainant in the instant matter. We again advise the Agency to consider reviewing all EEO training material used at this facility to ensure that such material clearly indicates the proper contact for initiating the EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to the time limits and procedures, the agency should also provide information about the types of claims covered by the EEO process. In <span class="Italic">Bynog v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120080283 (2008), the Commission determined that the complainant did not have a reasonable belief she was subjected to discrimination when the agency postponed her hire date because she was pregnant, but only had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination several months later when she was advised by a friend that pregnancy discrimination is illegal. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Bynog</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission determines that complainant did not reasonably suspect discrimination until June 2007. In an attachment to her Information for Pre-Complaint Counseling form, complainant stated that "I recently found out from a friend by a brochure that it is illegal to discriminate against pregnant women." In addition, the record contains a copy of the EEO Dispute Resolution Specialist's Inquiry Report. Therein, the EEO Dispute Resolution Specialist stated that complainant claimed that she was discriminated against on June 26, 2007, when "she found out it is illegal to discriminate against a pregnant woman..." The record also contains a letter from complainant to the Commission dated November 19, 2007. Therein, complainant states, in pertinent part, that "[o]n [June 25, 2007], [a named friend] informed me that it was illegal to discriminate against me while I was pregnant. After receiving this information, I proceeded to [go to] EEO) on [June 26, 2007]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission acknowledges that the record reflects that the agency posted copies of the EEO poster containing the applicable time limit at the time complainant started her employment at the agency, March 31, 2007. The record also reflects that complainant attended an orientation for career employees on April 2-April 5, 2007. In addition, the record contains a copy of portions of text from the agency's Orientation for New Employees manual. Therein, the manual advises employees who believe they have been subjected to discrimination to contact the agency's EEO Office within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory incident. However, while the record contains evidence that the agency posted EEO posters and had new employee orientation materials containing the applicable time limit, the record reflects that the agency's EEO posters and orientation materials did not make reference the basis of complainant's claim: pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Commission finds that an agency has failed to support its determination that counselor contact was untimely, the case is remanded with an order to the agency to process the case. An agency will not be permitted, on a request for reconsideration, to submit evidence that was previously available establishing that the complainant had notice of the time limits. <span class="Italic">Sumbler v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A00344 (2002). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120102094 (2010), also rejecting statements in the complaint file about posting of EEO notices where the statements were unsworn.</p>
<p class="noindent">Interestingly, in <span class="Italic">Klag v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01982513 (1999), the Commission held it was not error for the agency still to be using an EEO poster from the days of Part 1613, with a 30-day time limit for counselor contact. The Commission agreed with the agency that any error was harmless because the contact would have been timely if the complainant had adhered to the time limit reflected in the poster.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency cannot rely on EEO training to demonstrate that a complainant was aware of the time limits unless that training specifically addressed the time limits. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hoerr v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A31727 (2003), the Commission found that the agency had not demonstrated that the complainant was aware of the time limit for contacting a counselor because of supervisory EEO training she received. The Commission noted that the training relied upon by the agency had focused on defining sexual harassment and there was no indication that time frames were addressed in the training.</p>
<p class="noindent">Readers should note, however, that the Commission, in its discretion, may waive the time limits even where the agency can show compliance with posting requirements. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Sandra H. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, <span id="Page_57"></span>0120170999 (2017), the Commission excused the complainant's two-week delay where she asked her supervisor about EEO time limits and he responded that he had no knowledge of the process or the applicable time limits. Even though the evidence showed that the agency facility had EEO posters on display setting forth the time limits and that the complainant attended No Fear Act training, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sandra H</span>., held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserts that she was not aware of the 45-day limitation period for seeking EEO counseling, but requested counseling shortly after she was informed by her superior, the Field Chief, that the management investigation into her harassment allegations against the Lieutenant had been closed. We acknowledge that the record reflects that Complainant's facility had EEO posters on display setting forth the applicable time limit and that Complainant attended No Fear Act training. Usually this would be sufficient to find that Complainant had constructive knowledge of the relevant time limitations. However, here Complainant states that she asked the Field Chief about the time limits for the EEO process when he told her the management inquiry was closed and he responded that he had no knowledge of the EEO process or the applicable time limits. We note that the record is devoid of evidence that the Field Chief made any effort to provide any information on the EEO process subsequent to Complainant's request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the specific circumstances of this case, we exercise our discretion in this matter and waive the applicable time limit, noting Complainant's delay was relatively brief (two weeks). EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) provides that all time limits are subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.</p>
