<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-50"><span class="space">A.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">HICKS</span></span> AND THE BURDEN OF PERSUASION</h3>
<p class="noindent">As discussed briefly above, the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of intentional discrimination rests with the complainant. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. For many years, a showing of pretext was the equivalent of a showing of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993), the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, changed that. The best current statement of the law is that a determination that the employer's proffered reason is pretext can result in a finding of discrimination, but such a result is not required as a matter of law. The majority opinion noted that a finding of pretext, especially in conjunction with "a suspicion of mendacity," may be sufficient to support a finding of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Much has been made of the <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> decision. Indeed, both the tone of the majority opinion, as well as the dissent of Justice Souter, are filled with acrimony. In fact, at one point, the majority characterizes the position of the dissent as being "beneath contempt." The decision has also engendered heated debate in the legal community. The debate on the wisdom of the <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> decision aside, the holding of the case must be clearly understood in order to evaluate the actual impact of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> on employment discrimination cases. The discussion of pretext now begins with a detailed analysis of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> was a black corrections officer working in a halfway house who, through a series of promotions, worked his way up to the position of shift commander. After an investigation by the Missouri Department of Corrections and Human Resources, St. Mary's was required to implement extensive administrative reforms, including the replacement of Hicks' immediate supervisor and the superintendent of the halfway house.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although he previously had a satisfactory employment history, Hicks immediately began to experience trouble after the administrative changes. He was disciplined repeatedly in the next several months. Finally, some six months later, he was discharged for threatening his new supervisor during a heated exchange.</p>
<p class="noindent">After a bench trial, the district court found in favor of the employer. The district court specifically found that the employer's proffered reasons for its actions were pretextual and not the real reasons for termination the plaintiff. The court found that the employer had manufactured the confrontation that led to Hicks' removal. "It nonetheless held that respondent had failed to carry his ultimate burden of proving that his race was the determining factor in petitioners' decision first to demote and then to dismiss him. In short, the District Court concluded that 'although [respondent] has proven the existence of a crusade to terminate him, he has not proven that the crusade was racially rather than personally motivated.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2748 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">On review, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The appeals court held that once the plaintiff had established the employer's proffered reasons were pretextual he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. "Because all of defendants' proffered reasons were discredited, defendants were in a position of having offered no legitimate reason for their actions. In other words, defendants were in no better position than if they had remained silent, offering no rebuttal to an established inference that they had unlawfully discriminated against plaintiff on the basis of race." 970 F.2d 487, 492 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas, wrote the majority opinion. Noting that neither party contested the finding below that the plaintiff had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the employer had sustained its burden of articulating a legitimate reason, Justice Scalia wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the nature of things, the determination that a defendant has met its burden of production (and has thus rebutted any legal presumption of intentional discrimination) can involve no credibility assessment. For the burden-of-production determination necessarily <span class="Italic">precedes</span> the credibility-assessment stage. At the close of the defendant's case, the court is asked to decide whether an issue of fact remains for the trier of fact to determine. None does if, on the evidence presented, (1) any rational person would have to find the existence of facts constituting a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and (2) the defendant has failed to meet its burden of production--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, has failed to introduce evidence which, <span class="Italic">taken as true</span>, would <span class="Italic">permit</span> the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. In that event, the court must award judgment to the plaintiff as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)(1) (in the case of jury trials) or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c) (in the case of bench trials). <span class="Italic">See</span> F. James &#x0026; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure &#x00A7; 7.9, p. 327 (3d ed. 1985); 1 Louisell &#x0026; Mueller, Federal Evidence &#x00A7; 70, at 568. If the defendant has failed to sustain its burden but reasonable minds could <span class="Italic">differ</span> as to whether a preponderance of the evidence establishes the facts of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, then a question of fact <span class="Italic">does</span> remain, which the trier of fact will be called upon to answer. (3) If, on the other hand, the defendant has succeeded in carrying its burden of production, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework-with its presumptions and burdens-is no longer relevant. To resurrect it later, after the trier of fact has determined that what was "produced" to meet the burden of production is not credible, flies in the face of our holding in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> that to rebut the presumption "[t]he defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons." 450 U.S., at 254. The presumption, having fulfilled its role of forcing the defendant to come forward with some response, simply drops out of the picture. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 255. The defendant's "production" (whatever its persuasive effect) having been made, the trier of fact proceeds to decide the ultimate question: whether plaintiff has proven "that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [him]" because of his race,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 253. The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons, will <span class="Italic">permit</span> the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination, and the Court of Appeals was correct when it noted that, upon such rejection, "[n]o additional proof of discrimination is <span class="Italic">required</span>," 970 F. 2d, at 493 (emphasis added). But the Court of Appeals' holding that rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons compels judgment for the plaintiff disregards the fundamental principle of Rule 301 that a presumption does not shift the burden of proof, and ignores our repeated admonition that the Title VII plaintiff at all times bears the "ultimate burden of persuasion." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 256); <span class="Italic">Patterson v.

<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;If the finder of fact answers affirmatively-if it finds that the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case <span class="Italic">is</span> supported by a preponderance of the evidence-it <span class="Italic">must</span> find the existence of the presumed fact of unlawful discrimination and must, therefore, render a verdict for the plaintiff. <span class="Italic">See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 254, and n.7 (1981); F. James &#x0026; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7.9, p. 327 (3d ed. 1985); 1 D. Louisell &#x0026; C. Mueller, Federal Evidence &#x00A7; 70, pp. 568-569 (1977). Thus, the <span class="Italic">effect</span> of failing to produce evidence to rebut the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), presumption is not felt until the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case has been <span class="Italic">established</span>, either as a matter of law (because the plaintiff's facts are uncontested) or by the factfinder's determination that the plaintiff's facts are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. It is thus technically accurate to describe the sequence as we did in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>: "First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." 450 U.S., at 252-253 (internal quotation omitted). As a practical matter, however, and in the real-life sequence of a trial, the defendant <span class="Italic">feels</span> the "burden" not when the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is <span class="Italic">proved</span>, but as soon as evidence of it is <span class="Italic">introduced</span>. The defendant then knows that its failure to introduce evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason will cause judgment to go against it <span class="Italic">unless</span> the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is held to be inadequate in law or fails to convince the factfinder. It is this practical coercion which causes the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> presumption to function as a means of "arranging the presentation of evidence," <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 986 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2748-49 (some footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_724"></span>The practical effect of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is that a Title VII plaintiff must present at least some evidence that the employer acted for a discriminatory reason in addition to discrediting the employer's proffered reason. In the absence of such evidence, the factfinder is free, though not required, to find that the employer is being dishonest in saying the real reason for its actions is not to hide discrimination, but for some other reason. In <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, that reason was provided by the District Court in the form of its finding that the "crusade to terminate him" was conducted for reasons that were personal and not because of his race or color. It was not clear that the rationale advanced in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> could be used to overturn a finding of discrimination based solely on pretext without a "suspicion of mendacity."</p>
<p class="noindent">Since <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, some courts have held that, in certain cases, the showing of pretext, standing alone, can be sufficient to carry the plaintiff's ultimate burden of proving discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Saulpaugh v. Monroe Community Hospital</span>, 4 F.3d 134 (2nd Cir. 1993). As discussed below, the Commission has also reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent">The majority did not address the form of the evidence of discriminatory intent or establish any parameters that attempt to define the quantity of that evidence. Specifically, the majority did not address whether that evidence of intent must be direct evidence--a proposition that would seem to fly in the face of the entire basis of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> that direct evidence of discrimination is seldom available--or whether the plaintiff could rely on other forms of indirect evidence, such as a disparity in treatment involving other members of the plaintiff's protected group, or the employer's hiring and promotional practices with respect to the protected group. The majority did note, however, that a showing of pretext, combined with the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, could suffice to meet the plaintiff's burden of persuasion.</p>
<p class="noindent">The remainder of the majority's lengthy opinion in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is a response to the dissent authored by Justice Souter. While the majority characterized itself as merely reaffirming earlier decisions of the Court, such as <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> and <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, Justice Souter, in his dissent, had other thoughts:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Twenty years ago, in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), this Court unanimously prescribed a "sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence" in a Title VII disparate-treatment case, giving both plaintiff and defendant fair opportunities to litigate "in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978). We have repeatedly reaffirmed and refined the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, most notably in <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), another unanimous opinion. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711 (1983); <span class="Italic">Furnco</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. But today, after two decades of stable law in this Court and only relatively recent disruption in some of the Circuits. . .the Court abandons this practical framework together with its central purpose, which is "to sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual question of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 255, n.8. Ignoring language to the contrary in both <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, the Court holds that, once a Title VII plaintiff succeeds in showing at trial that the defendant has come forward with pretextual reasons for its actions in response to a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination, the factfinder still may proceed to roam the record, searching for some nondiscriminatory explanation that the defendant has not raised and that the plaintiff has had no fair opportunity to disprove. Because the majority departs from settled precedent in substituting a scheme of proof for disparate-treatment actions that promises to be unfair and unworkable, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2756-57.</p>
<p class="noindent">Much of the remaining portion of Justice Souter's dissent was less than "respectful":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, a plaintiff alleging disparate treatment in the workplace in violation of Title VII must provide the basis for an inference of discrimination. In this case, as all agree, Melvin Hicks met this initial burden by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was black and therefore a member of a protected class; he was qualified to be a shift commander; he was demoted and then terminated; and his position remained available and was later filled by a qualified applicant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 970 F. 2d 487, 491, and n.7 (CA8 1992). Hicks thus proved what we have called a "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case" of discrimination, and it is important to note that in this context a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is indeed a proven case. Although, in other contexts, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case only requires production of enough evidence to raise an issue for the trier of fact, here it means that the plaintiff has actually established the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to the satisfaction of the factfinder by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 450 U.S., at 253, 254, n.7. By doing so, Hicks "eliminat[ed] the most common nondiscriminatory reasons" for demotion and firing: that he was unqualified for the position or that the position was no longer available. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S., at 254. Given our assumption that "people do not act in a totally arbitrary manner, without any underlying reasons, especially in a business setting," we have explained that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case implies discrimination "because we presume [the employer's] acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors." <span class="Italic">Furnco</span>, 438 U.S., at 577; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S., at 254.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, however, proof of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case not only raises an inference of discrimination; in the absence of further evidence, it also creates a mandatory presumption in favor of the plaintiff. 450 U.S., at 254, n.7. Although the employer bears no trial burden at all until the plaintiff proves his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, once the plaintiff does so the employer must either respond or lose. As we made clear in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, "[I]f the employer is silent in the face of the presumption, the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 254; <span class="Italic">see ante</span> at 7, n.3 (in these circumstances, the factfinder "<span class="Italic">must</span> find the existence of the presumed fact of unlawful discrimination and <span class="Italic">must</span>, therefore, render a verdict for the plaintiff") (emphasis in original). Thus, if the employer remains silent because it acted for a reason it is too embarrassed to reveal, or for a reason it fails to discover, <span class="Italic">see ante</span> at 10-11, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment under <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Obviously, it would be unfair to bar an employer from coming forward at this stage with a nondiscriminatory explanation for its actions, since the lack of an open position and the plaintiff's lack of qualifications do not exhaust the set of nondiscriminatory reasons that might explain an adverse personnel decision. If the trier of fact could not consider other explanations, employers' autonomy would be curtailed far beyond what is needed to rectify the discrimination identified by Congress. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Furnco</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 577-578 (Title VII "does not impose a duty to adopt a hiring procedure that maximizes hiring of minority employees"). On the other hand, it would be equally unfair and utterly impractical to saddle the victims of discrimination with the burden of either producing direct evidence of discriminatory intent or eliminating the entire universe of possible nondiscriminatory reasons for a personnel decision. The Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> reconciled these competing interests in a very sensible way by requiring the employer to "articulate," through the introduction of admissible evidence, one or more "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason[s]" for its actions. 411 U.S., at 802; <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 254-255. Proof of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case thus serves as a catalyst obligating the employer to step forward with an explanation for its actions. St. Mary's, in this case, used this opportunity to provide two reasons for its treatment of Hicks: the severity and accumulation of rule infractions he had allegedly committed. 970 F.2d, at 491.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court emphasizes that the employer's obligation at this stage is only a burden of production, <span class="Italic">ante</span>, at 4, 6; <span class="Italic">see</span> 450 U.S., at 254-255, and that, if the employer meets the burden, the presumption entitling the plaintiff to judgment "drops from the case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 255, n.10; <span class="Italic">see ante</span> at 4. This much is certainly true, but the obligation also serves an important function neglected by the majority, in requiring the employer "to frame the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext." 450 U.S., at 255-256. The employer, in other words, has a "burden of production" that gives it the right to choose the scope of the factual issues to be resolved by the factfinder. But investing the employer with this choice has no point unless the scope it chooses binds the employer as well as the plaintiff. Nor does it make sense to tell the employer, as this Court has done, that its explanation of legitimate reasons "must be clear and reasonably specific," if the factfinder can rely on a reason not clearly articulated, or on one not articulated at all, to rule in favor of the employer. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 258; <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, at 255, n.9 ("An articulation not admitted into evidence will not suffice").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the employer chooses the battleground in this manner, "the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 255. During this final, more specific enquiry, the employer has no burden to prove that its proffered reasons are true; rather, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reasons are pretextual. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 256. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> makes it clear that if the plaintiff fails to show "pretext," the challenged employment action "must stand." 411 U.S., at 807. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff carries his burden of showing "pretext," the court "must order a prompt and appropriate remedy." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Or, as we said in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>: "[The plaintiff] now must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. This burden now merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that [the plaintiff] has been the victim of intentional discrimination." 450 U.S., at 256. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> drives home the point that the case has proceeded to "a new level of specificity" by explaining that the plaintiff can meet his burden of persuasion in either of two ways: "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Aikens</span>, 460 U.S., at 716 (quoting this language from <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>);<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 717-718 (BLACKMUN, J., joined by Brennan, J., concurring); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 287-289 (1989) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (discussing these "two alternative methods" and relying on JUSTICE BLACKMUN's concurrence in <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>). That the plaintiff can succeed simply by showing that "the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence" indicates that the case has been narrowed to <span id="Page_725"></span>the question whether the employer's proffered reasons are pretextual. Thus, because Hicks carried his burden of persuasion by showing that St. Mary's proffered reasons were "unworthy of credence," the Court of Appeals properly concluded that he was entitled to judgment. 970 F.2d, at 492.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court today decides to abandon the settled law that sets out this structure for trying disparate-treatment Title VII cases, only to adopt a scheme that will be unfair to plaintiffs, unworkable in practice, and inexplicable in forgiving employers who present false evidence in court. Under the majority's scheme, once the employer succeeds in meeting its burden of production, "the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework. . .is no longer relevant."<span class="Italic"> Ante,</span> at 7. Whereas we said in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> that if the employer carries its burden of production, "the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity," 450 U.S., at 255, the Court now holds that the further enquiry is wide open, not limited at all by the scope of the employer's proffered explanation. Despite the Court's assiduous effort to reinterpret our precedents, it remains clear that today's decision stems from a flat misreading of <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> and ignores the central purpose of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, which is "progressively to sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual question of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 255, n.8. We have repeatedly identified the compelling reason for limiting the factual issues in the final stage of a <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> case as "the requirement that the plaintiff be afforded a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 258 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, at 256 (the plaintiff "must have the opportunity to demonstrate" pretext); <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 716, n.5; <span class="Italic">Furnco</span>, 438 U.S., at 578; <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S., at 805. The majority fails to explain how the plaintiff, under its scheme, will ever have a "full and fair opportunity" to demonstrate that reasons not articulated by the employer, but discerned in the record by the factfinder, are also unworthy of credence. The Court thus transforms the employer's burden of production from a device used to provide notice and promote fairness into a misleading and potentially useless ritual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority's scheme greatly disfavors Title VII plaintiffs without the good luck to have direct evidence of discriminatory intent. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2757-61 (footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Souter went on to criticize the majority for giving "conflicting signals" about the scope of its holding that a showing of pretext does not compel judgment for a plaintiff but does not preclude such judgment either, and its statements that a plaintiff must show both pretext and that discrimination was the real reason for the employer's actions. He criticized the majority view as rewarding employers who "lie" about the reasons for their actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With no justification in the employer's favor, the consequences to actual and potential Title VII litigants stand out sharply. To the extent that workers like Melvin Hicks decide not to sue, given the uncertainties they would face under the majority's scheme, the legislative purpose in adopting Title VII will be frustrated. To the extent such workers nevertheless decide to press forward, the result will likely be wasted time, effort, and money for all concerned. Under the scheme announced today, any conceivable explanation for the employer's actions that might be suggested by the evidence, however unrelated to the employer's articulated reasons, must be addressed by a plaintiff who does not wish to risk losing. Since the Court does not say whether a trial court may limit the introduction of evidence at trial to what is relevant to the employer's articulated reasons, and since the employer can win on the possibility of an unstated reason, the scope of admissible evidence at trial presumably includes any evidence potentially relevant to "the ultimate question" of discrimination, unlimited by the employer's stated reasons. <span class="Italic">Ante</span>, at 8. If so, Title VII trials promise to be tedious affairs. But even if, on the contrary, relevant evidence is still somehow to be limited by reference to the employer's reasons, however "vaguely" articulated, the careful plaintiff will have to anticipate all the side issues that might arise even in a more limited evidentiary presentation. Thus, in either case, pretrial discovery will become more extensive and wide-ranging (if the plaintiff can afford it), for a much wider set of facts could prove to be both relevant and important at trial. The majority's scheme, therefore, will promote longer trials and more pre-trial discovery, threatening increased expense and delay in Title VII litigation for both plaintiffs and defendants, and increased burdens on the judiciary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to its unfairness and impracticality, the Court's new scheme, on its own terms, produces some remarkable results. Contrary to the assumption underlying the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, that employers will have "<span class="Italic">some</span> reason" for their hiring and firing decisions, <span class="Italic">see Furnco</span>, 438 U.S., at 577 (emphasis in original), the majority assumes that some employers will be unable to discover the reasons for their own personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See ante</span> at 10-11. Under the majority's scheme, however, such employers, when faced with proof of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, still must carry the burden of producing evidence that a challenged employment action was taken for a nondiscriminatory reason. <span class="Italic">Ante</span>, at 3-4, 6. Thus, if an employer claims it cannot produce any evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for a personnel decision, and the trier of fact concludes that the plaintiff has proven his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff. <span class="Italic">Ante</span>, at 7, n.3. The majority's scheme therefore leads to the perverse result that employers who fail to discover nondiscriminatory reasons for their own decisions to hire and fire employees not only will benefit from lying, but must lie, to defend successfully against a disparate-treatment action. By offering false evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason, such an employer can rebut the presumption raised by the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and then hope that the factfinder will conclude that the employer may have acted for a reason unknown rather than for a discriminatory reason. I know of no other scheme for structuring a legal action that, on its own terms, requires a party to lie in order to prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2763-64 (footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting that the minority view was also shared by the EEOC and the United States Solicitor General, who filed an <span class="Italic">amicus</span> <span class="Italic">curiae</span> brief in the case, Justice Souter concluded his dissent by noting that he saw "no reason why Title VII interpretation should be driven by concern for employers who are too ashamed to be honest in court, at the expense of victims who do not happen to have direct evidence of discriminatory intent. . . ." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2766.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Souter's dissent sparked an equally lengthy criticism of the minority by Justice Scalia, who started his defense of the majority position by stating that "[o]nly one unfamiliar with our case-law will be upset by the dissent's alarum" that well-established precedent was being swept aside<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2750. Labeling the dissent's position as an "utterly implausibility," Justice Scalia wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have no authority to impose liability upon an employer for alleged discriminatory employment practices unless an appropriate factfinder determines, according to proper procedures, <span class="Italic">that the employer has unlawfully discriminated</span>. We may, according to traditional practice, establish certain modes and orders of proof, including an initial rebuttable presumption of the sort we described earlier in this opinion, which we believe <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> represents. But nothing in law would permit us to substitute for the required finding that the employer's action was the product of unlawful discrimination, the much different (and much lesser) finding that the employer's explanation of its action was not believable. The dissent's position amounts to precisely this, unless what is required to establish the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is a degree of proof so high that it would, in absence of rebuttal, require a directed verdict for the plaintiff (for in that case proving the employer's rebuttal noncredible would leave the plaintiff's directed-verdict case in place, and compel a judgment in his favor). Quite obviously, however, what is required to establish the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is infinitely less than what a directed verdict demands. The dissent is thus left with a position that has no support in the statute, no support in the reason of the matter, no support in any holding of this Court (that is not even contended), and support, if at all, only in the dicta of this Court's opinions. It is to those that we now turn--begrudgingly, since we think it generally undesirable, where holdings of the Court are not at issue, to dissect the sentences of the United States Reports as though they were the United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The principal case on which the dissent relies is <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>. While there are some statements in that opinion that could be read to support the dissent's position, all but one of them bear a meaning consistent with our interpretation, and the one exception is simply incompatible with other language in the case. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> describes the situation that obtains after the employer has met its burden of adducing a nondiscriminatory reason as follows: "Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." 450 U.S., at 253. The dissent takes this to mean that if the plaintiff proves the asserted reason to be <span class="Italic">false</span>, the plaintiff wins. But a reason cannot be proved to be "a pretext <span class="Italic">for discrimination"</span> unless it is shown <span class="Italic">both</span> that the reason was false, <span class="Italic">and</span> that discrimination was the real reason. <span class="Italic">Burdine's</span> later allusions to proving or demonstrating simply "pretext," <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 258, are reasonably understood to refer to the previously described pretext, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, "pretext for discrimination."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Burdine</span> also says that when the employer has met its burden of production "the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 255. The dissent takes this to mean that the factual inquiry reduces to whether the employer's asserted reason is true or false--if false, the defendant loses. But the "new level of specificity" may also (as we believe) refer to the fact that the inquiry now turns from the few generalized factors that establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to the specific proofs and rebuttals of discriminatory motivation the parties have introduced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the next sentence, <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> says that "[p]lacing this burden of production on the defendant thus serves. . .to frame the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 255-256. The dissent thinks this means that the only factual issue remaining in the case is whether the employer's reason is false. But since in our view "pretext" means <span id="Page_726"></span>"pretext for discrimination," we think the sentence must be understood as addressing the form rather than the substance of the defendant's production burden: The requirement that the employer "clearly set forth" its reasons,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 255, gives the plaintiff a "full and fair" rebuttal opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A few sentences later, <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> says: "[The plaintiff] now must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. This burden now merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 256. The dissent takes this "merger" to mean that the "the ultimate burden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination" is replaced by the mere burden of "demonstrat[ing] that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision." But that would be a merger in which the little fish swallows the big one. Surely a more reasonable reading is that proving the employer's reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in the next sentence <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> says: "[The plaintiff] may succeed in this [i.e., in persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination] either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S., at 804-805." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. We must agree with the dissent on this one: The words bear no other meaning but that the falsity of the employer's explanation is <span class="Italic">alone enough</span> to compel judgment for the plaintiff. The problem is, that that <span class="Italic">dictum</span> contradicts or renders inexplicable numerous other statements, both in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> itself and in our later case-law--commencing with the very citation of authority <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> uses to support the proposition. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> does <span class="Italic">not</span> say, at the cited pages or elsewhere, that all the plaintiff need do is disprove the employer's asserted reason. In fact, it says just the opposite: "[O]n the retrial respondent must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection <span class="Italic">were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision</span>." 411 U.S., at 805 (emphasis added). "We. . .insist that respondent under &#x00A7; 703(a)(1) must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence <span class="Italic">that whatever the stated reasons for his rejection, the decision was in reality racially premised.</span>" <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 805, n.18 (emphasis added). The statement in question also contradicts <span class="Italic">Burdine's</span> repeated assurance (indeed, its holding) regarding the burden of persuasion: "The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." 450 U.S., at 253. "The plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 256. And lastly, the statement renders inexplicable <span class="Italic">Burdine's</span> explicit reliance, in describing the shifting burdens of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, upon authorities setting forth the classic law of presumptions we have described earlier, including Wigmore's Evidence, 450 U.S., at 253, 254, n.7, 255, n.8, James' and Hazard's Civil Procedure,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 255, n.8, Federal Rule of Evidence 301, <span class="Italic">ibid</span>., Maguire's Evidence, Common Sense and Common Law, <span class="Italic">ibid</span>., and Thayer's Preliminary Treatise on Evidence,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 255, n.10. In light of these inconsistencies, we think that the <span class="Italic">dictum</span> at issue here must be regarded as an inadvertence, to the extent that it describes disproof of the defendant's reason as a totally independent, rather than an auxiliary, means of proving unlawful intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, our interpretation of <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> creates difficulty with one sentence; the dissent's interpretation causes many portions of the opinion to be incomprehensible or deceptive. But whatever doubt <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> might have created was eliminated by <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>. There we said, in language that cannot reasonably be mistaken, that "the ultimate question [is] discrimination <span class="Italic">vel non</span>." 460 U.S., at 714. Once the defendant "responds to the plaintiff's proof by offering evidence of the reason for the plaintiff's rejection, the factfinder must then decide" <span class="Italic">not</span> (as the dissent would have it) whether that evidence is credible, but "whether the rejection was discriminatory within the meaning of Title VII." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 714-715. At that stage, we said, "[t]he District Court was. . .in a position to decide the ultimate factual issue in the case, "which is "whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 715 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). The <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> methodology was "'never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic.'" 460 U.S., at 715 (quoting <span class="Italic">Furnco</span>, 438 U.S., at 577). Rather, once the defendant has responded to the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, "the district court has before it all the evidence it needs to decide" not (as the dissent would have it) whether defendant's response is credible, but "whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff." 460 U.S., at 715 (internal quotation marks omitted). "On the state of the record at the close of the evidence, the District Court in this case should have proceeded to this specific question directly, just as district courts decide disputed questions of fact in other civil litigation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 715-716. In confirmation of this (rather than in contradiction of it), the Court then quotes the problematic passage from <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, which says that the plaintiff may carry her burden either directly "'or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.'" 460 U.S., at 716. It then characterizes that passage as follows: "In short, the district court must decide which party's explanation of the employer's motivation it believes." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. It is not enough, in other words, to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination. It is noteworthy that JUSTICE BLACKMUN, although joining the Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, wrote a separate concurrence for the sole purpose of saying that he understood the Court's opinion to be saying what the dissent today asserts. That concurrence was joined only by Justice Brennan. Justice Marshall would have none of that, but simply refused to join the Court's opinion, concurring without opinion in the judgment. We think there is little doubt what <span class="Italic">Aikens</span> meant.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2751-54 (footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Justice Scalia took issue with the dissent's position that employers whose evidence is disbelieved are "liars." He responded to the accusations of the dissent that the majority view rewards employers who are dishonest:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The respondent's argument based upon the employer's supposed lying is a more modest one: "A defendant which unsuccessfully offers a 'phony reason' logically cannot be in a better legal position [<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the position of having overcome the presumption from the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case] than a defendant who remains silent, and offers no reasons at all for its conduct." Brief for Respondent 21; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 11, 17-18. But there is no anomaly in that, once one recognizes that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> presumption is a procedural device, designed only to establish an order of proof and production. The books are full of procedural rules that place the perjurer (initially, at least) in a better position than the truthful litigant who makes no response at all. A defendant who fails to answer a complaint will, on motion, suffer a default judgment that a deceitful response could have avoided. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 55(a). A defendant whose answer fails to contest critical averments in the complaint will, on motion, suffer a judgment on the pleadings that untruthful denials could have avoided. Rule 12(c). And a defendant who fails to submit affidavits creating a genuine issue of fact in response to a motion for summary judgment will suffer a dismissal that false affidavits could have avoided. Rule 56(e). In all of those cases, as under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, perjury may purchase the defendant a chance at the factfinder--though there, as here, it also carries substantial risks, <span class="Italic">see</span> Rules 11 and 56(g); 18 USC &#x00A7; 1621.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent repeatedly raises a procedural objection that is impressive only to one who mistakes the basic nature of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> procedure. It asserts that "the Court now holds that the further enquiry [<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the inquiry that follows the employer's response to the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case] is wide open, not limited at all by the scope of the employer's proffered explanation." Post, at 10. The plaintiff cannot be expected to refute "reasons not articulated by the employer, but discerned in the record by the factfinder." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. He should not "be saddled with the tremendous disadvantage of having to confront, not the defined task of proving the employer's stated reasons to be false, but the amorphous requirement of disproving all possible nondiscriminatory reasons that a factfinder might find lurking in the record." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 11. "Under the scheme announced today, any conceivable explanation for the employer's actions that might be suggested by the evidence, however unrelated to the employer's articulated reasons, must be addressed by [the plaintiff]." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 14. These statements imply that the employer's "proffered explanation," his "stated reasons," his "articulated reasons," somehow exist <span class="Italic">apart from the record</span>--in some pleading, or perhaps in some formal, nontestimonial statement made on behalf of the defendant to the factfinder. ("Your honor, pursuant to <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> the defendant hereby formally asserts, as <span class="Italic">its</span> reason for the dismissal at issue here, incompetence of the employee.") Of course it does not work like that. The reasons the defendant sets forth are set forth "through the introduction of admissible evidence." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S., at 255. In other words, the defendant's "articulated reasons" <span class="Italic">themselves</span> are to be found "lurking in the record." It thus makes no sense to contemplate "the employer who is caught in a lie, but succeeds in <span class="Italic">injecting</span> into the trial an <span class="Italic">unarticulated</span> reason for its actions." Post, at 16, n.13 (emphasis added). There is a "lurking-in-the-record" problem, but it exists not for us but for the dissent. <span class="Italic">If</span>, after the employer has met its preliminary burden, the plaintiff need not prove discrimination (and therefore need not disprove all other reasons suggested, no matter how vaguely, in the record) there must be some device for determining which particular portions of the record represent "articulated reasons" set forth with sufficient clarity to satisfy <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>--since it is only that evidence which the plaintiff must refute. But of course our <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework makes no provision for such a determination, which would have to be made not at the close of the trial but in medias res, since otherwise the plaintiff would not know what evidence to offer. It makes no sense.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2755-56.</p>
<p class="noindent">Clearly, the impact of <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is to make cases of discrimination involving indirect evidence more difficult to prove from the complainant's perspective. It is not <span id="Page_727"></span>clear just how much more difficult it will be to sustain the burden of proof and the analytical formula articulated under <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>. If <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is ultimately read to require complainants to prove that the animus directed toward them is based on discriminatory as opposed to purely personal motives, then complainants will be faced with the nearly impossible prospect of either coming forward with direct evidence of discriminatory intent, or trying to prove a negative, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the animus is not simply personal in nature. If, on the other hand, it is interpreted to only require the complainant come forward with some evidence, including circumstantial evidence, suggesting a discriminatory motive, as opposed to personal animus, then its impact will be considerably less. In order for <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and its progeny to have any continued validity, it seems the latter interpretation should be adopted and intentional discrimination cases will continue to revolve primarily around the showing of pretext. That is the direction in which the Commission has moved over the past few years.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps not surprisingly, on remand, the employer in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> abandoned its argument that the plaintiff was fired for violating rules and argued that he was fired because of personal animosity between him and his supervisor. On that basis, the removal was upheld. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks v. St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, 90 F.3d 285 (8th Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.</span> 530 U.S. 133, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed.2d 105 (2000), the Supreme Court essentially reiterated its findings in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> in the context of an age discrimination case.
