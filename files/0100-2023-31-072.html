<h3 class="h3" id="sec22-69"><span class="space">G.</span> MIXED MOTIVE CASES</h3>
<p class="noindent">In a case where the employee proves discrimination but the agency shows it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination, 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) provides that the employee may receive, as partial relief, an award of attorney fees. When an agency demonstrates that the complainant would not have been selected even in the absence of discrimination, this is sufficient to confer prevailing party status on the complainant even though he receives no personal relief. <span class="Italic">Call v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720070017 (2007). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Renwick v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120112665 (2011) (complainant <span id="Page_2018"></span>presented direct evidence that he did not receive a reassignment because of his accent, but agency presented evidence that it would not have reassigned him in any event because of incidents of sleeping on the job).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby,</span> 506 U.S. 103, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992), allows a court to consider the degree of the employee's success in deciding on the proper amount of attorney fees to award, including whether no fee at all is a reasonable award, the question becomes what effect does <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> have on the award of fees under 5(g)(2)(B), which specifically limits the relief available to the employee but allows an award of fees. The answer to that question has been provided by at least one court in <span class="Italic">Sheppard v. Riverview Nursing Ctr. Inc.</span>, 88 F.3d 1332 (4th Cir. 1996). The jury in that case found that the plaintiff was subject to discrimination, but that the employee would have been laid off even absent discrimination. The defendant argued that, under <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, no award of fees was appropriate. The court, in <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span>, found that an award of fees is not mandatory under 5(g)(2)(B) and that <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> does apply. There was, however, a significant dissent in <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span>, so the question is by no means susceptible to an easy answer. The majority in <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span>, 88 F.3d at 1334-36, concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sheppard then filed a motion requesting attorney's fees of $40,000 and costs of $4,509.74.2 Riverview challenged the fee request, arguing that under <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103 (1992), a civil rights plaintiff who prevails as a technical matter but who receives only nominal damages should not recover any attorney's fees. The district court disagreed, reasoning that <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> was based on 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988, whereas Sheppard's request arose from 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). The latter provision already limits the types of available relief, the court concluded. As a result, hinging the recovery of attorney's fees on the degree to which plaintiffs secure relief would, in the court's view, effectively nullify the availability of fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court apparently believed that an award of attorney's fees was mandatory in mixed-motive cases, and that <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby's</span> concerns with the relationship between the fees and the degree of success achieved in the underlying litigation had no application here. To the contrary, we believe that the award of fees is discretionary under 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), and that concerns of proportionality do play a part in the analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute under which the attorney's fees were awarded in this case, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), provides that a court "may" grant attorney's fees. The word "may" means just what it says: that a court has discretion to award (or not to award) attorney's fees. The terms of &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) make evident that the granting of fees is discretionary rather than mandatory--the provision later states that a court "shall" not award damages or require reinstatement. Plainly, if Congress had wished to require recovery of attorney's fees, it would have provided that courts "shall" grant fees instead of that they "may" do so<span class="Italic">. See Russello v. United States</span>, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983); <span class="Italic">Persinger v. Islamic Republic of Iran</span>, 729 F.2d 835, 843 (D.C. Cir.) ("When Congress uses explicit language in one part of a statute...and then uses different language in another part of the same statute, a strong inference arises that the two provisions do not mean the same thing."), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 881 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the district court appeared to misperceive the discretionary nature of its inquiry, assuming instead that an award of attorney's fees was essentially mandatory. Its analysis of Sheppard's motion for attorney's fees dealt primarily with whether the amount of fees requested was reasonable, not with whether fees should be granted in the first instance. In the court's view, a "wholesale denial of fees...is completely unjustified and flies in the face of the statute making such fees available." <span class="Italic">Sheppard v. Riverview Nursing Centre</span>, 870 F. Supp. 1369, 1381 (D. Md. 1994). But a denial of fees only "flies in the face" of a statute that requires courts to award fees, not a statute, like &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), that leaves the determination to a court's discretion. By its nature, the latter sort of provision contemplates that courts may decide not to grant fees in particular cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision whether to award fees under &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) is thus plainly a discretionary one. We turn now to an examination of the considerations that should inform a court's exercise of that discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. at 103, the Supreme Court discussed the factors that should guide a court's determination of whether to award attorney's fees. In that case, Dale Farrar sought $17 million in damages in a &#x00A7; 1983 action, but ultimately received only one dollar as a nominal award. The district court nevertheless granted him $280,000 in attorney's fees under 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988, which states that a court "may" in its discretion award to a "prevailing party" in a civil rights action a "reasonable attorney's fee." The Supreme Court held that Farrar qualified as a "prevailing party" so as to be eligible for attorney's fees, but that considerations of proportionality should guide the decision whether to award fees. Given the minimal success achieved by Farrar, the Court found, the appropriate fee recovery in the circumstances was "no fee at all." <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 115. The same logic should bar recovery of attorney's fees here, Riverview asserts, because Sheppard only obtained declaratory relief. The district court rejected this argument on the ground that <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> construed 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988, whereas in this case the fee award arises under 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). In our view, however, any difference between the two provisions does not justify disregarding <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>. It is true that <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> examined whether a plaintiff who receives only nominal damages qualifies as a "prevailing party" under &#x00A7; 1988, and that &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) contains no prevailing party requirement. But the Court's discussion of the prevailing party threshold was only one of the decision's two principal elements, dealing solely with whether a particular plaintiff was eligible to receive fees<span class="Italic">. Farrar</span> also addressed a second issue, one that lies at the heart of this case: Assuming that a given plaintiff is eligible to receive attorney's fees, what factors should inform a district court's exercise of its statutory discretion in deciding whether to award fees? With respect to that question, sections 1988 and 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) require similar inquiries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When assessing whether to grant fees, <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> requires that courts consider the relationship between the fees and the degree of the plaintiff's success<span class="Italic">. Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114-16. The district court seemed to be of the view that, because &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) already limits the scope of recovery, <span class="Italic">Farrar's</span> concern with proportionality makes little sense in this context: "Denying recovery of attorney's fees in this situation on the rationale of 'lack of success' would render the statute ineffective and practically meaningless." <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span>, 870 F. Supp. at 1381. Section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) does prohibit any recovery of damages, and so we agree with the trial court that simply comparing the extent of damage recovery with the attorney's fees would amount to an empty exercise. Nevertheless, if denial of fees would invariably render the statute "ineffective" and "practically meaningless," Congress would have written a mandatory provision requiring that attorney's fees be awarded in every case. That it did not do so suggests that Congress was wary of enacting legislation whose benefit injures primarily to lawyers in the form of a substantial fee recovery, even if relief to the plaintiff is otherwise trivial and the lawsuit promotes few public goals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factoring proportionality concerns into the analysis helps guard against this result. In appropriate cases, for instance, courts should consider the reasons why injunctive relief was or was not granted, or the extent and nature of any declaratory relief. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Farrar's</span> concern was not only with whether the extent of recovery accords with the amount of attorney's fees. The decision suggested a more general proportionality consideration as well: whether the public purposes served by resolving the dispute justifies the recovery of fees<span class="Italic">. See Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 121-22. (O'Connor, J., concurring) (a plaintiff's "success might be considered material if it also accomplished some public goal other than occupying the time and energy of counsel, court, and client").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such an analysis should apply here. By definition, an illicit factor will have played some role in cases subject to &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m). But within that category of cases, there are large differences. Some mixed-motive cases will evidence a widespread or intolerable animus on the part of a defendant; others will illustrate primarily the plaintiff's unacceptable conduct which, by definition, will have justified the action taken by the defendant. The statute allows district courts to distinguish among cases that are in reality quite different.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factoring <span class="Italic">Farrar's</span> principles into the analysis under &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) will not suppress the incentive to file Title VII actions. A host of contingencies affects the course of every civil rights lawsuit. There is always the risk that a plaintiff will not prevail on the merits, yet this is not a disincentive to the initiation of Title VII actions. Moreover, because a case generally does not become a mixed-motive or pretext case until after the evidence is developed, <span class="Italic">see Fuller v. Phipps</span>, 67 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (4th Cir. 1995), plaintiffs ordinarily will not know whether their claim implicates &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) at the time of filing suit. And in cases governed by &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), an award of attorney's fees will often be appropriate for the reasons we have already expressed.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in a lengthy dissent in <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span>, 88 F.3d at 1340-43, Judge Michael wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span> does not have any bearing on whether and to what extent a court should grant an award of attorney's fees under section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). And, even if <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> were applicable in mixed-motive cases, that decision would support the conclusion that an award of attorney's fees should be granted under almost all circumstances in which a plaintiff establishes a violation of section 2000e-2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> the Court was asked to decide whether a plaintiff who recovers only nominal damages may still be deemed a prevailing party eligible for an award of attorney's fees. The statute at issue there was the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, as amended, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988, which provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1981a, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title, title IX of Public Law 92-318 [20 USC &#x00A7; 1681 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.], the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 [42 USC &#x00A7; 2000bb <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.], title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 USC &#x00A7; 2000d, <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.], or section 13981 of this title, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than <span id="Page_2019"></span>the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After determining that a party who "wins" her case yet recovers only nominal damages is in fact a "prevailing party" under section 1988, <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 112-14, the Court nonetheless held that under such circumstances "the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 115.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, we are asked to interpret section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), not section 1988. On their faces these sections are quite different. Section 1988 makes clear that "the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party...reasonable attorney's fees as part of costs." (Emphasis added.) Likewise, section 2000e-5(k), the general provision under which a Title VII plaintiff recovers attorney's fees, provides that "the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party...reasonable attorney's fees as part of costs." (Emphasis added.) By contrast, section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) does not provide for the court to award "reasonable" attorney's fees "in its discretion." Of course, section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) contains the word "may," and we usually assume that Congress's use of "may" instead of "shall" indicates that the court has discretion to act. But when, as here, "Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion." <span class="Italic">Russello v. United States</span>, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983). Thus, when the statutory language of section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) is contrasted with the language of section 1988 and section 2000e-5(k)--that is, when one appreciates that Congress omitted both the "in its discretion" and "reasonable" language from section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)--it is clear that Congress intended that a court have less discretion to deny attorney's fees under section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) than it possesses under section 1988 and section 2000e-5(k). Although section 1988 is not part of Title VII, both section 1988 and section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) involve the same subject: the grant of attorney's fees. Also, section 2000e-5(k) is in Title VII, and in fact, it is part of the same statutory section as section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, section 2000e-5), following just four paragraphs after section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). It is therefore evident that Congress intended to leave out the "in its discretion" and "reasonable" language from section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)<span class="Italic">. See ante</span> at 5 ("When Congress uses explicit language in one part of the same statute...and then uses different language in another part of the same statute, a strong inference arises that the two provisions do not mean the same thing.") (quoting <span class="Italic">Persinger v. Islamic Republic of Iran</span>, 729 F.2d 835, 843 (D.C. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 469 U.S. 881 (1984)). To read (as does the majority) section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) to require the same analysis as the Court employed in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> means either that the "in its discretion" and "reasonable" language of section 1988 and section 2000e-5(k) is superfluous or that we can infer from the statutory silence of section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) a level of discretion that does not expressly exist. As a matter of basic statutory construction, I can not accept either of these propositions. Nor did Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Congress's use of the phrase "shall not" in subsection (ii) of section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) does not, as the majority urges, show that Congress, in using the word "may" in subsection (i), intended a court to have the same discretion under section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) as it does under section 1988 and section 2000e-5(k)<span class="Italic">. See ante</span> at 5-6. For one thing, if Congress had used the phrase "may not" in subsection (ii), the court's discretion under that subsection would be just as limited (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, none at all). Also, because in most instances the statutory language of section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) precludes a grant of injunctive relief in a mixed-motive case, Congress's use of the word "may" likely reflects the fact that a court will be unable to grant injunctive relief, not that a court has the same discretion to grant (or deny) attorney's fees under section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) as it does under section 1988 and section 2000e-5(k). In this case, for example, Sheppard did not qualify for the limited form of injunctive relief authorized under section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) because, as the district court recognized, there is "no danger of a continuing violation of the plaintiff's right to be free from illegal discrimination." <span class="Italic">Sheppard v. Riverview Nursing Centre</span>, Inc., 870 F. Supp. 1369, 1374 (D. Md. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the (pre-<span class="Italic">Farrar</span>) case law existing at the time Congress enacted section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), Congress's probable intent was that a court should grant attorney's fees under almost all circumstances in which a plaintiff establishes a violation of section 2000e-2(m). When Congress enacted section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) in 1991, the Supreme Court had recognized on several occasions that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[S]ection [1988] states that the court "in its discretion" may allow a fee, but that discretion is not without limit: the prevailing party "should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Blanchard v. Bergerson</span>, 489 U.S. 87, 89 n.1 (1989) (quoting <span class="Italic">Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc.</span>, 390 U.S. 400, 402 (1968) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>); <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhardt</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983)) (emphasis added). Therefore, the conclusion to draw from Congress's decision not to include the "in its discretion" and "reasonable" language in section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) is that a court should grant attorney's fees under section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) even when "special circumstances" exist that would render a grant of fees "unjust" under section 1988 (or section 2000e-5(k)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The particular "special circumstance" that Congress evidently intended to exclude from a court's consideration when it enacted section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) is the situation where a plaintiff recovers no money damages. Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> confirms this because she makes clear that under <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span> the award of nominal damages is a "special circumstance" making "unjust" the award of any "reasonable" attorney's fee under section 1988:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It goes without saying that, if the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exclusion were to prevent the plaintiff from obtaining prevailing party status, fees would be denied. [<span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S.] at 116. And if the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> victory exclusion is in fact part of the reasonableness inquiry, <span class="Italic">see [id.]</span> at 114, summary denial of fees is still appropriate. We have explained that even the prevailing plaintiff may be denied fees if "'special circumstances would render [the] award unjust."' <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983) (citations omitted). While that exception to fee awards has often been articulated separately from the reasonableness inquiry, sometimes it is bound up with reasonableness: It serves as a short-hand way of saying that, even before calculating a lodestar or wading through all the reasonableness factors, it is clear that the reasonable fee is no fee at all. After all, where the only reasonable fee is no fee, an award of fees would be unjust; conversely, where a fee award would be unjust, the reasonable fee is no fee at all.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 118 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). Under section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), however, there is no "reasonableness inquiry" to make because the word "reasonable" is not found. There are, therefore, no "proportionality" considerations to take into account when deciding whether to grant attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Justice O'Connor also makes clear that if Congress had declared a contrary intent in section 1988, a court would still be required to grant a fee when only nominal damages are awarded:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Of course, no matter how much sense this approach makes, it would be wholly inappropriate to adopt if Congress had declared a contrary intent. When construing a statute, this Court is bound by the choices Congress has made, not the choices we might wish it had made.... Section 1988 expressly grants district courts discretion to withhold attorney's fees from prevailing parties in appropriate circumstances: It states that a court "may" award fees "in its discretion." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988.... [T]he occurrence of a purely technical or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> victory is such a circumstance. Chimerical accomplishments are simply not the kind of legal change that Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 118-19 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, in the light of the statutory language contained in section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), no matter how much sense the majority's approach might make here, it is wholly inappropriate because Congress has declared a contrary intent. The exclusion of the "in its discretion" and "reasonable" language shows that a court should still grant attorney's fees when a successful mixed-motive plaintiff recovers no money damages or obtains no injunctive relief. This only makes sense because section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) expressly precludes a plaintiff from recovering money damages and severely limits a plaintiff's right to injunctive relief. Indeed, in the context of mixed-motive cases, Congress has decided that even though a plaintiffs remedies are severely limited, there is nothing "technical," "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>," or "chimerical" when a plaintiff establishes liability. This is the case because there is nothing "technical," "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>," or "chimerical" about exposing discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Reddy v. Agency for International Development</span>, 0720060022 (2007), the Commission, relying upon MD-110, found that in a mixed-motive case where the complainant received minimal relief and did not prevail on several other counts a reduction of 75% of the lodestar fee was appropriate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that since it was successful in showing that it would have taken the same action absent the discrimination, complainant has not "prevailed" and he is not a prevailing party. The finding that the agency had a "mixed motive" in issuing the performance rating does not negate the fact that complainant is entitled to attorney's fees as a prevailing party. Indeed, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 specifically provides for attorney's fees in mixed-motive cases such as this one. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(g)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant is entitled to attorney's fees as long as he has obtained some relief on the merits of his claim. <span class="Italic">See Farrar v. Hobby,</span> 506 U.S. 103, 112, 113 S. Ct 566, 573 (1992). "In short, a plaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The magnitude of the relief obtained is not dispositive.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The Commission has found that a complainant is a <span id="Page_2020"></span>prevailing party even in situations where only a finding of discrimination and a posting was ordered. <span class="Italic">See McGinnis v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920150 (July 15, 1992). Accordingly, in light of fact that complainant obtained some relief on his complaint, we agree with the AJ's finding that he is a prevailing party for attorney's fees purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By federal regulation, the agency is required to award attorney's fees for the successful processing of an EEO complaint in accordance with existing case law and regulatory standards. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. 1614.501(e) (1) (ii). To determine the proper amount of the fee, a lodestar amount is reached by calculating the number of hours reasonably expended by the attorney on the complaint multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson,</span> 465 U.S. 886 (1984); <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 424 (1983). The circumstances under which the lodestar may be adjusted are extremely limited, and are set forth in EEO Management Directive 110 (November 9, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The party seeking to adjust the lodestar, either up or down, has the burden of justifying the deviation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at p. 11-8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his decision, the AJ went on to address Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Farrar,</span> and the criteria she would use to measure a plaintiffs success in determining the reasonableness of a fee, including (1) the difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought; (2) the significance of the legal issue on which the complainant prevailed; and (3) the public purpose served by the litigation. In examining these factors, the AJ determined that the lodestar should be reduced by 80% because of the limited success achieved, and the reasonableness of certain fees. However, the AJ also noted that a public purpose was served by this litigation, which revealed much ignorance on the part of agency officials as to the rights of those who have engaged in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant, on appeal, argues that the adjustment should be no more than 75% of the lodestar figure. Indeed, the Management Directive 110 states that any adjustment should be no more than 75% of the lodestar figure. MD-110 at 11-6. The record reveals that complainant was successful on only two out of the eight claims initially brought in his complaint. Accordingly, after a review of the record, and after considering our guidance, as well as the public purpose served by the instant litigation, we modify the AJ's award, and increase it by 5%.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, no fee reduction is warranted solely because in a mixed motive case the agency proves it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0720080024 (2008) (full fees awarded in mixed motive case in which agency prevailed on defense and fee reduced only for filing unwarranted motions).</p>
