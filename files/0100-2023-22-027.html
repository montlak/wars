<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-28"><span class="space">E.</span> ASSOCIATIONAL DISCRIMINATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Second Circuit, sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, in <span class="Italic">Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc</span>., 883 F.3d 100 (2nd Cir. 2018), extended the notion of associational discrimination to sex-based determinations. The Commission has recognized associational discrimination as it relates to race in its <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Race &#x0026; Color Discrimination" at p. 31 and helps to clarify what associational discrimination is:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The law also prohibits discrimination against individuals because of their association with members of a particular race. Specifically, an employer may not discriminate against an individual because of the race of the people the individual associates with in his or her family, professional, social or other circles.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> court found that the "because of...sex" language of Title VII also covers sexual orientation and succinctly explained how the doctrine of associational discrimination supports that finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is "associational discrimination" because "an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is alleging that his or her employer took his or her sex into account by treating him or her differently for associating with a person of the same sex."</p>
<p class="noindent">To further support its holding, the Second Circuit in <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The conclusion that sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination is further reinforced by viewing this issue through the lens of associational discrimination. Consistent with the nature of sexual orientation, in most contexts where an employer discriminates based on sexual orientation, the employer's decision is predicated on opposition to romantic association between particular sexes. For example, when an employer fires a gay man based on the belief that men should not be attracted to other men, the employer discriminates based on the employee's own sex. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin</span>, 2015 WL 4397641, at *6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Court recognized associational discrimination as a violation of Title VII in <span class="Italic">Holcomb v. Iona College</span>, 521 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2008), a case involving allegations of racial discrimination. Holcomb, a white man, alleged that he was fired from his job as the assistant coach of a college basketball team because his employer disapproved of his marriage to a black woman. This Court concluded that Holcomb had stated a viable claim, holding that "an employer may violate Title VII if it takes action against an employee because of the employee's association with a person of another race." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 138. Although the Court considered the argument that the alleged discrimination was based on the race of Holcomb's wife rather than his own, it ultimately concluded that "where an employee is subjected to adverse action because an employer disapproves of interracial association, the employee suffers discrimination because of the employee's own race." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 139; <span class="Italic">see also Whitney v. Greater N.Y. Corp. of Seventh Day Adventists</span>, 401 F. Supp. 1363, 1366 (S.D.N.Y. 1975) ("[I]f [plaintiff] was discharged because, as alleged, the defendant disapproved of a social relationship between a white woman and a black man, the plaintiff's race was as much a factor in the decision to fire her as that of her friend.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying similar reasoning, the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits have reached the same conclusion in racial discrimination cases. <span class="Italic">See Tetro v. Elliott Popham Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, &#x0026; GMC Trucks, Inc</span>., 173 F.3d 988, 994-95 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that plaintiff had alleged discrimination where the employer was "charged with reacting adversely to [plaintiff] because of [his] race in relation to the race of his daughter"); <span class="Italic">Deffenbaugh-Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>., 156 F.3d 581, 589 (5th Cir. 1998) ("[A] reasonable juror could find that [plaintiff] was discriminated against because of her race (white), if that discrimination was premised on the fact that she, a white person, had a relationship with a black person."), <span class="Italic">vacated in part on other grounds by Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc</span>., 182 F.3d 333 (5th Cir. 1999) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co</span>., 791 F.2d 888, 892 (11th Cir. 1986) ("Where a plaintiff claims discrimination based upon an interracial marriage or association, he alleges, by definition, that he has been discriminated against because of his race."). Other circuits have indicated that associational discrimination extends beyond race to all of Title VII's protected classes. <span class="Italic">See Hively</span>, 853 F.3d at 349 (majority) (holding that Title VII prohibits associational discrimination on the basis of race as well as color, national origin, religion, and sex); <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Whirlpool Corp</span>., 556 F.3d 502, 512 (6th Cir. 2009) (stating, in the context of a race discrimination case, that "Title VII protects individuals who, though not members of a protected class, are victims of discriminatory animus toward protected third persons with whom the individuals associate" (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)). We agree and we now hold that the prohibition on associational discrimination applies with equal force to all the classes protected by Title VII, including sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This conclusion is consistent with the text of Title VII, which "on its face treats each of the enumerated categories exactly the same" such that "principles...announce[d]" with respect to sex discrimination "apply with equal force to discrimination based on race, religion, or national origin," and vice versa. <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 243 n.9. It also accords with the Supreme Court's application of theories of discrimination developed in Title VII race discrimination cases to claims involving discrimination based on sex. <span class="Italic">See Meritor</span>, 477 U.S. at 63-67 (concluding that claims of hostile work environment, a theory of discrimination developed in the context of race, were equally applicable in the context of sex); <span class="Italic">see also</span> William N. Eskridge, Jr., Title VII's Statutory History and the Sex Discrimination Argument for LGBT Workplace Protections, 127 Yale L.J. 322, 349 (2017) (explaining that the 1972 amendments to Title VII "repeatedly equated the evils of sex discrimination with those of race discrimination").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As was observed in <span class="Italic">Christiansen</span>, "[p]utting aside romantic associations," the notion that employees should not be discriminated against because of their association with persons of a particular sex "is not controversial." 852 F.3d at 204 (Katzmann, C.J., concurring). If an employer disapproves of close friendships among persons of opposite sexes and fires a female employee because she has male friends, the employee has been discriminated against because of her own sex. "Once we accept <span id="Page_1001"></span>this premise, it makes little sense to carve out same-sex [romantic] relationships as an association to which these protections do not apply." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Applying the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Holcomb</span>, if a male employee married to a man is terminated because his employer disapproves of same-sex marriage, the employee has suffered associational discrimination based on his own sex because "the fact that the employee is a man instead of a woman motivated the employer's discrimination against him." <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, 2015 WL 4397641, at *6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this scenario, it is no defense that an employer requires both men and women to refrain from same-sex attraction or relationships. In <span class="Italic">Holcomb</span>, for example, the white plaintiff was fired for his marriage to a black woman. <span class="Italic">See</span> 521 F.3d at 138. If the facts of <span class="Italic">Holcomb</span> had also involved a black employee fired for his marriage to a white woman, would we have said that because both the white employee and black employee were fired for their marriages to people of different races, there was no discrimination "because of...race"? Of course not. It is unthinkable that "tak[ing] action against an employee because of the employee's association with a person of another race," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 139, would be excused because two employees of different races were both victims of an anti-miscegenation workplace policy. The same is true of discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although this conclusion can rest on its own merits, it is reinforced by the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Loving v. Virginia</span>, 388 U.S. 1 (1967). In <span class="Italic">Loving</span>, the Commonwealth of Virginia argued that anti-miscegenation statutes did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because such statutes applied equally to white and black citizens. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 7-8. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that "equal application" could not save the statute because it was based "upon distinctions drawn according to race." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10-11. Constitutional cases like Loving "can provide helpful guidance in [the] statutory context" of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Ricci v. DeStefano</span>, 557 U.S. 557, 582 (2009); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Reva B. Siegel, She the People: The Nineteenth Amendment, Sex Equality, Federalism, and the Family, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 947, 949 (2002) (arguing that, in the constitutional context, "the Supreme Court developed the law of sex discrimination by means of an analogy between sex and race discrimination"). Accordingly, we find that Loving's insight--that policies that distinguish according to protected characteristics cannot be saved by equal application--extends to association based on sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Certain <span class="Italic">amici</span> supporting the defendants disagree, arguing that applying Holcomb and <span class="Italic">Loving</span> to same-sex relationships is not warranted because anti-miscegenation policies are motivated by racism, while sexual orientation discrimination is not rooted in sexism. Although these <span class="Italic">amici</span> offer no empirical support for this contention, amici supporting <span class="Italic">Zarda</span> cite research suggesting that sexual orientation discrimination has deep misogynistic roots. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> Andrew Koppelman, Why Discrimination Against Lesbians and Gay Men is Sex Discrimination, 69 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 197 (1994). But the Court need not resolve this dispute because the <span class="Italic">amici</span> supporting defendants identify no cases indicating that the scope of Title VII's protection against sex discrimination is limited to discrimination motivated by what would colloquially be described as sexism. To the contrary, this approach is squarely foreclosed by the Supreme Court's precedents. In <span class="Italic">Oncale</span>, the Court explicitly rejected the argument that Title VII did not protect male employees from sexual harassment by male co-workers, holding that "Title VII's prohibition on discrimination 'because of...sex' protects men as well as women" and extends to instances where the "plaintiff and the defendant...are of the same sex." 523 U.S. at 78-79. This male-on-male harassment is well-outside the bounds of what is traditionally conceptualized as sexism. Similarly, as we have discussed, in <span class="Italic">Manhart</span> the Court invalidated a pension scheme that required female employees to contribute more than their male counterparts because women generally live longer than men. 435 U.S. at 711. Again, the Court reached this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that some people might not describe this policy as sexist. By extension, even if sexual orientation discrimination does not evince conventional notions of sexism, this is not a legitimate basis for concluding that it does not constitute discrimination "because of...sex."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fallback position for those opposing the associational framework is that associational discrimination can be based only on acts--such as Holcomb's act of getting married--whereas sexual orientation is a status. As an initial matter, the Supreme Court has rejected arguments that would treat acts as separate from status in the context of sexual orientation. In <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. Texas</span>, the state argued that its "sodomy law [did] not discriminate against homosexual persons," but "only against homosexual conduct." 539 U.S. 558, 583 (2003) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Justice O'Connor refuted this argument, reasoning that laws that target "homosexual conduct" are "an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. More recently, in a First Amendment case addressing whether a public university could require student organizations to be open to all students, a religious student organization claimed that it should be permitted to exclude anyone who engaged in "unrepentant homosexual conduct," because such individuals were being excluded "on the basis of a conjunction of [their] conduct and [their] belief that the conduct is not wrong," not because of their sexual orientation. <span class="Italic">Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hastings Coll. of Law v. Martinez</span>, 561 U.S. 661, 672, 689 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Drawing on <span class="Italic">Lawrence and Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic</span>, 506 U.S. 263 (1993), a case brought under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1985(3), the Supreme Court rejected the invitation to treat discrimination based on acts as separate from discrimination based on status. <span class="Italic">Christian Legal Soc</span>., 561 U.S. at 689; <span class="Italic">see also Bray</span>, 506 U.S. at 270 (rejecting the act-status distinction by observing that "[a] tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews"). Although <span class="Italic">amici's</span> argument inverts the previous defenses of policies targeting individuals attracted to persons of the same sex by arguing that Title VII's prohibition of associational discrimination protects only acts, not status, their proposed distinction is equally unavailing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More fundamentally, amici's argument is an inaccurate characterization of associational discrimination. First, the source of the Title VII claim is not the employee's associational act but rather the employer's discrimination, which is motivated by "disapprov[al] of [a particular type of] association." <span class="Italic">See Holcomb</span>, 521 F.3d at 139; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m) (asking whether the protected trait was "a motivating factor"). In addition, as it pertains to the employee, what is protected is not the employee's act but rather the employee's protected characteristic, which is a status. <span class="Italic">Holcomb</span>, 521 F.3d at 139; <span class="Italic">Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2522 (2013) (defining "status-based discrimination," which is "prohibited by Title VII," as "discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin"). Accordingly, associational discrimination is not limited to acts; instead, as with all other violations of Title VII, associational discrimination runs afoul of the statute by making the employee's protected characteristic a motivating factor for an adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we see no principled basis for recognizing a violation of Title VII for associational discrimination based on race but not on sex. Accordingly, we hold that sexual orientation discrimination, which is based on an employer's opposition to association between particular sexes and thereby discriminates against an employee based on their own sex, constitutes discrimination "because of...sex." Therefore, it is no less repugnant to Title VII than anti-miscegenation policies.</p>
