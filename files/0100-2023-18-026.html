<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-26"><span class="space">3.</span> Standards for Exclusion</h4>
<p class="noindent">The general standard for exclusion of any participant is that the conduct is willful and that it is disruptive to the hearing or the hearing process. In addition, a representative may be excluded for failing to follow the orders of the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="noindent">The standards for exclusion are set forth in MD-110 at 7-29 to 7-30:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General standard for exclusion</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A person's conduct is contumacious when it is "willfully stubborn and disobedient." Black's Law Dictionary 330 (6th ed. 1990). Contumacious behavior or disruptive conduct may include any unprofessional or disrespectful behavior; degrading, insulting or threatening verbal remarks or conduct; the use of profanity; or conduct engaged in for the purpose of improperly delaying the hearing. A finding of contumacious conduct or disruptive behavior may be based on a series of disruptive incidents, a pattern of acts, or a single sufficiently obstructive episode. Normally, any pattern should be manifest within a single case. However, the Administrative Judge may take into consideration other improper conduct engaged in by the individual on any previous occasion before that judge, if the Administrative Judge had clearly described the misconduct for the record in the earlier proceeding or the misconduct is otherwise clearly apparent from the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, there may be situations in which a decision to exclude a person may take into consideration prior misconduct before a different Administrative Judge or the Commission. For example, in the first instance of misconduct, the Administrative Judge, in his/her discretion and as part of the sanction, may publicize the sanction to other Administrative Judges or require the sanctioned individual to disclose the sanction to other Administrative Judges. This should be done in appropriate circumstances, taking into account the nature and degree of the misconduct. If the sanctioned individual engages in further improper conduct in a subsequent hearing before the same or a different Administrative Judge, the prior sanction should be considered in determining whether to exclude the individual from the subsequent hearing. To that end, the Administrative Judge also may ask an individual, on the record, to disclose whether or not s/he ever had previously been sanctioned in any way before the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standard for exclusion of representative</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_663"></span>Representatives may also be excluded for refusal to follow the orders of an Administrative Judge or other improper conduct, in addition to "contumacious conduct or misbehavior that obstructs the hearing." Representatives have a special duty to maintain the dignity of the EEO process and to preserve the order and authority of the EEO forum and must act accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If a party's representative engages in repetitive misconduct or conduct justifying exclusion, the Commission also will consider imposing a suspension or disqualification through the procedure described in Section B below. If the representative is an attorney, s/he also may be referred to the appropriate bar association for disciplinary action as provided in section C below.</p>
<p class="noindent">An attorney is required to zealously represent his or her client within the bounds of the law. Of course, there is zealous representation and there is over-zealous representation. In the latter instance, the administrative judge may terminate a hearing because of the contumacious conduct of a party's representative. In <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963827 (1996), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon careful review of the hearing transcript, the Commission finds that, despite repeated warnings, appellant's representative engaged in contumacious conduct of the worst kind: asking questions which the witnesses could not comprehend, then berating the witnesses for failing to answer; repeatedly testifying rather than asking questions; vociferously arguing on the record with the agency representative and the AJ; defying the authority of the AJ with regard to evidentiary rulings and the conduct of the hearing; and threatening the AJ over an evidentiary ruling. Given these circumstances, the Commission finds that the AJ did not abuse his discretion by terminating the hearing and remanding the case to the agency. The Commission notes appellant's contention that he attempted, unsuccessfully, to have his case reassigned to another AJ for a second hearing. However, appellant has not drawn the Commission's attention to any authority in support of his request for a second chance at a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">It should be noted that the sanction of cancelation of the hearing for misconduct by a party's counsel is indeed a harsh one. Absent an indication that the party has authorized or condoned the conduct, a lesser sanction should be imposed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01961505 (1996), the Commission did embrace the general philosophy that dismissal is an improper sanction where the dilatory conduct is on the part of counsel and there is no indication that the complainant played a role in that conduct. In that case, the Commission held that, where the complainant's attorney failed to inform her that he was no longer representing her, thus causing the appellant to miss the prehearing conference, dismissal of her complaint was improper. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant contends that she was never informed by her attorney that he was no longer representing her. Rather, appellant asserts that the attorney told her the prehearing conference was cancelled and would be rescheduled. Appellant has submitted a letter from her attorney's secretary, which states that on the morning of the prehearing conference, the secretary called appellant, per the attorney's instructions, and informed her that the prehearing conference had been cancelled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends she called the administrative judge's office on July 21 and 24, 1995, to inquire about the rescheduling of the prehearing conference. She states she left messages for the administrative judge, but never spoke with her. Appellant has submitted copies of telephone bills verifying these telephone calls. Appellant states she finally reached the administrative judge on August 11, 1995, and explained the circumstances of her failure to appear at the prehearing conference. She stated the judge suggested she contact the bar association. Appellant contends that, to date, her attorney has not returned her telephone calls to explain his role in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon appellant's submissions on appeal, the Commission finds that the agency's decision dismissing her complaints should be vacated and her complaints remanded for further processing. Appellant has submitted adequate evidence to establish that she had been contacted by her attorney's office and told that the prehearing conference had been cancelled. Appellant has also shown that she promptly attempted to contact the administrative judge and find out when the conference would be held, but was unable to get through to the administrative judge until after the case had been remanded back to the agency. Therefore, appellant's apparent failure to prosecute her complaints occurred through no fault of her own. In the interests of equity, the Commission orders the reinstatement of appellant's complaints for further processing. Appellant should be offered another opportunity for a hearing or a final decision on the merits of her complaints without a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complainants would be well advised to note that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> did more than just allege she was the victim of neglect by her counsel. She presented very specific evidence of that neglect and of her own efforts to determine the status of her case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Non-attorneys are held to the same conduct standards as attorneys. In <span class="Italic">Arnold T. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/1120160001.txt">1120160001</a> (2018), for example, the Commission upheld the administrative judge's decision to exclude the complainant's non-attorney representative from the case and suspend him from serving as a representative in any federal sector case that was not pending at the time for 180 days. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Arnold T.</span> described the conduct at issue and the standards for exclusion and suspension:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before disqualifying or suspending a representative, an AJ must give notice of the specific conduct that is the basis for the proposed disqualification, describe the proposed sanction, and give the representative an opportunity to be heard. The AJ may do this through a show-cause order. Where an AJ issues a show-cause order on why a representative should not be suspended or disqualified for improper conduct or refusal to follow orders at the hearing stage, the AJ should certify the matter to the Director, Office of Federal Operations (OFO), for a determination. Separately, or simultaneously, the AJ may issue an order excluding the representative from the hearing process in the matter at issue. MD-110 provides that "[a]n order suspending or disqualifying a representative from future hearings must specify the time period the penalty will be in effect, which must be commensurate with the severity of the conduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the procedural requirements have been met. AJ1 issued an Order to Show Cause that identified the proposed sanctions and the specific conduct giving rise to the proposed sanctions. Respondent had an opportunity to respond to the Order and submitted his response. AJ1 then certified the matter to the Office of Federal Operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with AJ1's finding that Respondent has engaged in contumacious conduct. As AJ1 noted, Respondent engaged in obstructionist behavior regarding depositions. On June 23, 2015, after AJ1 sent Respondent and the Agency attorney an e-mail expressly ruling that depositions may not be scheduled for the days and times when the attorney and witnesses were not available, Respondent sent an e-mail stating that the attorney's request to reschedule depositions was "denied." This was in direct contravention of AJ1's ruling. In addition, Respondent refused to provide a dial-in number to enable the Agency attorney and a witness to participate telephonically, and he rudely stated that they could "participate by telephone with" themselves. He has asserted that the facility for the depositions did not have teleconference capability and that Complainant did not want to pay the costs for the capability. Respondent, however, has not addressed whether or to what extent he would have incurred such costs if he had accepted the Agency attorney's offer to hold the depositions at the Agency's facility. Similarly, although Respondent has asserted that he never said that he planned to use exhibits in the depositions for EEOC Hearing No. 560-2014-00359X, he has not stated that he ever informed the Agency attorney that he did not plan to use exhibits. Moreover, Respondent cancelled the depositions in the present case and in EEOC Hearing No. 560-2014-00359X at the last minute. The record does not support his assertion that he cancelled depositions because of the Agency attorney's alleged misconduct. Instead, the record establishes that Respondent's conduct was defiant and unprofessional.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, Respondent's insulting behavior reveals a fundamental lack of respect for Administrative Judges, the Agency attorney, and the EEO process. His references to AJ's "so-called ruling" and the Supervisory AJ1's "so-called supervisory role" demonstrate his disdain for the AJs' authority. Given that AJ1 expressly stated in her June 23, 2015, e-mail that "[t]his notice constitutes the ruling" on the pending matter, there is no merit to Respondent's apparent assertion that he did not need to obey the ruling because it did not contain a title, caption, and signature. As AJ1 noted, in light of Respondent's uncooperative, disruptive behavior, she had a duty to intervene in the deposition matter. Respondent also treated AJ2 disrespectfully when he argued with her in EEOC Hearing No. 560-2013-00239X. Respondent appears not to understand the difference between strong, effective advocacy and disrespectful, contumacious conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, Respondent treated the Agency attorney with a lack of respect by repeatedly addressing her by her maiden name and refusing to copy her manager on e-mail correspondence. We agree with AJ1's conclusion that Respondent's reference to the attorney's "purported pregnancy. . .causing her a disability" was insulting and that his refusal to send email copies to the manager was disruptive and unprofessional. Further, although Respondent denied that AJ2 directed him to use the Agency attorney's married name, he has not denied that the attorney asked him to do so during the April 28-30, 2015, hearing on EEOC Hearing No. 560-2013-00239X or that he repeatedly mispronounced her maiden name, Respondent continued to refer to the attorney by her maiden name even after AJ1 raised this matter in the Notice and Order. There is no merit to Respondent's assertion that the attorney used her maiden and married names interchangeably. The January 3, 2014, letter that the attorney signed using her maiden name predates the hearing on EEOC Hearing No. 560-2013-00239X; AJ2's April 21, 2015, e-mail also predates the hearing. Respondent submitted a copy of the <span id="Page_664"></span>first page of the June 16, 2015, letter that the attorney sent to him, but he did not submit the second page containing the attorney's signature. Although the reference citation on the first page contains the attorney's maiden name, the attorney signed the letter using her married name. Respondent's deceptive omission of the signature page demonstrates a lack of regard for the truth and is yet another example of his disrespect for the EEO process. To the extent that Respondent is trying to argue that a reference citation supersedes a signature, he is mistaken.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent likewise is mistaken to the extent that he believes that incidents that occurred before other AJs or in the context of other hearings are irrelevant. When determining the propriety of sanctions, an AJ may consider a representative's other improper conduct before that AJ, a different AJ, or the Commission. MD-110 at Chap. 7, &#x00A7; V.A.3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Respondent has alleged that AJ1 was biased and prejudiced against him and that the Supervisory AJ made "disparaging remarks" about his race on "numerous occasions." Respondent has offered no evidence to support these allegations. He has not quoted or described the Supervisory AJ's alleged remarks, and he has not identified the dates or contexts of the alleged remarks. Similarly, Respondent has provided no examples of AJ1's alleged bias. The rulings with which Respondent disagrees do not constitute evidence of bias. There is no merit to Respondent's allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, we find that Respondent has engaged in a pattern of disruptive and willfully stubborn and disobedient behavior. Respondent, as a lay representative, may not be familiar with the rules governing attorney conduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Model Rules of Professional Conduct r.3.5(d) (Am. Bar Ass'n 2015) (attorney shall not "engage in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal"). Nonetheless, all representatives, non-attorneys as well as attorneys, "have a particular responsibility to respect the order and authority of the EEO process." MD-110 at Chap. 7, &#x00A7; V.A. Respondent has not done so. He has treated AJs with scorn rather than respect and has shown a general lack of regard for the EEO process. Respondent's repeated improper conduct--his defiance of AJ rulings, his unprofessional behavior toward AJs, his refusal to address the Agency representative by her legal name and to copy her manager on email correspondence, his pattern of scheduling depositions only to cancel them at the last minute, and his apparent belief that he, rather than the AJ, controls the hearing process--is disruptive and unacceptable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This behavior, when viewed as a whole, constitutes contumacious conduct. In reaching this determination, we recognize a complainant's right to strong and effective advocacy as well as the hearing process's need for proper demeanor and appropriate behavior. A representative whose behavior is contumacious harms the client's case. Accordingly, we conclude that Respondent's repeated improper conduct warrants the imposition of sanctions. The sanctions must be "proportional to the nature and degree of the improper conduct." MD-110 at Chap. 7, &#x00A7; V.A.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, an AJ may exclude a representative from participating in a hearing because of contumacious conduct. MD-110 at Chap. 7, &#x00A7; V.A.; <span class="Italic">see also Anderson v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A31409 (Jan. 23, 2004) (AJ properly cancelled hearing and remanded complaint to agency for decision without a hearing when complainant and her representative failed to comply with AJ's requests for information; decision noted that AJ also had excluded representative from participating in the case because of contumacious conduct); <span class="Italic">cf. Givens v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01841776 (Nov. 12, 1985) (complaints examiner, who excluded complainant's representative from hearing because of contumacious conduct, did not abuse discretion when he terminated hearing and remanded case to agency after complainant declined to continue without representative). We agree with AJ1's conclusion that Respondent has shown no likelihood of correcting his behavior and that exclusion is an appropriate sanction in this case. Although most of the conduct at issue here occurred in writing, rather than in the presence of an AJ, it was sufficiently improper and repetitive that exclusion is warranted. Through his conduct, Respondent has drawn the focus of the hearing process from his client's case to his inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. His conduct has harmed his client. Accordingly, we find that Respondent should be excluded from representing Complainant in the current case for the duration of the hearing process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that disqualification/suspension also is an appropriate sanction. The Commission has upheld the disqualification of a representative for flagrant or repeated misconduct. <span class="Italic">See In the Matter of Sessoms</span>, EEOC Appeal No, 1120060003 (Apr. 7, 2008) (representative disqualified/suspended for 120 days, expandable to 180 days for nonpayment of costs, where representative did not communicate with client for approximately four months; representative filed motions and pre-hearing report, participated in pre-hearing conference, and attended hearing without consulting client; and hearing had to be canceled because client did not appear); <span class="Italic">In the Matter of Szeredy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 11A60001 (June 22, 2006) (representative disqualified/suspended for 60 days, expandable to 90 days for nonpayment of costs, where representative did not appear at scheduled hearing, advised client not to appear, had not appeared at a hearing in another case, and had engaged in improper conduct in two additional cases). Respondent's defiant, obstructionist actions regarding depositions, recurring disrespectful conduct toward Administrative Judges, and repeated insulting behavior toward the Agency attorney warrant his disqualification/suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The length of the proposed disqualification/suspension must be commensurate with the nature and degree of Respondent's misconduct. MD-110 at Chap. 7, &#x00A7; V.B. Given the level and repetitiveness of the misconduct, and in the absence of any indication that Respondent will change his behavior in the near future,5 a significant disqualification/suspension is appropriate. We find that a suspension of 180 days, rather than one year, is appropriate in this case. A 180-day suspension is commensurate with the level of misconduct described in the Order to Show Cause and is sufficient time for Respondent to modify his behavior. Although we have reduced the length of the suspension, we caution Respondent that further disruptive, flagrant misconduct will result in additional sanctions, up to and including permanent disqualification. We strongly urge Respondent "to respect the order and authority of the EEO process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; V.A.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that AJ1's Order applies to disqualification in representing complainants in new cases on appeal to the Office of Federal Operations, however, the sanction is not upheld. All of the cited misconduct occurred before a hearings unit. When improper representational conduct occurs during an appeal, OFO shall issue a show-cause order. MD-110 at Chap.7, &#x00A7; V.B.2. That has not been done here. <span class="Italic">See Sessoms</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 1120060003 (sanction not upheld to extent that show-cause order applied to disqualification from representing parties in new cases on appeal).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we find that Respondent should be excluded from representing Complainant in the current case for the duration of the hearing process. We further find that Respondent should be disqualified/suspended for a period of 180 days from serving as a representative during the EEOC hearings process in any federal sector EEO complaint not presently pending before one of EEOC's field hearings units.</p>
