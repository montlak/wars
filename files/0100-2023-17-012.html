<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-13"><span class="space">4.</span> Waiver of Time Limit</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations, at 29 CFR 1614.403(c), provide that "[i]f a complainant does not file an appeal within the time limits of this subpart, the appeal shall be dismissed by the Commission as untimely." Complainants <span id="Page_569"></span>should take note that the language of subsection 403(c) is mandatory. However, 29 CFR 1614.604(c) provides that all time limits in the Commission's regulations are subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110 at 9-11 explains what a complainant needs to do to avoid dismissal for filing an untimely appeal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an appellant files an appeal beyond the applicable time limits, the Commission may dismiss the appeal. The agency should advise the complainant in its dismissal decision or final order that if s/he files his/her appeal beyond the thirty (30) day period set forth in the Commission's regulations, s/he should provide an explanation as to why his/her appeal should be accepted despite its untimeliness. If the appellant cannot explain why his/her untimeliness should be excused in accordance with &#x00A7; 1614.604, the Commission may dismiss the appeal as untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Philpotts v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01965874 (1997). When an agency decision is ambiguous as to the relief granted, the Commission will extend the time limit for appeal. <span class="Italic">Evans v. Department of Navy</span>, 01841609 (1986). In that case, decided under Part 1613, the agency stated that it would grant appellant a retroactive promotion to a position that spanned three grade levels. However, the agency did not specify which level was being applied. The Commission found it was reasonable for the employee to have filed her appeal within 20 days of determining the grade the agency intended to apply.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, like most agencies, is not lenient in waiving the time limits. To this end, the Commission has stated that the requirement of filing an appeal is not an onerous one, requiring nothing more than a one sentence letter stating the party wishes to appeal. <span class="Italic">Flynn v. Department of Army</span>, 01842242 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">In some cases, it may not become apparent that an appeal is necessary until the time period for filing has expired. For example, in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01873368 (1988), the agency agreed in its final decision to restore the complainant to his former position. It was not until several months later when the agency issued an SF-50 that the complainant became aware that he was not restored to his former grade level. The Commission found the appeal timely, under Part 1613, because it was initiated within 20 days of receipt of the SF-50.</p>
<p class="noindent">Contacting an agency EEO officer within the time period and expressing an intention to appeal does not suffice, if the agency's final decision clearly advises the complainant of where to file the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Lee v. Department of Navy</span>, 01830805 (1983). Requesting the agency to reconsider its final decision similarly does not toll the time period for filing an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01831216 (1984). However, when the appellant files his appeal with the local EEOC District Office instead of the Office of Federal Operations, the appeal was found timely where the district office received the appeal within the applicable period but did not forward it to OFO until after the time period had expired. <span class="Italic">See Silas v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01892692 (1989). A complainant who submits a request for a hearing to the agency instead of filing a notice of appeal with the EEOC may be able to establish equitable grounds for waiving the 30-day appeal period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stapp v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01940060 (1994). In that case, the Commission found the request for a hearing was not, by itself, sufficient for the purposes of initiating an appeal. However, the Commission noted the agency did not inform the complainant of her error until after her appeal period had expired. Because the complainant requested a hearing, this "indicates that appellant was attempting to pursue her case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In addition, the Commission noted the appellant filed her notice of appeal within six days of receiving the agency's notification of her error.</p>
<p class="noindent">The time period for filing an appeal with the Commission is subject to waiver or equitable tolling, but an agency may not waive the time period on behalf of the EEOC. In <span class="Italic">Barelka v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05921060 (1993), the agency agreed that the appeal period would run from receipt of the final agency decision by the complainant's counsel, and not the date of earlier receipt by the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arguments for equitable tolling and waiver are not persuasive. The RTR cites to several court decisions, and to the Commission's regulatory right to exercise its discretion to accept a late appeal, as support for the general propositions that equitable tolling is available and that Title VII as a remedial statute should be liberally construed. The RTR attempts to apply these principles to this case on the grounds that appellant was lulled into inaction by the agency's agreement. The waiver argument, premised on the notion that the agency had the power to waive the time limits, also depends on that alleged agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, any such agreement would have been irrelevant because, as the previous decision correctly noted, agency officials are without authority in the realm of appeals to the Commission. The appeal function is a statutory responsibility of the Commission, and it is the Commission's implementing regulations that govern this function. The Commission has the inherent authority to administer and interpret its regulations governing the time limits for filing appeals with the Commission. Therefore, parties to appeals are not free to make their own adjustments to the Commission's time limits, and any attempted waiver by a party has no effect. Moreover, the Commission in applying its regulations has established the principle, relied on in the previous decision, that appellant's receipt date governs the time limit for filing an appeal. <span class="Italic">Johnston</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (where separate addresses for a complainant and complainant's attorney were provided to the agency); <span class="Italic">Thomas M. Noonan v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910757 (February 4, 1992). The Commission finds no misapplication of established policy in the previous decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the case was decided under Part 1613, and Part 1614 now provides that all time frames are computed from receipt by the attorney, 29 CFR 1614.605(d), the case remains important because agencies cannot agree to waive time limits which apply to Commission actions. It is unclear whether the Commission would have treated the waiver issue differently if the complainant had been unrepresented. Certainly, the better view is that a <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> complainant could be lulled into excusable inactivity by an agency agreement to extend the time frame.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the parties may not agree to extend the time period for filing an appeal, where a complainant relies on the agency's erroneous instructions concerning when to file an appeal, the appeal should be accepted as timely if filed within the time period included in those instructions. <span class="Italic">McGhee v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05960424 (1997) (agency improperly advised complainant that he had 90 days to file an appeal and the appeal was filed 53 days after the final agency decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency misleads a complainant on the necessity of filing an appeal, the time limit will be waived. In <span class="Italic">Harris v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01963748 (1997), the agency's deputy EEO director, in a meeting with the complainant after a final decision was issued, admitted that the complaint was dismissed in error. He told the complainant not to worry about the dismissal, but to begin assembling the evidence in support of her case. The Commission determined this was good cause for waiving the time limit for appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission will generally review explanations provided with untimely appeals to determine if they are reasonable. When there is a deviation from standard procedure, it is reasonable for the complainant to rely on normal procedures. In <span class="Italic">Allen v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910045 (1991), the employee inadvertently lost the agency's final decision, and did not file an appeal until 20 days after receiving a new copy of the decision. In that case, decided under Part 1613, because substantial investigation was required to determine if the employee was in fact aggrieved, the agency issued a final decision dismissing the case for failure to state a claim without first issuing a proposed disposition. The Commission found it was reasonable for the employee to believe that the lost decision was an offer of an informal adjustment meeting and not a final decision, because the informal adjustment meeting would have been the next stage in most complaints. Since the complainant filed her appeal within 20 days of receiving a new final decision, the Commission found there was a sufficient basis for waiving the time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The time limit will be waived when the employee's representative submits a written statement indicating that the agency mailed the final decision to an address the appellant had not lived at for two years and that the agency did not mail a copy of the final decision to the employee's representative. The appeal was accepted as timely under Part 1613 since it was filed within 20 calendar days after actual receipt of the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 01842610 (1986). Similarly, <span class="Italic">In re Correa</span>, 01860076 (1987), the employee demonstrated that the final decision was received by his father and that the employee did not actually receive it until he returned home 10 days later.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Postmaster General</span>, 05960483 (1997), the Commission found that where an unidentified individual at the appellant's residence signed for receipt of the final agency decision, and the agency failed to state that it was relying on the presumption of constructive receipt, equity demanded that her appeal be considered timely:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant contends that an unidentified individual at her residence signed for receipt of the FAD on February 10, 1995, but that she never received or was aware of the document until August 14, 1995. Appellant asks that--under the circumstances--her appeal be considered timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant's arguments and evidence are sufficient to meet the statutory criteria for reconsideration and therefore grants the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission previously has held that receipt of a document at a complainant's correct address by a member of the complainant's household or family of suitable age and discretion constitutes constructive receipt by complainant<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Baunchand v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920389 (May 29, 1992). When a certified U.S. Postal return receipt has been signed by an unidentified individual at the complainant's address on a date certain to indicate delivery of an important document, the Commission has effectively relied on the certified receipt to establish a presumption of constructive receipt of the document by complainant on that date<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Pazinick v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930337 (September 10, 1993). The presumption, however, is rebuttable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Equity demands that a complainant be provided with adequate notice when the presumption of constructive receipt is relied on in a dismissal for untimeliness to provide her with a full and fair opportunity to rebut it<span class="Italic">. <span id="Page_570"></span>See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Fontanella v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940131 (April 10, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her appeal, appellant indicated that "someone at [her] residence" signed for the certified package but that after "question[ing] everyone that was at [her] residence" she still was unable to learn what had occurred. The previous decision did not state that it was relying on a presumption of constructive receipt to find appellant's appeal untimely. Consequently, appellant provided no additional information in this regard in her reconsideration request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's assertions raise the question of whether the individual who signed for the certified package was a member of her household or family and of suitable age and discretion. Further, appellant was not provided with a full opportunity to rebut the presumption of constructive receipt. Under the circumstances, the Commission exercises its discretion under 29 CFR 1614.604(c) and finds appellant's appeal timely. Consequently, the Commission reverses the previous decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">See also Chapter 2, sections on "<a href="0100-2023-10-050.html#sec1-50">Notice of Final Interview</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-11-121.html#sec2-121">Constructive Receipt of Notice</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">In a decision that at first seems overly harsh, the Commission held that emergencies involving complainant's counsel did not constitute good cause for waiving the time limit to file an appeal. In <span class="Italic">Philpotts v. Secretary of Navy, supra</span>, the Commission rejected an appeal that was filed three days late. The Commission found the delay was not excused by the loss of counsel's only paralegal (who had recently been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer) and an emergency which required him to file a brief in federal court. Under the general circumstances set forth, it would seem that the complainant's counsel established good cause for the minimal delay. However, it also is true that the filing of the notice of appeal is not an onerous task and, in all likelihood, could have been completed in a timely fashion even given counsel's emergencies. In declining to waive the time limit, the Commission specifically noted the absence of "further detail or corroborating evidence" to support counsel's excuses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The trend in <span class="Italic">Philpotts</span> was furthered by a decision of the Commission in <span class="Italic">Cardin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965750 (1997). In that case, the Commission declined to waive the time limit for filing an appeal due to the complainant being in federal custody and/or illness on the part of the complainant's counsel. In <span class="Italic">Cardin</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission then received a letter from the appellant's legal representative in September 1996, requesting that the appeal should not be dismissed on timeliness grounds for the following reasons. First, the appellant was being processed by a federal court for return to federal custody for an administrative violation of his community supervision requirements and was unable to handle his own affairs. Second, the appellant's legal representative was unable to file a timely appeal because he had been diagnosed with possible colon/prostate cancer which diagnosis threw him into a state of depression from March through July of 1996.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Cardin</span>, cited the lack of evidence submitted, noting that a "bare assertion, unsupported by appropriate medical evidence of mental or physical incapacity to conduct one's affairs, does not suffice to toll the time limits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant maintains that she was incapacitated during the period for filing an appeal, she must submit evidence of incapacitation. In <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A11594 (2001), the Commission declined to extend the time period where the complainant maintained she was under a great deal of medication during the appeals period but submitted no evidence of actual incapacitation. When evidence is submitted, it must establish that the complainant was "so incapacitated by the condition as to render her physically unable to make a timely filing." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stuart v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54054 (2005) (four-line note from doctor stating that complainant was very ill and had to go to emergency room several times insufficient to waive appeal period). By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Baker v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120080057 (2009), the Commission waived the 30-day period for filing an appeal where the complainant demonstrated that she was hospitalized during the relevant time period with a hypoxic brain injury. See also "<a href="0100-2023-12-030.html#sec3-31">Mental or Physical Incapacity</a>," Chapter 3.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Commission does extend the time period for filing an appeal and sets a date for the complainant to file a statement in support of the appeal, the Commission can subsequently dismiss the appeal if no statement is timely filed. For example, in <span class="Italic">Stark v. Postmaster General</span>, 01997007 (2002), the Commission received a letter from the complainant's attorney some two months after the appeal was due explaining that he had been in an automobile accident and then incarcerated, though he had been released prior to the date the appeal was due. The Commission accepted the appeal and set a November date for the statement in support of the appeal. When the date for the statement to be filed passed and no statement was filed, the Commission subsequently dismissed the appeal without review.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a brief decision on reconsideration, the Commission found that it previously erred in holding that an appellant could have timely filed his appeal prior to the arrival of Hurricane Andrew. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930205 (1993). In its original decision, the Commission noted that the appellant had a full 15 days before the hurricane to file his appeal. On reconsideration, it found that rationale was error because the appellant could not have predicted the arrival of Hurricane Andrew. However, the decision had little positive effect for the appellant because the Commission found he had not established his late filing of the appeal was due to the hurricane, in any event.</p>
<p class="noindent">The same standard is applied to an attorney representing a complainant who contends that family tragedies were responsible for a late-filed appeal. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01991283 (2002), the Commission rejected the attorney's explanation for missing the filing deadline by approximately two weeks:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant's attorney contends that he was unable to timely file the appeal because he suffered the death of one family member and the illness of another during the relevant time period. Further, complainant's attorney maintains that administrative problems within his office led to confusion about the time limits for appealing this matter. Finally, complainant's attorney notes that confusion and depression regarding the personal matters addressed above "wreaked havoc" on his legal practice during the relevant time period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Commission's regulations allow for waiver of time limits, 29 CFR 1614.604(c), there is no indication that complainant's attorney was so incapacitated to the point of being unable to file the notice of appeal in a timely manner<span class="Italic">. See Weinberger v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920040 (February 21, 1992). The Commission is sympathetic with complainant's attorney regarding the difficulties experienced during the relevant time period. However, the Commission determines that he has failed to demonstrate that the events warrant a waiver of the applicable time limits. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency is required to send a copy of its final decision to both the employee and his or her representative. 29 CFR 1614.605(d).</p>
