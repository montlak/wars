<h3 class="h3" id="sec11-15"><span class="space">A.</span> "BOTTOM LINE" CONCEPT</h3>
<p class="noindent">The initial assessment as to whether a test or selection procedure has an adverse impact on a protected group is done using what the Commission refers to as a "bottom line concept," applying the "four-fifths rule." In essence, these two procedures are used to assess whether a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of adverse impact exists. The procedures are explained at 29 CFR 1607.4:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Evaluation of Selection Rates. The "bottom line." If the information called for. . .shows that the total selection process for a job has an adverse impact, the individual components of the selection process should be evaluated for adverse impact. If this information shows that the total selection process does not have an adverse impact, the Federal enforcement agencies, in the exercise of their administrative and prosecutorial discretion, in usual circumstances, will not expect a user to evaluate the individual components for adverse impact, or to validate such individual components, and will not take enforcement action based upon adverse impact of any component of that process, including the separate parts of a multipart selection procedure or any separate procedure that is used as an alternative method of selection. However, in the following circumstances the Federal enforcement agencies will <span id="Page_790"></span>expect a user to evaluate the individual components for adverse impact and may, where appropriate, take enforcement action with respect to the individual components: (1) Where the selection procedure is a significant factor in the continuation of patterns of assignments of incumbent employees caused by prior discriminatory employment practices, (2) where the weight of court decisions or administrative interpretations hold that a specific procedure (such as height or weight requirements or no-arrest records) is not job related in the same or similar circumstances. In unusual circumstances, other than those listed in (1) and (2) above, the Federal enforcement agencies may request a user to evaluate the individual components for adverse impact and may, where appropriate, take enforcement action with respect to the individual component.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to make a preliminary determination that a test or selection procedure has an adverse impact, the Commission employs the "four-fifths rule." The rule is explained at 29 CFR 1607.4, subsection D:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Adverse impact and the "four-fifths rule." A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (4/5) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded. . .as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will generally not be regarded. . .as evidence of adverse impact. Smaller differences in the selection rate may nevertheless constitute adverse impact, where they are significant in both statistical and practical terms or where a user's actions have discouraged applicants disproportionately on grounds of race, sex, or ethnic group. Greater differences in selection rate may not constitute adverse impact where the differences are based on small numbers and are not statistically significant, or where special recruiting or other programs cause the pool of minority or female candidates to be atypical of the normal pool of applicants from that group. Where the user's evidence concerning the impact of a selection procedure indicates adverse impact but is based upon numbers which are too small to be reliable, evidence concerning the impact of the procedure over a longer period of time and/or evidence concerning the impact which the selection procedure had when used in the same manner in similar circumstances elsewhere may be considered in determining adverse impact. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">In the event that no statistics have been kept, the Commission may draw an adverse inference from the failure to keep records if there is an "underutilization of a group in a job category, as compared to the group's representation in the relevant labor market or, in the case of jobs filled from within, the applicable work force." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The proper statistical comparison in adverse impact cases "is between the gender composition of the at-issue jobs and the gender composition of the qualified applicant pool." <span class="Italic">Gray v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01891914 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Hazelwood School District v. United States</span>, 433 U.S. 299, 308 (1977)). In the <span class="Italic">Gray</span> case, the Commission found that the pool of female employees at the entire Army base was not the relevant comparison pool and was "too broad because there are many that did not seek high level positions or who may not be qualified for them."</p>
<p class="noindent">The UGESP sets up a prophylactic approach with respect to adverse impact by requiring agencies to keep records on tests and selections procedures and establishing presumptions that tests or procedures have an adverse impact under certain conditions. Unless a test or selection procedure has been "validated" in accordance with the Commission's regulations, it will be assumed that any adverse impact is discriminatory. 29 CFR 1607.3(A).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">District Council 37 v. New York City Dep't of Parks</span>, 113 F.3d 347 (2nd Cir. 1997), the court held that, under the "bottom line" concept, only dispositive steps of the process can be used to establish an adverse impact. In <span class="Italic">District Council</span>, the plaintiffs in an age discrimination case argued that the district court erred in finding that they could not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> adverse impact case by challenging a nondispositive step of the layoff process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Contrasting the case with findings of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Connecticut v. Teal</span>, 457 U.S. 440 (1982), the court in <span class="Italic">District Council</span>, 113 F.3d at 350-53, upheld the district court explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the close of testimony, plaintiffs asked the district court to instruct the jury as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If you find that the defendants' decision as to which job titles to cut, and how deeply to cut within those titles, had a disparate impact on older workers, then I instruct you that it was no defense for the defendants to assert that older workers were under- or over-represented among those ultimately affected by the layoffs. In other words, I instruct you that the "bottom-line" results of the June 1991 reduction in force are not relevant to whether plaintiffs have shown disparate impact; your inquiry should focus on the employment practice identified by plaintiff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court refused to give the requested instruction, and instead instructed the jury, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As a first step in proving their claim under disparate impact theory, plaintiffs must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a specific or particular employment practice or decision had a significantly disparate impact on Parks Department employees who were aged 40 or older. Plaintiffs claim that the defendants' decisions as to which job titles to cut [and] how deeply to cut within each title had a significantly disparate impact on workers over 40. In determining whether plaintiffs have proven disparate impact by a preponderance [of the] evidence, you may consider the statistical evidence offered by both parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If you find that plaintiffs have identified an employment practice, and have demonstrated that that employment practice had a significantly disparate impact on workers age 40 and above, then plaintiffs have satisfied the first element of proof required under disparate impact and you may move onto the next stage. If you find that plaintiffs have not proved that the defendants' employment practice had a disparate impact on workers over 40, then you must find for defendants on the disparate impact theory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court went on to instruct the jury on other elements of a disparate impact claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict for the Parks Department on the plaintiffs' disparate impact claim. On the jury verdict form, the jury answered "no" to the question whether the Parks Department's choice of which job title to cut and how deeply to cut within each title "had a disparate impact" on employees age 40 and older. Therefore, the jury did not proceed to answer the remaining questions about plaintiffs' disparate impact claim, such as whether the Parks Department presented a nondiscriminatory justification for the layoffs or whether there were alternative means of achieving the Parks Department's budget goals that would have had a lesser disparate impact on older workers. The jury also found for the Parks Department on plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiffs appeal only their disparate impact claim. On appeal, plaintiffs, relying on <span class="Italic">Teal</span>, 457 U.S. at 452-56, contend that the district court committed reversible error when it refused to instruct the jury that if the plaintiffs identified an employment practice that had a significant disparate impact on older workers, the fact that the layoffs were nondiscriminatory at the bottom line was no defense. We conclude that the jury instructions were adequate, and affirm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A plaintiff can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact by showing that at the bottom line, a challenged employment practice had a significant disparate impact on a protected class of which the plaintiff is a member.<span class="Italic"> See Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 490 U.S. 642, 653 &#x0026; n.8 (1989). Therefore, if the plaintiffs here established that the Parks Department's decision had a significant disparate impact on plaintiffs at the bottom line, they would have made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact. However, as is discussed below, this is not the only way the plaintiffs could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Teal</span>, 457 U.S. 440, the State of Connecticut gave a group of its employees a written test and only those employees who received a passing score were eligible for promotion<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 443. Black employees failed the test at a significantly higher rate than white employees, and those black employees who failed the test were ineligible for promotion<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 443-44. However, Connecticut used an affirmative action program to select which employees who had passed the test would actually be promoted<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 444. The bottom line result was that black employees were promoted at a higher rate than white employees<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The black employees who failed the test sued Connecticut for employment discrimination, arguing that the test had a disparate impact on them. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Connecticut argued that there was not a disparate impact because black employees were promoted at a higher rate than white employees at the bottom line<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 452-53.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court rejected Connecticut's argument, stating: "It is clear that Congress never intended to give an employer license to discriminate against some employees on [an illegal basis] merely because he favorably treats other members of the employees' group."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 455. Accordingly, the Court held that employees can make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact by showing that a step in an employment practice had significant disparate impact on a protected class of which the employee was a member, regardless of whether the bottom line was discriminatory<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 452-56; <span class="Italic">see also Waisome</span>, 948 F.2d at 1378 ("An employer may not rely on a bottom-line defense, by that we mean that though parts of the employer's hiring or promotion procedures adversely affected members of a protected group, it may not successfully argue that a sufficient number of protected group members were nevertheless hired or promoted so as to refute proof of disparate impact."); <span class="Italic">Newark Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Town of Harrison</span>, 940 F.2d 792, 800-01 (3d Cir. 1991) ("The teaching of <span class="Italic">Teal</span> is that disparate impact analysis will be used to measure the effect of each component of a selection system.") (emphasis and quotation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiffs contend that under <span class="Italic">Teal</span>, they would have established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact if they established that the first step in the <span id="Page_791"></span>layoff process, the Parks Department's decision as to which job titles to cut and how deeply to cut, had a disparate impact on workers age 40 or over, and that a nondiscriminatory bottom line was no defense to their claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the Parks Department contends that under <span class="Italic">Teal</span>, if the bottom line is nondiscriminatory, a disparate impact claim cannot be made to a step in the layoff process that is "non-dispositive," or in other words, a step that affects an employee, "but that does not in itself create an outright barrier" to that employee receiving consideration under subsequent steps<span class="Italic">. See Koger v. Reno</span>, 98 F.3d 631, 639 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (reserving issue). The Parks Department points out that in <span class="Italic">Teal</span>, the challenged step was a dispositive barrier, as everyone who failed the test would not be considered in subsequent steps. The Parks Department contends that, in contrast here, their first step--the decision as to which job titles to cut and how deeply to cut--was not dispositive of whether plaintiffs would be laid off. Rather, the Parks Department contends that it was the second and third steps in the layoff process that determined whether plaintiffs would be laid off.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court then explained why the Parks Department's interpretation was correct, and how the plaintiffs' case in <span class="Italic">District Council</span>, 113 F.3d at 353-54, was distinguished from <span class="Italic">Teal</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Teal</span> originated in this Circuit, and when we decided the case, we discussed the very argument that the Parks Department now makes. We stated, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Viewing the overall results of [an employment] process ordinarily is a prudent course to pursue, since it places the burden upon the defendant to demonstrate [a legitimate purpose for a challenged practice] only in situations in which courts can determine with some degree of certainty that [an employment process] has discriminatorily denied an employment opportunity to members of a protected class. Where all of the candidates participate in the entire [employment] process, and the overall results reveal no significant disparity of impact, scrutinizing individual [steps] would, indeed, "conflict[ ] with the dictates of common sense." Where, however, an identifiable [dispositive] barrier denies an employment opportunity to a disproportionately large number of [members of a protected class] and prevents them from proceeding to the next step in the [employment] process, a different result must obtain. . . . With respect to the. . .contention that courts should not be burdened with having to evaluate the allegedly disparate impact that an isolated sub-test or question might have had, we think that [the] concern in that regard is justifiable only in connection with cases that might involve a challenge to a disparate "subscore" that was subsumed in a non-disparate, cumulative overall score. While it is difficult to conceive of how. . .a multi-component [employment] process could discriminate in part, but not in the aggregate, without the influence of some affirmative action effort designed to achieve the non-discriminatory overall result, in such a case the multi-component [employment] process would by necessity have to include some internal mechanism that offsets the disparate impact caused by the discriminatory component. [If] all of the candidates in such a process [were] afforded the opportunity to receive the benefit of the offsetting mechanism, however, the overall results of the process should be deemed a fair barometer of the fairness of the process.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Where [an employment] process contains a discriminatory [dispositive] barrier, however, we see little justification for judicial restraint. In the case of [a dispositive] barrier, both the discriminatory component and the affected individuals are readily identifiable. Courts are under an obligation to entertain the claims of individuals who have been victimized by a discriminatory [dispositive] barrier, notwithstanding any belated "corrective" actions taken by the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Teal v. Connecticut</span>, 645 F.2d 133, 138-39 (2d Cir. 1981) (citation omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 457 U.S. 440 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiffs argue that despite our discussion in <span class="Italic">Teal</span>, we decided in <span class="Italic">Waisome</span> that a disparate impact claim can be used to challenge a nondispositive step even when the bottom line was nondiscriminatory. In <span class="Italic">Waisome</span>, an employer decided to conduct promotions, and as part of its creation of a promotion list, the employer gave a written exam, an oral exam and a performance appraisal to those employees who were eligible for promotion<span class="Italic">. Waisome</span>, 948 F.2d at 1372. The written exam served two functions: first, each candidate was required to pass it to move on to the subsequent steps of the promotions process; and second, the scores of those candidates who passed the written exam were combined with the candidates scores from the other steps to arrive at a total score that would determine which candidates would be promoted<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1377.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Black candidates received a low average score on the written exam, and sued alleging that the exam had a disparate impact on them<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1373, 1377. We concluded that the black candidates could make a disparate impact challenge to the exam, and that a nondiscriminatory bottom line was no defense to that challenge. Plaintiffs here argue that the written test that we held the plaintiffs could challenge in Waisome was a nondispositive step, and that we held that a nondispositive step could be challenged despite a nondiscriminatory bottom line.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in <span class="Italic">Waisome</span> we did not hold that the plaintiffs could challenge a nondispositive step. In that case, we held that the plaintiffs could challenge two separate dispositive aspects of the written test: first, that the test excluded candidates from promotion if they failed to receive the official passing score, and second, that the test served as a further dispositive step for those candidates who did not receive a score of 76 (who were then unable to be promoted, no matter how well they performed on the other parts of the promotion tests)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1373, 1377-79. While the test also served as a nondispositive step for those candidates who scored a 76 or higher (those candidates had a chance to be promoted if they did sufficiently well on the other tests), we never held that the plaintiffs could challenge this aspect of the test. Accordingly, we cannot agree that Waisome held that a bottom-line defense may not be asserted with respect to a nondispositive step.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiffs have also argued that even if a step must be dispositive to be challenged, the first step here, the Parks Department's decision to cut the Laborer job title in its entirety, was dispositive because it prevented them from receiving any consideration under subsequent steps. However, although the Parks Department decided to eliminate the Laborer job title at the first step, all Laborers did not lose their jobs within the Parks Department. The Laborers were entitled to "bump" employees from other titles who had less seniority, <span class="Italic">see</span> N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &#x00A7; 80(6) (McKinney 1983), and ten Laborers did bump other employees and thereby retained jobs within the Parks Department. Therefore, even after the Parks Department decided to cut the Laborer job title in its entirety, it is arguable that a second step was still required to determine which Laborers had bumping rights and would therefore be retained; this fact suggests that the Parks Department's decision as to which job titles to cut and how deeply to cut was not a dispositive step. However, the issue is of no consequence. Because we conclude below that the jury instructions were adequate, we do not need to decide whether the first step was dispositive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the issue raised by the parties as to whether a step must be dispositive to be challenged, there is at least one other difference between this case and <span class="Italic">Teal</span> which might distinguish <span class="Italic">Teal</span> from this case. In Teal, an affirmative action program caused the nondiscriminatory bottom line. In contrast here, the laws of the State of New York, which created steps two and three of the layoff process, caused the nondiscriminatory bottom line. Because this distinction was never discussed below, we do not decide what effect, if any, it would have on this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, if plaintiffs had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact--by establishing that the Parks Department's decision as to which job titles to cut and how deeply to cut had a significant disparate impact on employees age 40 and over--then the nondiscriminatory bottom line was no defense to their claim<span class="Italic">. See Teal</span>, 457 U.S. at 452-56; <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co.</span>, 490 U.S. at 653 n.8.</p>
<p class="noindent">It can be difficult for a complainant to get a statistically significant sample because of the small number of decisions within a limited time span. In such cases, the Uniform Guidelines provide that a longer period of time can be used for sampling. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A30650 (2006), the Commission found that the administrative judge erred in granting summary judgment on the complainant's claim that a requirement that attorneys graduate from an ABA accredited law school had an adverse impact on African Americans. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lacy</span>, found that the judge should have permitted discovery on the issue and increased the time period involved:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the requirement that applicants for attorney positions graduate from ABA accredited law schools is the neutral policy that caused complainant to be screened out of the selection process. We find that the AJ's conclusion, that complainant's statistical sample was too small to be significant, was erroneous in light of his discovery rulings which restricted complainant's ability to obtain additional statistics over a longer period of time. According to the UGESP, "where the user's evidence concerning the impact of a selection procedure indicates adverse impact but is based upon numbers which are too small to be reliable, evidence concerning the impact of the procedure over a longer period of time and/or evidence concerning the impact which the selection procedure had when used in the same manner in similar circumstances elsewhere may be considered in determining adverse impact." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1607.4(D). Accordingly, under the UGESP, complainant is entitled to obtain application and selection data from the agency over substantial period of time, if necessary to increase the sample size. In addition, since the selection procedure at issue is applied similarly throughout the USACE, as well as, the Department of the Army, there is no reason why complainant should be restricted from obtaining application and selection data nationwide, or at the very least statewide. Moreover, the AJ improperly relied exclusively on complainant's statistical data rather than considering the entire evidence in the record which supported an <span id="Page_792"></span>inference of disparate impact such that summary judgment was not appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Bazemore v. Friday</span>, 478 U.S. 385,402 (1986) (where the Court held that it was error not to consider the evidence in the record as a whole, in addition to the statistical evidence, in determining whether there was sufficient proof of a pattern and practice of discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we note that the agency is obligated under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1607 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. to maintain data on its selection procedures. Where the agency has not maintained the requisite selection data, the Commission has the authority to draw an adverse inference of the selection process.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1607.4(D). In this case, complainant requested relevant application and selection data from the Huntsville Center, US ACE and the Department of the Army. All information requested is relevant and should have been provided by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Greaser v. Attorney General</span>, 0120103014 (2012), the Commission upheld a finding by its administrative judge that use of a "negative dilute" disqualification on the analysis of urine for drugs did not have a disparate impact on women. The complainant who failed to pass a drug test after a conditional offer of employment demonstrated that men passed the test at a higher rate, but not a statistically different higher rate. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Greaser</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we agree with the AJ's finding that Complainant also failed to establish that women were disparately impacted by the Agency's use of the "negative dilute" finding. In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under a disparate impact analysis, Complainant must show that a challenged practice or policy disproportionately impacted members of her protected class, <span class="Italic">Huber v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120070399 (July 9, 2009). Specifically, Complainant must: (1) identify the specific practice or policy challenged; (2) show a statistical disparity; (3) show that the disparity is linked to a challenged policy or practice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust,</span> 487 U.S. 977, 994-95 (1988)). The burden is on Complainant to show that "the facially neutral standard in question affects those individuals [within the protected group] in a significantly discriminatory pattern." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 329 (1977) and <span class="Italic">citing Gaines v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03990119 (August 31, 2000)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If Complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact, the burden shifts to the Agency to provide a business justification for the challenged action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing Section 105 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (Nov. 21, 1991)). Pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1991, once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the Agency has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the Agency satisfies this burden, Complainant may nevertheless prevail if she identifies an alternative employment practice that would accomplish the same goal with a less adverse impact on her protected class. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find that Complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact as she did not provide sufficient evidentiary or statistical support, showing a statistical disparity, and that the disparity was linked to the challenged policy or practice. Specifically, we find that Complainant failed to show that the Agency's utilizing "negative dilute" findings negatively impacted female applicants more than male applicants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency indicated that Complainant's disparate impact claim was barred as a matter of law. Specifically, the Agency stated and on September 15, 1986, the President issued an executive order entitled "Drug-Free Federal Workplace." Exec. Order No. 12,564, 1986 WL 141872, 51 FR 32889. Pursuant to this order, the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) promulgated its Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs ("Guidelines"). According to the guidelines, agencies were required to perform "specimen validity tests" on all urine samples to ensure that they were unadulterated. Guidelines, Section 3.1. As part of validity testing, agencies must determine whether samples were "dilute." <span class="Italic">See generally</span>, Guidelines, Subpart C. The Agency designated some test results as "negative dilute" in order to ensure that the sample was "a viable human specimen" and not something else. Specimens must be tested for dilution to make sure that donors were not attempting to defeat the test by consuming large volumes of liquid. Although the Agency argued, as above, that Complainant's disparate impact claim improperly challenged HHS' Guidelines, we need not address such in this case since we found no disparate impact regardless.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that the Agency properly provided the data, i.e., the 344 page summary report, dating back to October 1, 2004, which was produced by its drug screening contractor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ indicated that the subject report was the only data containing the gender of the applicants who were drug tested and, thus, it was the most relevant and reliable information available to the Agency. The AJ stated that based on this data, the Agency analyzed the effect of "negative dilute" findings on all females given drug tests for any reason which showed that males passed at the rate of 99 percent and females passed at the rate of 98.6 percent. The AJ indicated that the ratio of the female pass rate to the male pass rate under the "four-fifths rule" was 99.6 percent. We note that under the "four-fifths rule," as set forth in the Commission's Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, "[a] selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (4/5) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1607.4(D). The Agency also analyzed the effect of "negative dilute" findings on female job applicants which showed that males passed at the rate of 98.6 percent and females at the rate of 97.8 percent. The AJ noted that the ratio of female pass rate to the male pass rate under the "four-fifths rule" was 99.2 percent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant contends that the Agency's data was unreliable since not all applicants' gender was clearly designated. However, the Agency states that out of more than 12,000 applicants, there were only ten for whom gender was not determined, and, most importantly, the gender designation was lacking for only one of the 141 "negative diluted" results. Upon review, we agree with the Agency that the purported incompleteness of the Agency's records was so small as to be statistically insignificant. Furthermore, despite Complainant's contentions, the Agency need not prove its "negative dilute" policy was job-related and consistent with business necessity since Complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact. Based on the foregoing, we concur with the AJ's finding of no discrimination.</p>
