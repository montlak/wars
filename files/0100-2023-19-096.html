<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-89"><span class="space">D.</span> DEFINING DIRECT EVIDENCE</h3>
<p class="noindent">Though, at first blush, it might seem obvious, defining direct evidence is not so easy. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Schoonover v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912338 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a mixed motive analysis is indicated where there is direct evidence that discrimination was a motivating factor in the relevant employment decision. <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989). (Footnote omitted.) Direct evidence is "[e]vidence which, if believed, proves the existence of the fact in issue without inference or presumption." Black's Law Dictionary 413-14 (5th ed. 1979); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Randle v. LaSalle Telecommunications, Inc.</span>, 876 F.2d 563, 569 (7th Cir. 1989). One court found direct evidence of age discrimination where there was evidence that an employer wrote and stated that he was looking for a young man to fill the position at issue, and that the employer made comments involving age-based stereotypes. <span class="Italic">Grant v. Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp.</span>, 88 F.2d 1564 (2d Cir. 1989). The Commission has found direct evidence of discrimination for the purposes of this analysis, where there was testimony by more than one witness that a supervisor made racially derogatory comments about the race of complainant and others, and that this discrimination contributed to the challenged employment decision. <span class="Italic">Winnie v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890969 (June 28, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, discriminatory remarks, unrelated to the challenged employment decision, are not direct evidence of intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J. concurring) (these "stray remarks" in the workplace, while perhaps probative of unlawful discrimination, are not direct evidence); <span class="Italic">Randle v. LaSalle Telecommunications, Inc.</span>, 876 F.2d at 569 (7th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Furr v. AT &#x0026; T Technologies, Inc.</span>, 824 F.2d 1537, 1549 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Montgomery Ward &#x0026; Co.</span>, 823 F.2d 793, 797 (4th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Flynt v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01943653 (1996), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Direct evidence is an action or statement of an employer which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude, and which correlates to the challenged act<span class="Italic">. See Caban-Wheeler v. Elsea</span>, 904 F.2d 1549, 1555 (11th Cir. 1990). Once the trier of fact has accepted the direct evidence, liability is established. EEOC Policy Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, No. 915.002, July 14, 1992, Section III. The statement that appellant did not fit in and that she should adjust the manner in which she held her lips in order to get along better with her coworkers directly correlate to appellant's termination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Direct evidence consists of two components. First, the evidence must reflect a discriminatory attitude on the part of the agency. Second, there must be some connection between the statement and the personnel action at issue. For example, in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of State</span>, 01932717 (1994), the Commission found both prerequisites:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the retaliation claim, both parties rely on the probative value of the statement of the unidentified personnel official, with the agency minimizing its evidentiary value to reach the findings in the FAD, and appellant contending that it is dispositive because it is direct evidence. The Commission agrees with appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Direct evidence is an action or statement of an employer which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude, and which correlates to the challenged act<span class="Italic">. See Caban-Wheeler v. Elsea</span>, 904 F.2d 1549, 1555 (11th Cir. 1990). Once the trier of fact has accepted the direct evidence, liability is established. EEOC Policy Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, No. 915.002, July 14, 1992, Section III. The Commission concludes that the comment of the unidentified personnel official, at issue here, constitutes direct evidence. The comment on its face shows that the low-ranking statement was withheld because of appellant's involvement in an "administrative matter." That causal relationship is precisely what is prohibited by Section 704(a) of Title VII, which prohibits taking adverse <span id="Page_761"></span>employment actions against an individual "because" of opposition to discrimination or participation in the EEO process. As noted above, the agency does not contend or show that the administrative matter was anything other than appellant's prior EEO activity, and indeed in its FAD noted her highly visible role in the 1984 EEO investigation. We infer that the administrative matter referred to was appellant's prior EEO activity. Since the comment explicitly states a link between the administrative matter and the withholding of the low-ranking statement, the comment is direct evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520120553 (2013), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the references to the complainant's past EEO activity were merely "oblique" and did not constitute direct evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that statements identified in our previous decision as direct evidence of retaliatory animus are "merely oblique references to the Complainant's work restrictions and or/EEO claim activity." Contrary to the Agency's assertions, S1 's references to Complainant's EEO activity as a basis for Agency actions were not merely oblique. Instead, S1 directly asserted that Complainant should be denied outside employment, denied her request to work from home, and placed her on administrative leave because of her EEO activity. As such, S1 's statements clearly reflect bias against Complainant and are related to claims 3, 7, and 9. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8: Retaliation, EEOC No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998). Therefore, we conclude that our previous decision properly found that Sl's comments about Complainant's EEO activity constituted direct evidence of retaliatory motive.</p>
<p class="noindent">The direct evidence of discrimination must relate to the actions at issue in the complaint, and not other issues. <span class="Italic">See Swerdlik v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01921633 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Swerdlik</span>, a draft version of a proposed disposition of a previous discrimination complaint was not considered direct evidence of discrimination in a later complaint involving different incidents of alleged discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that appellant's allegation that the AJ and the agency applied the incorrect standard of law to her case is without merit. Appellant contends that she produced sufficient direct evidence of discrimination to place the burden of proof on the agency in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Price-Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989). However, the Commission is not persuaded that appellant has proffered "direct evidence" of reprisal discrimination. Appellant submitted a copy of a draft proposed disposition in her sex discrimination claim, in which the agency allegedly found discrimination. However, this decision was never finalized or issued because appellant's sex discrimination complaint was settled. The Commission notes that while the draft PD purports to determine issues of reprisal, it does not appear that appellant actually filed a reprisal complaint in the earlier case. In any event, the alleged incidents of reprisal discussed in the draft PD are not the same incidents at issue in the instant case. The draft PD therefore is not probative of whether the agency discriminated against appellant based on reprisal in the instant case. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the draft PD does not constitute direct evidence of reprisal discrimination sufficient to place the burden of proof on the agency in the first instance. Therefore, the Commission will proceed, as did the AJ, to analyze appellant's complaint under the appropriate standard, found in <span class="Italic">McDonnell-Douglas</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The connection between the statements and the personnel action is demonstrated where the RMO states to the complainant's coworkers that he was going to "get rid of the black son of a bitch" and the complainant is subsequently terminated. <span class="Italic">See Maryland v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01882992 (1989). Similarly, the connection is demonstrated where a supervisor states he will not place an employee on light duty answering the phones because her English is not good enough. <span class="Italic">See Yu v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956772 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Winters v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01966459 (1998), the Commission found the requisite connection where the supervisor told the complainant "she did not need to be promoted because 'Jews already control the banks in the United States,' and that [she] would have to walk on water to be promoted." In <span class="Italic">Franklin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981040 (2001), the Commission found direct evidence of retaliation where there was a notation on a supervisory appraisal form that the complainant had filed too many EEO complaints and demonstrated poor judgment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Elmer C. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120150721 (2018) (finding "potential direct evidence of race discrimination" in a nonselection case where the record contained an undated memorandum from the rating panel with the word "black" handwritten next to the complainant's name but remanding for a supplemental hearing to determine how the notation got there, who wrote it, and why it was written).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the statement the complainant relies upon as direct evidence was made several months in advance of the disputed personnel action does not negate its probative value when there are other indicia that the individual making the statement was involved in the ultimate personnel action. In <span class="Italic">Green v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 07A10090 (2003), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant case involves direct evidence of age discrimination. The Commission finds that S1's statement that he "didn't think [complainant was] ever going to be hired [because] the agency is looking for a younger person" demonstrates a bias against a protected group, and because of S1's participation in the selection process and referral to the selecting official, there is a link to the complained of adverse action<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Revised <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory</span>, (July 14, 1992), Part III.A. 6 ("evidence that the biased remarks were made by the individual responsible for the adverse employment decision or by one who was involved in the decision, along with evidence that the remarks were related to the decision making process, would be sufficient to establish this link"); and fn. 8 ("a link between the evidence of bias and the challenged employment action can be shown if the biased statements were made by the decision maker or one who was involved in the decision, at or around the time the decision was made, even if the biased remarks were not specifically related to the particular employment decision at issue"); <span class="Italic">see</span> e.g., <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Alton Packaging Corp.</span>, 901 F.2d 920, 924, 53 EPD Par. 39,932 (11th Cir. 1990) (manager's statement that if it were his company, "he wouldn't hire any [B]lack people" constituted direct evidence of discrimination in his failure to promote Black plaintiff; argument that statement related to hiring, and therefore did not prove discrimination in failure to promote, rejected); <span class="Italic">Burns v. Gadsden State Community College</span>, 908 F.2d 1512, 1518 n.9, 54 EPD Par. 40,158 (11th Cir. 1990) (decision maker's statement that he refused to hire females for an entire class of positions constituted direct evidence of discrimination in his refusal to hire female plaintiff for one of the positions in that class). The AJ's findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. As such, we find no reason to disagree with the AJ's finding that there was direct evidence of age discrimination and complainant established the agency's discriminatory motive by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency submits that S1's statement that was allegedly made in May 1997, five months before the position was posted in October 1997, was remote, and that S1 had a small role in the selection process. However, S1's statement that the agency is looking for a younger person and his subsequent selection actions are linked because they are both directly related to the employment decision for the GS-13 position. It is noted that S1's statement was in response to AEM's inquiry "when are you guys going to pick [complainant] up again [since] the job was made permanent." Also, S1's actions of drafting the job description, organizing the selection process, designing a portion of the assessment tool, interviewing applicants, convening a conference telephone call, participating in deciding on a selectee, and referring the selectee to the selecting official demonstrates that S1 was involved in the selection decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ledet v. Secretary of HHS</span>, 01941206 (1994), the Commission had an opportunity to illustrate the difference between evidence of a simply discriminatory attitude and direct evidence of discrimination. The issue in the case was whether the agency's decision to fill a position by selecting a candidate from its employee development program (EDP), as opposed to filling the position competitively, was discriminatory. To further complicate the issue, two agency officials each testified that he was responsible for that decision. One of the officials further testified that race was a factor in his decision to promote the successful candidate. The Commission found that the complainant had not presented direct evidence that the agency's action was discriminatory because the second prong of the direct evidence test had not been met. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Ledet</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that because there is direct evidence of discrimination, the Commission should utilize a "mixed motive" analysis, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), rather than the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. At the hearing, the Director of the Office of Enforcement testified that he made the selection for the Director of DCP vacancy and that he was the "key person" responsible for deciding to select a graduate of the EDP. When asked what qualities he found favorable in the Selectee, the Director of the Office of Enforcement answered, in part: "[The Selectee] is a professional person. He is a black male." The following exchange between appellant's counsel and the Director of the Office of Enforcement (Director of OE) also occurred:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Director of OE: I said the fact that he was black was a factor in the decision. The fact that he was a male did not have a factor in my decision. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Appellant's Counsel:. . .You said that being black was a factor in the decision?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Director of OE: Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Appellant's Counsel: In your selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Director of OE: In your selection process. . . .But in my thought processes, if a white male comes out as the best qualified person. . .that is the person I'm going to select. If it turns out that I end up with a tie. . .I made the decision typically to use the sex or the race of the individual as the deciding issue between whether that person would be selected or not selected for the for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the hearing, the Director of the Office of Enforcement also testified that he was the recommending official for the selection at issue in this case and <span id="Page_762"></span>that the Associate Commissioner concurred in that recommendation. The Associate Commissioner testified that it was his decision to not open the vacancy at issue for competition and that ultimately he was the deciding official for the selection. Thus, both the Associate Commissioner and the Director of the Office of Enforcement testified that they each made the decision to make the selection through the EDP program rather than through competition. The administrative judge found that the Associate Commissioner "credibly and persuasively testified that he made the decision about which positions he would use to fulfill the commitment to place EDP graduates." In general, the Commission will not disturb the credibility determination of an administrative judge<span class="Italic">. Pietro v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920533 (Sept. 10, 1992). The credibility determination of an administrative judge is entitled to deference due to her first-hand knowledge through personal observation of the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 340 U.S. 474, 496 (1951)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The testimony by the Associate Commissioner shows that the Associate Commissioner himself made the decision to choose a graduate of the EDP to fill the Director of DCP position and, subsequently, the decision was made to choose the Selectee. If the decision to choose the Selectee from the graduates of the EDP was made on a nondiscriminatory basis, then it does not matter who made the actual selection from the list of EDP graduates because it is uncontroverted that appellant was not an EDP graduate. Although the Director of Office of Enforcement indicated at one instance in his testimony that he made the decision to use the EDP, he also testified that in the selection at issue he made the recommendation of the Selectee and the Associate Commissioner concurred in that decision. It is not fully clear if the Director of Office Enforcement's testimony that he made the "recommendation," refers to the decision to use the EDP program or refers to the ultimate decision of which person should fill the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the Associate Commissioner was the supervisor of the Director of the Office of Enforcement. Furthermore, the testimony by both the Director of the Office of Enforcement and the Associate Commissioner shows that the Associate Commissioner was not merely a "rubber stamp" for the filling of positions at the Director level or the position at issue or for the decision to use graduates of the EDP. The Request for Personnel Action for the Selectee's promotion shows that the Director of the Office of Enforcement requested the action and that the Associate Commissioner authorized the action. Therefore, we see no reason to disturb the administrative judge's credibility determination that the Associate Commissioner credibly testified that he made the decision about which positions he would use to fulfill the commitment to place EDP graduates. We agree with the administrative judge that the evidence shows that the Associate Commissioner was responsible for the decision to fill the vacancy with an EDP graduate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the statements by the Director of Office of Enforcement indicating that the Selectee's race and sex were a factor in his selection are not direct evidence of discrimination in the instant case. The Commission has held that "[d]irect evidence is an action or statement of an employer which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude, and which correlates to the challenged act." <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of State</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932717 (June 10, 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Caban-Wheeler v. Elsea</span>, 904 F.2d 1549, 1555 (11th Cir. 1990)). "Once the trier of fact has accepted the direct evidence, liability is established."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> (citing EEOC Policy Guidance of Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, No. 915.002, Section III (July 14, 1992)). The EEOC Policy Guidance further states that "a link must be shown between the employer's proven bias and its adverse action." EEOC Policy Guidance No. 915.002, Section III(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case the agency action at issue was the decision to use a graduate of the EDP to fill the Director of DCP vacancy. The Commission has determined, in part based on the credibility determination of the administrative judge, that the Associate Commissioner made that decision to fill the vacancy with a graduate of the EDP. Therefore, the testimony by the Director of the Office of Enforcement does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination in the instant case because we have determined that the Director of the Office of Enforcement was not the person who decided to fill the vacancy with an EDP graduate. Therefore, there is no proven link between the Director of the Office of Enforcement's purported bias and the decision to fill the vacancy through the EDP. The Commission finds that the record also does not contain any other evidence which could be construed as direct evidence of discrimination. Therefore, the "mixed motive" case analysis should not be applied because the record does not establish that appellant's race or sex was a factor in the decision to fill the vacancy with a graduate of the EDP<span class="Italic">. See Sierra v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930932 (June 2, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073300 (2009), the Commission appeared to expand its definition of direct evidence to include statements by the alleged offending official indicating bias made at or about the time of the disputed employment action even if those statements did not specifically reference the action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Commission finds that the AJ erred in examining complainant's suspension under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> tripartite analysis, because complainant presented direct evidence of discrimination. Direct evidence of discriminatory motive may he any written or verbal policy or statement made by a respondent or respondent official that on its face demonstrates a bias against a protected group and is linked to the complained of adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Revised <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory</span>, III(A) (July 14, 1992) (Revised Enforcement Guidance). A link between the evidence of bias and the challenged employment action can he shown if the biased statements were made by the decision maker or one who was involved in the decision, at or around the time the decision was made, even if the biased remarks were not specifically related to the particular employment decision at issue. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> fn. 8. The United States Supreme Court has held that where the complainant presents direct evidence of discrimination, use of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> test is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792 (1973), <span class="Italic">Trans World Air Lines, Inc. v. Thurston,</span> 469 U.S. Ill. 121 (1985). Unless the agency can impeach the evidence or can establish an affirmative defense, liability will be established. Revised Enforcement Guidance, at III(B)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Cowan v. Glenbrook Securities, Inc.</span>, 123 F.3d 438 (2nd Cir. 1997), the court found no direct evidence of discrimination where the supervisor who made the discriminatory remarks was not the official who disciplined the plaintiff. As the court in <span class="Italic">Cowan</span>, 123 F.3d at 443-44, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, because Cowan does not contend that Radley made the ultimate decision to fire him, direct evidence sufficient to state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discriminatory discharge would be evidence that Radley misrepresented the number of days on which plaintiff was tardy (and forged plaintiff's signature on the tardiness warning), or that Radley was otherwise less tolerant of plaintiff's tardiness, because plaintiff is African-American, and that Radley's complaints regarding plaintiff's tardiness were a motivating factor in Steve Bucklin's decision to fire plaintiff. As the district court recognized, plaintiff has failed to produce any such evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As mentioned above, plaintiff's evidence of discriminatory intent boils down to his testimony that Radley used derogatory racial expressions on two occasions, one of which was directed at plaintiff when plaintiff accused Radley of interfering with his attempt to secure a position with the Postal Service. This evidence, while relevant to the issue of discriminatory intent, does not relate to the employment decision in question. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Firestone Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.</span>,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"stray remarks in the work place, while perhaps probative of sexual harassment [here race],. . .cannot justify requiring the employer to prove that its hiring or firing or promotion decisions were based on legitimate criteria." Such remarks, as offered by the plaintiff, when unrelated to the decisional process, are insufficient to demonstrate that the employer relied on illegitimate criteria, even when such statements are made by the decision-maker in issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">875 F.2d 1325, 1330 (7th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">quoting Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 277 (1989)) (internal citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Geier v. Medtronic, Inc.</span>, 99 F.3d 238, 242 (7th Cir. 1996) (stating that "isolated comments must be contemporaneous with the discharge or causally related to the discharge decision making process"); <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, 924 F.2d at 686 (stating that "[u]nless the remarks upon which plaintiff relies were related to the employment decision in question, they cannot be evidence of a discriminatory discharge"); <span class="Italic">Randle</span>, 876 F.2d at 569-70 (collecting cases).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that Radley called plaintiff a racially derogatory name, this fact cannot prove directly that Radley, motivated by racial animus, fabricated tardiness warnings and placed them in plaintiff's file or was otherwise less tolerant of plaintiff's tardiness; some nexus between this type of stray remark and the challenged employment decision is necessary. For example, a discriminatory remark made to plaintiff when confronted concerning a discrepancy on his time sheet or a statement made to plaintiff or others that he was writing plaintiff up because he was African-American would demonstrate that Radley likely relied on illegitimate criteria in issuing the tardiness warnings<span class="Italic">. See Plair</span>, 105 F.3d at 347 ("[D]irect evidence would be what [the employer] said or did in the specific employment decision in question: terminating [the employee]."); <span class="Italic">Maxfield v. Sinclair Int'l</span>, 766 F.2d 788, 791 (3d Cir. 1985) ("Direct evidence would include statements by the employer to the employee that s/he was being fired because of age."). Absent this nexus, a jury, even if it believed that Radley made the alleged statement, would need to rely on inferences or presumptions to conclude that racial animus played a part in the termination decision<span class="Italic">. See Furr v. AT &#x0026; T Tech., Inc</span>., 824 F.2d 1537, 1549 (10th Cir. 1987) (discriminatory statements unrelated to challenged employment decision are not direct evidence of causation because inference required).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_763"></span>In reviewing comments to determine whether they constitute direct evidence of discrimination, the Commission will look to see if the comments are indicative of motive. The Commission may also look to other factors in the work environment in evaluating the comments. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cimini v. National Mediation Board</span>, 01942369 (1995), the Commission explained why comments describing the selectee as a "younger guy" were not evidence of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has proffered two main arguments in support of a finding of pretext. First, appellant advances the Executive Director's statement describing the selectee as "a younger guy at a lower grade who could grow into the job." The Commission finds this statement insufficient to establish discriminatory animus. The reference to the selectee as "younger" appears merely descriptive; there is neither express nor implied preference of youth<span class="Italic"> per se</span>. Coupled with a work environment which appears quite hospitable to employees over the age of 40 (many well over the age), the Commission finds the Executive Director's statement insufficient to establish discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, it is not direct evidence of discrimination based on pregnancy when a selecting official inquires about a complainant's due date and childcare arrangements in response to the complainant initiating a discussion on her leave usage. <span class="Italic">Old Horn v. Secretary of Interior, BIA</span>, 01961337 (1998). Likewise, there was no direct evidence of discrimination in a reassignment where the regional director who made the reassignment stated there was a need for a female agent in a particular office, but the reassignment was based on the operational needs of the agency. <span class="Italic">Past v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A60565 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lewin v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01950272 (1996), the Commission found "direct evidence" of discrimination where the complainant's supervisor told her he disapproved of her use of the EEO process and also inquired if she had a "pattern and practice" of filing EEO complaints. The <span class="Italic">Lewin</span> case is somewhat interesting because the Commission found these statements correlated to a letter of termination and low performance evaluation. Although the statements themselves contained no direct reference to either of those actions, the Commission found the correlation in the fact that both adverse actions occurred within a month of the statements.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Arestad v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A24894 (2003), the Commission found that there was no direct evidence of reprisal where, in response to a request for a reassignment, the deciding official expressed concern that the employee would file an EEO complaint if the reassignment was denied. In <span class="Italic">Arestad</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We address first, complainant's challenge of the AJ's conclusion that RMO1's statements were not direct evidence of discriminatory animus. Direct evidence of discrimination is any statement made by an agency official that, on its face, demonstrates a discriminatory or retaliatory motive and is linked to the complained of adverse action. EEOC Policy Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at 16 (July 7, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claims that RMO1's statement that complainant "misleads the public, his peers supervisors and EEO investigators alike" was direct evidence of reprisal. He further claims that RMO1's reference to complainant's EEO activity in a memorandum recommending disapproval of an extension of his overseas assignment was direct evidence of reprisal. A review of RMO1's statements in the memorandum indicates he oriGINAlly recommended approval of complainant's request because he feared complainant would file an EEO complaint against him. RMO1 explained that he decided to change his recommendation based on his negative view of complainant's performance and his inability to receive constructive criticism.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">RMO1 made another statement in his 1999 investigative affidavit expressing the opinion that EEO complaints are often filed by disgruntled employees and contain unfounded accusations. There was no evidence that this statement was connected to his actions at issue in these complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on these facts, we conclude that the statements are not direct evidence but instead indicate RMO1's opinion that complainant's EEO complaint had no basis and was groundless. His reference to complainant's protected activity when recommending against his extension request indicates only his fear that complainant would file an EEO complaint not that he harbored discriminatory intent. He further explained his true reasons for disapproving the request were based on non-discriminatory motives--complainant's failure to perform his duties in a professional manner and his failure to accept criticism from his supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement that the complainant demonstrate bad intent when there is direct evidence of discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cushman v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01993480 (2002), the agency found the supervisor's statements that he promoted a female candidate because of the agency's emphasis on hiring women and minorities to be direct evidence of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the selecting official acknowledged that his decision to select the woman initially was greatly influenced by the regional office's "strong emphasis on hiring women and minorities particularly for this position." The selecting official also stated that he selected the female as his first choice, in part, because "she was a woman." (Statement of Selecting Official, Report of Investigation, Exhibit 3). In addition, he refused to consider the list of eligibles upon which complainant's name appeared because the list did not contain the names of women candidates. He chose to use the promotion eligibility list because it "contained two good female candidates." The agency's selecting official statements are sufficient to establish that sex was an overriding factor in complainant's non-selection. We find that, taken together, this evidence is sufficient to constitute direct evidence that unlawful sex and race discrimination, as a motivating factor for the challenged adverse action<span class="Italic">. Emmel v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.,</span> 95 F.3d 627, 631 (7th Cir. 1996). Each of these statements were made by the selecting official, were contemporaneous with the selection decision at issue, and were corroborated by other top officials involved in the selection process (who added that diversity was important since the staff has many, many middle-age white males). In addition, the record contains a worksheet, dated January 28, 1998, which documents that complainant scored higher at 65 points, than either the female with 58 points or the younger male selectee with 53 points<span class="Italic">. See</span> the Official Discrimination Complaint File at Exhibit 19. We find that complainant was excluded from consideration because the agency wanted to select a woman or a minority and complainant was neither.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the agency would not have made the same decision in the absence of unlawful discrimination. The record further confirms that the region and the selecting official was aware of the need to outreach to others who were not white males since according to one supervisor, the refuge staff has "many, middle-age white males." (ROI, Exhibit 2). We note that both the woman and male candidates who were selected were under age 40. We note again that the selecting official was given two certificates of eligible candidates and was aware that complainant's name appeared on the other certificate which was presented to him. At no point does the agency contend that the female candidate was better qualified than complainant. Instead, the agency said that the female candidate was the best qualified individual on the eligibility list which the selecting official opted to use. The record confirms that the agency scoring for complainant was higher than both the female who first accepted the position or the male who was later offered the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the direct evidence offered is deemed insufficient to establish a discriminatory intent, then it may be considered with other circumstantial evidence under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. Evidence that a supervisor made discriminatory statements, even though corroborated by witnesses, is not sufficient to prove discrimination when there is no evidence the supervisor attempted to translate this prejudice into practice. <span class="Italic">Roberts v. USPS</span>, 01820869 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">In assessing whether evidence of discriminatory intent is direct, a distinction must be made between the possible and what actually happened. In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01872413 (1988), the Commission found that an admission by the selecting official that the complainant's past EEO activity "could have been" a factor considered by the screening panel did not constitute direct evidence of discrimination. The Commission found the testimony of the selecting official was "[a] candid response, in a conjectural manner," to questions on direct examination, but was not an admission of discrimination. A similar result was obtained in <span class="Italic">Mojsejenko v. Veterans Administrator</span>, 01881076 (1988), where the RMO denied calling the complainant a "dumb woman" and stated that, had he made a comment it would have been in stronger language, such as "stupidest bitch." The Commission found that such a statement could be probative of discriminatory motivation but was not direct evidence of such because there was no indication the RMO had made any comment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a statement is hearsay does not exclude the statement from also being direct evidence. In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of State</span>, 01932717 (1994), the complainant received a low ranking from a promotion potential board shortly after her testimony in an EEO proceeding. Although agency policy required that an employee be informed of such a ranking, the complainant was never advised of her low ranking. In the ensuing investigation, one agency official testified that someone in personnel told him that the statement was withheld from the complainant because, coming right after her testimony, it would only cause the complainant distress and make her angry. The official could not recall the name of the personnel representative who made the statement. In finding that hearsay could constitute direct evidence, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> examined the statement for indicia of veracity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Direct evidence is an action or statement of an employer which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude, and which correlates to the challenged act<span class="Italic">. See Caban-Wheeler v. Elsea</span>, 904 F.2d 1549, 1555 (11th Cir. 1990). Once the trier of fact has accepted the direct evidence, liability is established. EEOC Policy Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, No. 915.002, July 14, 1992, Section III. The Commission concludes that the comment of the unidentified personnel official, at issue here, constitutes direct evidence. The comment on its face shows that the <span id="Page_764"></span>low-ranking statement was withheld because of appellant's involvement in an "administrative matter." That causal relationship is precisely what is prohibited by Section 704(a) of Title VII, which prohibits taking adverse employment actions against an individual "because" of opposition to discrimination or participation in the EEO process. As noted above, the agency does not contend or show that the administrative matter was anything other than appellant's prior EEO activity, and indeed in its FAD noted her highly visible role in the 1984 EEO investigation. We infer that the administrative matter referred to was appellant's prior EEO activity. Since the comment explicitly states a link between the administrative matter and the withholding of the low-ranking statement, the comment is direct evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant persuasively argues that the fact that the comment is hearsay does not detract from its evidentiary value. She cites to <span class="Italic">Hoska v. United States Dept. of the Army</span>, 677 F.2d 131 (D.C. Cir. 1982) in support of the admissibility of hearsay in administrative proceedings. The Court in <span class="Italic">Hoska</span> states that under certain circumstances, hearsay can constitute substantial evidence, 677 F.2d at 138, and cites to several cases for the standards determining its acceptability. For example, in <span class="Italic">Calhoun v. Bailar</span>, 626 F.2d 145, 149 (9th Cir. 1980), the tests are whether the hearsay is probative and bears indicia of reliability. We agree with appellant that the comment is relevant and material. We also agree that the comment bears sufficient indicia of reliability as suggested by <span class="Italic">Calhoun</span>: Because the CDO reporting the comment was removed from the withholding action by both time and office, and any bias she may have would more likely be in favor of the agency than of appellant, she may be viewed as a disinterested witness; the CDO provided a sworn affidavit; and her testimony is not contradicted by any other evidence. In that regard, we note that the agency in its investigation could have, but did not, canvas employees then in PER/PE to verify or rebut the truth of the reported comment. We conclude therefore that the reported comment is substantial and probative evidence, and find that the FAD was in error on this point. The Commission finds that appellant has shown that the agency retaliated against her for her participation in EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">A statement is not removed from the realm of direct evidence because it was not made until a year after the disputed personnel action. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gatewood v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01953327 (1997), the selecting official made a statement about the complainant's promotion potential as a woman nearly a year after her nonselection. The Commission found the statement was direct evidence of discriminatory intent even though it followed, rather than preceded, the selection.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that conflicting evidence calls for a credibility determination does not mean the case does not involve direct evidence. For example, in <span class="Italic">Boff v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072104 (2007), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Direct evidence may be any written or verbal policy or statement made by a management official that on its face demonstrates a bias against a protected group and is linked to the complained of adverse action.<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEOC Revised <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory</span>, Section III (July 12, 1992) (available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov">www.eeoc.gov</a>). A link must be shown between the employer's proven bias and its adverse action. For example, evidence that the biased remarks were made by the individual responsible for the adverse employment decision or by one who was involved in the decision, along with evidence that the remarks were related to the decision making process, would be sufficient to establish this link.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> When there is direct evidence of discrimination, the circumstantial evidence analysis established in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), is inapplicable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at footnote 11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 1, we find there is direct evidence of discrimination. It is more likely than not that complainant's account of the events that day is what occurred, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>., when he asked for labor assistance, the manager refused, expressing the refusal was because as a man complainant could do twice the amount of work as a woman, and then partly reiterating this. Co-worker 2 stated the manager made the man/woman remark to complainant; and the manager does not deny he did so. Rather, he stated he could not recall what he said to complainant even though he learned soon thereafter that complainant filed an EEO claim regarding the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The manager stated that he denied complainant's request for staff assistance based on mail volume, the number of mail handlers available, and the needs of the service. Given the manager's stated reason to complainant for the refusal, this explanation is not credible. In fact, when complainant challenged the man/woman remark, the manager reacted with anger and partly reiterated the comment. There is no documentation supporting the manager's claim of mail volume and number of available mail handlers, and Co-worker 2 stated he had been subject to the same double standard when dumping sacks. Accordingly, we find that complainant was discriminated against based on his sex when on February 1, 2006, his request for staff assistance was denied and he was ordered to do perform two tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is well recognized that in most cases there will be little, if any, direct evidence of discriminatory intent. Most cases adopt the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis for this reason.</p>
