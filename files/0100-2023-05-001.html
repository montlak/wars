<h2 class="h2s" id="pre"><span id="Page_i"></span>PREFACE</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Dear Readers,</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It may seem silly but, for me, writing this preface is always far more angst-producing than the book itself. Maybe it's because, over the years, authors like Peter and Ernie have always written thoughtful, intelligent, and many times very funny prefaces. I've always looked forward to reading theirs. It could also be because it requires me to quiet my mind and reflect over the year. A glimpse into my soul...I don't like doing that. I'm a forward-motion kind of gal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">My thought preferences aside, it has been another year, friends. We've been doing this together for a while now, which makes this the perfect time to thank our readership and loyal customers for your continued interest in our books and (sometimes) even the prefaces of our books.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Highlighted below are the cases that were of particular interest in 2023...at least to me.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h"><b>CIRCUIT COURT CASES</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Shields v. Credit One Bank N.A., </span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/shields-v-credit-one-bank-2">32 F.4th 1218</a> (9th Cir. 2022), the court held that short-term impairments may be covered under the ADA if the effects are sufficiently severe. That case is discussed in <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h"><b>COMMISSION CASES</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text-h1"><b>COVID-19</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">There were plenty of cases that involved, in one way or another, COVID-19. Complainants cite it to excuse filing delays. There is also the "to be determined" issue of whether COVID-19 qualifies as "disability" under the ADA. Last year, in <span class="Italic">Justin P. v. Veterans Affairs, </span>2021001747 (2021), the complainant alleged race and age-based discrimination where the agency failed to enforce COVID-19 precautions after he complained that a "coworker in his work area continually removed her face mask and coughed and sneezed." The complainant was not aggrieved, and the claim was better characterized as a safety concern according to the Commission. <span class="Italic">Justin P. </span>is discussed in <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec3-1">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Darius C. v. Postmaster General, </span>2020000613 (2021), the agency failed to provide
interpretative services for a hearing-impaired employee during a
last-minute meeting called to relay that there had been a COVID-19
positive individual at the work site. The complainant alleged that the agency's failures at this meeting and one other left him unable to participate in the meeting and to ask questions. The agency defended that "due to the exigent circumstances of the emergency meeting, it was not a violation when management failed to provide Complainant with his preferred accommodation of a live interpreter" and it effectively communicated the happenings at both meetings by providing the complainant with pertinent meeting notes. Emphasizing the fact that the agency had previously provided interpretive services to the complainant, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Darius </span>C., held the agency failed to provide the complainant with a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Darius C. </span>is discussed in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-10-001.html#sec1-1">1</a> and <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec15-1">15</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h1"><b>DAMAGES AWARDS</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Commission upheld an award of the cap--$300,000--in <span class="Italic">Miquel G. v. Secretary of Transportation, </span>2019002129 (2021), where the complainant, who was in excellent health prior to the discriminatory nonselection, suffered, among other things, significant cardiovascular episodes, bouts of crying and anxiety and had to retire from the agency. The amount of the award in <span class="Italic">Miquel G. </span>makes the facts and the analysis especially significant and is discussed in more detail in <a href="0100-2023-30-001.html#sec21-1">Chapter 21</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h1"><b>DISCIPLINE</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">An analysis of comparable disciplinary actions is not always necessary to defend against a complaint of discrimination. Evidence that the complainant violated agency policy, for instance, may be enough to establish a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the discipline. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Drew N. v. Secretary of Commerce, </span>2022003230 (2022), where the agency terminated the complainant for "political speech" posted on Facebook during off-duty hours. Though completed outside of work hours, social media posts are not outside the purview of the Commission if those posts violate agency policies or create a hostile work environment for other agency employees. See Chapters <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec10-1">10</a> and <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">12</a> for more discussion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h1"><b>HARASSMENT</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Challenges to routine work assignments do not normally state a claim of harassment. There are, however, exceptions like <span class="Italic">Vickie T. v. Postmaster General, </span>2021000988 (2021). In that case, the complainant claimed that her supervisor moved her out of her preferred duty assignment where she had worked for more than seven years. The agency dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Reversing the dismissal, the Commission noted that the supervisor's actions were "outside the standard practices within the facility."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Rumors can also create a hostile work environment. In <span class="Italic">Thomasina B. v. Secretary of Defense, </span>0120141298 (2021), the Commission found that rumors about the complainant's sexual orientation amounted to harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Felix R. v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, </span>2019002240 (2021), reminded us that the severity of harassment can be heightened when perpetrated by a supervisor. When a supervisor harasses an employee, "in their capacity as a supervisor," they can "normalize" discriminatory behavior, making it more pervasive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">All of these cases are discussed in <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h1"><b>INTRUSION/INTERFERENCE BY AGENCY COUNSEL</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Commission applied the interference principle in <span class="Italic">Kylee C. v. Secretary of Army, </span>2020001154 (2021), and found no intrusion where agency counsel participated in a fact-finding conference and named relevant witnesses, submitted documentation, asked follow up questions to testimony, commented on testimony, and objected to questions. <span class="Italic">Kylee C. </span>is discussed in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec4-1">4</a>, <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec8-1">8</a> and <a href="0100-2023-18-001.html#sec9-1">9</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But, the agency in <span class="Italic">Larraine D. v. Agency for International Development, </span>2020003744 (2021), overreached where "metadata" revealed that the agency's final decision, finding no discrimination, "appear[ed] to be the product of the Agency's Office of General Counsel rather than the Agency's EEO office."</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h1"><b>"INTUITIVELY OBVIOUS" HARM</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Commission discussed last year the concept of "intuitively obvious" harm in terms of proof or evidence of harm and award calculations. In <span class="Italic">Elise S. v. Secretary of State, </span>2020004019 (2021), the Commission wrote about harm that is "intuitively obvious" based on the discriminatory acts and reminded that the duration of time a complainant is subjected to discrimination can affect a damages award. <a href="0100-2023-30-001.html#sec21-1">Chapter 21</a> discusses in more detail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h1"><b>NONSELECTIONS</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Vickie T. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </span>2021002444 (2022), considered the "common core of tasks" shared between the complainant and the selectee to determine whether discrimination occurred, finding that the comparator's "areas of focus" were sufficiently distinguishable from the complainant's in "skill, effort, and responsibility."</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h1"><b>OFFERS OF REEMPLOYMENT</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, </span><a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1982677458us2191672">458 U.S. 219</a> (1982), an agency can toll back pay accrual by unconditionally offering the complainant the job previously denied. "Usually, settlement offers require that the complainant lose his or her right to pursue the complaint in exchange for reinstatement. Such an offer is not an unconditional one." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Lorita A. v. Secretary of Defense, </span>2021004328 (2021), held <span id="Page_ii"></span>that withdrawing an offer of reemployment does not give way to a separate cause of action. In addition, the offer itself is entitled to the same confidentiality and privilege as settlement negotiations. Discussion of offers of reemployment can be found in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-10-001.html#sec1-1">3</a> and <a href="0100-2023-30-001.html#sec21-1">21</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-h"><b>NEW TO THE GUIDE:</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">A few notable and new topics in the <span class="Italic">Guide </span>this year:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> "Microaggressions" as a concept is not exactly new, but it is a term being used more often where routine, even every day, "low-level," subtle or insensitive slights that relate to one's protected status the behavior can rise to harassment. <span class="Italic">Anne G. v. Veterans Affairs, </span>2022003036 (2022), is a great example where the Commission found race-based harassment against a black female when coworkers called her "girl," asked her to play a slave in a "living museum," suggested that they serve "kool aid" and fried chicken at a Juneteenth event and committed other microaggressions. A new section dedicated to such cases is in <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec20-1">Chapter 12</a>.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> This year, OPM issued "Guidance Regarding Gender Identity and Inclusion in the Federal Workplace" wherein it reiterates the importance of addressing employees "by the names and pronouns they use to describe themselves." That guidance is discussed in a new section of Chapter 12 entitled "<a href="0100-2023-21-049.html#sec12-45-1">Pronoun Usage</a>."</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> "<a href="">Blaming the Victim of Harassment</a>" was added this year to Chapter 17. When an employee is harassed or subjected to a hostile work environment and the agency ignores those claims or is ineffective in its attempts to stop the harassment, it is foreseeable that the victim may act out in defense or upset. In those cases, the victim's reactions may be the "natural, foreseeable, and to-be-expected consequence of management's inaction to severe and pervasive harassment by coworkers." <span class="Italic">Jason L. v. Attorney General, </span>2022000528 (2022).</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> "<a href="0100-2023-21-116.html#sec12-86a">Hostile Environment Harassment--Non-Employees to Employees</a>" is a new section in Chapter 12. In <span class="Italic">Silas T. v. Secretary of Defense, </span>2019003996 (2021), the Commission held the agency liable for the homophobic actions of a customer/employee directed at the gay employee.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> "<a href="0100-2023-24-060.html#sec15-44a">Trial Periods for Accommodations</a>" is a new heading in the Chapter 15. The ADA does not speak to how long an accommodation must last, but the duty to provide an accommodation is on-going. Once an accommodation is established there is still a period of time for all parties to assess reasonableness and effectiveness. Nothing precludes agencies from granting an accommodation on a trial basis and the Commission approved of one in <span class="Italic">Meaghan F. v. Secretary of Treasury, </span>2019005325 (2021), where the agency tentatively granted the complainant's request for an emotional support dog. At the end of the trial period, the agency determined that the accommodation was not effective and rescinded its provision. The Commission found that the agency's actions were not improper.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> The topic of "<a href="0100-2023-19-009.html#sec10-10">Comparison Employees</a>" in Chapter 10 is reorganized and broken out into new headings to make research easier.</p>
<p class="Body-Text1"><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text">I calculated it. I've known Peter Broida for 21 years. He was my first employer out of law school. I remember my interview with him to be the legal editor for Dewey. I arrived in a black skirt suit and heels. The interview began as most, sitting at a table asking and answering questions. Then, Peter took me to the room where we kept boxes and boxes of books. He asked me to move a box from one spot to another. And then another. And another. The job would involve some amount of manual labor, he explained. We were a publisher of books after all. I feel like I knocked that part of the interview out of the park, especially given the length of my skirt and height of my heels. I got the job. My first day of work, he asked me to visit the NLRB's library to conduct some legal research for a case he was working on. I must have knocked that out of the part too, because within two months he had asked me to become his very first associate attorney. I was delighted to see the plague on the door change from "Peter Broida, Attorney at Law" to "Broida and Associate". In time, even his coy pond included one coy namely "Soley" (short for sole practitioner) and another named "the associate". Ha! Many thanks to Peter for starting me down this career path and for supporting my efforts over the years.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">My dear friend, Karen Troutman, whom I've also known for 21 years, and her sons, Michael and William, polish up this <span class="Italic">Guide </span>and make it interactive and easy to navigate. Thank you, Troutmans.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The children are back to in-school learning. All it took was one year at-home for them to realize how much they love school. Now, they jump out of bed unprompted in the mornings. It's the little things. My eldest is driving. If you visit Bentonville, best to take the bike trails to get around. My daughter took up diving and track. Track meets are my favorite. My youngest got his braces off. It's amazing what orthodontics can do. They are growing up too fast and it makes me what to jump out of this chair to go hang out with them. And, that is exactly what I will do, but only after I thank my husband of 17 years just for being him. He (now along with track meets) is still my favorite.</p>
