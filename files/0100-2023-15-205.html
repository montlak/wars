<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-203"><span class="space">B.</span> BIAS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The showing of bias really consists of two distinct demonstrations: one of bias on the part of the judge and secondly that the complainant or agency actually was prejudiced by the bias displayed. In other words, the party alleging bias must demonstrate a nexus between the alleged bias of the judge and the rulings made.</p>
<p class="noindent">"Appellant must demonstrate that the bias demonstrated so permeates the hearing process that it would be impossible to receive a fair hearing or the process was so tainted by substantial personal bias that he did not receive a fair and impartial hearing." <span class="Italic">Nelson v. USPS</span>, 01832799 (1985). In that case, the Commission rejected the employee's argument that he was prejudiced by the judge's mention of past EEO complaints and an undue criticism of the manner in which appellant presented his case. The EEOC found that the judge indeed was biased, but there was no causal connection between the personal animus of the judge and the outcome of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 7-3 contains the following guidance on bias:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge should not participate in any conduct during the hearing that presents the appearance of or demonstrates actual bias in favor of or against one of the parties. For example, it is improper for the Administrative Judge to eat lunch with a representative of one party during the course of the hearing. If a party or a witness accuses the Administrative Judge of bias during the course of the hearing, the Administrative Judge should document the allegations and the response on the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">If bias is to be alleged against an administrative judge, the allegation must be promptly asserted and a motion to recuse should be filed. The time for asserted bias and seeking recusal is not after an adverse decision has issued. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Warvolis v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A03250 (2001) (rejecting claims of bias, noting that the administrative judge should have disclosed his prior professional relationship with an agency representative prior to the start of the hearing, but also noting that once the disclosure was made neither party made a request for the judge to recuse himself). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54268 (2005) (allegation of bias must be raised with administrative judge to be preserved for appeal).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the administrative judge decided in favor of the agency does not indicate bias. In alleging bias on the part of the administrative judge, the appellant must cite specific incidents to illustrate that contention. <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01831837 (1984). Similarly, the fact that the administrative judge has found against the complainant in a previous case does not demonstrate bias. <span class="Italic">Meza v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52933 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the administrative judge makes inappropriate comments during the prehearing conference does not prejudice an appellant who has failed to state a claim under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01883085 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Arnold</span>, the complainant alleged that a dress code requirement was sex discrimination. The administrative judge, prior to the hearing, asked the complainant why he was wasting taxpayers' money. Although the Commission is certainly correct in holding that there can be no prejudice where the employee has failed to state a claim, it is equally correct that no self-respecting administrative judge should make such a comment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Merely adding support to the basic proposition that administrative judges are, after all, human beings and subject to the same frailties as the rest of us, the Commission rejected an allegation of bias in a case that was transferred from the EEOC's Los Angeles District Office to the San Francisco District Office. The administrative judge transferring the case wrote a cover memo that referred to the complainant as another "disgruntled complainant." The Commission found that the remark, while inappropriate, was not evidence of bias on the part of the judge who decided the case. <span class="Italic">LaFaso v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A44854 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">Allegations of bias sometimes arise out of conversations with the administrative judge during settlement discussions when a judge renders an opinion about a case in that context. Such allegations virtually always fail as the Commission views it as a proper role of the judge during settlement negotiations. As the Commission explained in rejecting an allegation of bias in <span class="Italic">Skarica v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120073399 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_547"></span>Complainant contends that the AJ should have recused himself from this case because he stated that this case would not warrant a hearing during settlement negotiations. In <span class="Italic">Ronald L. Porter v. Department of the Navy</span>, 0120051744 (December 4, 2006), the Commission, in deciding that an AJ's decision not to recuse herself from a case was proper, focused on whether the AJ's comments compromised her objectivity or otherwise improperly influenced her conclusions. We find no such evidence in the present case. As indicated above, our own review supports the AJ's determination that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute or any credibility determinations that would warrant a hearing. Moreover, we note that Management Directive 110, Chap. 7, Sec. III (D)(14) indicates that an AJ may engage or encourage the parties to engage in settlement discussions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Humor, and sometimes even sarcasm, can have a place in EEO hearings. Particularly when proceedings are protracted and emotion levels run high, humor and sarcasm can help alleviate tension. In <span class="Italic">Douglas-Slade v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01903537 (1990), the Commission found there was nothing inappropriate in the sometimes caustic comments of the administrative judge, where the comments were directed equally at the parties, the humor was used, in part, to ease tension created by the irresponsible conduct of complainant's attorney, who did not show up for the hearing, and the administrative judge went to great lengths to help the complainant develop the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Hawthorne v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01921012 (1992), the Commission found there was no bias on the part of the administrative judge where an exchange with the complainant ended with the judge stating, "Don't argue with me.... You'll lose, I guarantee it." The Commission concluded, reviewing the exchange as a whole, that the administrative judge was attempting to focus the complainant on the answer to a particular question, while the complainant persisted in testifying about another matter. The Commission decided "[i]t seems that the AJ's remark was directed at the context of his disagreement with appellant and intended to mean that appellant would lose that particular disagreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hooker v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A44349 (2005) (no showing of bias where judge allegedly told complainant he would need Johnnie Cochran to win case).</p>
<p class="noindent">Encouraging the complainant to obtain counsel is not an indication of bias, even where the complainant does not retain counsel and the subsequent decision is adverse. <span class="Italic">Srinivasan v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 01986951 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Mere evidence of a personality clash between the administrative judge and the complainant's attorney does not constitute a showing of bias on the part of the judge. In <span class="Italic">Antipolo v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01912087 (1991), the Commission found evidence of a "clash of personalities" and also noted that, at times, the administrative judge took control of the case from the agency representative. However, the Commission noted that it appeared the administrative judge was driven by a desire to fully develop the hearing record and to manage the hearing in a smooth fashion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cortez v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05950683 (1998), the Commission found that the administrative judge did not show bias by allowing a guard to search the complainant's backpack, allowing the agency representative to use a technical advisor, and referring to the agency as "our federal government":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no support in the record for appellant's claim that the AJ showed bias against him by allowing an agency security officer to search his back pack and remain present outside the hearing room. The agency's hearing representative stated that she asked that a security guard be posted outside the room because of some witnesses' fears that appellant would become violent. An officer searched appellant's back pack, with appellant's consent, and remained in the hallway for the duration of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, we find nothing improper about the AJ's decision to allow a technical advisor to assist the agency's representative. In overruling appellant's objection, the AJ stated that, in order to expedite the hearing and facilitate the gathering of witnesses, he would allow the technical advisor to assist the agency representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not agree that the AJ exhibited bias toward appellant by asking him what it would take to settle the complaint during a prehearing telephonic conference. Appellant mistakenly characterized the AJ's use of the phrase "our federal government," as opposed to "this agency," as reflecting bias against him.</p>
<p class="noindent">Having lunch with one party's representative does not indicate bias on the part of the administrative judge. However, it does give the appearance of impropriety and should be avoided. <span class="Italic">Margotta v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01911253 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Porter v. Secretary of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0120051744.txt">0120051744</a> (2006), the Commission found that it was not error for the administrative judge to deny a motion to recuse based on a conversation between the judge and agency counsel. Although it appears the conversation, which took place while the complainant's counsel was out of the room, tangentially touched on the subjects related to the hearing, the Commission found there was no evidence of bias in <span class="Italic">Porte</span>r explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding recusal, the record reflects that at the conclusion of the second day of hearing, while complainant's counsel was outside of the hearing room, there was conversation between the AJ and agency counsel. Complainant filed a motion for recusal which the AJ denied in an order prior to her reconvening of the third day of hearing. In her denial, the AJ stated that she did not recall the nature of the comments and would not have been influenced by them. Complainant was provided the opportunity to put his motion for recusal on the record at the hearing. The AJ stated at the hearing that all she remembered about the communication was that she had asked if the parties could try to resolve the matter, that she commented that Person A was a good witness, and that agency counsel stated to her that he did not want to engage in a discussion outside of the presence of counsel for complainant. The AJ's denial of the recusal motion was proper. We do not find that the AJ's communication compromised her objectivity or otherwise improperly influenced her conclusions. <span class="Italic">See Higbee v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12046 (July 10, 2002), <span class="Italic">req. to reconsider den</span>., EEOC Request No. 05A21139 (November 4, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">On occasion, when the Commission remands a case for other reasons, it will order or suggest that the case be assigned to a new administrative judge on remand to avoid any appearance of bias. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A50324 (2006).<span id="Page_548"></span></p></section>
