<h3 class="h3" id="sec16-27a"><span class="space">1.</span> Court Opinions on the ADEA and Disparate Impact</h3>
<p class="noindent">A number of courts have held that a claim of adverse impact cannot be maintained under the ADEA. In <span class="Italic">Hazen Paper Company v. Biggins</span>, 113 S. Ct. 1701 (1993), the Supreme Court noted, without deciding, that there are a number of substantial arguments as to why an adverse impact claim cannot be brought under the ADEA. Several courts have now followed the lead of <span class="Italic">Hazen</span> and held that ADEA claims cannot be based on a theory of adverse impact. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mullin v. Raytheon Company</span>, 164 F.3d 696 (1st Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Ellis v. United Airlines</span>, 73 F.3d 999 (9th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">DiBiase v. Smithkline Beecham Corp.</span>, 48 F.3d 719 (3d Cir. 1995). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Aerospace Community Credit Union</span>, 114 F.3d 745, 750 (8th Cir. 1997) ("[O]ur circuit continues to recognize the viability of such claims under the ADEA."); <span class="Italic">Criley v. Delta Airlines, Inc</span>, 119 F.3d 102 (2d Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. City of Jackson</span>, 544 U.S. 228 (2005), the Supreme Court found that the theory of disparate impact does apply in ADEA cases. However, the scope of the theory is somewhat narrower than under Title VII, in part, because of the ADEA provision permitting employers to make decision based on reasonable factors other than age. As the Court explained in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title VII. The first is the RFOA provision, which we have already identified. The second is the amendment to Title VII contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071. One of the purposes of that amendment was to modify the Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 490 U.S. 642 (1989), a case in which we narrowly construed the employer's exposure to liability on a disparate-impact theory. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Rights Act of 1991, &#x00A7; 2, 105 Stat. 1071. While the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII, they did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination. Hence, <span class="Italic">Wards Cove's</span> pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII's identical language remains applicable to the ADEA. Congress' decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individual's capacity to engage in certain types of employment. To be sure, Congress recognized that this is not always the case, and that society may perceive those differences to be larger or more consequential than they are in fact. However, as Secretary Wirtz noted in his report, "certain circumstances...unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers." Wirtz Report 28. Thus, it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older <span id="Page_1454"></span>workers as a group. Moreover, intentional discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred at the same levels as discrimination against those protected by Title VII. While the ADEA reflects Congress' intent to give older workers employment opportunities whenever possible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120132477 (2015) (applying <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> under ADEA).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court resolved the question as it relates to private sector cases in <span class="Italic">Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory</span>, 128 S. Ct. 2395 (2008), finding that a claim of disparate impact discrimination could be brought under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent">Regarding federal sector cases, however, the Fourth Circuit most recently in <span class="Italic">DiCocco v. Attorney General</span>, No. 20-1342 (4th Cir. 2021), held that the ADEA does not cover disparate impact claims. DiCocco, 67 years old, accepted a job offer with the Bureau of Prisons. As a condition to employment, she had to pass a Physical Abilities Test. DiCocco failed her first try, declined a retake and resigned. After exhausting her administrative remedies and the district court dismissed her complaint for lack of standing, she appealed to the circuit. The agency argued that 29 USC 633a(a), the provision of the ADEA that governs federal employee, does not allow for disparate impact claims and, because of this, the government has not waived sovereign immunity. The Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">DiCocco</span> agreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADEA "unequivocally" waives the government's immunity from suit for claims under &#x00A7; 633a(a). <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 491; <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(c) ("Any person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter."). So we are left to determine whether Dr. DiCocco has asserted a claim that falls within the terms of that waiver. She has not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADEA's federal-sector provision, &#x00A7; 633a(a), provides: "All personnel actions affecting [federal] employees or applicants for [federal] employment who are at least 40 years of age...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) (emphasis omitted). Our task is to determine whether this provision encompasses disparate-impact claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In doing so, we are guided by the Supreme Court's interpretation of similar provisions. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. City of Jackson</span>, 544 U.S. 228, 234-40 (2005) (plurality opinion); <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. 474. Considering the framework provided by these two cases, we conclude that the language of &#x00A7; 633a(a) does not create a disparate-impact cause of action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, a plurality of the Supreme Court held that "the 'disparate-impact' theory of recovery announced in <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co</span>., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), for cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, is cognizable under" &#x00A7; 623(a)(2), the section of the ADEA that addresses private-sector conduct. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 230, 233-40 (plurality opinion). In so holding, the plurality relied on four arguments: statutory text, statutory structure, precedent, and deference to agency action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the text of the ADEA's private-sector provision, &#x00A7; 623(a)(2): It "shall be unlawful for an employer...to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's age." This text uses the same language, swapping the term "race" for "age," as &#x00A7; 703(a)(2) of Title VII, which <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> found to encompass disparate-impact liability. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 233-34 (plurality opinion). As the ADEA used language derived from Title VII, the plurality presumed the two had the same meaning. So <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> "strongly suggest[ed] that a disparate-impact theory" should also be cognizable under the ADEA's private-sector provision, &#x00A7; 623(a)(2). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 236.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But <span class="Italic">Smith</span> did not rely exclusively on the precedential value of <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>. It went on to explain why, in its view, <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> articulated the "better reading of the statutory text." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 235. Disparate-impact liability fit the language of Title VII's private-sector provision (and therefore the comparable ADEA provision) because those provisions "focus[ ] on the effects of the action on the employee rather than the motivation for the action of the employer." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 235-36 (emphasis omitted); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 234 (noting Title VII was directed at the consequences of the employer's action, not just the employer's motivation).4 In contrast, disparate-impact liability was excluded where the ADEA's statutory language focused "on the employer's actions with respect to the targeted individual." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 236 n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, <span class="Italic">Smith</span> relied on statutory structure, especially the existence of a statutory defense for "reasonable factors other than age," to support finding disparate-impact liability in the private-sector provision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 238-39. The defense permits an employer to "take any action otherwise prohibited [by the private-sector provision]...where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(f)(1). This provision "plays its principal role," <span class="Italic">Smith</span> explained, in disparate-impact cases "by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was 'reasonable.'" <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 239 (plurality opinion). So its presence was probative of the statute's intended scope.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Court noted that the Department of Labor, which drafted the legislation, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which was delegated the responsibility of enforcing the statute, had consistently interpreted the ADEA's private-sector provision to encompass disparate-impact liability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 243 (Scalia, J., concurring) (characterizing this as <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Smith</span> thus relied on text, structure, precedent, and agency guidance to find that the ADEA's private-sector provision authorizes a disparate-impact cause of action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Three years after <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Court again returned to interpret the ADEA. This time, the Court addressed the federal-sector provision of the ADEA, holding that the term "discrimination based on age" in the ADEA's federal-sector provision includes retaliation claims. <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 479. To do so, the Court turned to precedent interpreting statutory language that was "not materially different" from the ADEA provision and that carried the same context: "remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 481. The first case, <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc</span>., 396 U.S. 229 (1969), held that retaliation claims could be brought under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1982. <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 479. While that provision did not explicitly "use the phrase 'discrimination based on race,'" the Court found that to be the statute's plain meaning. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The second case, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education</span>, 544 U.S. 167 (2005), relied on Sullivan's interpretation of &#x00A7; 1982 to interpret 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1681(a),7 part of Title IX, to prohibit retaliation. <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 480. <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> had "presume[d] that Congress was thoroughly familiar with [<span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>]" and expected Title IX "to be interpreted in conformity with [it]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 485 (alteration in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 544 U.S. at 176).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span> followed "the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> and <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>" to "interpret the ADEA federal-sector provision's prohibition of 'discrimination based on age'" to likewise prohibit retaliation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 481. In doing so, the Court explained that "retaliation is discrimination 'on the basis of [a protected class]' because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of...discrimination [against that class]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 480 (emphasis omitted) (quoting <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 544 U.S. at 173-74).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court observed that the ADEA's federal-sector provision differed sharply from the private-sector provision. The federal-sector provision includes "a broad prohibition of 'discrimination,'" while the ADEA's private-sector provision includes "a list of specific prohibited practices." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 487. So the Court found that the enactment of a broad ban, like Title VII's ban interpreted in <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> and Title VI's ban interpreted in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, suggested Congress expected it to "be interpreted 'in conformity' with" <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> to include retaliation claims. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 488 (citations omitted). The express inclusion of retaliation in the private-sector provision but not in the federal-sector provision lacks significance given the breadth of the prohibition and its similarity to the other broad bans. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span> thus relied on the statute's text and the legal landscape in which it was enacted to find that the ADEA's public-sector provision authorizes a retaliation cause of action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr. DiCocco urges us to read these two cases to find that the ADEA's federal-sector provision should also encompass disparate-impact liability. <span class="Italic">See Lujan v. Walters</span>, 813 F.2d 1051, 1057-58 (10th Cir. 1987) (analyzing a disparate-impact claim under the federal-sector provision without explaining why a disparate-impact claim is permitted); <span class="Italic">Palmer v. United States</span>, 794 F.2d 534, 536-37 (9th Cir. 1986) (same). But the arguments that emerge from <span class="Italic">Smith</span> and <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>--those based on the statute's text, the law's structure, and the legal landscape in which the law was passed--do not support such a finding here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Start with the text. <span class="Italic">See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co</span>., 534 U.S. 438, 450 (2002). Section 633a(a) provides: "All personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Smith teaches that statutes barring disparate treatment focus on the "motivation for the action of the employer." 544 U.S. at 235-36. Only where the statutory prohibition refers to the "consequences of actions and not just to the mindset of actors" is disparate-impact liability authorized. <span class="Italic">Tex. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc</span>., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2518 (2015); <span class="Italic">see also Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 235-36. The ADEA's federal-sector provision addresses the actor's intent: "personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) (emphasis omitted). "The phrase 'free from any discrimination' is an adverbial phrase that modifies the verb 'made.'" <span class="Italic">Babb v. Wilkie</span>, 140 S. Ct. 1168, 1173 (2020). So it "describes how a personnel action must be 'made.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1174. Thus, the statutory text asks if "age discrimination plays any part in the way a decision is made." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That focus on the "motivation for the employer's action"--and not the "effects of the action on the employee"--precludes disparate-impact liability under <span class="Italic">Smith</span>. 544 U.S. at 235-36 &#x0026; n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recall that, unlike &#x00A7; 633a(a), the Title VII text interpreted in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> prohibits classifications "which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as <span id="Page_1455"></span>an employee, because of such individual's age." &#x00A7; 623(a)(2) (emphasis omitted). That language directs our focus to the consequences of an action on the employee and thus permits disparate-impact liability. But the text of &#x00A7; 633a(a) directs our focus to the actor's intent and whether it involved discrimination.10 And that focus on the actor's intent precludes disparate-impact liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court's analysis of &#x00A7; 633a(a) in <span class="Italic">Babb</span> reinforces this conclusion. While <span class="Italic">Babb</span> did not concern the existence of disparate-impact liability specifically, the Supreme Court did interpret the words of the statute, and that interpretation forecloses disparate-impact liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Babb</span> explained that the term "personnel actions" includes "most employment-related decisions" and that &#x00A7; 633a(a) protects against decisions in which "age discrimination plays any part in the way a decision is made." 140 S. Ct. at 1173-74 (emphasis omitted). So, under Babb's interpretation, the text of &#x00A7; 633a(a) looks to the motivation behind, rather than the effect of, the decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1173-74 ("Thus, 'free from any discrimination' describes how a personnel action must be 'made,' namely, in a way that is not tainted by differential treatment based on age. If age discrimination plays any part in the way a decision is made, then the decision is not made in a way that is untainted by such discrimination."). And yet the Supreme Court directs that disparate-impact liability applies only when the text focuses on the consequences of a decision, not on the actor's intent. <span class="Italic">Cf. Tex. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Cmty. Affairs</span>, 576 U.S. at 534 ("the consequences of an action rather than the actor's intent"); <span class="Italic">Bd. of Educ. of City Sch. Dist. of N.Y. v. Harris</span>, 444 U.S. 130, 140-41 (1979) (same); <span class="Italic">see also Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 235-36 &#x0026; n.6.11</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having established that the statute places a condition on an employer's decisions, the rest of the statute establishes what that condition is: Those decisions "shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." If age-based animus even slightly "tainted" the employer's decision, then that decision was not "made free from any" age-based discrimination. 140 S. Ct. at 1173-74.12</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Babb</span> Court read "discrimination" to "carr[y] its 'normal definition,' which is 'differential treatment.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1173. So under &#x00A7; 633a(a), the Court concluded, "age must be a but-for cause of discrimination--that is, of differential treatment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "Differential treatment" directs the statute's focus to the employer's action, not the consequences of the action on the employee, and requires intent. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ</span>., 544 U.S. 167, 175 (2005) ("'Discrimination' is a term that covers a wide range of intentional unequal treatment."); <span class="Italic">see also Puffer v. Allstate Ins</span>., 675 F.3d 709, 716 (7th Cir. 2012). And disparate-impact liability is not a form of intentional discrimination or differential treatment. <span class="Italic">See Ricci v. DeStefano</span>, 557 U.S. 557, 577 (2009) (contrasting "intentional discrimination (known as 'disparate treatment')" with "practices that are not intended to discriminate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse effect on minorities (known as 'disparate impact')").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the statute identifies which type of intentional differential treatment is not allowed: that which is "based on age." As <span class="Italic">Babb</span> declares and our colleague in dissent acknowledges, this clause requires that age "be a but-for cause of discrimination--that is, of differential treatment." 140 S. Ct. at 1173; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Dissent at 6. So, &#x00A7; 633a(a) is only implicated where an employer intended to treat otherwise identical employees differently because of their ages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">So in sum, the text of &#x00A7; 633a(a) requires that employment-related decisions be untainted by differential treatment of employees identical in all respects but age. This standard authorizes disparate-treatment claims, such as where an employer's age-based animus contributes to their decision to pass over an employee for promotion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Babb</span>, 140 S. Ct. 1168. But it does not encompass disparate-impact claims, where an employer adopts a policy that treats all employees the same, no matter how old they happen to be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statutory structure also supports this conclusion. Smith relied on the narrowing effect of the reasonable-factors defense to justify finding disparate-impact liability under the private-sector provision. 544 U.S. at 239 (plurality opinion). The Court noted that the defense reflected Congress's understanding that age often "has relevance to an individual's capacity to engage in certain types of employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 240-41. So Congress would not prohibit every potential disparate impact based on age without providing a defense to protect legitimate actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab'y</span>, 554 U.S. 84, 97 (2008) (holding that the ADEA private-sector provision does not include a business-necessity defense but relies solely on the reasonable-factors defense). Smith reasoned that Congress's inclusion of the reasonable-factors defense as a limit reflects the intention to sweep broadly and include disparate-impact claims. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 239 (plurality opinion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII's federal-sector provision also expressly incorporates a defense to disparate-impact claims--specifically, a business-necessity defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 &#x00A7; 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i) (including as part of the burden that the "respondent" can "demonstrate that the challenged practice is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity"); &#x00A7; 2000e(n) (defining "respondent" in &#x00A7; 2000e-2(k) to include federal employers); <span class="Italic">Rodr&#x00ED;guez v. United States</span>, 852 F.3d 67, 77-78 (1st Cir. 2017) (explaining how the federal-sector provision is the same as the private-sector provision under Title VII, including disparate-impact); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Cohen</span>, 400 F.3d 388, 397-98 (6th Cir. 2005) (noting the business-necessity defense when applying &#x00A7; 2000e-2(k)(1)(A) to a federal employee); <span class="Italic">Figueroa v. Pompeo</span>, 923 F.3d 1078, 1083-85 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike a Title VII disparate-impact claim or a private-sector ADEA claim, however, the ADEA's federal-sector provision provides no business-necessity defense nor reasonable-factor defense.13 Indeed, it contains no defense at all. Using <span class="Italic">Smith's</span> logic, the absence of the limiting defenses found in comparable provisions suggests that Congress did not intend to include a broad disparate-impact claim in the ADEA's federal-sector provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr. DiCocco finally points to the legal landscape to suggest that we should read the federal-sector provision as encompassing a disparate-impact cause of action. As the Supreme Court has recognized, the federal-sector provision was "patterned 'directly after' Title VII's federal-sector discrimination ban." <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 487 (quoting <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 156, 167 n.15 (1981)). The Title VII provision expressly prohibits discrimination based on disparate impact. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(k) (codifying the burden of proof for disparate-impact cases against "respondent[s]"); &#x00A7; 2000e(n) (defining "respondent" in &#x00A7; 2000e-2(k) to include federal employers). And the Supreme Court has separately held that the ADEA's private-sector provision, in part, provides for disparate-impact liability. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 240 (plurality opinion). But the legal landscape when the federal-sector provision was passed does not suggest that Congress intended the ADEA's federal-sector provision to include disparate-impact liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADEA's federal-sector provision was enacted in 1974, long before the 1991 amendments to Title VII codified disparate-impact liability for federal employers. Before those amendments, the Supreme Court had not considered whether Title VII's federal-sector provision permitted disparate-impact claims. <span class="Italic">Cf. Griggs</span>, 401 U.S. at 426 n.1, 429-30 (explaining, in 1971, that the private-sector provisions of Title VII permit disparate-impact claims). The amendments "expanded the coverage of Title VII" to disparate-impact liability but did not make corresponding changes to the ADEA. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 240. So because the Title VII amendments resolved the federal-sector disparate-impact question after the ADEA's federal-sector provision was enacted, we do not see how Congress could have incorporated their substance into the ADEA, especially when it expressly included disparate-impact language in Title VII but left the ADEA unaltered. <span class="Italic">See Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc</span>., 557 U.S. 167, 174 (2009) ("We cannot ignore Congress' decision to amend Title VII's relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the ADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>, which interpreted Title VII's private-sector provision to include disparate-impact liability, was decided three years before the ADEA federal-sector provision was enacted. But Title VII's private-sector provision is worded and structured differently than the ADEA's federal-sector provision. <span class="Italic">See Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 474 (explaining that the language of &#x00A7; 633a(a) differs sharply from the language of &#x00A7; 623(a), which, as the Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 554 U.S. at 236, is nearly identical to that of Title VII's private-sector provision). Compare 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a) (Title VII private-sector provision), with 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) (ADEA federal-sector provision). So Congress would not have had a "reason to expect" that the ADEA's federal-sector provision "would be interpreted 'in conformity' with" <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>. <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 488 (quoting <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 544 U.S. at 176). So even though a Title VII disparate-impact case would normally be a "compelling" precedent in interpreting the ADEA, <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 544 U.S. at 234, <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> does not control here.14</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, neither the legal background at enactment nor the statute's text and structure support allowing a disparate-impact liability claim under the federal-sector provision of the ADEA. So we hold that Dr. DiCocco's disparate-impact claim is not cognizable under the ADEA's federal-sector provision. And because the government's waiver of sovereign immunity is limited to claims by persons "aggrieved" under the section, her claim is not within the scope of that waiver.</p>
