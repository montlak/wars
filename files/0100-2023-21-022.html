<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-22a"><span class="space">C.</span> FRAGMENTED OR PIECEMEAL ANALYSIS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Fragmentation occurs is when a claim involving a series of events, such as a hostile environment claim, is viewed as a collection of independent claims where each event represents a separate claim. Each event, when analyzed separately, may not to rise to the level of sufficient personal harm to state a claim. But when those same claims are considered together as a single claim of ongoing harassment, collectively, they do rise to the necessary level to state a claim and/or justify a finding of discriminatory harassment. Fragmentation is discussed at length in <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec3-1">Chapter 3</a> as it relates to the complaint process. This section focuses on fragmentation at the hearing level.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Treasury,</span> 0120092043 (2011), the Commission found that its administrative judge improperly fragmented a claim where after the complainant disclosed she had Parkinson’s Disease she was denied a detail, denied permission to serve in a back-up role, denied training and ultimately removed. In explaining in Rodriguez, that the claim was one of hostile work environment based on disability, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_815"></span>In the instant case, we find that the AJ improperly fragmented Complainant’s harassment claim. The Agency accepted Complainant’s complaint as challenging three adverse actions: the denial of the detail, the denial of her request to serve in a back-up role, and the denial of training. Although Complainant’s removal was not an accepted issue, we note that the EEO Investigator obtained supplemental statements from management officials regarding the removal. The AJ treated all of the adverse actions as separate claims, rather than considering them as part of an ongoing harassment claim. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, we find that Complainant’s complaint should be viewed as alleging one ongoing unlawful employment practice claim, that is, that the Agency allegedly subjected her to a hostile work environment based on disability when, after learning about her Parkinson’s disease, management officials repeatedly denied her career development opportunities. We find that the AJ erred by failing to recognize that Complainant was raising a claim of harassment that began with her removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that Complainant explicitly raised a harassment claim. In her August 23, 2007 request to amend her complaint, Complainant specifically stated that she wanted to include "hostile work environment/harassment as a basis." She also maintained that she was being subjected to harassment and cited the matter of her removal, the denial of her request to serve in a back-up role, and the denial of training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant’s affidavit also indicates that she was alleging an ongoing claim of harassment, beginning with her removal. This consisted of management continually denying her career development opportunities based on disability (and reprisal). Specifically, Complainant attested, “From the time management became aware of my disability and my subsequent EEO complaint, they have repeatedly denied me opportunities to further my development or to experience different duties and assignments…there's [sic] appears to be no end to the disparate treatment and reprisal." In addition, Complainant attested, "Once I notified [PM] of my Parkinson’s the disparate treatment began and started with the removal from my position as [QRM]." Further, Complainant attested, "If management continues to remove my name from lists or not consider me for assignments because of my Parkinson's, I will forever be denied the opportunity to advance in the Agency." Finally, Complainant attested, "Since I made management aware of my Parkinson's disease, it appears that every time I'm offered a developmental or other assignment, management slams the door. Now that I have filed an EEO complaint, I believe that the door has been slammed shut for all future opportunities." Complainant also testified at the hearing that her removal was related to her disability and that management began thinking, around the time of her removal, that she was "incapable of working."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's factual claims describe the means the Agency allegedly used to effectuate the hostile work environment: (1) her removal from a temporary promotional position; (2) her non-selection for a detail; (3) her non-selection as a back-up; and (4) the denial of training. See EEO MD-110, at Ch.5, III.A.2. (it is critical to understand the exact nature of the complainant's concerns so that the employment practice is defined broadly enough to reflect any allegation of a pattern of ongoing discrimination). The Commission has previously held that an Agency should not ignore the "pattern aspect" of a complainant’s claims and define the issues in a piecemeal manner where an analogous theme unites the matters complained of. <span class="italic">Meaney v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940169 (Nov. 3, 1994). Once an AJ is appointed, the AJ has full responsibility for the adjudication of the complaint. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(a). Accordingly, based on the factual allegations set forth by Complainant in the record, we find that the AJ erred by fragmenting Complainant's claim of harassment. We note that Complainant's hostile work environment claim includes her 2005 QRM removal, in addition to the incidents involving her non-selection for a detail, non-selection as a back-up, and denial of training.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="italic">Willia M. v. Veterans Affairs,</span> 2020005021 (2022), the complainant alleged five incidents that she claimed culminated into a hostile work environment. The Commission found that the AJ improperly fragmented the complainant's claim where he found that only one of five incidents was due to the complainant’s race and/or sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant is a member of a protected class, insomuch as she is African American, and she is female. It is uncontested that Complainant was also the subject of unwelcome verbal and physical conduct which involving her protected class. As to verbal conduct, Doctor 1 called Complainant and CW1 "monkey" in reference to an invitation. Both CW1 and Complainant considered this a racial slur. We note that the use of the term "monkey" to refer to an African American is an historically offensive racial slur. See EEOC's Compliance Manual, Section 15 "Race and Color Discrimination," No. 915.00 (Apr. 19, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the AJ found that this instance of claim 3, alone, was harassment as due to her protected class, the Commission notes that a pattern of harassment should not be ignored in a piecemeal manner. <span class="italic">See Meaney v. Dep’t of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940169 (Nov. 3, 1994) (an agency should not ignore the "pattern aspect" of a complainant's claims and define the issues in a piecemeal manner where an analogous theme unites the matter complained of). As such, the Commission will determine whether there was a pattern of harassment as outlined in the claims on appeal. In this case, we find that it does.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record clearly indicated that Complainant and CW1, both African American females, were physically assaulted by Doctor 1 as alleged in incident 4. The AJ found that this was not causally related to Complainant's protected classes, asserting, "I do not find the physical altercation occurred because of Complainant's race and/or sex just because it involved a white male and two black females." Rather, the AJ found that "[t]he incident occurred because CW1 and Doctor 1 had a disagreement over whether a computer would be removed from his office." Complaint File at 47. This finding is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding this to be the case, the AJ relied upon a portion of Doctor 1's unsworn statement to Agency police, given five days after the assault, in which he stated that he wanted CW1 to move the computer but she refused as the sole reason for the assault, which is in contradiction to Complainant and CW1. While it is true that an AJ's determination as to credibility of a hearing witness will be accepted as true, this is not at issue in regard to these statements; the AJ made no credibility determinations regarding the hearing witnesses on this issue. Doctor 1 was not present at the hearing and did not provide testimony before the AJ. Moreover, Doctor 1 did not provide a sworn affidavit for the record; despite numerous attempts by the Agency to contact Doctor 1, he did not respond. The statement upon which the AJ relies is an unsworn statement provided to the investigating Agency police officer five days after the assault and that statement was reported in the police report. The statement provided by Doctor 1 to the officer contained numerous inconsistencies, with Doctor 1 initially asserting that there was no contact between him and CW1, later stating he had never hit a woman prior to that event, and then stating he did not hit CW1. Due to the conflicting information provided by Doctor 1 in the police report, and the fact that the statement upon which the AJ relied is in contradiction to both CW1 and Complainant, both of whom provided affidavits and testified, under oath, in two hearings consistent with this series of events, we find that a reasonable mind would not find this statement as adequate to support a conclusion. <span class="italic">Universal Camera Corp.,</span> 340 U.S. at 477 (1951).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding Complainant, Doctor 1 asserted that Complainant was not in the room, but that he apologized to her.4 Moreover, the AJ specifically did not approve the inclusion of Chief of Urology, who saw all parties, and spoke to Doctor 1, immediately after the incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As nobody who testified and/or presented testimony under oath contests that Doctor 1 assaulted Complainant, Chief of Urology was excluded by the AJ, and the report of the police officer's account of Doctor 1's statement indicated Doctor 1 reported that Complainant was not even in the room, the Commission finds that there is no evidence within the record which supports the AJ's finding that Doctor 1's assault of Complainant and CW1 was merely due to a disagreement. We find that no reasonable mind could determine that Doctor 1's double hearsay statement in the police report, in which he asserts that Complainant was not even in the room, could find this credible evidence, given that it is uncontested that the assault occurred. <span class="italic">Universal Camera Corp.,</span> 340 U.S. at 477. Instead, we find that a preponderance of the evidence of record supports the conclusion that this physical assault and the subsequent continued contact between Doctor 1 and Complainant, as stated in incidents 4, 5, 7, 10, and 13, occurred as Complainant alleged and was based upon her protected classes.
</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have considered the testimony of CW3, upon which the AJ relied, who is an African American female nurse at the same facility. She stated that she worked with Doctor 1 and got along well. The AJ considered her testimony in finding that the assault was not race or sex based. The Commission need not address whether CW3 was credible, though we have no reason to doubt that she is, because she is not a valid comparator to extrapolate Doctor 1's treatment of all African American female nurses during the relevant time period. CW3 worked with Doctor 1 from 2013 until 2014. She was not working in the same area, nor with Doctor 1, at the time of the harassment complained herein. As CW3 did not work in the area with Doctor 1 at the time of the incident, and there is no contemporaneous evidence to infer that Doctor 1 treated people the same, regardless of race, a reasonable mind would not find this testimony to be adequate to support the conclusion that Doctor 1 treated all African-American female nurses well during the time in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, the Commission finds that there is no credible evidence upon which the AJ made his decision that the altercation was merely about a disagreement in moving office furniture. Considering the above, the Commission finds that the unwelcome physical and verbal conduct, the harassment, was based upon Complainant's protected class.</p>
