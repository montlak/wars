<h4 class="h4" id="sec18-106"><span class="space">3.</span> Burden of Proof</h4>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant does allege a security clearance matter within the Commission's narrow jurisdiction, he has the burden of not only alleging disparate treatment but proving disparate treatment. The case is analyzed along the lines of a traditional disparate treatment case with the burden falling on the complainant to demonstrate that the agency's reasons for any disparate treatment are a pretext for discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Valdez v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120063062 (2007), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that the Commission's authority to review cases involving security clearances is heavily circumscribed due to the decision of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Department of Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518 (1988). In that case the Court held that the MSPB had no jurisdiction to review the merits of a denial of revocation of a security clearance in the context of an adverse action premised on the employee's loss of or failure to obtain a security clearance. We therefore are not permitted to review the merits of security clearance decisions or the actual requirements of a clearance itself. We may only review to determine if clearance considerations are applied in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon analysis of the record and the arguments on appeal, we affirm the final agency decision. Complainant simply has not shown that the process by which management revoked his security clearance was riddled with discriminatory animus towards his race and/or national origin. Complainant's submission of 1999 congressional testimony indicating that other agency employees found to have engaged in visa fraud received--a lesser penalty than he is insufficient without specifics as to whether these other individuals were similarly situated to him and had engaged in actions substantially similar to those in which complainant had purportedly engaged. Moreover, we find that his claim <span id="Page_1605"></span>that the agency should have handled the matter as a performance rather than a security concern also fails because again he has not shown that the agency treated similarly situated employees outside of his protected class any differently than he.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As it stands, complainant's allegation is based on suspicions of discrimination, yet to prevail and withstand legal scrutiny, such suspicions must be supported by actual proof of discrimination. Otherwise, the suspicions are nothing more than statements of belief, which no matter how genuinely held, are not proof and do not hold legal weight. <span class="Italic">See George v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A31214 (July 28, 2003). We remind complainant that pretext can be demonstrated by "<span class="Italic">showing</span> such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the [Agency's] proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence." <span class="Italic">Dalesandro v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A50250 (Jan. 30, 2006) (<span class="Italic">citing Morgan v. Hilti, Inc.,</span> 108 F.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir. 1997) (emphasis added). However, complainant has not made that showing here.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1989, the Commission published Guidance on the Use of the National Security Exception Contained in &#x00A7; 703(g) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, wherein it is noted that Section 703(g) is an affirmative defense to a charge of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Jarrett C. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120172705 (2018), the Commission highlighted the importance of the agency's burden in this regard, reversing the agency's dismissal for failure to state a claim where the agency failed to prove its affirmative defense:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission does not have jurisdiction to review an agency's determination on the substance of a security clearance decision. Policy Guidance on the Use of the National Security Exception Contained in &#x00A7; 703(g) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as Amended, EEOC Notice No. N-915-041 (May 1, 1989) (Guidance); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 529 (1988). Section 703(g) is an affirmative defense to a charge of discrimination. This means that the Agency must raise it and prove the challenged employment decision was made because of national security requirements imposed by statute or Executive Order. It is not an unlawful employment practice to deny employment opportunities to an individual who does not fulfill the national security requirements of the position being filled. However, the legislative history of &#x00A7; 703(g) makes it clear that the Commission is not precluded from determining whether the grant, denial or revocation of a security clearance is conducted in a nondiscriminatory manner. <span class="Italic">Guidance</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency did not prove its affirmative defense. In a May 23, 2017, letter by the Agency's Assistant Director of Pubic and Governmental Affairs to a Congressman, the Agency advised that regarding the polygraph, Complainant passed the "National Security portion of the exam" but failed the "suitability portion" thereof. Hence, the record does not show that the polygraph results were related to the Agency's affirmative defense that Complainant was denied employment because he did not meet national security requirements (as opposed to suitability requirements).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that there is any question about the probity of the above letter since it came out of the Agency's Public and Governmental Affairs office rather than the Recruitment, Diversity, and Hiring Division or an Agency security function, we find that the Agency in its FAD did not accurately capture the wording of the July 1, 2016 letter, upon which it relied. Specifically, the letter reads:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...Upon receipt of your signed acknowledgement that successful completion of the training is required, favorable completion of your background investigation, polygraph examination, medical examination, and drug screening test result and upon the availability of related budgetary funding, you will be notified of the final employment decision....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Background Investigation and Polygraph: (emphasis in original) Applicants must successfully complete a background investigation to be eligible for a Top-Secret clearance. Enclosed you will find a Security Package for ATF Employment. The packet contains specific instructions and forms to be completed by you and returned to our office. In addition, you will be contacted and scheduled for a polygraph examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the letter reflects that applicants must pass a background investigation to be eligible for a Top-Secret clearance, nowhere therein is the purpose of the polygraph explicitly identified. The Agency has not shown that it rejected Complainant for employment because he did not fulfill national security requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his complaint, Complainant claimed that the ATF has allowed other applicants who fail the polygraph to retake the test, and indicated it should do the same for him. This allegation goes to something over which the EEOC has jurisdiction procedures, not the substance of a security clearance determination (even if the ATF showed the polygraph was part of the Top-Secret clearance process). <span class="Italic">Kingan v. National Security Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996328 (Feb. 15, 2002) (if a complainant alleged that an agency required female applicants to take a polygraph examination, but did not require such an examination for male applicants, it could review the process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We add that while the July 1, 2016 letter reflects that Complainant must complete a background investigation to be eligible for a Top-Secret clearance, it does not explicitly reflect that such a clearance is a requirement for the position, and even it did, there is no documentation in the record identifying the statute or Executive Order under which the position was designated a national security position with a requirement of a clearance, nor that the Agency so designated it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Al H. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120181043 (2019), involved a foreign services officer who alleged reprisal when the agency delayed the processing of his security clearance and pointed to incorrect information contained in his security file to support his discrimination claims. The Commission summarized the administrative judge's decision to dismiss the complainant's case for failure to state a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim because the Commission lacks jurisdiction to review the merits of an agency's clearance decision. The AJ explained as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Commission has repeatedly held that once statements gathered during a security clearance investigation are included in a security clearance investigative report, they are "squarely within the rubric of a security clearance determination and, accordingly, beyond the Commission's jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930248 (Apr. 14, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite Complainant's assertion to the contrary, the AJ found that issues 1 and 2 are predicated on the inclusion of statements and information in his security clearance investigative file. The AJ found Complainant did not allege his failure to receive promotions during the annual promotion cycles of 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 as free-standing discrete non-selection claims. The AJ concluded that since Complainant's claims were predicated on the inclusion of statements and information in his security clearance investigative file, they fell beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, citing to <span class="Italic">Schroeder and Complainant v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131718 (Jan. 22, 2015). These cases stand for the proposition that negative information in a security file is beyond the Commission's legal jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal to the Commission, <span class="Italic">Al H</span>. argued that his claims did not challenge a security clearance decision and that the <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> holding, as it related to information obtained from a security file, was narrower than the administrative judge's characterization. The agency countered in <span class="Italic">Al H</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]llowing an agency to maintain information in a security file, yet preventing it from doing anything with that information, would render <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> rule fairly meaningless. It argues that <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> holds that complainants may not challenge the presence of allegedly false statements in a security file, nor may they challenge harms alleged to flow from the presence of these statements. In support, the Agency cites three cases: <span class="Italic">Becky N. v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120162093 (Nov. 15, 2016), which it characterizes as holding the Commission lacked jurisdiction over claims that an investigator questioned the complainant about disparaging information provided by former supervisor; <span class="Italic">Haydee A. v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132668 (Jan. 19, 2016), which it characterizes as holding that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over a claim that a former colleague told an investigator that the complainant left a prior position due to poor writing skills; and <span class="Italic">Sleiman v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A41493 (July 29, 2004), which it characterized as holding that a complainant could not bring claims that challenged both the initiation of numerous investigations and the ultimate revocation of his security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reversed the dismissal for failure to state a claim and found that <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> established that "a complainant's allegation that his supervisors and coworkers made discriminatory utterances stated a claim--but the documentation thereof in the security investigative in of itself does not." In so finding, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Al H</span>. addressed each case cited by the agency and reasoned:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span>, the Commission granted, in part, the agency's request that the Commission reconsider its previous appellate decision deciding that the complainant's claim that the inclusion of allegedly discriminatory statements in his security file stated a claim. On reconsideration, the Commission recounted that the Agency argued that the background investigation is central to the clearance adjudication process, and the Commission looking into the contents of the security investigative report would interfere with the agency's discretion to make clearance determinations. The Commission recited the Agency's explanation that comments from coworkers, supervisors and neighbors are routinely obtained during the course of security clearance investigations and that all statements, whether true, false, misleading, derogatory or otherwise, are included in the security file for review of their adjudicatory relevance. <span id="Page_1606"></span>Accordingly, the Commission held that allegedly discriminatory utterances, once manifested in the security file, are squarely within the rubric of a security clearance determination and, accordingly, beyond the Commission's jurisdiction. But this rule was narrowly construed. The Commission found that the complainant's allegation, standing alone, that his supervisors and coworkers made discriminatory utterances stated a claim. The Commission was not persuaded by the agency's suggestion that investigating the complainant's claim of discriminatory utterances would have a chilling effect on the security clearance process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that while Complainant theorizes that the discrimination in issues 1 and 2 occurred because of allegedly false and discriminatory information in his security file, the essence of his EEO complaint is that he was subjected to disability discrimination and reprisal regarding his non-promotions and the delay in processing the renewal of his security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we disagree with the Agency's reading of the three cases it cites to show <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> not only stands for the proposition that information in a security file is squarely within the rubric of a security clearance determination and hence beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, but so are events that result therefrom even if they do not concern a security clearance determination. Below, we address the three cases the Agency cites to support its argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Becky N</span>., the complainant was a federal employee. The Commission ruled that the complainant's allegation that questions asked for a routine security clearance investigation by a security investigator about events that occurred when she worked for a prior federal employer did not state a claim of under <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span>. But unlike the Complainant's case which regards not receiving promotions and the delay in renewing his security clearance, <span class="Italic">Becky N</span>. regarded what questions a federal security investigator chose to ask to elicit information for a later determination on whether to renew a security clearance which implicates <span class="Italic">Egan</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Haydee A</span>., the complainant was employed by the Department of Homeland Security and alleged that someone there gave false statements about her writing skills during a Department of Defense background security investigation. Citing the <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> language that statements in a security clearance investigative report are beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission found that the complainant's allegation failed to state a claim. The <span class="Italic">Haydee A</span>. complainant did not identify who made the statement, and the Commission, observing there was no evidence the complainant's federal employer initiated the background investigation, found that the complaint failed to state a claim. The Commission implicitly found that what was at issue was the content of the security investigation file, which failed to state a claim. In the case before us, the focus is on the denial of promotions and delay in the processing of the renewal of his security clearance partly or fully because of information in his security file. This does not regard the contents of a security clearance file being used to make a security clearance determination, which implicates <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> and <span class="Italic">Egan</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Sleiman</span>, the issue initially accepted for investigation by the agency was but for the discriminatory harassment of the agency Intelligence and Security Office for the past 10 years, the complainant's security clearance would not have been suspended and revoked by the U.S. Army Central Clearance Facility (CCF). It is true that in <span class="Italic">Sleiman</span> the Commission wrote that the complainant's contention that agency officials in the past 10 years made false accusations about him which led to numerous investigations and the revocation of his security clearance was outside the Commission's jurisdiction. But the language that false accusations led to numerous investigations was <span class="Italic">dicta</span> because the Commission found that a fair reading of the record indicated that the complainant was alleging he was discriminated against when the CCF considered false accusations when it revoked his security clearance.4 As read, this puts the complaint within <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. In any case, <span class="Italic">Sleiman</span> is inapposite because it regards allegedly false information in a security investigative file being used to make a security clearance determination, not for some other purpose like discriminatorily denying promotions and delaying processing the renewal of a security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> holds that a complainant's allegation that his supervisors and coworkers made discriminatory utterances stated a claim--but the documentation thereof in the security investigative in of itself does not. This rule was designed to prevent Commission review of the substantive determinations in the security clearance process, which include what to put in a security clearance file and what to rely on therein to make the determination. But while what to put in security file and relied on therein to make a security clearance determination are outside the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission may review claims that promotions were denied and that processing a security clearance was delayed because of discrimination--even if the cause was allegedly partly or fully because of false information in a security file.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, the Commission follows <span class="Italic">Fields v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930468 (Dec. 23, 1993), which held that the complainant's allegation concerning the agency's delay in investigating and ultimate refusal to resolve her appeal on the suspension of her security clearance was within the Commission's jurisdiction since it does not concern the nature of the suspension decision, but the manner in which it was processed by the agency.</p>
