<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-24d"><span class="space">5.</span> "Regarded As" Disabled and Substantially Limited</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a case involving the direct threat analysis, if the complainant establishes she is otherwise qualified, then the issue of whether the complainant actually has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, to a degree, falls by the wayside. By disqualifying the complainant because of a medical condition, the agency essentially demonstrates that it regards the complainant as substantially limited in a major life activity, whether the complainant is so limited. This is particularly true under the ADA Amendments Act with its revised definition of the regarded as, or third prong, of the definition of disability. See Chapter 14 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-23-046.html#sec14-46">Regarded As Disabilities.</a>" Under the ADAAA, cases not involving reasonable accommodation are generally analyzed under the regarded as prong. Whether the complainant actually has an impairment and the degree of limitation any impairment imposes do not entirely drop from the analysis, however, because those issues must be examined to determine if the employee is a direct threat. For example, in <span class="Italic">Plambeck v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981021 (2002), the complainant did not specifically contend that a hearing impairment, disfigured fingers and the implantation of a plate in her foot actually constituted a disability. Instead, she maintained the she was disqualified from employment because the agency regarded her as disabled. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Plambeck</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next step in a claim of disability discrimination is that complainant must show that she is a qualified person with a disability. A "qualified" individual with a disability is one who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements for the employment position she holds or desires and can perform the essential functions of that position with or without reasonable accommodation. 29 CFR 1630.2(m). Based upon the facts in the record and for the purposes of further analysis, we find that complainant has demonstrated that she is a qualified person in as much as she was selected for the position at issue. The agency, however, determined, based upon the under-development of her fourth and fifth fingers, the piece of metal in her foot, and her hearing impairment, that complainant was unable to perform the essential functions of the position and placed her health and safety in jeopardy. The agency found that complainant posed a "direct threat" and, therefore, was unsuitable for employment. 29 CFR 1630.2(r).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to exclude an individual on the basis of possible future injury, the agency must show there is a significant risk; <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> high probability of substantial harm; a speculative or remote risk is insufficient. It must show more than that an individual with a disability seeking employment stands some slightly increased risk of harm<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The burden of showing a significant risk is on the agency<span class="Italic">. Selix v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000). Moreover, such a finding must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk, (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm, (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. Appendix to 29 CFR Part 1630, 1630.2 (r). A determination of significant risk cannot be based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation, or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. Rather, this requires that the employer gather and base its decision on substantial information regarding the individual's work and medical histories.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency made its decision to find complainant unsuitable for employment based on the MO's finding that complainant posed a risk of potential injury. The MO issued a medical assessment dated August 30, 1995, in which he determined that complainant's physical conditions restricted her from probably lifting more than twenty-five pounds, minimal hearing, and finger dexterity in her right hand. Based on the MO's conclusion, the agency found that complainant was not qualified for employment. In particular, the HRS indicated that complainant's condition would not allow her to perform the strenuous heavy lifting, carrying, walking, and use of fingers needed in the position in question. ROI, ex. 1, p. 1. Accordingly, the HRS concluded that the position would place complainant's personal health and safety in jeopardy<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having carefully considered the evidence of record, the Commission finds that the agency failed to meet its burden of showing a high probability of substantial harm. The agency's findings of unsuitability was not explained in any detail, nor did it include a specific statement addressing the nature and severity of the risk posed by complainant's condition. Furthermore, we find that the statements made by the MO in his assessment sheet contradict statements made and evidence provided by complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MO stated that complainant was restricted in hearing regular conversations at fifteen feet. Complainant argues that she can hear with her new hearing aid. She also indicated in her application for the Casual Clerk position that in her prior positions as a Certified Nurse's Aid, communications was vital to her work and there is no indication that she had any problems communicating with her patients. As to the claim that she could not do any fine manipulation due to her "little fingers," complainant indicated in her appeal that she crochets, develops film, and does other arts and crafts well. As for walking, the MO indicated that complainant could not "toe walk." There is no evidence in the record that complainant had difficulty walking. In fact, the record shows that as a Nurse's Aid, complainant was working long shifts and had to spend much of her time on her feet. As to heavy lifting and carrying, the HRS averred that these were essential functions of the position. The Casual Clerk position description indicates that the position "may involve the handling of heavy sacks of mail." ROI, ex. 5, p. 2 (emphasis added). The record does not support the HRS's claim that heavy lifting is a function of the position. The record indicates that it may be a task of the position, however, it clearly does not indicate that heavy lifting is an essential function.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the Commission finds that there is no evidence to support the agency's conclusion that complainant posed a direct threat, we conclude that the agency's denial of employment was discriminatory in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ward v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0720070029 (2012), the Commission found that an applicant for employment with a hearing impairment was not substantially limited in hearing because his audiologist stated that with hearing aids his hearing would improve "considerably" and "minimize[e] his overall handicap." Deciding the case under pre-ADAAA standards, the Commission, however, found that the complainant was perceived by the agency as substantially limited in the major life activity of working because if the employer's view was adopted the complainant would be disqualified for any jobs in an industrial environment. The Commission went on in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> to find that the agency had failed to conduct the required individualized inquiry in assessing the risk to the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Inasmuch as the Agency admits that it denied Complainant employment because of his perceived inability to safely perform the functions of the position, we will proceed to the issue of whether the Agency satisfied its burden of proof to establish that its disparate treatment of Complainant based on his disability was justified by a "direct threat" defense. A "direct threat" is defined as "a significant risk of substantial harm" which cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An Agency cannot exclude qualified individuals with disabilities from employment based upon fear of a future risk of injury. <span class="Italic">Zarate v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A00415 (Jan. 8, 2001); <span class="Italic">Holmes v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01977073 (Oct. 20, 2000). Rather, an Agency must make an individualized assessment of whether the individual poses a "direct threat" of substantial harm, taking into account: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); <span class="Italic">Massingill v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01964890 (July 14, 2000); <span class="Italic">Selix v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (Mar. 16, 2000). This assessment must be based on objective evidence, not subjective perceptions, irrational fears, patronizing attitudes, or stereotypes about the nature or effects of a particular disability or of disability generally. <span class="Italic">Boots v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03A40060 (Dec. 13, 2004). Relevant evidence may include input from the individual with a disability, his work history or experiences in previous positions, and opinions of medical doctors who have expertise in the particular disability or direct knowledge of the individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If it is determined that an individual does pose a direct threat because of his or her disability, the employer must determine whether a reasonable accommodation would eliminate the risk of harm or reduce it to an acceptable level. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that the Agency did not demonstrate that Complainant would have posed a direct threat to his safety or that of those around him if he were hired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record clearly demonstrates that the Agency was motivated by concern based upon fear of a future risk of injury. As noted above, AA indicated in his statement that he was concerned that Complainant would have to turn up the volume of his hearing aid and that this could worsen his hearing impairment. Further, HOAD found that "amplification would be contra-indicated to meet shipyard requirements when working in hazardous noise areas."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding this fear, however, we find that nothing in the record shows the duration of the risk to Complainant; the nature and severity of any potential harm; the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; or the imminence of any potential harm. Rather, the record simply contains AA's <span id="Page_1292"></span>opinion in general terms that individuals could be harmed if they use hearing aids in an industrial environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not contain any evidence whatsoever that the Agency conducted an individualized assessment to determine what harm, if any, Complainant would have been subjected to if he used his hearing aids in this specific work environment. The Agency provided Complainant with a speech recognition test and took steps to meet with Complainant and his father after the offer was revoked. However, the record is devoid of any evidence that the Agency took steps to analyze the work environment and Complainant's ability to work in such an environment. The record contains a document that shows the levels of decibels in Complainant's prospective worksite, however, there is no testimony explaining these result or how they would specifically affect Complainant. Additionally, it is clear from the record that hearing protection is required to work in the industrial environments of the Navy Shipyard. The Agency could have measured the noise levels in the environment and then assessed whether Complainant's risk of harm was less, the same or greater than other employees in the workplace. The Agency could have also assessed what types of hearing protection, if any, would have been available to Complainant with his hearing aids.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the record contains a "Standard Form 78," which lists the functional requirements of the "Electrical Installation &#x0026; Maintenance" Occupational Series in Shop 51. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 83. One of the functional requirement states "hearing (aid permitted)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find it unpersuasive that the Agency demonstrated that it was medically prohibited from hiring Complainant in this case. Without additional evidence that the Agency considered Complainant's specific impairments in the work environment at issue, we find that the Agency failed to establish that Complainant would have posed a direct threat to himself or others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record indicates that the Agency was motivated by stereotypes of individuals with impairments. AA provided affidavit testimony that when HOM called the shop Complainant would have been employed in, he was informed that the shop "could not hire someone with [Complainant's] restrictions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 50. AA also indicated that at some point thereafter, it was established that the shop "would not want to hire [Complainant] with work restrictions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that these statements reflect that the Agency did not want to hire Complainant based on preconceived ideas as to what an individual with his limitations was capable of doing. There is no evidence to show that Complainant could not perform the work as required. Instead, the Agency considered Complainant's impairments without any evidence regarding the actual implications of his impairments in the workplace. Consequently, the denial of employment to Complainant violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that under ADAAA standards, the analysis of whether the complainant is a qualified individual with a disability becomes much simpler. Instead of analyzing whether a complainant with a disability that is ameliorated by mitigating measures or devices is substantially limited in the major life activity of working, the case can be analyzed under the third-prong of the disability definition--i.e., whether the complainant was regarded as having such an impairment. An individual is regarded as having such an impairment if the agency acts on the basis of an impairment, regardless of whether the impairment limits or substantially limits a major life activity. 42 USC 12102(3)(A). The definition excludes minor and transitory impairments--i.e., impairments with an actual or expected duration of six months or less. So, in a case like <span class="Italic">Ward</span> where the agency clearly withdrew its offer of employment based on the complainant's hearing impairment which had an actual duration of more than six months, the agency would regard the complainant as an individual with a disability and the inquiry would proceed directly to the issue of direct threat.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case, <span class="Italic">Surprenant v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996186 (2001), the Commission found that a complainant who controlled his diabetes through medication and diet was not substantially limited in any major life activity. However, because the agency disqualified the complainant from driving tractor-trailers, the Commission found the complainant was substantially limited in the major life activity of working and that the agency's failure to conduct an individualized inquiry into the threat posed constituted discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Surprenant</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination as to whether an individual has an impairment which substantially limits a major life activity is made on a case by case basis<span class="Italic">. Bragdon v. Abbott,</span> 524 U.S. 624 (1998); Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 CFR 1630.2(j). Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which blood levels of glucose (a simple sugar) are abnormally high because the body does not release or use insulin adequately. Individuals with diabetes mellitus produce little to no insulin at all and thus must regularly inject it in order to control blood sugar levels. The primary problem controlling blood sugar levels is the increased chance of overshooting, resulting in hypoglycemia which can cause organs, specifically the brain, to malfunction or fail. Commission precedent has found that some individuals with diabetes mellitus are individual with disabilities within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, while others are not. In cases where the Commission has found a substantially limiting impairment, the diabetes itself has caused debilitating complications; medication has not successfully controlled the condition; or the regimen involved with monitoring and controlling the condition itself imposes a substantial limitation<span class="Italic">. See Ortiz v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01990911 (January 19, 2001), request for reconsideration pending, EEOC Request No. 05A10357. In cases where the Commission has not found coverage under the Rehabilitation Act, individuals have failed to show that the diabetes substantially limits them in a major life activity<span class="Italic">. See Drummond v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03990069 (March 6, 2000); <span class="Italic">Medina v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01990709 (February 15, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the record indicates that through the daily injection of insulin and monitoring of diet, complainant has been successful controlling his diabetes and has not suffered from any complications. His treating physician describes his blood sugar control as "excellent." There is no evidence in the record as to whether controlling his condition requires complainant to strictly monitor his blood sugar levels throughout the day or whether he has to pay strict attention to what, when, and how much he eats. On appeal, complainant does not contend that the effort required to maintain this control imposes substantial limitations on any one of his major life activities. Rather, he argues that the diabetes itself substantially limits him only in the major life activity of working, and in the alternative, that he was regarded as being substantially limited only in the major life activity of working. In his appeal statement, complainant argues that he is substantially limited in the major life activity of working because he cannot perform either a class of jobs due to his inability to operate vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds in interstate commerce or a broad range of jobs in various classes due to his need to only work the day shift.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The major life activity of working should only be considered if an individual is not substantially limited with respect to any other major life activity. Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 CFR 1630.2(j). Since complainant does not contend and the evidence of record does not indicate that he is substantially limited in other major life activities, we will consider the major life activity of working. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(3)(i). To be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job or a particular job of choice<span class="Italic">. Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc.,</span> 527 U.S. 471 (1999). The Commission finds that truck driving is a class of jobs, and because the DOT regulations preclude complainant from driving motor vehicles in excess of 10,000 pounds, he is significantly restricted in his ability to drive a truck as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that complainant is an individual with an impairment which substantially limits the major life activity of working. 29 CFR 1630.2(g)(1). Thus, we find the agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,</span> 527 U.S. 516 (1999) to be misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that there is no dispute between the parties that complainant had been successfully and safely driving tractor trailers for the past nine years and that there was no explanation besides the DOT safety standard for removing complainant from his position. Complainant argues that if, as a reasonable accommodation, the agency waived the safety requirement, he would be a qualified individual with a disability. In response, the agency contends that insulin dependent diabetics are not qualified to drive tractor trailers because they pose a direct threat, rooted in the unpredictability of the occurrence of a hypoglycemic episode. The agency further argues that formally restricting complainant only to yard work as opposed to over the road assignments would not diminish the threat he posed because of the constant high volume of motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic at the Springfield facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may require, as a qualification standard, that an individual not pose a direct threat. A "direct threat" is defined as "a significant risk of substantial harm" which cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 CFR 1630.2(r). The agency has the burden of proof regarding whether there is a significant risk of substantial harm<span class="Italic">. See Massingill v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01964890 (July 14, 2000). A determination as to whether an individual poses such a risk cannot be based on an employer's subjective evaluation or, except in cases of the most apparent nature, merely on medical reports<span class="Italic">. See Selix v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000). Rather, after identifying the risk, the employer must conduct an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 CFR 1630.2(r). This assessment must be based on objective evidence, not subjective perceptions, irrational fears, patronizing attitudes or stereotypes about the nature or effect of a particular disability or of disability generally. Relevant evidence may include input from the individual with a disability, his work history or <span id="Page_1293"></span>experiences in previous positions, and opinions of medical doctors who have expertise in the particular disability or direct knowledge of the individual with the disability. If it is determined that an individual does pose a direct threat because of his disability, the employer must determine whether a reasonable accommodation would eliminate the risk of harm or reduce it to an acceptable level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency failed to conduct an individualized assessment of complainant. We find that the agency's reliance on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Albertsons, Inc. v. Kirkingburg,</span> 527 U.S. 555 (1999) is misplaced since the employer in Albertsons, Inc. was required to abide by DOT regulations whereas in the instant case, the agency's adoption of the DOT regulations was purely voluntary. Accordingly, the agency should have conducted an individualized assessment of complainant rather than relying on the following statement made by one of its physicians:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Diabetics treated with insulin are prone to episodes of hypoglycemia which may be severe. Although some diabetics are more likely to have these episodes than others, to my knowledge, almost any diabetic may be subject to them. This is true even if the individual has never had such an episode. Variables such as changes in insulin dosage or type, injection site, food intake, physical activity, environmental temperature, body weight, and underlying state of health can change the response of the body to insulin and may result in an unpredictable hypoglycemic episode.... Whereas the operation of a motor vehicle requires constant mental vigilance, the occurrence of a severe hypoglycemic episode while engaging in such operation may lead to a serious fatal outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that there is no evidence that this agency physician had any expertise in the study of diabetes or any direct knowledge of complainant. Rather, the agency submitted evidence that as of 1991 complainant had experienced two hypoglycemic episodes in the previous six years: one of them, as described above, was considered mild and remedied by a spoonful of honey; there is no evidence concerning the severity of the other; and there is no evidence indicating that the agency was alarmed by or concerned with their occurrences. Moreover, there is no evidence that complainant experienced a hypoglycemic episode after 1991. Rather than seeking an opinion from complainant's own treating physician or even from the agency physician who examined complainant in December 1994, the agency concluded that an individualized assessment of complainant was unnecessary, since such an assessment would not conclusively determine whether complainant would have another episode. We note the error in the agency's reasoning insofar as the purpose of an individualized assessment is not to produce a conclusive result as to whether harm will occur but rather to determine whether there is a significant risk of substantial harm which cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Commission concludes that, as a result of its failure to conduct an individualized assessment of complainant, the agency did not meet its burden of proof with regard to whether complainant posed a significant risk of substantial harm. Consequently, we find that the agency discriminated against complainant on the basis of his disability when it reassigned him from his position as a Tractor Trailer Operator to the position of Vehicle Operations Assistant. We also find that because this is not a case where the agency made a "good faith effort" to reasonably accommodate complainant, the agency is not relieved of its obligation to award appropriate compensatory damages<span class="Italic">. See Teshima v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961997 (May 5, 1998). Therefore, we remand the case to the New York District Office for a determination regarding complainant's entitlement to remedies. In light of this finding, we decline to address the Administrative Judge's conclusion that complainant proved direct evidence of disability discrimination when the agency reassigned him to a Mail Handler position. In conclusion, we discern no basis to disturb the Administrative Judge's finding of discrimination, and we reverse the agency's final decision and remand the case in accordance with the Order below.</p>
