<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-48"><span class="space">6.</span> Interest on Back Pay</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whether or not interest is available on back pay awards has been a question subject to contradictory answers, depending on when the Commission was responding to the question. The enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides an affirmative answer to the question as it applies to Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Treadway v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A30237 (2003). With the adoption of Part 1614, the Commission provides that interest on back pay will be awarded where sovereign immunity has been waived. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(b)-(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">Originally, the Commission held that interest was not available in the federal sector on back pay awards pursuant to Title VII. <span class="Italic">Baca v. Department of Justice</span>, 01832045 (1985). The doctrine of sovereign immunity prohibited the assessment of interest because the United States had not consented to such interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">That consent, however, apparently was granted--at least under limited conditions--late in 1987. On December 22, 1987, a continuing budget resolution was enacted that amended the Back Pay Act to provide for interest on back pay awards in general, with some rather expansive exceptions. Sec. 623 of the Act, Pub. L. No. 100-202, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5596(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs (3) and (4), respectively; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;by adding after paragraph (1) the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(2)(A)&#x2003;An amount payable under paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection shall be payable with interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;such interest--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;shall be computed for the period beginning on the effective date of the withdrawal or reduction involved and ending on a date not more than 30 days before the date on which payment is made;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;shall be computed at the rate or rates in effect under section 6621(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 during the period described in clause (i); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;shall be compounded daily.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;Interest under this paragraph shall be paid out of amounts available for payments under paragraph (1) of this subsection"</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Effective Date--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Generally.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amendments made by subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply with respect to any employee found, in a final judgment entered on a final decision otherwise rendered on or after such date, to have been the subject of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, the correction of which entitles such employee to an amount under section 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Exception--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;Cases in which a right to interest was reserved--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall also apply with respect to any claim which was brought under section 5596 of title 5, United States Code, and with respect to which a final judgment was entered or a final decision was otherwise rendered before the date of the enactment of this Act, if, under terms of such judgment or decision, a right to interest was specifically reserved, contingent on the enactment of a statute authorizing the payment of interest on claims brought under such section 5596.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;Method of computing interest--The amount of interest payable under this paragraph with respect to a claim shall be determined in accordance with section 5596(b)(2)(B) of title 5, United States Code (as amended by this section).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1738"></span>Pursuant to this amendment, the Commission began to award interest on its back pay awards. The Commission held that in determining whether a successful complainant is entitled to interest on back pay, the critical date is not when the complaint was filed but when the decision became final. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05880523 (1988). If the decision still was subject to reconsideration or some higher level of review as of December 22, 1987, the complainant was entitled to interest on any back pay award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1990, the Commission reversed field and went back to its previous ways, finding that complainants are not entitled to interest on back pay awards. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05900606 (1990), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1985, the Commission adopted a policy statement on remedies in individual cases and, in 1987, incorporated that policy statement into its federal sector regulations as Appendix A to 29 CFR Part 1613, 52 Fed. Reg. 41920 (Oct. 30, 1987), codified at 29 CFR Part 1613, Appendix A (1989). That policy statement provides at paragraph 4 that "[i]nterest should be computed on all Net Backpay Due." 52 Fed. Reg. at 41934, codified at 29 CFR Part 1613, Appendix A (1989). In the preamble to the regulations, 52 Fed. Reg. at 41921, the Commission recognized that payments of interest by federal government agencies could not be made unless there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity. The Commission subsequently found that the 1987 amendments to the Back Pay Act constituted such a waiver. The Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, was amended on December 27, 1987, to provide for payment of interest on back pay awards "with respect to any employee found, in a final judgment entered or a final decision otherwise rendered on or after December 22, 1987, to have been the subject of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." Accordingly, the Commission had issued decisions awarding interest on back pay, finding that the 1987 amendments to the Back Pay Act waived sovereign immunity for the payment of interest. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hall v. Lyng</span>, EEOC No. 05880912 (Dec. 29, 1988). Nonetheless, an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice indicates the Back Pay Act or 1969, as amended, 5 USC 5596, does not serve as a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to federal agencies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds in the absence of a reversal of this opinion or a Congressional waiver of sovereign immunity or a definitive judicial interpretation specifically providing for interest on back pay at the administrative level, interest on back pay will not be awarded to federal applicants or employees who prevail in discrimination cases...(footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Michelson v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01912154 (1991), the Commission rejected the argument that <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214 (D.C. Cir. 1990), provided a definitive interpretation on the interest question. The court in Brown held that the Back Pay Act was a waiver of sovereign immunity for the purposes of obtaining interest on a back pay award under Title VII. However, the Commission refused to follow the lead of the D.C. Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent">For a brief period, the Commission held that when an agency enters into a settlement agreement that specifically provides for the payment of interest on a back pay award, that provision is construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity and the complainant is entitled to interest. In <span class="Italic">Corbbrey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01912082 (1991), the Commission found that the agency had breached a settlement agreement providing for the payment of interest on back pay, where it later reneged because interest on back pay is not authorized by law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency breached the settlement agreement by deciding not to provide interest on appellant's back pay award. In <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310, 54 U.S.L.W. 4951 (1986), cited by appellant, the Supreme Court held that when a complainant and a federal agency enter into an agreement to settle a complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and such agreement does not explicitly provide for interest, the complainant is not entitled to interest because Congress did not expressly waive the federal government's immunity against interest claims. The Court asserted, however, that a specific contractual provision for interest would waive such immunity and require interest to be paid. <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, 54 U.S.L.W. at 4593....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Moss v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01911368 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Attorney General, Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, 05901185 (1992), the Commission reversed its previous holding in <span class="Italic">Michelson</span> that <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Army</span> did not provide a definitive judicial interpretation that the 1987 amendment to the Back Pay Act was a waiver of sovereign immunity for prejudgment interest on back pay awards. Reviewing a claim that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> was entitled to interest on a back pay award stemming from a constructive discharge, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-2000e-17 (1988) (hereinafter referred to as "Title VII"), allows victims of discrimination to receive back pay and any other "equitable relief" in order to make them whole. However, at the time this complaint arose, Title VII did not contain any provision awarding prejudgment interest on back pay. Nor did it provide for a waiver of the government's immunity from interest awards. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310 (1986). The Supreme Court has found, however, that a waiver of sovereign immunity can be supplied by a separate statute. In <span class="Italic">Loeffler v. Frank</span>, 486 U.S. 549 (1988), the Supreme Court ruled that the Postal Reorganization Act's provision that the Postal Service could "sue, or be sued," constituted a waiver of immunity such that prejudgment interest could be paid in Title VII cases where an employee of the Postal Service has been discriminated against and back pay is awarded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the question now before the Commission is whether Congress, when it amended the Back Pay Act in 1987 to allow for interest on back pay awards, also waived the federal government's sovereign immunity from payment of interest on back pay under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act provides, in pertinent part, that "an employee of any agency who...is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances or differentials of the employee..." is entitled to back pay. 5 USC 5596(b)(1). The Back Pay Act did not originally provide for the payment of interest, but this changed when Congress amended the Back Pay Act in 1987 to provide that any amount payable under the Back Pay Act would be paid with interest. Pub. L. No. 100-202, 623, 101 Stat. 1329, 1329-428 to -429 (1987), (codified at 5 USC 5596(b)(2) (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a September 18, 1989, opinion, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel determined that the Back Pay Act did not serve as a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to Title VII and ADEA claims against federal agencies, and therefore, federal employees who were discriminated against were not entitled to prejudgment interest on their back pay awards. The Commission has previously found that in the absence of a reversal of this opinion or a Congressional waiver of sovereign immunity or a definitive judicial interpretation specifically providing for interest on back pay at the administrative level, interest on back pay will not be awarded to federal applicants or employees who prevail on their discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">Thomas S. Hall v. Clayton Yeutter, Secretary, Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05891002 (June 1, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This policy was followed in our previous decision, and appellant was denied interest on her back pay award. In her request to reopen, appellant contends that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and the District Court decision in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> provide the definitive judicial interpretation necessary for the Commission to allow interest to be awarded on back pay awards for federal employees who prevail on their Title VII claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Army</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the D.C. Circuit found that the Back Pay Act waived sovereign immunity from payment of interest on back pay under Title VII and that federal employees who prevailed on their Title VII claims could be paid interest if they had been affected by "an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" that resulted in the "withdrawal or reduction" of all or part of their compensation. With respect to the plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the court found that they did not meet this criteria as they were challenging discriminatory promotion actions. The court ruled that unless the promotion at issue is of the "virtually automatic, noncompetitive kind," the plaintiffs had no right to the promotions, and therefore, the Back Pay Act afforded them no relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is persuaded that the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decision provides, at this time, a definitive judicial interpretation that the Back Pay Act provides for a waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity against the payment of prejudgment interest on back pay awards made in Title VII cases. The Commission notes, however, that the D.C. Circuit decision limits the Back Pay Act's waiver of sovereign immunity to only those cases which have resulted in the "withdrawal or reduction" of all or part of an employee's compensation (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, terminations and non-competitive, mandatory promotion actions), as a result of an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action. Accordingly, the Commission will only award interest on back pay where a finding of discrimination has been made on a personnel action which falls within the parameters set forth in the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, appellant was subjected to an unwarranted personnel action when she was forced to resign from her Special Agent trainee position because of her failure to meet a discriminatory training requirement. This had the effect of constructively discharging appellant from her position. The agency found that appellant, as a member of the class which was discriminated against, was entitled to an award of back pay, which appellant received, but that the issue of the payment of interest was to be decided by the agency's Complaint Adjudication Officer. The Complaint Adjudication Officer denied appellant's claim for interest on her back pay award and appellant appealed to the Commission for a reversal of this ruling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since appellant's resignation or constructive discharge resulted in the withdrawal of all of her compensation as a Special Agent with the agency, and was a consequence of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, appellant falls within the coverage of the Back Pay Act. Accordingly, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to interest on her back pay award.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1739"></span>On reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Corbbrey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05910885 (1992), the Commission followed its holding in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, reaffirming its position that the Back Pay Act provided the appropriate waiver of sovereign immunity, but imposing the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> restrictions on such awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Presently at issue is the agency's contention that notwithstanding the terms of the October, 1990 settlement agreement, the agency does not have the authority to pay appellant interest on his back pay award. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., (hereinafter referred to as Title VII), allows victims of discrimination to receive back pay and any other "equitable relief" in order to make them whole. However, at the time this complaint arose and the settlement agreement at issue was entered into, Title VII did not contain any provision awarding prejudgment interest on back pay. Nor did it provide for a waiver of the government's immunity from interest awards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Supreme Court has found, however, that a waiver of sovereign immunity can be supplied by a separate statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that Federal employees pursuing discrimination claims are entitled to interest on back pay awards, in the absence of the application of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, it is through the application of the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, to those awards. The Back Pay Act provides, in pertinent part, that "an employee of any agency who...is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances or differentials of the employee..." is entitled to back pay. 5 USC 5596(b)(1). The Back Pay Act did not originally provide for the payment of interest, but this changed when Congress amended the Back Pay Act in 1987 to provide that and amount payable under the Back Pay Act was payable with interest. Therefore, the necessary inquiry is whether Congress, when it amended the Back Pay Act to allow for interest on back pay awards, also waived the Federal government's immunity from payment of interest on back pay under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a September 18, 1989 opinion, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel issued a memorandum which concluded that the Back Pay Act of 1969, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 5596, did not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to Title VII and ADEA claims against Federal agencies, and therefore, Federal employees who were discriminated against were not entitled to prejudgment interest on their back pay awards. Based on this memorandum, the Commission's position was that in the absence of a reversal of this opinion, a Congressional waiver of sovereign immunity, or a definitive judicial interpretation specifically providing for interest on back pay at the administrative level, interest on back pay would not be awarded to Federal applicants or employees who prevailed on their discrimination claims. This position was set forth in <span class="Italic">Thomas S. Hall v. Clayton Yeutter, Secretary, Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05891002 (June 1, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A recent court decision has led the Commission to reexamine its position on interest on back pay. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214 (D.C. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 112 S. Ct. 57 (1991), the D.C. Circuit found that the Back Pay Act provides a waiver of sovereign immunity from payment of interest on back pay under Title VII, and that Federal employees who prevail on their Title VII claims could be paid interest if they have been affected by "an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" that has resulted in the "withdrawal or reduction" of all or part of their compensation. With respect to the plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the court found that they did not meet this criteria as they were challenging discriminatory promotion actions. The court ruled that the Back Pay Act's waiver of the government's sovereign immunity did not authorize prejudgment interest on back pay awards to Federal employees denied competitive promotions in violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 218-21. The court stated that unless the promotion at issue is of the "virtually automatic, noncompetitive kind," the plaintiffs had no right to the promotions, and therefore, the Back Pay Act afforded them no relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is persuaded that the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decision provides, at this time, a definitive judicial interpretation that the Back Pay Act provides for a waiver of the Federal government's sovereign immunity against the payment of prejudgment interest on back pay awards made in Title VII cases; however, the D.C. Circuit found that the Back Pay Act's waiver of sovereign immunity was limited to only those cases which have resulted in the "withdrawal or reduction" of all or part of an employee's compensation (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, terminations and non-competitive, mandatory promotion actions), as a result of an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action. Accordingly, the Commission finds that, absent application of the amendment to Title VII contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, interest on back pay is appropriate only when the underlying personnel action falls within the parameters set forth in the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Eileen Sullivan v. William P. Barr, Acting Attorney General, Department of Justice, (Federal Bureau of Investigation)</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901185 (March 2, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's previous decision ruled that appellant was entitled to interest on his award of back pay, as the settlement agreement provided for such interest. The agency argues that it is without the statutory authority to comply with its agreement to pay interest; however, in light of the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decision, this may or may not be the case. The record before the Commission fails to establish the nature of the underlying employment action which led to appellant's complaint; therefore, the Commission is unable to determine whether the waiver of sovereign immunity provided for in the Back Pay Act, as amended, allows for interest in appellant's case. Accordingly, the Commission cannot definitively address the agency's argument that it did not have the statutory authority to pay appellant interest on his back pay award, as it agreed to do in the October, 1990 settlement agreement. Therefore, this matter must be remanded to the agency for further processing. If, on remand, the agency determines that the personnel action at issue falls within the parameters set forth in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, then the agency will have the statutory authority to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement, and pay appellant interest on back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If, in the alternative, the agency determines that the personnel action at issue does not fall within the parameters set forth in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, and that the agency does not have the statutory authority to comply with the interest provision of the settlement agreement, the agency shall give appellant the option of either: (1) requiring the agency to perform on the settlement agreement except for the interest provision at issue; or (2) considering the agreement unenforceable due to the interest provision, and reinstating his complaint for processing from the point processing ceased under the terms of the agreement. The Commission advises appellant that if he chooses to reinstate his complaint, the consequences of doing so will render the settlement agreement null and void, which shall result in, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the reinstatement of the underlying personnel action, and the repayment to the agency of any monies appellant has received to date pursuant to the settlement agreement. (footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The question of interest on back pay awards was finally resolved by Congress in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Section 114, codified at 42 USC 2000e-16(d), provides that the government is liable for interest on back pay awards to the same extent as private employers. The Commission's 1992 amendments to Part 1614 provided for awards of interest where sovereign immunity has been waived. This provision was carried forward without change in the 1999 amendments to Part 1614. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(b)-(c). In somewhat cryptic comments accompanying the 1992 notice of final rulemaking, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the process of developing proposed part 1614, EEOC considered proposals to require payment of interest on back pay in discrimination cases and to provide for awards of attorney's fees in Age Discrimination in Employment Act cases. The Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, at the Department of Justice advised us, however, of his opinion that the Back Pay Act of 1966, 5 USC 5596, does not serve as a waiver of sovereign immunity for those purposes. Therefore, we provided in proposed &#x00A7; 1614.501 that interest on back pay may not be awarded to federal applicants or employees who prevail in discrimination claims. Proposed &#x00A7; 1614.501(e) remained unchanged from its counterpart in part 1613; that is, the attorney's fees awards provisions shall apply to allegations of discrimination or retaliation prohibited by title VII and the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some commenters suggested that the Department of Justice's opinion is incorrect and that EEOC should award interest on back pay and attorney's fees on ADEA complaints. EEOC asked the Attorney General to reconsider the Assistant Attorney General's opinion. The Attorney General forwarded the Commission's request to the Assistant Attorney General who notified the EEOC that he was adhering to the conclusion of his earlier memorandum. We note that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia recently ruled against the Justice Department's position, finding that the Back Pay Act waived sovereign immunity for the award of interest on backpay in employment discrimination cases. <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214 (1990). A few commenters also noted that the proposal went too far when it stated that interest may never be paid on back pay awards under part 1614 since sovereign immunity has been waived for some agencies, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the Postal Service. Further, section 114 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Public Law No. 102-166 (1991), amends section 717 of title VII to provide for the payment of interest on back pay. Consequently, the regulation provides for payment of interest where sovereign immunity has been waived.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Norwood v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05920645 (1993), the Commission affirmed its previous holding in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>. It also made clear in <span class="Italic">Norwood</span> that the interest is obtainable in cases arising under the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the agency challenges the Commission's reliance on a single appellate court decision, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, to reverse its position on this issue. We are persuaded that the judicial reasoning in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> affords the basis for concluding that the Back Pay Act provides for a waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity against the payment of <span id="Page_1740"></span>prejudgment interest on back pay awards made in Title VII cases under certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">Brown</span> allowed that in those cases resulting in the "withdrawal or reduction" of all or part of an employee's compensation, the Back Pay Act's waiver may be applied to afford payment of prejudgment interest. Those criteria were considered by the Commission in its decision in the <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> case and exist in the instant matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the agency challenges the applicability of a Title VII remedy to cases arising under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This argument is completely without merit. The remedies and procedures for implementing those portions of Title VII covering federal employment apply to implementation of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 CFR 1613.708. By extension, therefore, the ruling in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> providing for payment of prejudgment interest on a back pay claim is similarly applicable to cases arising under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's final argument is that the 1991 Civil Rights Act's (CRA) provision providing for payment of prejudgment interest to prevailing federal employees demonstrates that Congress intended to change the law from what existed previously. The decisions in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> held that the Backpay Act provided a limited waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to interest on backpay. The Commission finds that the CRA's provision affording interest on back pay in federal sector EEO cases expanded the waiver of sovereign immunity "to compensate for delay in payment as in cases involving nonpublic parties."</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent">The statutory entitlement to interest on back pay comes under both the Back Pay Act and the 1991 Civil Rights Act. However, the entitlement under each statute is different. Under the Back Pay Act, interest only is available if the personnel action results in a loss or reduction in pay. Under the Back Pay Act, therefore, a competitive promotion does not form the basis for an interest award because no pay was lost or reduced. Only the failure to obtain a career ladder promotion would result in an award of interest. Although the scope of the interest provision of the 1991 Civil Rights Act is broad enough to provide for interest on all personnel actions, including a competitive promotion, interest is not available for acts occurring on or before November 21, 1991. As the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Bass v. Attorney General</span>, 05960082 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The prior decision awarded interest under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596(b)(2)(A) (BPA). The BPA provides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity against the payment of prejudgment interest on back pay awards in Title VII cases. Under the BPA, an employee is entitled to interest on back pay only if s/he meets certain requirements<span class="Italic">. Sullivan v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901185 (March 2, 1992), <span class="Italic">citing Brown v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214 (D C. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 502 U.S. 810 (1991). Under the express terms of the Act, prejudgment interest is allowed in cases resulting in the "withdrawal or reduction" of all or part of an employee's compensation<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC 5596 (b)(1). In <span class="Italic">Ramsey v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940658 (July 27, 1995), the Commission held that where the BPA did not provide for a waiver of sovereign immunity and allow an award of prejudgment interest, the CRA 1991 would limit such awards to the time period following the November 21, 1991 effective date of the CRA 1991. As a general rule, denial of a promotion or a grade increase does not constitute a reduction in compensation<span class="Italic">. See Ramsey; Todd v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942915 (August 23, 1995). In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the court ruled unless the promotion at issue was noncompetitive and mandatory, the BPA would not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the issue that must be addressed is whether the career ladder promotion appellant alleges she was discriminatorily denied is of the required, mandatory type of action covered by the Back Pay Act. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Request No. 05921059 (June 24, 1993), the Commission held that where the record demonstrated that the promotion was noncompetitive and that the agency had no choice but to promote appellant once specified conditions were met, the promotion was, in effect, mandatory<span class="Italic">. See also Davis v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930804 (August 4, 1993). A review of the record herein indicates that appellant's promotion to GS-9 was noncompetitive. In particular, we note that the agency admitted discriminating against appellant when it failed to promote her in May 1989, thus demonstrating that it had determined that she had met the prerequisites for the career ladder promotion. Moreover, the record includes a memorandum and affidavit from appellant's supervisor noting that appellant had met the prerequisites for promotion to the GS-9 position. For these reasons, the Commission finds that the prior decision correctly ordered the agency to pay appellant interest on the back pay awarded for the May 8-June 9, 1989 period, following appellant's promotion to GS-9. Accordingly, the Commission DENIES the agency's request for reconsideration of this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the prior decision did not err when it ordered an award of prejudgment interest for the period following appellant's termination. Once the agency terminated appellant, she suffered a withdrawal of all of her compensation and the BPA provides for her recovery of interest on the back pay award. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the prior decision did not err when it awarded appellant prejudgment interest on her back pay award for the period June 9, 1989 through the date of her reinstatement and DENIES the agency's request for reconsideration as to this part of the order set forth in the prior decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, when a deprivation of pay from a nonselection that occurred prior to the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act continues after the effective date, the complainant is entitled to interest from November 21, 1991 until the pay deprivation is corrected. <span class="Italic">Morelli v. Attorney General</span>, 01990248 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prejudgment interest extends to retroactive career ladder promotions. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 05921059 (1993), the Commission rejected an agency argument that such promotions fell outside the parameters of the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ppellant argues that this is a career ladder promotion, that a career ladder promotion is noncompetitive and automatic, and that as such, it is the type of action entitled to interest under the provisions of the Back Pay Act, as amended, 5 USC 5596. The fact that an employee must meet certain preconditions for the career ladder promotion, she contends, does not make it less automatic. For its part, the agency maintains that a career ladder promotion is not mandatory or nondiscretionary, and therefore is not the type of action covered by the Back Pay Act. The agency points to the agency's Merit Assignment Program, which is in the investigative file, and in an Exhibit referenced in the Program which was submitted to the Commission in connection with the RTR. Under these policies, a promotion up the career ladder depends on an employee having a satisfactory performance rating, sufficient time-in-grade (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the one-year time-in-grade required by civil service qualification requirements), and a demonstrated ability to perform at the next higher level. In addition, there must be a management decision to establish the higher graded position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act, as amended, has been held to be a waiver of sovereign immunity which provides for payment of prejudgment interest on back pay awards in certain types of Title VII cases. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214 (D.C. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 112 S. Ct. 57 (1991). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Eileen Sullivan v. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901185 (March 2, 1992), determined that <span class="Italic">Brown</span> provided a definitive judicial interpretation of the Back Pay Act which specifically provided interest on back pay at the administrative level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision apparently followed our pre-<span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> policy in finding that interest is not available to appellant. Since the previous decision failed to apply existing policy, it must be reconsidered. In <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, the Commission noted that the waiver of sovereign immunity applies to only those cases which have resulted in the "withdrawal or reduction" of all or part of an employee's compensation (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, terminations and non-competitive, mandatory promotion actions) that are a result of an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action. The Court in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> noted that the legislative history of the 1978 amendment to the Back Pay Act, as well as background regulations, repeatedly described actions that are covered by the Back Pay Act with the words "mandatory," "nondiscretionary," and "require(d)." The Court read those words "to mean that the agency never had any choice but to take the particular, precisely defined action in question." <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 918 F.2d at 220. Also instructive in the context of the instant case was the Court's statement that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(W)e comprehend the 1978 Back Pay Act definitional amendment to mean that if an upgrade is mandatory once specified conditions are met, the Act now affords a retrospective remedy. If an upgrade is not of that virtually automatic, noncompetitive kind, the Act affords no relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">918 F.2d at 220. The Commission has determined that under the particular facts of this case, the subject career ladder promotion is of the required, mandatory type of action covered by the Back Pay Act. It is, as the agency policies show, noncompetitive. Moreover, the agency decided to offer appellant a retroactive career ladder promotion, demonstrating that it had determined that the prerequisites for the career ladder promotion were met, including a determination to create the higher graded position. Consequently, since the specified conditions were met, the agency had no choice but to promote appellant once she accepted the offer. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.215(a)(7). Accordingly, the Commission finds that the career ladder promotion was, in effect, mandatory. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 918 F.2d at 220. Therefore, the Commission finds that the agency's offer, in failing to provide for interest on back pay, did not constitute an offer of full relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">Interest is only computed based on the net back pay and not the gross back pay. In other words, taxes are deducted before the interest is calculated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Haines v. Postmaster General</span>, 01974634 (1999). In the <span class="Italic">Haines</span> case, the Commission also held that it is the Secretary of Treasury overpayment rate under 26 USC 6621(a) and the Federal Judgment Interest rate that applies in calculating interest on back pay awards.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission elaborated on the interest rate for back pay awards in <span class="Italic">Yovan v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520130302 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1741"></span>Complainant has not shown that the previous decision erroneously concluded that the Agency complied with the Commission's order concerning the calculation of interest on back pay. Revenue Ruling 2010-31 explains that the overpayment rate, which is the rate used to compute interest on back pay, "is the sum of the federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points." Thus, since the Agency used the overpayment rate, there is no merit to Complainant's assertion that the Agency's calculations failed to include "the extra 3%." Further, the spreadsheet prepared by the Chief of the Payroll Branch identifies the "Compounded Interest Factor" used to calculate the interest paid to Complainant. Complainant has not shown that the previous decision erroneously accepted the Agency's methods for calculating interest. Accordingly, we find that Complainant has not shown that the previous decision involved a clearly erroneous interpretation of material fact or law or will have a substantial impact on the Agency's policies, practices, and operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sherrod v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05950301 (1996), the decision whether to hire the complainant was discretionary. Contrary to the complainant's assertions, the agency's failure to hire him for a motor vehicle operator position was not deemed to have resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the complainant's compensation. Likewise, the failure to hire did not support an interest award.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant is required to cooperate with the agency in its back pay calculations. That cooperation includes filling out any required paperwork for processing of the award. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 04990033 (2001), the Commission held that the complainant's refusal to complete the required paperwork cut off any accrual of interest from the time of the complainant's refusal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote in <span class="Italic">Longus v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01941038 (1994), the Commission found that a complainant was not entitled to interest when an agency allegedly delayed paying a performance award under a settlement agreement. Without analysis, the Commission simply noted that the agreement did not provide for interest and, thus, the agency was not required to pay interest. It was unclear whether the rule enunciated in this footnote generally applied to all settlement agreements. However, it is better that the issue of interest be squarely addressed in the agreement to avoid later disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since <span class="Italic">Longus</span>, the Commission has held that when a settlement agreement provides for back pay but is silent on the issue of interest, the agency is not required to pay interest. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01943841 (1994). The Commission noted that, unless specifically provided in the agreement, interest is based on a finding of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962387 (1996), the Commission reaffirmed its position that unless a settlement agreement explicitly provides for interest on back pay, the employee is not entitled to such interest:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant raised the issue of interest in her prior appeal to the Commission. However, the Commission found that the terms of the settlement agreement did not provide for the payment of interest and that any such expectations should have been reduced to writing as part of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. Hanson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942669 (June 20, 1994). When neither party filed a request for reconsideration within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Commission's decision, that decision became final and binding on the parties under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.405(b). Therefore, the agency was not required to consider the issue of interest or provide the appellant with interest on her back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the agency will be ordered to pay interest where it substantially delays payments due under a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Parks v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05970925 (2000) (interest is appropriate where the agency delayed payment for over two years).</p>
<p class="noindent">A cash performance award is subject to the provisions of the Back Pay Act and, thus, interest is payable on such an award. <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Attorney General</span>, 01933184 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a reassignment results in the reduction of income, a complainant is entitled to interest on any back pay award. <span class="Italic">Cotton v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01932096 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a conditional job offer is withdrawn on a discriminatory basis, the complainant is not entitled to interest on a backpay award. In <span class="Italic">Sherrod v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01941439 (1994), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]s noted above, appellant may only be awarded interest if the unwarranted personnel action resulted in a "withdrawal or reduction" in pay. We find the withdrawal of appellant's tentative job offer does not meet this criteria. First, unlike the complainant in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, appellant never actually started the subject position nor was he put on the rolls of the agency. Further, while appellant was tentatively offered the position by one agency official, the offer was apparently disapproved prior to any official personnel action being taken on appellant's application. In short, we find that the General Foreman's decision to disapprove appellant's conditional hire cannot be considered a "withdrawal" of compensation, since appellant was never actually in a position to receive compensation or benefits from the agency. In so finding, we note that at the time of his application, appellant had no employment relationship with the agency....</p>
<p class="noindent">When interest is payable on a back pay award, interest continues to accrue up until the time the agency actually issues a check for the back pay and interest. For example, in <span class="Italic">Meza v. Postmaster General</span>, 04950025 (1996), the Commission found it was error for the agency to pay interest only until the date of the complainant's reinstatement. Instead, the Commission found the agency was obligated to pay interest to the complainant for an additional five months, which is how long it took the agency to issue the actual check for back pay.</p>
