<h2 class="h2" id="sec17-36"><span class="space">III.</span> PROTECTED ACTIVITY--OPPOSITION CLAUSE</h2>
<p class="noindent">An employee who opposes practices made illegal by Title VII, but does not participate in any complaint process, is protected from reprisal. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Tynes v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01913033 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Judicial interpretations of the protection afforded by Section 704(a) have consistently rejected the interpretation that only individuals who have participated in the EEO process are covered in private sector EEO matters. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Novotny v. Great American Savings and Loan Association</span>, 584 F.2d 1235 (3rd Cir. 1978), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds</span>, 442 U.S. 336 (1979), where the Court concluded "...[t]hat section 704(a) of Title VII prohibits retaliation against employees for reasonable opposition to unlawful employment practices <span class="Italic">even when such opposition is not manifested through participation in Title VII proceedings.</span>" (emphasis by Commission)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal courts, when discussing the issue of the protection of federal employees from retaliation, have generally held that federal employee protection is coextensive with the protection of employees in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Alexander</span>, <span class="Italic">sub nom v. Marsh</span>, 664 F.2d 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Avon v. Sampson</span>, 547 F.2d 446 (9th Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Canino v. EEOC</span>, 707 F.2d 468 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The opposition clause applies "regardless of whether the opposition activity involves allegations which the employer accurately asserts are false." <span class="Italic">Booker v. Attorney General, INS</span>, 01933842 (1994). Moreover, the opposition can be either explicit or implicit. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 at II.A.2. (2016), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The anti-retaliation provisions make it unlawful to discriminate against an individual because s/he has opposed any practice made unlawful under the employment discrimination statutes. This protection applies if an individual explicitly or implicitly communicates to his or her employer or other covered entity a belief that its activity constitutes a form of employment discrimination that is covered by any of the statutes enforced by the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant need not directly participate in the EEO complaint process in order to oppose discriminatory employment practices. In <span class="Italic">Wilfredo B. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120170327 (2017), the complainant alleged that the agency subjected him to reprisal for prior protected EEO activity. The agency dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, concluding that the complainant's opposition was for mere favoritism, which is not protected activity. Upon review of the facts, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Wilfredo B</span>., disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant, in his emails to management and Agency officials, made various statements pertaining to his race and suggesting that he was being treated differently. For example, Complainant in an email to a human resource specialist, dated February 18, 2016, stated "why is it when a black man put what he [has] to say [in writing] to a white man he find[s] out that he [has] pending disciplinary action when he leave[s] a ship." The human resource specialist interpreted Complainant's email to suggest an allegation of discrimination. Specifically, the human resource specialist responded via email dated February 18, 2016, and stated "[g]iven that you have mentioned your belief that race has played a factor in the pending proposed discipline and denial of your training attendance, you may contact the EEO Manager...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the record contains other emails from Complainant to other Agency officials referencing race and suggesting that he was being treated differently based on his protected class. In an email dated December 21, 2015 to an Agency official, Complainant stated, in pertinent part, "why did the Chief...ask some of the other black watch standers that have been here over one year [if they wanted] to be a day worker? What was the problem...ask the black people?" Based on Complainant's various statements, we find that Complainant was conveying opposition or resistance to a perceived EEO violation rather than just favoritism based on a non-EEO protected class. Thus, we find Complainant has set forth an actionable claim of reprisal under the opposition clause.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are, of course, certain hazards involved in opposing discriminatory practices without directly participating in any complaint process, because an employee is not free to interfere with the orderly conduct of business. In <span class="Italic">Mattern v. USPS</span>, 01850054 (1986), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[U]nder the protected opposition provision of the Act, appellant can set forth a proper claim of reprisal if: (1) the challenged employment practice violates Title VII, (2) she possessed a good faith, reasonable belief that it did, or (3) she possessed a subjective, good faith belief that Title VII was violated by the practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mattern</span>, the employee's opposition related solely to the performance of work under the collective bargaining unit and was not related to Title VII and, thus, was not protected.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like the participation clause, the opposition clause is broad in scope. In <span class="Italic">Whipple v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01924233 (1992), the Commission observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A variety of activities has been found to constitute opposition. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Index Journal Co.</span>, 647 F.2d 441 (4th Cir. 1981) (complaints to superiors regarding employment discrimination); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Red Baron Steak Houses</span>, 47 FEP Cases 49 (D.N.D.C. Cal. 1988) (refusal to fire an employee because she is pregnant); <span class="Italic">Payne v. McLemore's Wholesale &#x0026; Retail Stores</span>, 654 F.2d 1130 (5th Cir. 1981) (boycott, protests, and picketing against employment discrimination). Because the enforcement of Title VII depends on the willingness of employees to oppose unlawful employment practices or policies, courts have interpreted section 704(a) of Title VII as intending to provide "exceptionally broad protection" to those who oppose such practices. <span class="Italic">Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co.</span>, 411 F.2d 998, 1006 n.18 (5th Cir. 1969). EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.261 provides similar protection. These same principles also apply under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission noted that the fact that an appellant's claim is not cognizable--as in this case--will not negate a claim of reprisal discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Wolf v. J.I. Case Co.</span>, 617 F. Supp. 858, 868 (E.D. Wis. 1985), the federal district court noted that "all federal appellate courts that have considered the scope of Title VII's opposition clause...have held that protection under the clause extends to all situations where the employee has a reasonable, good faith belief that the challenged employment practice violates Title VII, even if the belief is later found to be mistaken...The mistaken belief may be one of law or of fact." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Porter v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950292 (1995), the Commission found that a complainant who alleged retaliation for being involved with an effort by the NAACP to increase the level of black employees in a certain post office stated a claim for relief under the opposition clause. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Leonard v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01994132 (1999), the Commission found that contact with an agency inspector general concerning discrimination was protected opposition activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the opposition clause does not require an employee to be correct in their belief that the practice he or she is opposing actually violates Title VII. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Ihrcke v. Postmaster General</span>, 01892686 (1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he anti-reprisal section of Title VII protects employees who "oppose" discriminatory practices as well as those who formally "participate" in the EEO process. The effective enforcement of Title VII depends in a very large part on the initiative of individuals who oppose employment policies or practices which are reasonably believed to be unlawful. <span id="Page_1487"></span>Protesting or otherwise opposing suspected discrimination serves to alert agencies to possible violations and allows them the opportunity to examine the matter brought to their attention and take correction action when necessary as quickly as possible. Section 704(a) of Title VII has therefore been interpreted as intending to provide "exceptionally broad protection" for protestors of discriminatory employment practices. <span class="Italic">Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co.</span>, 411 F.2d 998, 1004-1005 (5th Cir. 1969). The Commission has strongly reaffirmed this position. EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Section 614.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if an employee engaged in oppositional activity is mistaken in interpretation of the facts or law and the challenged practice does not amount to a violation of Title VII, the opposition is protected activity provided the employee had a good faith, reasonable belief that a violation of the discrimination laws had or was occurring. <span class="Italic">Sias v. City Demonstration Agency</span>, 588 F.2d 692, 695 (9th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Park v. Baltimore &#x0026; O.R. Co.</span>, 652 F.2d 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Sisco v. J.S. Alberici Construction Co., Inc.</span>, 655 F.2d 146 (8th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Rucke v. Higher Educational Aids Bd.</span>, 669 F.2d 1179 (7th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant was not required to prevail on her underlying claim of sexual harassment to prevail on a claim that she was terminated for bringing the allegation to the attention of an agency nurse and police officer.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the alleged discriminatory practice must be an employment practice. In a short, but interesting, decision, an employee alleged that he was retaliated against for his opposition to a letter of admonishment that he received regarding the medical care being given to a blind, African-American veteran. The complainant was successful in having the admonishment withdrawn, but alleged the agency engaged in acts of retaliation thereafter. The Commission found that the complainant was not protected under the opposition clause because the complainant did not oppose any alleged discriminatory employment practice. <span class="Italic">See Ludwig v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01931796 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to be protected activity, the practice opposed must be an alleged violation of Title VII, or another antidiscrimination statute enforced by the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kiara R. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120141103 (2017) (an employee's contact with the agency's HR department to complain about her part time status did not constitute opposition activity where she did not communicate a belief that the agency's actions were motivated by discriminatory animus). An employee's protests over an agency's refusal to hire a transsexual are not protected activity. Being a transsexual is not protected by Title VII. <span class="Italic">See McCann v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01933543 (1994). Although <span class="Italic">McCann</span> limits its holding to Title VII, that is only because of the specific complaint in that case. Obviously, it is protected activity to oppose practices in violation of the ADEA, the Rehabilitation Act, or the EPA. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 03A00044 (2002), the Commission found that the complainant had not participated in opposition activity under Title VII where she opposed the way her supervisor ran the agency's EEO program. The Commission held that management of the EEO program was not an activity prohibited under Title VII. However, in a muddled decision in <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01965201 (1998), the Commission found that the complainant had engaged in protected opposition activity when he protested two skits that portrayed persons from Kentucky as slow-witted. The Commission rejected the underlying complaint based on national origin because being from Kentucky does not confer protected status. The Commission in <span class="Italic">DeWitt</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ppellant's claim of reprisal discrimination was not negated by the fact that he had protested the agency's portrayal of persons from Kentucky. Rather, the Commission found that appellant had acted reasonably and in good faith when he engaged in conduct opposing perceived discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly in <span class="Italic">Lankford v. Secretary of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a43157.txt">01A43157</a> (2005), the Commission found that the complainant had not engaged in protected activity where she complained that the agency was not enforcing a policy against viewing pornography on government computers. The Commission held that "[t]here is simply no evidence to support the conclusion that complainant explicitly or implicitly communicated to anyone her belief that the viewing of pornography on the library's computers constituted unlawful employment discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Opposition to discriminatory practices need not be "formal." <span class="Italic">See Barnes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933458 (1994). In that case, the Commission found that it was protected activity under the opposition clause for an employee to bring examples of perceived discriminatory treatment to the attention of his union. The employee further testified that each time he did so, the union brought it to the attention of his supervisor, who retaliated against him.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that the complainant engaged in protected opposition activity in <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0120111759 (2011), where he spoke to one supervisor and wrote to another protesting the placement of a pregnant employee at the end of a call-in list. The Commission found that in both instances the complainant was alleging a violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, an amendment to Title VII, and that the activity was protected.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, however, there must be opposition. If a complainant's previous participation in EEO proceedings is in support of her employer, she has not engaged in protected activity under the opposition clause. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Navarez v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01963415 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There remains the question of whether appellant's activity is protected activity by virtue of opposition to unlawful employment practices. In both proceedings, appellant testified in support of her supervisor, refuting allegations of a coworker that the supervisor engaged in sexual harassment and other forms of misconduct. It is difficult to see how appellant's testimony can be construed as opposition to an employment practice unlawful under Title VII. Appellant was not opposing alleged sexual harassment or other forms of misconduct; rather, her testimony refuted the occurrence of the events alleged by the coworker. Accordingly, appellant is not shielded by the provisions of Title VII and the Commission's regulations which cover "opposition."</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to clarify its position on what constitutes opposition to a discriminatory practice, the Commission set forth several examples in EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.004 at II.A.2.c. and e. (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 1</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Reasonable Good Faith Belief</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee complains to her office manager that her supervisor failed to promote her because of her sex after an apparently less qualified man was selected. Because the complaint was based on a reasonable good faith belief that discrimination occurred, she has engaged in protected opposition regardless of whether the promotion decision was in fact discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not Protected Opposition--Complaint Not Motivated By Reasonable Good Faith Belief</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Same as above, except the job sought by the employee was in accounting and it required a CPA license, which she lacked and the selectee had. She knew that it was necessary to have a CPA license to perform this job. She has not engaged in protected opposition because she did not have a reasonable good faith belief that she was rejected because of sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 3</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Complaints to Management Consistent with Legal Position Taken by the EEOC</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee believes he is being harassed by coworkers based on his sexual orientation, and complains to his manager and human resources. This is protected activity under Title VII because, in light of the EEOC's stated legal position and enforcement efforts, it is reasonable for an individual to believe that sexual orientation discrimination is actionable as sex discrimination under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected opposition includes actions such as: complaining or threatening to complain about alleged discrimination against oneself or others; providing information in an employer's internal investigation of an EEO matter; refusing to obey an order reasonably believed to be discriminatory; advising an employer on EEO compliance; resisting sexual advances or intervening to protect others; passive resistance (allowing others to express opposition); and requesting reasonable accommodation for disability or religion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complaining or threatening to complain about alleged discrimination against oneself or others</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 4</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Complaint About Sexual Harassment, Even if Not Yet Severe or Pervasive</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee complains to her supervisor about graffiti in her workplace that is derogatory toward women. Although she does not specify that she believes the graffiti creates a hostile work environment based on sex, her complaint reasonably would have been interpreted by the supervisor as opposition to sex discrimination, due to the sex-based content of the graffiti. The graffiti does not need to rise to the level of severe or pervasive hostile work environment harassment in order for her complaint to be reasonable opposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Providing information in an employer's internal investigation of an EEO matter</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 5</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Providing Information to Employer to Corroborate Part of Coworker's Harassment Allegation</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee who has not lodged any complaint of her own is identified as a witness in an employer's internal investigation of a coworker's sexual harassment allegations. The employee is interviewed by the employer and provides corroborating information about sexual harassment she witnessed and/or <span id="Page_1488"></span>experienced. This is protected opposition, even though she has not lodged an internal complaint of her own.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Refusing to obey an order reasonably believed to be discriminatory</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Refusing to obey an order constitutes protected opposition if the individual reasonably believes that the order requires him or her to carry out unlawful employment discrimination. Protected opposition also includes refusal to implement a discriminatory policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 6</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Refusal to Obey Order to Make Assignments Based on Race</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Plaintiff, who works for an employment agency referring individuals to fill temporary and permanent positions with corporate clients, is instructed by his manager not to refer any African Americans to a particular client per the client's request. Plaintiff tells the manager this would be discriminatory, and proceeds instead to refer employees to this client on an equal opportunity basis. Plaintiff's refusal to obey the order constitutes "opposition" to an unlawful employment practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Advising an employer on EEO compliance</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 7</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Human Resources Manager Reports ADA Violations to Company</p>
<p class="noindent-2">XYZ Corp.'s human resources manager came to believe that the company was improperly denying certain requested reasonable accommodations to which individuals with disabilities were entitled under the ADA. Shortly after she reported this to supervisory management, her employment was terminated. Even though her reports to supervisors fell within the ambit of her managerial duties, her reports of unlawful company actions were protected opposition. Protected activity includes EEO complaints by managers, human resources staff, and EEO advisors--even when those complaints happen to grow out of the individual's job duties--provided the complaint meets all the other relevant requirements for protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Resisting sexual advances or intervening to protect others</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 8</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Resisting Supervisor's Sexual Advances</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In response to a supervisor's repeated sexual comments to her, an employee tells the supervisor "leave me alone" and "stop it." A coworker intervenes on her behalf, also asking the manager to stop. The employee's resistance and the coworker's intervention both constitute protected opposition. A materially adverse action by the supervisor in retaliation would be actionable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Passive resistance</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Passive opposition refers to certain acts that allow others to express opposition, such as refusing to implement an instruction to interfere with other employees' complaints. Such an action may itself be protected under the opposition clause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 9</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Refusal to Implement Instruction to Interfere with Exercise of EEO Rights</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A supervisor does not carry out his management's instruction to dissuade his subordinates from filing discrimination complaints. The supervisor's refusal is protected opposition, and a materially adverse action by management against the supervisor because of his refusal to prevent complaints would be actionable retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Requesting reasonable accommodation for disability or religion</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A request for reasonable accommodation of a disability constitutes protected activity under the ADA, and therefore retaliation for such requests is unlawful. By the same rationale, persons requesting religious accommodation under Title VII are protected against retaliation for making such requests. Although a person making such a request might not literally "oppose" discrimination or "participate" in a complaint process, the individual is protected against retaliation for making the request. One court explained: "It would seem anomalous...to think Congress intended no retaliation protection for employees who request a reasonable accommodation unless they also file a formal charge. This would leave employees unprotected if an employer granted the accommodation and shortly thereafter terminated the employee in retaliation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 10</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Protected Opposition--Request for Exception to Uniform Policy as a Religious Accommodation</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After a retail employee's supervisor denies her request to wear her religious headscarf as an exception to the new uniform policy, the corporate human resources department instructs the supervisor to grant the request because there is no undue hardship. Angry about being overruled, the supervisor thereafter gives the employee an unjustified poor performance rating and denies her request to attend training that he approves for her coworkers. The employee's request for an exception as a religious accommodation was protected activity, and the supervisor's action in response is retaliation in violation of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission is clearly correct in its position on refusal to obey discriminatory orders, that category of opposition conduct requires substantial qualification. One of the primary rules of the workplace is "work first, grieve later." Orders are not to be lightly regarded. The Commission's guidance on this point is deceptive, insofar as it uses two clear-cut examples of discriminatory policies. Seldom are orders so blatantly discriminatory. Subjective belief that the order is discriminatory is not sufficient to justify disobedience. A reasonable belief is required. See "<a href="0100-2023-26-026.html#sec17-27">Reasonable Belief</a>," below. That means an "objective reasonable person in the circumstances" test will be applied. The Commission's guidance on refusal to obey orders must be read in conjunction with the balancing test applied to opposition cases, discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Opposition to the alleged discriminatory practice need not be expressed directly to the employer. For example, informing a congressman of the practice is protected activity. <span class="Italic">Guest v. Postmaster General</span>, 01975276 (1998).</p>
