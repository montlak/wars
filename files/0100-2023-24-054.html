<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-41"><span class="space">1.</span> Failure of Complainant to Cooperate</h4>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant fails to cooperate with the agency in the interactive reasonable accommodation process he or she risks not receiving an accommodation. However, more may also be at risk for the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Wells v. Shalala</span>, 228 F.3d 1137 (10th Cir. 2000), the court found the complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination when he failed to cooperate in the interactive process because he could not establish he was a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wells</span>, the complainant brought a constructive discharge action after taking early retirement. He contended that it was the agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation from the travel requirements of his position that resulted in his early retirement. It was undisputed that the complainant could not travel and that the only position available that did not involve travel would have required the complainant to transfer from Denver to Washington, D.C. The complainant refused to accept the reassignment and did not offer any other proposed accommodations. The court in <span class="Italic">Wells</span>, 228 F.3d at 1145-46, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that throughout the relevant time period, Plaintiff simply refused to engage in a good faith, interactive process with OAS in an attempt to resolve the problem<span class="Italic">. See Templeton v. Neodata Servs. Inc.</span>, 162 F.3d 617, 619 (10th Cir. 1998) (ADA envisions an "interactive process that requires participation by both parties"). Despite ample time to do so, Plaintiff failed to provide OAS with any medical documentation to support his demand for relief from travel until after he had requested early retirement. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (where employee fails to provide necessary medical documentation, employer is not liable for failing to provide a reasonable accommodation). Once OAS finally received the letter from Plaintiffs chiropractor indicating Plaintiffs condition would not permit him to engage in overnight travel, OAS offered to reassign Plaintiff to its headquarters in Washington D.C., the only office where travel is not an essential function for an OAS auditor. Plaintiff refused the reassignment. Without the offered reassignment, Plaintiff would have been ineligible for early retirement. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Midland Brake</span>, 180 F.3d at 1177:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[The ADA] requires the employer to use reasonable accommodation to keep the employee in his or her existing job, and if that cannot be accomplished, to use reasonable accommodation to offer a reassignment to another vacant job which that person would be qualified to perform with or without reasonable accommodation. Once the employer has offered such a reassignment, its duties have been discharged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court properly held that Plaintiff failed to carry his burden to suggest any reasonable accommodation short of reassignment for his inability to perform an essential function of his job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The simple fact is Plaintiff could not perform an essential function of his job and did not propose a reasonable accommodation for his inability to perform that function. Because of his inability to travel to field audit sites, Plaintiff simply was no longer "qualified" for an auditing position in OAS's Denver field office at the time he elected early retirement. Moreover, Plaintiff gave OAS no indication of when, if ever, he might be able to resume travel to field audit sites<span class="Italic">. See Hudson</span>, 87 F.3d at 1169 (employer is not required to wait indefinitely for a disabled employee to recover). Because Plaintiff is not a "qualified individual with a disability" entitled to protection under 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 791 &#x0026; 794, OAS did not illegally discriminate against him by failing to reasonably accommodate his disability. Accordingly, Plaintiffs constructive discharge claim based on disability discrimination necessarily fails<span class="Italic">. See Sanchez v. Denver Public Sch.</span>, 164 F.3d 527, 534 (10th Cir. 1998) (In the context of discrimination, "[c]onstructive discharge occurs when the employer by its illegal discriminatory acts <span id="Page_1314"></span>has made working conditions so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to resign.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Pantaleo v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0220060015 (2008). In <span class="Italic">Pantaleo</span>, the Commission upheld the decision of an arbitrator that the complainant had forfeited his disability claim when twice he had denied that he required any accommodations for his diabetes and bipolar disorder.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the Commission held that there is no requirement that a complainant identify the specific accommodations needed. The complainant need only identify the specific work limitations imposed by his or her disability. For example, in <span class="Italic">Zarate v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00415 (2001), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to management's reasoning, an individual with a disability "does not have to be able to specify the precise accommodation" required, but rather must "describe the problems posed by the workplace barrier." EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act</span>, Number 915.002 (March 1, 1999) (Guidance) at question 5. It is undisputed that complainant did specifically identify to S1 the nature of the tasks he could not yet perform. HT at 195-96. This was sufficient to trigger the agency's obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation which would have permitted complainant to perform the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, according to S1's own testimony, he concluded his conversations with complainant by advising complainant that he might be able to obtain an extension of complainant's probationary period and would try to do so. HT at 190. We therefore find implausible S1's contention that he was delaying action until complainant re-advised him that he desired this accommodation.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We also note that S1's contention that complainant's absence for 38 days during his 90-day probationary period was excessive and was part of the reason for his termination, even though the absence was medically excused, is without merit. Permitting the use of accrued paid leave or providing additional unpaid leave for treatment and/or recovery are forms of reasonable accommodation that an employer must provide, absent undue hardship, and the Commission has noted that an employer may not penalize an employee for leave which is taken as a reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(o); Guidance at question 19.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to provide reasonable accommodation. In reaching this conclusion, we note in particular that S1 testified he was well aware that the "correspondence course," other light duty modifications of complainant's position, or other means of accommodating complainant were possible, yet only failed to offer them because complainant did not specifically request these accommodations in particular. Moreover, the evidence establishes that S1's superiors may have been acting on the mistaken belief that complainant, as a probationary employee, was not entitled to any type of reasonable accommodation, even within his position<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Hakohane v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01956411 (January 5, 1998), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980348 (July 30, 1998) (agency held liable for failure to accommodate probationary employee within his position).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the medical documentation provided by a complainant is inadequate to establish the accommodation necessary, the agency is justified in requesting additional information. If the complainant refuses to provide that information, the agency cannot be held liable for the breakdown in the interactive process. <span class="Italic">Madison v. Secretary of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/03A40105.txt">03A40105</a> (2004). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120083928 (2013) ("When an individual's disability or need for reasonable accommodation is not obvious, and the individual fails to provide reasonable documentation requested by the employer, the employer will not be held liable for failure to provide the requested accommodation.").</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant declines an accommodation because the offered accommodation is not within his medical restrictions, the agency has an obligation to continue the interactive process. <span class="Italic">Trobia v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A10173 (2001). However, if the complainant declines an accommodation that is reasonable, the denial terminates the agency's obligation to provide accommodation unless there is a subsequent request. For example, in <span class="Italic">Holloman v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a42878.txt">01A42878</a> (2005), the Commission found that the agency made a "good faith" attempt to accommodate the complainant's asthma, but the complainant rejected the offer on the basis that it was outside her medical restrictions. The agency offered the complainant several options for exposure to allergens. The complainant rejected those options and requested to work at home. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Holloman</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency attempted in good faith to provide complainant a reasonable accommodation, but that complainant rejected the agency's reasonable accommodation offer on the grounds that it did not meet her medical requirements. We note the record reflects that after rejecting the agency's offer, complainant requested to work from home or in a safe and clean environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the Senior Community Builder, who was also complainant's first-level supervisor (Supervisor), stated that he handled complainant's request for reasonable accommodation "with all due diligence and as expeditiously as possible." The Supervisor further stated that after receiving complainant's January 16, 2001 request for reasonable accommodation, he contacted an EEO/Labor Relations Specialist (Specialist) at the agency's Chicago facility after being instructed by the agency Secretary's Representative "to get further advice on the procedures to be followed in connection with [Complainant's] request." The Supervisor stated that on February 6, 2001, he had a conversation with the Specialist by phone and was informed that complainant's request would be reviewed. The Supervisor stated that the Specialist also informed him that complainant had contacted her, and that she informed complainant that a review of her request could possibly take up to six months. The Supervisor stated that according to the Specialist, complainant stated that the period of time would create a financial hardship on her. The Supervisor stated that the Specialist then assured complainant that she would expedite the review of her request. The Supervisor stated that on February 7, 2001, he received an e-mail from the Specialist inquiring if there was any work-at-home assignments that complainant might be given to allow her to collect her pay. The Supervisor stated that he informed the Specialist that there was a departmental policy that all Community Builders "were specifically excluded from telework privileges." The Supervisor stated that the Acting Assistant Deputy for Field Policy and Management reaffirmed the departmental policy that excluded Community Builders from telework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supervisor stated that the following two months after receiving complainant's January 2001 reasonable accommodation request, there was "an on-going exchange of information from me to [Complainant] detailing specific instructions on what the procedures were and what information was needed from [Complainant's] doctors." The Supervisor stated that during the relevant period, he reassigned complainant to the Storefront office on the first floor because she complained that the conditions near her workspace made breathing difficult. The Supervisor stated that during complainant's work in the Buffalo Field office, she had meetings at the Storefront office, and did not complain "about any breathing problems during that period so I believed the Storefront would alleviate some of her problems." The Supervisor, however, stated that complainant left the first day of her reassignment to the Storefront office, complaining of respiratory problems. The Supervisor stated that other employees started questioning him concerning complainant's whereabouts because she was "rarely" seen in the Storefront office. The Supervisor stated that he later learned complainant had decided to report to the 5th floor of the office building instead of the Storefront office without consulting with him beforehand. The Supervisor stated "this same 5th Floor space was where [Complainant] alleged she encountered the most respiratory problems." Further, the Supervisor stated that during the relevant period, complainant received maximum amount of advanced sick leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supervisor stated that on April 25, 2001, he received a letter from the agency's physician. The Supervisor stated that in his letter, the physician stated that after a review of complainant's medical documentation, he recommended that complainant be offered an office space devoid of all fabric dividers, carpet together with a HEPA filter. The Supervisor stated that the physician also advised that if complainant was unable to tolerate a full week in the office, then she should attempt to report to work one or two days a week and that if that was not feasible he recommended that complainant work out of her home as much as feasible for her position. The Supervisor stated that on September 18, 2001, he received a letter from complainant's allergist in which he made the same recommendation as the physician. The Supervisor stated that the Acting Assistant Deputy for Field Policy and Management was the deciding official concerning complainant's request, and approved the physician's and complainant's allergist recommendations that complainant be offered an office space with no dust collecting fabric and cloth cubicle dividers; and a portable HEPA air filter. The Supervisor stated that "the recommended space was made available for occupancy on August 2, 2001, the day [Complainant's] leave was to expire." The Supervisor stated that complainant rejected the agency's reasonable accommodation offer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to complainant's assertion that another employee was allowed to work from home as part of his reasonable accommodation, the Supervisor stated that he was aware that the named employee "was granted conditions different than those offered to [Complainant]." Specifically, the Supervisor stated that the named employee was not a Community Builder, and that he (the Supervisor) did not have anything to do with either the employee's request or the accommodation offered to him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record further reflects that the agency physician stated that he contacted complainant's physician and that "all he could tell me is that [Complainant's] asthma was worse when she was in the building." The agency physician stated "what you do in these cases is to start somewhere in terms of limits, and see how the individual is impacted." <span id="Page_1315"></span>Specifically, the agency physician stated in his April 25, 2001 letter, that if his recommendations were not sufficient in reducing complainant's asthma, then she should be allowed to work from her home "if possible within the context of her job."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering the entire record as reflected above, the Commission determines that the AJ properly found that complainant was not denied a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's use of the phrase "good faith" in referring to the accommodation efforts of the agency is somewhat unfortunate given the "good faith" exception to award of damages under the Rehabilitation Act. That exception provides that when an agency makes a good faith effort to provide accommodation and falls short of what is legally required, the agency is not liable for compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> below. However, the good faith exception does not exempt the agency from providing reasonable accommodation. The <span class="Italic">Holloman</span> case should not be understood to hold that an agency can escape all liability in a reasonable accommodation case by making a good faith effort at accommodation. It appears that the use of the phrase "good faith" in <span class="Italic">Holloman</span> was merely descriptive of the agency's efforts. The real bar to relief in <span class="Italic">Holloman</span> was that the agency offered several accommodations designed to eliminate the complainant's breathing problems and indicated it was willing to consider further accommodations if those were inadequate. The complainant declined those accommodations and then failed to present any evidence they would have been ineffective.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although delay in providing an accommodation can amount to denial of accommodation, that is not true when the delay is because of the complainant's failure to cooperate in the interactive process as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Barham v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120112386 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer should respond expeditiously to a request for reasonable accommodation. Enforcement Guidance, at question 10 (Oct. 17, 2002). If the employer and the individual with a disability need to engage in an interactive process, this too should proceed as quickly as possible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, the employer should act promptly to provide the reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Unnecessary delays can result in a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In determining whether there has been an unnecessary delay in responding to a request for reasonable accommodation, relevant factors would include: (1) the reason(s) for delay, (2) the length of the delay, (3) how much the individual with a disability and the employer each contributed to the delay, (4) what the employer was doing during the delay, and (5) whether the required accommodation was simple or complex to provide. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at n.38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the entire record in this case, the Commission finds that Complainant has not established that the Agency unreasonably delayed providing her reasonable accommodation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. S1 affirmed that Complainant's reasonable accommodation request was received on December 2, 2009, and forwarded to the Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator. S1 confirmed that the Agency immediately began working on accommodating Complainant and offered her a temporary accommodation of Complainant working in a private office approximately two blocks away; however, Complainant declined. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On January 28, 2010, Complainant accepted an accommodation which included use of a desk fan to improve air circulation in her work station, allowing her to prop open the office door behind her work station to aid air flow, and a security screen to nullify privacy and security issues arising from the open door. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Subsequently, on February 12, 2010, Complainant rejected the accommodations as insufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In March 2010, the Agency offered to relocate Complainant's work station to a conference room adjacent to her current work area with an inner door that would seal her work area from outside perfumes and odors. Further, Complainant was offered a portable air purifier and fan and would be allowed to use "situational flexi-place." S1 affirmed that this would have provided Complainant with a private office, but she rejected the offer because she believed that perfume odor would enter through the walls or that her coworkers would spray perfume under the door. Thereafter, the Agency underwent a search for available space to relocate Complainant. Once available space was located, the Agency offered to move Complainant. Complainant accepted the offer and, on April 30, 2010, Complainant was moved to a new cubicle in an open area with maximum airflow and ventilation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 noted that throughout the entire process of finding a suitable accommodation, Complainant was provided opportunities to work from her home as needed. While Complainant did not have Internet access at home, the Agency ordered an Air card which allowed her access to all data necessary to perform her duties. Additionally, Complainant was provided liberal use of two conference rooms in close proximity to her assigned work area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds no evidence that the Agency unnecessarily delayed providing Complainant reasonable accommodation. The record reflects that any delay in fully accommodating Complainant resulted from the interactive process used to determine what accommodations would be effective to enable Complainant to work. Further, the record evidence does not indicate that Agency management failed to act in good faith in attempting to accommodate Complainant. The record reveals that Complainant rejected many of the Agency's offered accommodations, but was allowed use of a conference room and to work from home as needed while the Agency sought a permanent accommodation. The Commission notes that while Complainant may not have been offered the accommodations of her preference, an employer is not required to provide the precise accommodation the employee or applicant wants, so long as the accommodation offered is an effective one under the circumstances of the situation. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Airways v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391, 400 (2002). Thus, the Commission finds that Complainant has not established that she was denied reasonable accommodation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant not only has an obligation to cooperate initially in the interactive process but to inform her chain of supervision if there are problems with a provided accommodation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Memmer v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0120081695 (2012), the complainant alleged that the agency failed to accommodate her vision impairment when ZoomText software provided as an accommodation did not properly function. In exonerating the agency in <span class="Italic">Memmer</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Complainant's claim that the Agency failed to give her the specific CPU she requested, we note that in her actual request, Complainant specified that she needed a computer with 1.5 Mhz hard drive. The record reveals that Complainant was issued a computer with 600 Mhz hard drive. However, even assuming Complainant requested a computer with 1.5 Ghz versus 1.5 Mhz hard drive, we find Complainant failed to show that she was denied a reasonable accommodation. Specifically, we note that the crux of Complainant's contention regarding the size of her hard drive is the focus on whether her computer had sufficient memory to run ZoomText. Upon review, we find the record supports the AJ's conclusion that it was more likely than not that Complainant's computer had sufficient memory to run ZoomText. Moreover, we find that to the extent that ZoomText was not running effectively, Complainant was required to advise her supervisor, Person A, of this problem. While the record shows that Complainant informed the computer department in March 2002, and subsequently informed the Union of her concerns, we find substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that Complainant failed to inform Person A, or anyone in her supervisory chain, that ZoomText was not running properly.</p>
