<h3 class="h3" id="sec18-26"><span class="space">A.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">PRIMA FACIE</span></span> CASE</h3>
<p class="noindent">The appellant in a promotion or appointment complaint establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing he is a member of a protected class, that he applied and was qualified for the position, and that someone outside his protected group was selected for the position. <span class="Italic">See Weinstein v. USPS</span>, 01830674 (1983). When several positions are at issue, it does not defeat a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case or preclude a showing of pretext that one of the disputed positions was filled by a member of appellant's protected group. <span class="Italic">See Salais v. Department of Army</span>, 01832748 (1985). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, it is not necessary that the complainant demonstrate she is as qualified or more qualified than the ultimate selectee, only that she was minimally qualified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCrary v. USPS</span>, 01830695 (1983). That the selected candidate is more qualified is for the agency to raise as rebuttal to a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the requirement that the complainant apply for the position in question is generally part of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case formulation, there are instances where failing to apply will not defeat a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. This is particularly true if the underlying allegation is that the agency is discriminatorily manipulating the selection process to prevent a complainant from applying. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Lapina v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01950656 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency found that allegation (j) failed to state a claim because appellant did not apply for the position. Appellant has alleged that the agency announced the position in allegation (j) at a GS-11 level, rather than as a trainee position, in order to deny her the opportunity to apply for the position. On appeal, appellant argues that allegation (l) "is a claim that [the agency] structured a position or vacancy announcement in a way so as to exclude candidates." Under the circumstances of this case, where appellant is alleging that the agency is attempting to manipulate the selection process over a number of years to avoid selecting appellant, appellant's allegations concerning the decision to issue the position at a grade level higher than appellant's qualifications and the decision to noncompetitively announce a position, state a claim under 1614.103. Therefore, we find that the agency improperly dismissed allegations (j) and (l) for failing to state a claim. Because we are remanding allegation (k) for clarification, we do not address whether allegation (k) states a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Graham v. Attorney General</span>, 01956003 (1997), the Commission determined that the appellant's allegation that the agency misled him in order to keep him from applying for positions warranted further investigation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of the complaint, appellant, although selected for a CRSCS position, had not been officially hired, as a government-wide hiring freeze was instituted prior to him receiving security clearance and final approval. Without his knowledge, the vacancy announcement (89-43-D) <span id="Page_1567"></span>under which appellant was selected was cancelled as a result of the hiring freeze. Upon the resumption of hiring, the position was announced on two more occasions. After the second announcement (91-09-B), a candidate (not of appellant's protected group) was selected but was unable to get security clearance; consequently, the agency issued a third announcement (91-45-B) for the position at which time another candidate (not of appellant's protected group) was selected and hired. It was not until almost five months after the selectee was hired that appellant was given official notice of what had occurred, this despite the fact that appellant had been attempting to find out the status of his employment. Not being aware of the subsequent announcements, appellant did not reapply for the CRSCS position. Believing he was a victim of discrimination, appellant sought EEO counseling and, subsequently, filed a formal complaint on February 1, 1994, alleging that he was discriminated against as noted above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency complied with all procedural and regulatory prerequisites, and on May 9, 1995, an EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) issued a Recommended Decision (RD) pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e)(3), finding that appellant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination as he failed to establish that he applied for the position under which the final candidate was selected. Consequently, appellant failed to demonstrate that there were any genuine issues of fact in dispute as his selection was cancelled due to the hiring freeze and he did not apply under the subsequent announcements. Thereafter, the agency issued a FAD, adopting the AJ's RD.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In doing so, however, the agency supplemented the AJ's RD by discussing an issue which it indicated the AJ did not address. The FAD pointed out that the record contained allegations that supported appellant's contention that he was not informed of the subsequent announcements in order to keep him from reapplying so the selecting official (SO) and the director (RMO) could hire a candidate (Hispanic) not of appellant's protected group. However, the agency concluded that even assuming that the SO and the RMO did not inform appellant of the subsequent announcements with the purpose of preventing him from reapplying, there was no Title VII violation as being Hispanic was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification (BFOQ).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the agency's supplemental argument to the AJ's RD to be contrary to the legal basis upon which the RD is based. Pursuant to our regulations, an administrative hearing will not be held when the material facts of the case are not in genuine dispute and there is no genuine issue as to credibility. As the agency points out, appellant contends that agency officials (RO and RMO) purposely kept him from reapplying for the position for discriminatory reasons by not informing him of the fact that his selection was cancelled and that it issued new announcements. However, the record also indicates that appellant contends that not only was he not informed but he was intentionally misled into believing that his documentation was being processed with the purpose of keeping him from reapplying.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that appellant contacted the agency on several occasions after his selection to inquire about the processing of his employment documents. He made inquiries to the RMO but did not receive any response. In the EEO Counselor's Report, the SO is credited with stating that, responding to appellant's telephone call, "he did not tell Brawleigh Graham that the vacancy announcement was reopened because he knew [the RMO] wanted someone else to fill the position." Appellant also contacted the agency's personnel office and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that to the extent that appellant alleges he was actively misled by the agency in order to keep him from reapplying by not responding to his inquiries and intentionally misinforming him of his status for discriminatory reasons (when it knew that his selection was cancelled and the vacancy was reopened), then there are genuine issues of fact that merit further investigation and an administrative hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Code mandates that "the agency shall develop a complete and impartial factual record upon which to make findings on the matters raised by the written complaint." 29 CFR 1614.108(b). As we find the record incomplete, the agency is to conduct a supplemental investigation wherein appellant may present evidence to the investigator of his inquiries to the agency regarding his employment status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This decision does not overturn the AJ's findings that appellant had not been hired by the agency, his selection had been vacated as a result of a government-wide hiring freeze and that appellant did not reapply for the position under either of the two announcements issued after the hiring freeze was lifted. Additionally, it does not overturn the agency's finding that appellant did not meet his burden of proving discrimination on the basis of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The supplemental investigation is limited to the issue of whether or not agency officials intentionally and discriminatorily did not inform and/or misled appellant, into not applying for the position under the subsequent two announcements. To that end, we find that the agency may not, on the one hand, argue that appellant did not apply for the position when that failure may have been due to the agency's intentional acts in not informing and/or intentionally misleading appellant, thereby preventing him from becoming aware of the announcements and applying. With regard to the agency's BFOQ defense, the investigation is to also include information clarifying when and how agency officials concluded that a Hispanic was needed to perform the essential elements of the position.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Reyes v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120080831 (2008) (complainant stated claim by alleging selection process was designed to keep her, a female, from applying so male could be selected).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant may not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of failure to promote or select for details simply by asserting that she took steps that indicated a desire for the positions. In <span class="Italic">Katz-Pueschel v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01970644 (2001), the complainant alleged that even though she made herself available for details and promotions, she was never solicited for the positions while other employees were solicited. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Katz-Pueschel</span> noted the lack of specificity in the complainant's allegations and found that the complainant failed to show that she sought details or promotions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her rebuttal affidavit, complainant argued that volunteers were solicited for SATC positions through recommendations by supervisors, and that she was never solicited to be detailed to SATC positions even though her supervisors were aware of her desire to be detailed to SATC positions<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at exhibit 6. Complainant noted that she had taken a Controller-in-Charge (CIC) course with a colleague and asserted that she had specifically volunteered for details<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> However complainant provided neither written documentation nor specific information such as exact dates, who was contacted for details, exact locations of details, or other indicia to support the assertions set forth in her affidavits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also suggests that the list of training courses she took, set forth in exhibit 4 of the IF, together with her seniority and new evidence that she had previously served as a CIC, demonstrate that she had expressed to her supervisors a desire to seek details and promotions to supervisory positions. Complainant also asserts that the language in the negotiated agreement between the union and agency, which provides that CIC details are intended to provide supervision where a supervisor is not available, supports her contention that she affirmatively sought details to supervisory positions. Finally, complainant repeats her allegation that supervisors would approach other ATCs to serve in supervisory positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission next concludes that complainant failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she expressed a desire for details and was denied awards and promotions. In reaching this conclusion, we note that complainant provided no evidence, other than her testimony, that she was denied details, promotions or awards. That complainant had seniority, took a series of training courses and previously served as a CIC is, without more, insufficient to establish that complainant sought details or promotions to supervisory positions during the relevant time. Moreover, even assuming that ATCs were solicited for supervisory details, all three management officials indicated that complainant never expressed any desire for details or promotions to supervisory positions, and complainant has failed to provide any evidence in support of her argument that she affirmatively sought and was denied such opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent">The real bottom-line is that, in accordance with <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination in selections or promotions consists of those facts which, if otherwise unexplained, could lead one reasonably to conclude the action was based on discriminatory motives.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant unsuccessfully seeks a position, the fact that he obtains a position at a higher level does not bar him from stating a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Franklin v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01973193 (1998), found that the complainant was aggrieved by the agency's failure to consider him for a position, despite the fact that he was promoted to another position. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Franklin</span> noted that there are many factors that a person may consider in determining the relative desirability of certain jobs:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant is aggrieved under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103 because he was not permitted to be eligible for the position of his choice. Even if the position of appellant's choice was a "lower" position than the position he was placed in, such a situation would not mean that appellant was not harmed. There are other attributes of positions other than pay, including geographic location of position, career potential of position, and type of work. Furthermore, the agency's argument regarding what is "prudent" inappropriately addresses the merits of appellant's complaint in a procedural decision. The Commission finds that the agency improperly dismissed the complaint for failing to state a claim. Because the matter was before an EEOC Administrative Judge prior to the agency's decision dismissing the complaint, we shall remand the complaint so that the agency may forward the matter to the administrative judge for a hearing.</p>
