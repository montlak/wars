<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-39"><span class="space">12.</span> Similarly Situated Employees; Meaningful Distinctions</h4>
<p class="noindent">In articulating a legitimate reason, the agency must do more than merely distinguish the particular facts of a situation. It is required to articulate some meaningful distinction that serves a legitimate purpose of the agency. In <span class="Italic">Garcia v. USPS</span>, 01830181 (1983), the agency failed to meet its burden in defending the demotion of a driver who alleged discrimination on the basis of national origin. The agency contended that the driver was demoted because of his involvement in two accidents. The agency contended that two other drivers were not similarly situated because one of the drivers had an accident on postal service property and the other had been given a lateral transfer. The Commission noted that the agency's primary concern was in the safe and competent operation of its vehicles and discredited the distinction based on where the accident occurred. With respect to the driver who was transferred, the Commission noted that the penalty was disparate because no demotion was involved.</p>
<p class="noindent">The general rule is that "[i[n order for two or more employees to be considered similarly situated, all relevant aspects of the employees' work situation must be identical or nearly identical." <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093843 (2011), citing <span class="Italic">Smith v. Monsanto Chemical Co.,</span> 770 F.2d 719, 723 (8th Cir. 1985). In <span class="Italic">Hudson</span>, the Commission found that the complainant had held his bid position for 26 years and was rebidding on it and the comparison employee was backfilled into the position in a relief status. The Commission, in Hudson, found that the two employees were similarly situated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">because all relevant aspects of their work situation are identical or nearly identical. Specifically, we note the following. . .(a) Complainant had bid on and was awarded the position that C1 was working in at the time and continued to work in after; (b) S1 and M1, the supervisors for the position, were responsible for determining the off days for the position--both during the time when Complainant was bidding on the position and when C1 was working in the position. We find that these similarities are sufficient to show that Complainant and C1 are similarly situated.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant relies upon comparison employees in attempting to prove discrimination, some factors are more important than others in establishing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the agency's actions. In <span class="Italic">Dabney v. Veterans Administration</span>, 05880391 (1988), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In evaluating comparative evidence in disparate treatment cases concerning termination, courts appear to give weight to certain critical factors, such as: 1) whether the employee was warned about his or her conduct and given a chance to improve (<span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Macey v. World Airways, Inc.</span>, 14 FEP Cases 1426 (N.D. Cal. 1977) (employee's discharge for absenteeism was discriminatory because she never was informed that certain absences were unexcused)); and, 2) whether or not the employer departed from its normal practices and policies in discharging the employee (<span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lowry v. Whitaker Cable Corp.</span>, 348 F. Supp. 5 FEP Cases 409 (W.D. Mo. 1972), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 472 F.2d 1210, 5 FEP Cases 612 (8th Cir. 1973)). . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission seems to have limited this decision to removals, there is no persuasive reason why the enunciated factors could not be of equal importance in cases involving lesser personnel actions. In <span class="Italic">Dabney</span>, the Commission found significance in the fact that the supervisor, while testifying that he had given the complainant warnings, had no record of such warnings. The Commission also found that the agency departed from its normal practices in removing the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an RMO testifies that he relied on the advice of a personnel specialist in issuing or not issuing letters of warning to comparison employees, the relevant inquiry is whether the RMO in fact contacted the personnel specialist in each case and then followed the provided advice. In the absence of any evidence to dispute the testimony of the RMO, the agency sustains its burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, and the complainant fails to make a showing of pretext. <span class="Italic">Goode v. Postmaster General</span>, 01882142 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency cannot be treated as a "monolithic entity" for the purposes of assessing the treatment afforded to similarly situated employees. <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05900445 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Turner</span>, an employee stationed at one Marine Corps base attempted to show disparate treatment by comparing herself to other employees holding the same position at other bases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission decided to restrict its analysis to Camp Lejeune because it found extending its analysis to other Commands, could lead to "improper inferences of dissimilar treatment." Despite appellant's arguments to the contrary, we find that our previous decision properly decided this issue. Besides the numerous legitimate factors that could lead to different personnel actions and policies at the different Commands, the Commission finds that if it was to treat the Marine Corps as a monolithic entity, it would in effect be interfering with the legitimate exercise of the agency's managerial discretion. Such action is contrary to established Commission policy, as well as case law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thelda K. Ostrenga v. Edward J. Derwinski, Secretary, Department of Veterans' Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890060 (May 22, 1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Loeb v. Textron, Inc.</span>, 600 F.2d 1003 (1st Cir. 1979).</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120130896 (2015), the Commission found that the employees the complainant claimed were similarly situated were not:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also argues that non-Hispanic male employees were treated more favorably because they were not issued indefinite suspensions when charged with crimes even more serious than her own. In her affidavit, Complainant describes one employee who purportedly "[pled] to felony vandalism," and another who falsified timesheets. However, we agree with the Agency, that these employees are not "similarly situated<span class="Italic">."</span> TSM-1 explained that he chose to impose the indefinite suspension in Complainant's case because as an ECCO she is trusted with sensitive information. Moreover, the facility interacts with many stakeholders. Because the incident had received substantial news coverage, indicating that a TSA employee was involved with the shooting of a neighbor and lying to law enforcement, and Agency stakeholders had brought the matter to the Agency's attention, TSM-1 believed that the suspension was appropriate. As for the employee who allegedly did not have a security clearance, TSM-1 attested that the employee did have a clearance and was never convicted of a crime. TSM-1 explained that he was unaware of the situation regarding the final employee cited by Complainant, as he did not work for TSM-1. Therefore, we agree that the comparators relied upon by Complainant are not similarly situated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's failure to advance any explanation for a supervisor's disparate treatment of the complainant will result in a finding that the complainant has carried her burden of proof. For example, <span class="Italic">Beler v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994631 (2002), the Commission noted that the agency had articulated a legitimate reason for the complainant's termination by asserting he continued to have unscheduled absences after the third disciplinary action for such an offense, but failed to meet its burden of production when it offered no evidence on why similarly situated white employees were not terminated for unscheduled absences after a third disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Tuggey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961826 (1998). Similarly, it is not a legitimate reason for an agency to impose upon a white employee the same penalty as a black employee, regardless of their degree of culpability in an altercation, to avoid the appearance of <span id="Page_717"></span>discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966602 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency establishes a meaningful distinction in the treatment of employees who would otherwise be considered similarly situated by demonstrating that its actions are based on the complainant's actions and not his protected status. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120101409 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Complainant disagreed with the AJ's credibility determinations, Complainant failed to show on appeal that objective evidence (as opposed to other testimonial evidence) so contradicts the credited testimony or that the credited testimony so lacks in credibility that a reasonable fact finder would not credit it. In addition, we note that the AJ, in crediting the testimony of RSO and ARSO and in finding that RSO acted reasonably, explicitly considered the fact that Diplomatic Security had later cleared Complainant of the cited security violations. Moreover, we note that the AJ acknowledged that RSO treated Complainant differently from other employees by compiling the lengthy cable and detailed spreadsheet, but found that RSO's differing treatment of Complainant was based on his actions and not his protected classes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes a distinction can be drawn on the basis that conduct occurs off-duty rather than on-duty. In <span class="Italic">Washington v. USPS</span>, 01842852 (1986), the employee complained that her government driving permit was suspended for less serious violations than male counterparts. The record showed the appellant had several off-duty driving offenses, was found to be at fault in a minor collision while driving an agency vehicle and was observed swerving in front of another car by her supervisor. The employee argued that three male drivers had their state licenses suspended for operating under the influence but had been allowed to retain their government permits. The Commission found a meaningful distinction in the fact that the state suspended the licenses of the three male employees, but it was the agency that suspended appellant's permit. In many ways, the case makes little or no sense. It is noted here to demonstrate that drawing distinctions is done on a case by case basis and is far from a mechanical test. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> probably represents the best view in a situation such as this. If the agency's interest is in the safe and efficient operation of its motor vehicles, it should make little difference how employee drives on-duty or off-duty.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency does not sustain its burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason simply by stating that the employee's conduct was deserving of discipline where the employee, as part of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, has demonstrated a discrepancy between the treatment he received and that received by others not in his protected group. <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 01873586 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is clear that an agency can permit the disparate treatment of employees from different protected groups if it can advance a sufficient reason for doing so. Although the Commission has never acknowledged it, often a sort of sliding scale is used with respect to the agency's burden of proof on advancing a legitimate reason. In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01842106 (1986), the employee complained that she was demoted for poor performance while a similarly situated younger male employee received a lateral transfer based on poor performance. The agency demonstrated that the male employee was a GS-5, as opposed to the appellant, who was a GS-7. The agency further demonstrated that its first preference was to attempt to retain the grade of an employee facing performance problems by reassignment. Finally, the agency proved that there were no GS-7 positions vacant at the time of the employee's demotion. Based on the above, the Commission determined that the agency articulated a legitimate reason for its actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency draws a meaningful distinction in its treatment of employees where it demonstrates that two similarly situated employees had been allowed to withdraw their resignation within two or three days of submitting it. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01852400 (1987), the complainant had waited 25 days before asking to rescind the resignation and alternative staffing decisions already had been made.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the conduct may be generally similar in nature, such as conviction for an offense, the Commission will compare the underlying nature of the conduct to determine if employees are similarly situation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Adame v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112932 (2013), the complainant was terminated for off-duty conduct that resulted in harm to another, failure to meet the terms and conditions of his probation and inability to attend work due to his incarceration. The complainant was involved in an off-duty incident where he broke the window of a car that he girlfriend was in with another man. The complainant pled guilty to two felonies and a domestic violence charge. He was sentenced to a year in prison. The complainant argued that another employee had twice been convicted of driving with a suspended license and not having insurance and that the employee had not been terminated. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Adame</span>, found the conduct was not comparable because the other employee had not engaged in "violent" behavior:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we assume, without so finding that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of unlawful discrimination. Nonetheless, we find that the Agency provided legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its action. Specifically, Agency management stated that Complainant was issued a notice of removal because he attacked two people with a torque wrench, pled guilty to Felony Assault with a Deadly Weapon, Domestic Violence, and Felony Vandalism over $400, and failed to report to work because he was incarcerated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant maintains that a Cl was "very violent" with a supervisor at the Oxnard Main Post Office and drove an Agency vehicle while he was unlicensed, but Cl was allowed to return to work. Court records reveal that CI was convicted twice in 2008 for driving with a suspended license and failing to provide proof of insurance and registration. However, unlike Complainant's convictions, these are not violent crimes. Complainant also maintains that Cl became violent with an Oxnard Main Post Office supervisor, but we note that Complainant did not provide any specific details about this alleged event beyond his generalized claim. Most significantly, there is simply no evidence in the record that C1, C2, C3, or C4 have ever been charged with a violent crime while working for the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further maintains that he pled guilty to the criminal charges because he relied upon the Postmaster's promise that he could be placed in a work furlough program and would be allowed to continue to work. Even if this claim is true, Complainant has not shown how the Postmaster's purported failure to honor his promise reflects unlawful discrimination. In fact, we note that one of the employees placed on work furlough program is Mexican, and two other employees are almost the same age as Complainant, which undercuts Complainant's claim that he was denied enrollment in the program because of his national origin or age.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that, even on appeal, Complainant continues to minimize the crimes to which he pled guilty. In contrast to Complainant, we view the Agency's response to Complainant's convictions as reasonable and appropriate in light of the serious nature of the criminal convictions at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case noted more for amusement than legal value, the Postal Service successfully argued that denying the request of the complainant to read a recommended decision of an administrative judge finding discrimination over the public address system should have put the employee on notice that he could not post it on a bulletin board by the time-clock. The Commission found that the agency had not discriminatorily punished the complainant in <span class="Italic">Schneider v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971285 (1999). In <span class="Italic">Schneider</span> the complainant was punished for publicizing a decision in an EEOC case in which he had been the representative:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that appellant's contentions on appeal are without merit. For instance, appellant contends that "there is a great difference between being denied permission to announce a decision on a case and subsequently posting it." We disagree. The reasonable interpretation of denying appellant's request to announce the AJ's recommended decision over the public access system, is that the agency did not want to publicize the decision. Appellant should have known that posting the decision at the time-clock was not permitted. At the very least, appellant should have known that he needed to obtain prior approval before posting the decision. Accordingly, we find that the agency was justified in reprimanding appellant for his conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Discussed below are some additional examples of frequently recurring situations involving the agency's burden of production.</p>
