<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-74"><span class="space">H.</span> DEROGATORY COMMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Supervisors and coworkers sometimes utter comments that may reflect negatively on the race, color, sex, national origin, religion, age, or disabled status of a person. Not all such comments can be taken as an indication of discrimination. Whether or not the comments evidence a discriminatory intent will be inferred from the circumstances in which they occurred. Whether such comments rise to the level of creating a hostile environment is discussed in Chapter 12 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-21-023.html#sec12-23">Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment</a>," below. The discussion here is limited to the use of derogatory comments to demonstrate pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the work atmosphere is one in which supervisors and coworkers often "joke" with or "kid" each other, what otherwise would be derogatory comments may be interpreted as part of the give and take of the work environment. But, when a selecting official refers to all female candidates as "girls" and there are no females in similarly situated positions, the comments can be "very telling" and likely will have a substantial impact on a finding of pretext. <span class="Italic">Washington v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01852267 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">In evaluating whether such comments provide evidence of discrimination, the Commission will look at the circumstances in which the comments were made. In <span class="Italic">Parker v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 01942322 (1995), the Commission found a supervisor's comments about the office becoming a maternity ward were not indicative of discrimination where the comments were made in a joking manner and the supervisor otherwise seemed happy about the complainant's pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence of past racially derogatory comments is not sufficient to demonstrate pretext without some showing of a causal connection between the comments and the employment action at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Castro v. Agency for International Development</span>, 01A03745 (2003) (statements about the number of Hispanics in the office and in management is insufficient, standing alone, to show pretext); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 01923205 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, there was no evidence that the comments had occurred within a year of the selection at issue. Moreover, there was evidence the selecting official had taken actions to eliminate practices that were perceived as discriminatory. Finally, a black member of the ranking panel concurred with the decision not to select the complainant. The Commission found that the derogatory comments, though disturbing, were insufficient to demonstrate that the selection was more likely than not motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence that the management official responsible for a personnel decision has made racially derogatory statements about the complainant, though persuasive, may only be sufficient to raise a rebuttable inference of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Doucette v. Postmaster General</span>, 01911107 (1991), the complainant presented evidence that the selecting official had stated he had not chosen the complainant for a position because he was "black, fat and old." However, without presenting evidence of actual animus directed toward the complainant, or similar statements made on other occasions, the agency was able to rebut the inference of discrimination by testimony from the selecting official that the successful candidate was chosen because of his education, experience, training, and outside endeavors.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, evidence that such statements were made by a recommending official is sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Arvizu v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01200541621 (2007), the Commission reversed the administrative judge's decision granting summary judgment to the agency on the basis that the complainant had not shown his qualifications were plainly superior to the successful candidates. The Commission, noting that a demonstration of superior qualifications is only one way to show pretext, found that the complainant's affidavit contained several instances where the recommending official had allegedly referred to him as a "spic" and used other racial epithets. The Commission found that summary judgment was inappropriate as evidence of the comments raised an issue of material fact that could support a finding of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that a complainant is questioned about his name change during a position interview is not persuasive evidence of discrimination based on national origin. <span class="Italic">Gellert v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01933939 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence of derogatory statements may be combined with indirect evidence of discrimination to support a finding of pretext. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01910442 (1991) (evidence of a statement threatening reprisal combined with evidence of disparate treatment and a <span class="Italic">post</span> <span class="Italic">hoc</span> performance evaluation was sufficient to support finding of pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Klau v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A00031 (2000), the Commission found that one comment by the complainant's supervisor was sufficient to establish pretext. In <span class="Italic">Klau</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission further finds that the AJ's factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and that her decision referenced the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws. While the agency has made a persuasive argument that complainant failed to identify any similarly situated employees whose unofficial, non-scheduled days were not changed, we note that although comparative evidence is often used to establish disparate treatment, it is not required, complainant need only set forth some evidence of acts from which, if otherwise unexplained, an inference of discrimination can be drawn<span class="Italic">. Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978). Approximately two weeks before his non-scheduled day was changed, complainant informed his first line supervisor that he would need leave for a religious holiday that fell during the route inspections. She responded, "I never heard of no Jew not working. You'll be here." The Commission draws an inference of religious discrimination from this response.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_747"></span>What is unclear about the <span class="Italic">Klau</span> case is why the Commission treated it as a circumstantial evidence case. Clearly, the supervisors comments linked religious bias to the personnel action in question and is, therefore, direct evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the wake of Supreme Court decisions in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993) and <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.</span>, 530 U.S. 133 (2000), it is a bit unclear as to whether a showing of pretext, standing alone, is sufficient to demonstrate discrimination. Both cases stand for the general proposition that demonstrating pretext does not inexorably lead to a finding of discrimination though, combined with <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case evidence may be sufficient. The Commission, along with most federal courts, appears to approach the situation on a case-by-case basis assessing the totality of the circumstances. For example, when derogatory ethnic comments are combined with a demonstration of pretext, this is sufficient to support a finding of discrimination as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Bustamante v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120080104 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To ultimately prevail, Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation is pretextual. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc</span>., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000); <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993). We find that Complainant has clearly done so in the present case, and the AJ erred in finding otherwise. In this respect, we find that the AJ did not consider Complainants' evidence that was offered to establish that the Agency's articulated reason is unworthy of belief. We note that the Supreme Court has held that the fact-finder may find pretext where she determines that the Agency's articulated reason is unworthy of belief. <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at 133. In this regard, we find that Complainant has presented credible evidence to establish that the Agency's nondiscriminatory reasons are unworthy of belief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, we find that Complainant has sufficiently established that S1's testimony that he was terminated because he could not sort three to four trays of mail per hour was unworthy of belief. In finding so, we note that Complainant testified that his mail trays were intentionally over-packed in comparison to other employees to make him slow in his mail sorting. Complainant testified that he counted over 800 pieces of mail in a tray when usually a tray is supposed to contain about 450 pieces of mail. In support of Complainant's testimony, the Custodian testified, "The trays that [Complainant] would have to sort were always jam packed in comparison to regular trays." The Custodian further testified, "I am a custodian, but. . .you see a difference in the trays that are worked by clerks, you know, and it was just--they were exaggeratedly packed, and he was always hurried, you know, Come on." Further, another Agency employee (Caucasian male) with 14 years of experience testified that his trays were also intentionally over-packed due to his sex. The employee testified, "I counted 880 pieces of mail in a tray, there's suppose to be 453, and if they're timing you, there's no way you're going to make it, so what that's doing is setting you up to fail."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that S1 was inconsistent in her testimony that Complainant's April 28, 2000, AWOL contributed to his termination. In particular, during the investigation S1 testified that Complainant's AWOL was factor to his termination. Conversely, however, later during the April 25, 2007 hearing, S1 testified that Complainant was not terminated for attendance or tardiness. Also we note, that S2, the supervisor on duty for April 28, 2000, testified that he was initially not going to mark Complainant with AWOL, but only did so because PM1 instructed him to.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Agency has not sufficiently explained why PM1 rated Complainant "unacceptable" in all six areas for his 30-day evaluation, including dependability and personal conduct. As to dependability, there is no evidence in the record supporting the fact that Complainant was absent or tardy during his first 30 days of employment. With respect to personal conduct, the record is devoid of any evidence that Complainant exhibited poor personal behavior at any point during his probationary period. Therefore, we find that the Agency's nondiscriminatory reasons are unworthy of belief and pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the Supreme Court has held that a complainant may demonstrate pretext by producing any relevant evidence that is sufficient to establish that agency officials more likely than not were motivated by discriminatory animus. <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, 509 U.S. at 511. Other relevant evidence of pretext might include the Agency's treatment of a complainant prior to the complained of action or the use of racial slurs by responsible management officials. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 804; <span class="Italic">Rowe v. Cleveland Pneumatic Co., Numerical Control</span>, 690 F.2d 88 (6th Cir. 1982). Notwithstanding the AJ's findings, we find that Complainant's testimony that PM1 remarked, "Are all Mexicans stupid?" to be credible. We further find that Complainant's Representative's testimony that PM1 said that Complainant was a "stupid Mexican," and she never wanting to hire him in the first place to be credible also. In finding so, we note that it is undisputed that PM1 had a history of uttering ethnic slurs to other Hispanic employees. Witnesses testified that they heard PM1 utter derogatory comments concerning Mexicans on multiple occasions. Further, we note that another employee also overheard PM1 say that she never wanted to hire Complainant. In this regard, we find that PM1's statements that she never wanted to hire Complainant, and her use of ethic slurs in reference to him, demonstrate that her decision to remove Complainant was motivated by unlawful discriminatory animus based on his national origin and sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, we note that the AJ not only found Complainant's testimony not credible, but also found that other witnesses testifying in his favor lacked credibility. Although in an administrative hearing the credibility findings of an AJ are entitled to great weight, we need not defer to them where, as here, they were not based upon witness demeanor or conduct. <span class="Italic">Munoz v. Secretary, Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900282 (July 18, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Derogatory comments on race can be especially telling when combined with evidence of disparate treatment and a racially segregated workforce. In <span class="Italic">McHugh v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120072925 (2012), the complainant, a black heavy mobile equipment technician was suspended and ultimately terminated parked in a space designated for the general foreman's secretary. He resolved the matter with the secretary, but refused to discuss it further with the assistant shop foreman. In addition to establishing that two white employees had parked in designated spaces without questioning, the Commission in <span class="Italic">McHugh</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that we cannot second guess the judgment of Agency officials regarding personnel decisions without a demonstrably discriminatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 259 (1981). After a careful review of the entire record, we find that a preponderance of the evidence establishes that discriminatory animus towards Complainant's race existed in CSMS. First, we note that discriminatory epithets such as "nigger" and "boy" were used by management officials in reference to Complainant. Those same management officials were involved in the decision to remove Complainant from his position, including the highest ranking official in CSMS. Further, the record establishes that CSMS was racially segregated, and that white employees were assigned to a separate side of the shop from black employees. The only white employee who was assigned to the side of CSMS with the black employees was subjected to many comments, including whether he liked working with "the brothers." The AJ noted that there was "convincing testimony regarding racial grouping in the mechanic work area" and cautioned the Agency to review its assignments. The AJ added "[a]s the Agency is well aware, segregation breeds hostility."</p>
