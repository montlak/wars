<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-154"><span class="space">M.</span> SPECIFIC DAMAGE ISSUES</h3>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Geraldine B. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0720180025 (2019), the Commission awarded $250,000 where the complainant was subjected to harassment and denied a reasonable accommodation. Previous to the events described in the complaint, the complainant was diagnosed with Post Trauma Stress Disorder. She requested and was granted a reasonable accommodation that excused her from duties involving interactions with the public. Later, her new supervisor assigned her to work the front desk, a public facing duty. During a conversation between the complainant and her new supervisor, the complainant experienced a panic attack that included crying, increasingly loud speak and a comment that she wanted to "slam (the supervisor) against a wall." The supervisor alleged that the complainant threw a chair and easel as she left the room. Witnesses to the incident stated that the complainant pushed the chair and easel as she tried to get out of the room. The supervisor suspended the complainant and had her removed from the premises by police. The administrative judge found that the supervisor had mixed motives for the suspension, the undisputed verbal threat and the uncorroborated allegation that the complainant threw the chair and easel to justify call the police and the discipline. The Commission agreed. In concluding that the complainant was due $250,000, the Commission considered the testimony of the complainant, complainant's family and therapist:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining nonpecuniary, compensatory damages, the Commission strives to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases. In this case, Complainant asserted that she was diagnosed with PTSD in 2010 and began therapy with a counselor in 2011. Complainant stated that she made marked improvements with her PTSD between 2011 and 2015, including losing weight, exercising, and having higher self-esteem. Complainant stated that S3's actions in April 2015 exacerbated her PTSD. Complainant stated that she slept and cried all the time, felt "worthless," and experienced insomnia. Complainant stated that S3's unfounded allegation of violence ruined her reputation and caused her to be removed from Agency property as if she were a criminal. Complainant stated that she lives in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business and she is humiliated. A third party even informed Complainant's daughters who live outside of the state. Complainant stated that she continues to be impacted by the discriminatory actions. (S3 acknowledged that she spoke of violence in the workplace and the use of furniture for violence at a staff meeting the next day.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that she feels like she had to start over with her progress. Complainant got a therapy dog that comforts her and changes her focus when she gets upset. Complainant stated that she stopped going to church, volunteering, and socializing, and she wants to have either her husband or her therapy dog with her at most times. Complainant stated that her eldest daughter had a high-risk pregnancy about the time of the incident and she could not go to the birth or visit immediately after her grandchild's birth because she could not stop crying. She stated that her daughters wanted her around but only if she could control her depression. Complainant stated, "I will never get over this." She stated that S3 intentionally harassed her when she did not listen to her request for accommodation and belittled her mental condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency placed Complainant on administrative leave from April 30, 2015 to May 17, 2015. Complainant stated, after the April 29 incident, she regained weight, had stomach pains and headaches, was the most depressed she has ever been in her life, had insomnia, did not exercise, did not take care of herself, did not feel she was worthy of respect, and <span id="Page_1941"></span>had intense nightmares. Complainant stated that she went on extended leave of absence, even after the Agency instructed her to return to work or risk adverse action. Complainant did not return to work until May 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that when she returned to work, her new supervisor, S5, provided her the accommodation of no front desk coverage. Complainant worked the 2016/2017 season. Complainant stated, ultimately, she retired from the Agency because she felt like people could not look at her the same as they did before the allegation of violence. Complainant stated that she wanted to work at least another year to reach 20 years of Republic employment and 65 years of age, but she was emotionally drained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's husband corroborated Complainant's statements. He added that Complainant's depression negatively affected their marriage and their daughters. The husband stated that Complainant became reclusive as she would not leave the house or have anyone over and would not socialize. The husband stated that he was concerned that Complainant would have a nervous breakdown or become suicidal. He stated, over the three years since the incident, things have settled a bit where one could have a conversation with Complainant and she was willing to leave their home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's therapist stated that Complainant's primary diagnosis is PTSD due to childhood experiences and her secondary diagnosis is Depression. The therapist stated that Complainant's PTSD can lead to panic attacks. The therapist stated that she believes the April 29 incident triggered a panic attack. The therapist stated that Complainant made tremendous strides in her therapy prior to April 29, but the incident "[undid] an enormous amount of work that [they] had done together." The therapist stated that Complainant was "flourishing," but the April 29 incident came close to undoing every bit of therapy she and Complainant did. The therapist stated that Complainant felt shame in living and taking up space in the world. The therapist stated that Complainant wanted to become a "shut-in." She stated that Complainant was afraid to go in public because she feared encountering someone who was aware of the April 29 incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The therapist stated that she heard rumors that Complainant threw a chair, got violent, and went to jail. (There is a city police department incident report citing Complainant as "suspect.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The therapist stated that she does not think Complainant will ever be able to move past the humiliation of April 29. She stated that Complainant was able to develop enough coping strategies and functionality to return to work in 2016, but still was unable to feel safe there and retired. The therapist stated that the high-risk pregnancy of Complainant's daughter was an exacerbating stressor, but not the primary stressor in Complainant's life. The therapist said the bulk of Complainant's therapy had been once a week, but during a crisis like the April 29 incident, they met twice a week. She stated that Complainant's therapy should continue indefinitely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After considering the awards in similar cases and the relevant factors discussed above, we find the AJ's award of $250,000 appropriate. We note that the Commission has awarded compensatory damage amounts similar to the amount awarded in this case. <span class="Italic">See Augustine S. v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110018 (October 22, 2015) (Commission affirmed EEOC Administrative Judge's award of $250,000 in nonpecuniary, compensatory damages to Complainant who experienced sleep disturbances, physical pain, social withdrawal, fear of others, and inability to work due to the Agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation over an extended period); <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720100040 (November 23, 2011) (Commission affirmed EEOC Administrative Judge's award of $200,000 in nonpecuniary, compensatory damages to Complainant who experienced depression, severe migraines, sleeplessness, strain on familial relationships, severe physical damage, social withdrawal, and damage to her professional reputation due to the Agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation and its portrayal of Complainant as an insubordinate employee); <span class="Italic">Blount v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (October 21, 2009) (Commission affirmed EEOC Administrative Judge's award of $200,000 in nonpecuniary, compensatory damages to Complainant who experienced severe depression and loss of self-esteem and sense of worth due to the Agency's failure to engage in the interactive process and provide reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taunya P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720180022 (2019) (upholding a $250,000 award where a failure to accommodate resulted in nerve damage, exacerbated back pain, leg pain, neurologic damage, a miscarriage, occasional difficult urinating, numbness, tingling, burning, weakness and the complainant's doctor testified that she had reached her maximum medical improvement but still suffered from pain, spasms, stiffness and occasional giving way of the legs).</p>
<p class="noindent">The availability of compensatory damages has infused a "messy" element into what, in the past, were relatively sanitary legal proceedings. Prior to passage of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, such things as the prior mental history or family problems of a complainant would only be raised if they had some direct bearing on the merits of the case as it related to the agency's liability. Rarely were such matters deemed relevant to that determination. Now such matters are routinely raised in the vast majority of cases because of their relevance to damage determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem is simple; the solution is not. Complainants, who invariably seek large damage awards for emotional distress, must prove the discrimination caused their distress. Agencies, who invariably seek to pay little or nothing in emotional distress damages, attempt to prove there are other causes of the complainant's distress. The general rules, at first blush, seem straightforward. An agency is liable for the harm caused by its discrimination, even if the complainant has a preexisting condition that makes him or her more susceptible to harm. The agency, however, is only liable for the additional harm caused by its discrimination. Moreover, an agency is only liable for the harm caused by its discrimination and not for harm caused by factors other than discrimination. Application of the general rules is not always so easy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Addressed below are some of the specific issues that can arise in damage cases.</p>
