<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-64"><span class="space">1.</span> Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009</h4>
<p class="noindent">Congress immediately pursued Justice Ginsburg's suggestion in closing her dissent in the <span class="Italic">Ledbetter</span> case and legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives to overturn the decision. On January 29, 2009, President Obama signed Pub. L. 111-2--the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Act overruled the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co., Inc.,</span> 550 U.S. 618 (2007), holding that discrimination based on the discriminatory payment of wages had to be brought within the statute of limitations that began running as of the date of the initial decision on wages. The Act amends Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The purpose of the Act is to "clarify that a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice that is unlawful under such Acts occurs each time compensation is paid pursuant to the discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, and for other purposes." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Act provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.</span>, 550 U.S. 618 (2007), significantly impairs statutory protections against discrimination in compensation that Congress established and that have been bedrock principles of American law for decades. The Ledbetter decision undermines those statutory protections by unduly restricting the time period in which victims of discrimination can challenge and recover for discriminatory compensation decisions or other practices, contrary to the intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The limitation imposed by the Court on the filing of discriminatory compensation claims ignores the reality of wage discrimination and is at odds with the robust application of the civil rights laws that Congress intended.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;With regard to any charge of discrimination under any law, nothing in this Act is intended to preclude or limit an aggrieved person's right to introduce evidence of an unlawful employment practice that has occurred outside the time for filing a charge of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Nothing in this Act is intended to change current law treatment of when pension distributions are considered paid.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION BECAUSE OF RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)(A) For purposes of this section, an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;In addition to any relief authorized by section 1977A of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981a), liability may accrue and an aggrieved person may obtain relief as provided in subsection (g)(1), including recovery of back pay for up to two years preceding the filing of the charge, where the unlawful employment practices that have occurred during the charge filing period are similar or related to unlawful employment practices with regard to discrimination in compensation that occurred outside the time for filing a charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SEC. 4. DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION BECAUSE OF AGE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7(d) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 626(d)) is amended--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;in the first sentence--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;by striking "(d)" and inserting "(d)(1)";</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;in the third sentence, by striking "Upon" and inserting the following:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, take effect as if enacted on May 28, 2007 and apply to all claims of discrimination in compensation under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.), title I and section 503 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that are pending on or after that date.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kirby S. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2021001072 (2021), the agency dismissed, for untimely counselor contact, a complaint that the agency discriminated against complainant based on his age throughout his employment because the agency determined that he was ineligible, due to being hired after his 45th birthday, to participate in Part A of the Mission Germany Retirement Benefit Plan/Defined Benefit Plan (DBP) for LE Staff. The Commission described the benefit plan as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DBP Part A provided old age, disability, and survivor annuities for non-temporary LE Staff in the plan. All costs were borne by the U.S. Government. Non-temporary LE Staff automatically became participants of DBP Part A following five years of credible Agency service, so long in relevant part that they did not enter U.S. Government service after their 45th birthday. While benefits are paid by a private German insurance company, the legal entitlement to them remained with the U.S. Government. Effective March 31, 2019, Mission Germany replaced DBP with a Defined Contribution Plan (DCP) for LE Staff. With DCP, the U.S. Government contributed 3%, and the employee could contribute up to the legal limit under German law. DCP had no exclusion on participation based on hire age. Eligible participants included those hired after January 25, 2015 (the date, according to Complainant, that Mission Germany suspended DBP for newly hired LE Staff) and those hired before January 25, 2015, who were not eligible to participate in DBP because of insurance underwriting restrictions. LE Staff already in DBP, and those who both had not completed their five-year waiting period to enter DBP and were hired prior to January 25, 2015, were grandfathered into DBP with no changes to its provisions, unless they waived their entitlement to participate in DBP.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reversed the dismissal in <span class="Italic">Kirby S</span>. reminding that the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act applies to "all claims of compensation discrimination pending on or after the effective date":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An aggrieved person must seek EEO counseling within 45 days of the date of the alleged discriminatory action, or in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) &#x0026; .107(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency did not analyze the complaint under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-2, 123 Stat 5. The Act has a retroactive effective date of May 28, 2007, and applies to all claims of compensation discrimination pending on or after the effective date under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA. With respect to Title VII claims, Section 3 of the Act provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or part from such a decision or other practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Ledbetter Act covers "wages, benefits, or other compensation" which includes contributions to a pension plan. <span class="Italic">Tomlinson v. El Paso Corp</span>., 107 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 194, 2009 WL 2766718 (D. Colo. 2009). Complainant's EEO complaint regards wages and benefits in the form of accrual of pension benefits, not pension distribution payments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the Ledbetter Act applies, and Complainant's claim is timely from May 28, 2007, onward.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kitchen v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120090609 (2009), the Commission held that the Ledbetter Fair Act applied to EPA, Title VII, Rehabilitation Act and ADEA claims. However, the Commission limited the complainant's claim to include only those arising within 45 days of the initiation of counseling and not to include any earlier allegations of discriminatory compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission vacated the dismissal of a complaint in <span class="Italic">Tesfazion v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120091121 (2009), where the complainant alleged that she was paid less than her predecessor. The complainant contacted a counselor six months after her initial assignment to the position. Citing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Commission reversed finding the Act applied to all cases pending on or after May 28, 2007, the effective date of the Act. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141578 (2014); <span class="Italic">Turose-Gaddy v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0520090180 (2010) (reinstating complaint that was pending before an administrative judge in May 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Gilbert B. v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 0120152531 (2016), revived an otherwise untimely counselor contact case where complainant alleged "that the Agency subjected him to discrimination on the basis of race (African-American) when he was denied opportunities to be promoted to GS-14 and other advancement opportunities in the Safety Mission and Assurance Commercial Crew Office." The Commission reasoned:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that Complainant's EEO counselor contact was timely under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (Ledbetter Act), Pub. L. No. 111-12, 123. Stat. 5. The Ledbetter Act applies to all claims of discrimination in compensation, pending on or after May 28, 2007, under Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. With respect to Title VII claims, Section 3 of the Ledbetter Act provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or part from such a decision or other practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Ledbetter Act was passed in response to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co</span>., 550 U.S. 618 (2007). In brief, the plaintiff, Ledbetter, had filed a private sector charge with the Commission several months prior to her retirement. In her charge, she alleged that she had been paid less than her male counterparts because of her sex filing an EEOC charge for pay discrimination began when the pay-setting decision was made. Plaintiff Ledbetter's claim was therefore late. Following the Ledbetter decision, Congress passed the Ledbetter Act determining that the Supreme Court's decision had been unduly restrictive regarding the time period within which victims of compensation discrimination could challenge and recover for discriminatory compensation decisions or other practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant initiated contact with an EEO counselor on December 9, 2014, which was approximately nine months after the most recent alleged discriminatory promotion. Here, however, Complainant is alleging in essence that the Agency subjected him to race-based discrimination when he was paid less than other workers. According to the Ledbetter Act, Complainant's EEO counselor contact was timely because, as a current Agency employee as of December 9, 2014, it was within 45 days of Complainant's last paycheck. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">Complainant, v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 012015-458, (Apr. 30, 2015); <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120100794 (May 4, 2010). Therefore, we find that the Agency's dismissal of the complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(2) was not appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Act does not extend to retirement payments. In <span class="Italic">Brakeall v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0120093805 (2010), the Commission upheld dismissal of a complaint alleging that the complainant had received discriminatory paychecks for the last three years of her employment with the agency and, as a result, was receiving discriminatory retirement benefits. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brakeall</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This matter presents an issue of first impression for the Commission. The Commission has previously addressed the issue of timeliness of claims under the Ledbetter Act when a complainant is alleging receipt of discriminatory paychecks. However, the Commission has not addressed the issue of timeliness of claims under the Ledbetter Act when a complainant is alleging receipt of discriminatory pension checks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The President signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-2, 123 Stat, 5, on January 29, 2009. 2 The Ledbetter Act applies to all claims of discrimination in compensation, pending on or after May 28, 2007, under Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, <span id="Page_96"></span>Title I and Section 503 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. With respect to Title VII claims, Section 3 of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the portion of Complainant's claim that she received discriminatory pay as an employee, we find that the Agency properly dismissed this claim on the grounds of untimely EEO Counselor contact. Complainant retired from the agency and received her last paycheck in 1997, but did not initiate EEO Counselor contact until 2009, over twelve years later. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) provides that an aggrieved person must initiate contact with an EEO Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action. In the instant matter, Complainant did not contact an EEO Counselor within 45 days of receiving a paycheck during her tenure as an Agency employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission further notes that the record is without evidence that the applicable time limit should be waived. The record reflects that Complainant reasonably suspected discrimination during her employment with the Agency. In her formal complaint, Complainant asserted that she knew while she was still employed that the other Information Resource Management Branch Chiefs (who were males) were GS-15s, while she was compensated below the GS-15 pay level. Significantly, Complainant stated that, prior to her retirement in 1997, she helped prepare a vacancy announcement for her replacement and the position was posted as a GS-14/15. However, she does not explain why she did not initiate EEO counseling on this matter until twelve years later in 2009. Thus, the Agency correctly dismissed her claim that her paychecks were discriminatory as untimely raised with an EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing the Ledbetter Act, Complainant also claims that the pension checks she has received since her retirement from the Agency reflect the discriminatory compensation she received while employed by the Agency. We find that the Agency properly dismissed this claim on the grounds of untimely EEO Counselor contact, as well. Section 2(4) of the Ledbetter Act provides that "[n]othing in this Act is intended to change current law treatment of when pension distributions are considered paid." The legislative history of this provision of the Ledbetter Act supports differentiating between wage-based claims and claims based on pension payments. Specifically, the House Report for the Ledbetter Act stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">While the bill includes benefits as a form of compensation which could trigger the statute of limitations when paid, the bill does not intend to alter how current law treats the question of when such benefits are paid. For example, case law treats the receipt of repeated pension checks under a defined benefit plan to be qualitatively different from the receipt of paychecks. <span class="Italic">See Florida v. Long</span>, 487 U.S. 223, 239 (1988). One court has explained: "Paychecks are payments for a prior term of work. For example, an employee works for a week, then the salary structure is applied and the paycheck is issued. Pension checks, however, are based on a pension structure that is applied only once, when the employee retires, and the pension checks merely flow from that single application" [quoting <span class="Italic">Maki v. Allete, Inc</span>., 383 F.3d 740, 744 (8th Cir. 2004)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">H.R. Rep. No. 110-237, at 18 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several courts have determined that the Ledbetter Act preserves the former case law with respect to payments of pension benefits where the amount of the benefit is determined by a formula that was applied or a contract that was entered into when the employee retired. In such cases, a new unlawful employment practice does not occur each time a discriminatory pension benefit is paid. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Zimmelman v. Teachers' Ret. Sys. of the City of New York</span>, 2010 WL 1172769 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); <span class="Italic">Tomlinson v. El Paso Corp</span>., 2009 WL 2766718 (D. Colo. 2009) (<span class="Italic">dictum</span>). The Commission's Compliance Manual recognizes that courts might decide that "pension benefits are considered paid upon entering retirement and not upon issuance of each annuity check." EEOC Compliance Manual, Chapter 2 sec. 2-IV, C, 4 (revised Aug. 2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has not pointed to any evidence to convince us that the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Florida v. Long</span> that while a series of payments of discriminatory wages may constitute a continuing violation, a series of payments of discriminatory pension benefits usually does not should not apply in this particular case. In the instant matter, Complainant retired in 1997, but did not contact an EEO Counselor until 2009. Thus, Complainant did not contact an EEO Counselor within 45 days of her retirement and her claim alleging discriminatory payment of pension benefits was correctly dismissed as untimely raised. Moreover, we have already determined that she reasonably suspected the discrimination prior to her retirement and has not proffered adequate justification for waiving the applicable limitation period.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the complainant was aware of an alleged pay disparity for more than 45 days, her complaint was timely where she alleged that the agency corrected the erroneous hiring of a white employee but did not correct a similar error for her. In <span class="Italic">Gillotte v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120111987 (2011), the complainant was one of four employees hired as GS-4 secretaries. The complainant alleged that the agency corrected the error for a white employee, promoting him to GS-5, but despite several efforts on her part the agency had not corrected a similar error for her. The agency dismissed the complaint as untimely because the complainant did not contact a counselor within 45 days of learning that the error had been corrected for the white employee. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Gillotte,</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The President signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-2, 123 Stat 5 ("the Act") on January 29, 2009. The Act applies to all claims of discrimination in compensation, pending on or after May 28, 2007, under Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA. With respect to Title VII claims, Section 3 of the Act provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or part from such a decision or other practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 3 of the Act also provides that back pay is recoverable for Title VII violations up to two years preceding the "filing of the charge," or the filing of a complaint in the federal sector, where the pay discrimination outside of the filing period is similar or related to pay discrimination within the filing period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant learned that she was erroneously hired by late November or early December 2009. She contends that the status of the white employee who was erroneously hired around the same time as her was corrected. Complainant indicated that within a few weeks of continually complaining to HRMS, the white employee got his status changed and received his promotion and pay increase, but she has been waiting since March 30, 2010, for her promotion and pay increase.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant knew or reasonably should have known that the Agency's failure to correct her erroneous hire was allegedly discriminatory after the status of the white employee was corrected and hers was not. When Complainant contacted the EEO counselor on August 24, 2010, she indicated that things had been fixed for the white employee in a matter of weeks, but her situation remained unchanged since March 30, 2010. Based on this, we find that Complainant waited more than 45 calendar days after learning the white employee's erroneous hire was corrected to contact an EEO counselor regarding her own situation, and hence her EEO contact on correcting the erroneous hire was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, we find that Complainant's claim that she was discriminated against when her pay was not upgraded on March 30, 2010, is timely. We understand that on appeal, Complainant stated the Agency incorrectly defined her complaint, and it was about her erroneous hire. Complainant's writings, however, indicate she is also alleging that not receiving the wage increase and back pay because of the erroneous hire was discriminatory, and we find these matters are intertwined, i.e. an investigation on why Complainant was not given a wage increase on March 30, 2010, will require looking into why her erroneous hire has not been corrected.</p>
