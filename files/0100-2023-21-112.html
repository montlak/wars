<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-83"><span class="space">1.</span> Knowledge of Agency</h4>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission's regulation plainly indicates, knowledge of the harassment on the part of the agency is a necessary element of liability. However, the plain language of the regulation also makes it clear that constructive knowledge--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the agency should have known of the harassment--will suffice.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency cannot be charged with knowledge of coworker harassment where it makes inquiries about suspected harassment and received negative responses from the alleged victims. In <span class="Italic">Puklich v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54017 (2006), the plant manager received reports from a union official that an employee was harassing two female coworkers. The manager then made inquiries of the complainant, but was told there was nothing that she wished to report. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Puklich</span>, found that the agency was not liable for any harassment because it could not be charged with actual or constructive knowledge of the harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we concur with the agency that although complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment, the record supports a finding that the agency successfully asserted an affirmative defense to avoid liability. Specifically, we find that the record reflects that although complainant discussed CW's harassing conduct with her co-workers, she expressly stated that she declined to make a formal report to management due to fear of reprisal should CW be fired. In fact, even when PM gave her the opportunity to confirm the "scuttlebutt" reported to him, early in February 2004, she declined to do so. In this regard, we find that PM acted reasonably in making a preliminary inquiry of this nature, given that the e-mail from the union president was third-hand information, and strongly suggested that the report of sexual harassment might be no more than an unsubstantiated rumor started by FUO, who apparently had an adverse relationship with CW. Moreover, we further find that PM further acted reasonably when he made inquiries of union officials <span id="Page_905"></span>regarding receipt of any reports of harassing conduct by CW, and also when he asked the other female worker, who was also rumored to have been sexually harassed by CW, if she had a problem with him. We find that the record confirms that all of these inquiries yielded negative responses. Therefore, based on this evidence, we concur with the agency that the union president's e-mail to PM was not sufficient to put the agency on notice at that time that CW was sexually harassing complainant, and liability cannot be imputed to the agency at this point for taking no action. <span class="Italic">See Parker, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that PM's inquiry of complainant on the work floor was simply part PM's attempt to ascertain whether or not there was a problem to investigate, and not an overture to conduct a full-blown on-the-spot confidential discourse with complainant about a confirmed report of sexual harassment. We also find that the management's action upon complainant's March 2, 2004 report of CW's to her supervisor, was immediate and had the effect of abruptly and permanently stopping the harassment. Therefore, we find that once complainant finally communicated CW's conduct to management, the agency took immediate measures to stop the harassment, thereby avoiding liability.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Frank v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110223 (2013) (complainant never told management that she heard coworker say she wished the agency would "get rid of these niggers" and also did not tell work environment analyst brought in to deal with workplace tensions about the comment).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the sexual harassment is pervasive, it will give rise to an inference that the agency had constructive knowledge of the harassment. <span class="Italic">See Trammel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01871154 (1988). This is so even when the employee testifies she did not alert agency management because she was afraid of losing her job. A contemporaneous complaint of harassment is considered persuasive evidence on the issue of knowledge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Postmaster General</span>, 05900546 (1990), <span class="Italic">citing</span> the <span class="Italic">EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment</span> (March 19, 1990). In <span class="Italic">Ulloa v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972750 (2000), the Commission found that rumors about the complainant's sexual activity were so egregious and pervasive that "it was inconceivable that agency supervisors would have been unaware of such comments about complainant's sexual exploits."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720140002 (2014), the Commission imputed knowledge to the agency where the complainant told her supervisor about being called a "bitch" by a coworker and that he pounded a table and told her she was not safe "off-the clock." The supervisor reported the incident to management:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found Complainant's testimony credible that EE's sex-based utterance on November 1, 2010, and threat caused her fear and anxiety and created a hostile work environment. On appeal, the Agency contends that there is no basis for imputing liability to the Agency since they did not know EE threatened Complainant on the date of the incident. We note that where, as here, the alleged harassment is perpetrated by a coworker, liability is imputed to the employer if it knew or should have known of the misconduct and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, EEOC Notice No. N-915-050 at 29-30 (March 19, 1990); <span class="Italic">Owens v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940824 (September 5, 1996). In this case, the AJ found that S1 was made aware that Complainant felt harassment due to EE's threat on November 1 incident and S1 informed management and the Postal Inspector of the incident. The AJ also found that S1 credibly testified that S1 knew that EE lied to the Supervisor of Maintenance during his interview denying his threat to Complainant leading to no further investigation of the matter. The AJ further found that EE's other derogatory remark (regarding that Complainant should have been escorted from the building) further contributed to harassment experienced by Complainant. We agree with the AJ that the harassment was sufficient to create a hostile work environment. After a review of the record, despite the Agency's contentions, we find that liability is imputed to the Agency since the Agency failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. We also find that the AJ properly found that management, including S1, failed to ensure Complainant that she would be safe on the job with no further harassment from EE.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's knowledge of the specifics of the alleged harassment is not required. If it ignores more general complaints about the workplace, liability may ensue. In <span class="Italic">Calunas v. Postmaster General</span>, 01970547 (2000), the Commission found that general complaints about the workplace, coupled with the pervasive nature of the harassment, resulted in liability for the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence in the file, however, suggests that the agency's actions were not immediate or appropriate. Although the complainant did not immediately complain about the specifics of the harassment, we find that her supervisor should have known that she was being subjected to a hostile working environment before she complained with specificity. For example, complainant made general complaints about the workplace on several occasions. And many of her co-workers, including her supervisor, stated that sexually derogatory jokes were common in the workplace. Complainant's co-workers also stated that many of the male employees had obscene pictures at their workstations. Complainant's supervisor found a sanitary napkin at complainant's workstation and threw it away. Those things, combined with the fact that the supervisor gave complainant a picture of a naked cartoon man which read, "I never forgot an a**hole," convinces us that the supervisor knew or should have known of the hostile environment to which complainant was subjected before she (complainant) complained with specificity. Therefore, we find that the supervisor's failure to take action as soon as she knew or should have known constitutes a failure on the agency's part to respond immediately and appropriately to the hostile work environment. Given the circumstances as a whole and to the extent that the supervisor participated in the activities, we find that the agency is liable to complainant for sexual harassment<span class="Italic">. See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes an agency's denial of knowledge is simply not credible under the circumstances. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Stanton S. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120170582 (2019). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Stanton S.,</span> an African American, alleged that his coworkers took his toolbox, removed the tools and a left a note in the toolbox suggesting that African Americans lacked the skills to be plumbers; a coworker tried to restrain him to a chair using a metal hose clamp; a coworker showed him a picture of a beam that said African Americans smell like goats and referred to him as a goat; and his coworkers duct taped him to a chair. The agency conducted a fact-finding inquiry. Finding the complainant's allegations true, the agency suspended one coworker and proposed to terminate two others. Before the Commission, however, the agency maintained that, while they found complainant's allegations credible, management denied knowledge that the harassment was race-based. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Stanton S.</span> discredited the agency's position, holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find it highly unlikely that Complainant would be credible regarding every detail of the incidents, except for the racial component. Moreover, as Complainant testified that he was the only African-American plumber in the facility, so if true, it strains credibility that neither S1 nor S2 thought there was no racial animosity behind these incidents.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although not emphasized by the Commission, the supervisor's participation in the harassment in <span class="Italic">Calunas</span> is a significant factor weighing in favor of liability. An example of that is <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070042 (2007), where the supervisors' participation in the racial harassment of a white employee precluded the agency from establishing that it had used reasonable care in preventing the harassment. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusion that management was generally not credible. Specifically, we note that management's testimony was inconsistent. For example, management testified that complainant was performing poorly, but documentary evidence indicated that management found complainant's performance superb. Without providing any reasonable explanation, management conceded that complainant desperately sought a transfer which is seemingly at odds with management's characterization of a tranquil and supportive work environment. Moreover, there can be no reasonable denial that the agency was unaware of the racially charged abusive environment created and fostered by its supervisory personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that there was substantial evidence of racial animus in the record to support the AJ's findings of harassment based upon race. While complainant testified that he felt that he was being picked on because he had an easy job, the weight of the evidence indicates that his African-American supervisors and co-workers did not like Caucasians. Although complainant was easy to pick on because of his low level position and veteran status, the evidence points to race as the basis of the hostile conduct. Accordingly, we find substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's findings of fact as well as her credibility determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the agency has made no attempt whatsoever to show that it should not be held liable for the actions of its supervisors. The record is devoid of any evidence tending to prove the two elements of the affirmative defense. For example, with respect to the "first prong" of the defense, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the agency ever exercised any care (much less "reasonable care") to prevent and correct promptly the harassment. In addition, the agency failed the "second prong" of the affirmative defense. The record is devoid of evidence showing that complainant "unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by [his] employer." We therefore find that the agency has not proven the two essential elements of the affirmative defense to vicarious agency liability for supervisory conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Notifying a supervisor that sexual harassment is occurring is sufficient to put the agency on notice with respect to a subsequent EEO complaint. As a result, the complainant may not be required to strictly comply with the 45-day time limit for contacting a counselor. In <span class="Italic">Landmesser v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 05920835 (1993), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central purposes of 29 CFR 1613.214 are (1) to effectively notify <span id="Page_906"></span>the agency of an allegation of discrimination so that the agency can promptly right any wrong which may have been done; and (2) to prevent complainants from sitting on their rights and then deciding to file an EEO complaint over matters which occurred long ago. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Marsh</span>, 777 F.2d 8, 14 (D.C. Cir. 1985). With these purposes in mind, the Commission notes that this is not a case in which appellant failed to exercise due diligence in bringing her allegations to the attention of an agency official, whom appellant thought to be an appropriate recipient of the information. The record reflects that, not only did appellant have discussions with her Immediate Supervisor regarding the alleged sexual harassment, but that this supervisory official also personally observed the alleged sexual harassment take place at the work site. Further, while the Supervisory official may not have been employed as an EEO Counselor within the facility, we find that appellant's contact with the supervisory official is sufficient to constitute notice to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Commission finds that, despite the agency's assertion that the alleged harassment and discriminatory conduct ceased in January 1991, appellant's contentions indicate that she did not feel that the harassment had ceased at that time. Appellant indicated that, in early April 1991, she received anonymous obscene telephone calls which she believes were initiated by her former supervisory official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that, while a complainant's failure to comply strictly with the requirements of 29 CFR 1613.214 would ordinarily confer on the agency the right to reject the complaint, there are occasions when the circumstances, when viewed in light of the purposes of our regulations and Title VII, dictate exceptions to this general rule. <span class="Italic">Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 455 U.S. 385 (1982). When Congress amended Title VII in 1972 to cover federal as well as private-sector employees it was mindful that frequently administrative complaints would be lodged by lay persons, without the benefit of legal assistance, who would be untrained in negotiating procedural labyrinths. <span class="Italic">Loe v. Heckler</span>, 768 F.2d 409, 417 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The Commission finds that this case presents one of those exceptional circumstances where the spirit, if not the letter of the regulations was satisfied by appellant's contacts with the agency's managerial official, prior to her May 23, 1991 contact with the EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Commission finds that the discussions appellant had with agency managerial officials, as well as her Immediate Supervisor's personal observation of the alleged sexual harassment conduct in the workplace, were sufficient to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1613.214(a)(1)(i). Specifically, we find that the agency had an affirmative duty to take some form of corrective action at the time appellant raised concerns regarding the alleged sexual harassment conduct. Therefore, in the absence of evidence demonstrating that the agency exercised due diligence in this matter to timely address appellant's concerns, the agency is precluded from asserting that appellant's contact with an EEO Counselor on May 23, 1991 was untimely. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the previous decision properly determined that appellant's EEO contact on May 23, 1991 was timely, and that the agency improperly canceled appellant's complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Delay in reporting the alleged harassment to the agency can result in a finding of no liability, particularly where the agency has a sexual harassment policy and place and provides annual training to employees on sexual harassment. In <span class="Italic">Piccolo v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0210111477 (2012), the complainant delayed some three years in reporting alleged harassment by a coworker. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Piccolo</span> found that the agency was not liable for any harassment explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency produced evidence to establish that it had a sexual harassment policy in place and that all employees, including Complainant received annual training on sexual harassment. The record in this matter established that Complainant waited years before finally reporting the conduct of CW to Agency officials. To justify her delay, Complainant indicates that she feared CW and his capacity to retaliate. However, record evidence indicates and Complainant admits that CW never made any threatening statements or gestures toward her. In fact, the AJ found that Complainant's claim that she feared CW directly contradicted her hearing testimony. Specifically, the AJ pointed to the fact that Complainant served as Union treasurer during the time she asserted that CW was harassing her and she voluntarily attended a Union dinner in October 2007 where she sat right next to CW. The AJ also found that Complainant voluntarily engaged in conversation with CW about sex, claiming that she did so in order to "fit in."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, it is undisputed that Complainant did not report her allegations to the Agency for years. The record indicates that Complainant did not report any of CW's harassing behavior until April 25, 2008 although she indicates that it began as early as 2005. Complainant finally reported the harassing conduct in April 2008, at which time the Agency immediately took action by removing CW from the tower, placing CW on administrative leave and transferring him to an offsite work location. The Agency conducted an investigation of CW and found that he had engaged in inappropriate conduct and disciplined him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above the Agency had in place a harassment policy which provided alternate methods for reporting allegations of sexual harassment. Complainant could have telephoned in her allegations directly to the Agency's Accountability Board, or she could have availed herself of the employee hotline well before April 2008. We concur with the AJ's determination that Complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities to avoid harm. Once Complainant reported the allegations of sexual harassment, the Agency immediately took action ultimately disciplining CW for his behavior. While Complainant questions the severity of the discipline issued to CW, the Agency established that the issued discipline conformed to Agency policy and Union agreement when CW was suspended for three days.</p>
