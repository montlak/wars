<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-75"><span class="space">3.</span> "Speak English Only" Rule and Restrictive Language Policies</h4>
<p class="noindent">An important part of a person's national origin is often the native language of that particular group. Even though many persons who have learned English as a second language are extremely fluent in English, it is not unexpected that, at times, they will revert to their native language. When an agency imposes a rule that requires employees to speak English at all times in the workplace, the rule is subject to extreme scrutiny. Under 29 CFR 1606.7:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a) <span class="Italic">When applied at all times</span>. A rule requiring employees to speak English only at all times in the workplace is a burdensome term and condition of employment. The primary language of an individual is often an essential national origin characteristic. Prohibiting employees at all times, in the workplace, from speaking their primary language or the language they speak most comfortably, disadvantages an individual's employment opportunities on the basis of national origin. It may also create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation and intimidation based on national origin which could result in a discriminatory work environment. Therefore, the Commission will presume that such a rule violates Title VII and will closely scrutinize it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When applied only at certain times</span>. An employer may have a rule requiring that employees speak only in English at certain times where the employer can show that the rule is justified by business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Notice of the rule</span>. It is common for individuals whose primary language is not English to inadvertently change from speaking English to speaking their primary language. Therefore, if an employer believes it has a business necessity for a speak-English-only rule at certain times, the employer should inform its employees of the general circumstances when speaking English only is required and of the consequences of violating the rule. If an employer fails to effectively notify its employees of the rule and makes an adverse employment decision against an individual based on a violation of the rule, the Commission will consider the employer's application of the rule as evidence of discrimination on the basis of national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent">Section V, C. of the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination</span> further notes as to English only rules and other employer imposed restrictive language policies:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Restrictive language policies or practices requiring the use of the English language at work are commonly known as English-only rules. These policies or practices may also involve languages other than English, for <span id="Page_1037"></span>example, Spanish-only policies. Restrictive language policies implicate national origin because an individual's primary language is closely tied to his or her cultural and ethnic identity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Policies Adopted for Discriminatory Reasons</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with other workplace policies, a restrictive language policy violates Title VII if it is adopted for discriminatory reasons, such as bias against employees of a particular national origin. Thus, it would be unlawful disparate treatment to implement an English-only rule in order to avoid hearing foreign languages in the workplace, to generate a reason to discipline or terminate people who are not native English speakers, or to create a hostile work environment for certain non-English speaking workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence of disparate treatment includes failure to consider whether there are substantial business reasons for the policy. The weaker the business reasons, the more difficult it may be to justify the policy under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 28</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Evidence Establishes That Policy Was Adopted for Discriminatory Reasons</p>
<p class="noindent-2">John, a Latino man who is bilingual in Spanish and English, works in a warehouse for Factory, Inc. John works on an assembly line and has job duties that do not require him to speak English. Factory decides to adopt a rule that requires all workplace communications to be conducted in English after a complaint is received objecting to John speaking Spanish during a break. In practice, the English-only rule is applied at all times on company property, even though its text says that it should not be applied during breaks and personal time.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">John files a Title VII charge challenging the rule. Based on the evidence, the EEOC finds reasonable cause to believe that John was subjected to unlawful disparate treatment. In particular, the evidence reveals that Factory, Inc., had no work-related reasons for the rule, and a manager expressed concern prior to the rule's adoption that other warehouse employees were likely to taunt Latinos if they knew about the rule. Finally, Factory, Inc.'s chief executive referred to the Spanish language as "garbage" in a public interview. The evidence establishes reasonable cause to believe that the English-only rule was adopted because of anti-Latino bias.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Policies Applied in a Discriminatory Manner</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regardless of whether a restrictive language policy was adopted for nondiscriminatory reasons, the policy may not be applied differently to employees because of their national origin. For example, if six languages other than English are spoken in a workplace, it would be facially discriminatory to prohibit employees from speaking one of those languages but not the others, e.g., a "no Russian rule," no matter the reason. Title VII also prohibits an employer from enforcing a policy in a discriminatory manner, for example, imposing more severe discipline on Vietnamese employees who violate the policy than on Latino employees with comparable violations. Finally, penalizing employees for minor, inadvertent infractions that do not undermine workplace safety or efficiency may be evidence of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;EEOC Guidelines on English-only Policies</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC's long-standing English-only guidelines, issued in 1980, provide that rules requiring employees to speak English in the workplace at all times will be presumed to violate Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Adverse Effect on National Origin Groups</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When an employer imposes an English-only rule, either in limited circumstances or at all times, employees with limited or no English skills and bilingual employees whose primary language is not English may be adversely affected because they are prohibited from communicating at work-including for work-related purposes--in their most effective language. An English-only rule may also adversely impact these employees by subjecting them to discipline and termination for speaking their most effective language while imposing no comparable risk for native English-speaking employees. Finally, an English-only rule "is likely in itself to 'create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation, and intimidation' that constitutes a 'discriminatory working environment.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Policies That Apply at All Times</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A restrictive language policy is applied "at all times" when employees are prohibited from speaking their primary language any time they are on duty or in the workplace, including during lunch, breaks, and other personal time while on the employer's premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Because language-restrictive policies may be applied only to those specific employment situations for which they are needed to promote safe and efficient job performance or business operations, blanket rules requiring employees to speak English (or another language) at all times are presumptively unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;Policies That Apply in Limited Circumstances</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The lawfulness of a limited language-restrictive policy--one that does not apply at all times or to all jobs, workplace situations, or locations--depends on whether the evidence shows that the policy is job related and consistent with business necessity. An employer may satisfy this standard by providing detailed, fact-specific, and credible evidence demonstrating that the business purpose of requiring employees to speak a common language is sufficiently necessary to safe and efficient job performance or safe and efficient business operations to override its adverse impact, and that it is narrowly tailored to minimize any discriminatory impact based on national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">d.&#x2003;Job Related and Consistent with Business Necessity</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Because of the adverse effects of a restrictive language policy on employees with limited or no English skills, and on bilingual employees whose primary language is not English, such a policy is unlawful unless the employer establishes that the policy is job related and consistent with business necessity. It is not sufficient that the policy merely promote business convenience.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To meet the burden of establishing business necessity, the employer must present detailed, fact-specific, and credible evidence showing that the language-restrictive policy is "necessary to safe and efficient job performance" or safe and efficient business operations. This burden cannot be met with conclusory statements or bare assertions about the business need for a language-restrictive policy. It is necessary to analyze the specific circumstances that are presented in each situation. The following general principles provide guidance when evaluating whether a language-restrictive policy is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;Restrictive Language Policy Effectively Serves Business Needs</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Part of establishing business necessity is demonstrating that the language-restrictive policy actually serves the identified business need. The effectiveness of a language-restrictive policy also may hinge on which language is identified as the common language of those performing the work. Sales representatives with monolingual clientele may generate the most sales by speaking the language in which the customer is proficient. Similarly, cooperative work assignments may be completed efficiently when employees use the language in which they are most proficient. If safety considerations constitute the demonstrated business need, employers may assess whether their employees with limited English skills are more likely to understand and relay safety instructions or warnings efficiently and effectively in English or in their shared language.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;Restrictive Language Policy is Narrowly Tailored</p>
<p class="noindent-3">A language-restrictive policy is narrowly tailored when it applies only to those workers, work areas, circumstances, times, and job duties in which it is necessary to effectively promote safe and efficient business operations. This minimizes the adverse impact.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 29</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Policy Narrowly Tailored to Promote Safe and Efficient Job Performance</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Claudia, a Honduran-born U.S. immigrant who is fluent in Spanish and English, is employed by County hospital as a housekeeper, and she is assigned to clean operating rooms. She files a charge of discrimination alleging that she was subjected to unlawful national origin discrimination when the hospital adopted an English-only rule. The respondent produces evidence showing that the rule applies to all workers, including cleaning staff, but only for job-related discussions when they are working in the operating room. The evidence shows that most of the medical staff in the operating room only speak English.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Clear and precise communication between the medical staff and the cleaning staff is essential in the operating room because cleanliness is of paramount importance to patients' health and safety. The rule only applies to job-related discussions in the operating room and does not apply in any other circumstances. Based on this evidence, the EEOC does not find reasonable cause to believe that County Hospital's English-only rule violates Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some employers contend they adopt language-restrictive policies in order to improve interpersonal relationships between employees. If coworkers or customers are concerned about exposure to languages they do not understand, or about gossip in these languages, one approach is to address these concerns on an individualized basis without resorting to language-restrictive policies. A language-restrictive policy that has a disparate impact on a particular group cannot be justified if an employer <span id="Page_1038"></span>can effectively promote safe and efficient business operations through a policy that does not disproportionately harm protected national origin groups.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 30</p>
<p class="noindent-2">English-Only Rule Not Justified</p>
<p class="noindent-2">At a management meeting of Athletic Shoe Co., a supervisor proposes that the company adopt an English-only rule to decrease tensions among its ethnically diverse workforce. Two of the employees he supervises, Ann and Vinh, allegedly made derogatory comments in Vietnamese about their coworkers. Managers conclude that this can be addressed effectively under the company's discipline policy and that it would not justify a practice that adversely affects other workers based on their national origin. Therefore, Athletic Shoe decides that the circumstances do not justify adoption of an English-only rule. To reduce the likelihood of future incidents, supervisors are instructed to investigate the allegations and, if necessary, to counsel line employees about appropriate workplace conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;Notice and Enforcement of Restrictive Language Policy</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers must provide adequate notice of language-restrictive policies. "Adequate notice" means effectively communicating to employees under what circumstances they will be required to speak a specific or common language and what will happen if they violate the rule. Notice can be provided by any reasonable means under the circumstances, such as explaining the rule at a meeting, providing personal notice, sending e-mail, or posting the rule. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to provide notice in multiple languages. A grace period before the effective date of the policy generally will be important. Because adequate notice is essential to ensure employee compliance with the policy, "[i]f an employer fails to effectively notify its employees of the rule and makes an adverse employment decision against an individual based on a violation of the rule, the Commission will consider the employer's application of the rule as evidence of discrimination on the basis of national origin."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Managers often benefit from guidance on how to enforce the policy. Employers are strongly discouraged from "draconian" enforcement of language-restrictive policies. By limiting disciplinary measures to willful violations and not penalizing workers for inadvertent violations linked to their protected status, employers will more likely be able to establish business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">MInda W. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120162040 (2018), applied the "safe and efficient" rule to find that the agency discriminated against the complainant on the basis of her national origin when it implemented an English-only rule that was not justified by business necessity. In that case, a supervisor issued the complainant a "letter of expectations," directing her and her subordinates to "use the English language when discussing work topics." The Commission found no evidence that this rule was necessary to the safe or efficient operation of the agency. It further rejected the agency's argument that an employee complained about the use of Tagalog in the workplace, noting that there was "no evidence of a widespread problem involving language-related interpersonal conflicts or derogatory or intimidating conduct."</p>
<p class="noindent">If an employee, whose primary or first language is not English, establishes that the agency has a speak-English-only rule in effect at all times, that showing constitutes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of national origin discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Childress v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01842814 (1986). The Commission is vigorous in its enforcement of the speak-English-only prohibition. In <span class="Italic">Childress</span>, the Commission held the employee does not bear the burden of testing whether a rule has been imposed on only one occasion, or is a blanket prohibition. The employee's supervisor had, on one occasion, told her to "stop speaking that language" when she was conversing in Greek with a coworker. The Commission found it was not unreasonable for the employee to interpret the comment as applying at all times in the workplace and that it "would be absurd if the employee had the responsibility to test whether the supervisor was imposing a one time only rule or a permanent rule." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Where the "English-only" rule permits the use of a foreign language during breaks and lunchtime, it will not automatically be found burdensome but will be closely scrutinized under the business necessity justification. In <span class="Italic">Garza v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01924360 (1993), the Commission rejected the agency's dual justification of preventing "ill will" among fellow employees and allowing the supervisor to understand what was being said at all times:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the RD indicated, <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Lorillard Corporation</span>, 444 F.2d 791 (4th Cir. 1971), sets forth the parameters for "business necessity." While <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> involves race discrimination, these parameters are equally applicable in the context of discrimination based on national origin. The <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> court indicated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The business purpose must be sufficiently compelling to override any racial impact; the challenged practice must effectively carry out the business purpose it is alleged to serve; and there must be available no acceptable alternative policies or practices which better accomplish the business purpose advanced, or accomplish it equally well with a lesser differential racial [or national origin-based] impact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 444 F.2d 791.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency proffered two business purposes for the English-only rule. The first purpose, indicated in the memorandum, was to avoid "disruption and ill feelings among those that do not understand the [foreign] language." The second purpose, stated by appellant's immediate supervisor, was to ensure that this immediate supervisor would know what was being said by the other five or six members of the work group.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We concur with the RD that neither of these reasons comports with business necessity. With regard to the first purpose, we find that the emotional security of supervisors is insufficiently compelling to justify the speak-English-only rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Childress v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01842814 (July 7, 1986) (finding that a supervisor's feeling of being threatened by subordinates speaking a foreign language was an insufficient business consideration for imposing a speak-English-only rule). Additionally, we find that alternative acceptable policies or practices would accomplish the second purpose with a lesser differential national origin-based impact. An alternative policy or practice might involve requesting that English be spoken in the conduct of those business transactions that involve employees who do not understand the foreign language at issue. Management's requirement that English be spoken in the conduct of all business (and perhaps personal interactions), even during communications between two foreign language speakers, was too broadly drawn to shield the agency from liability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Suzie K. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120130410 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that S1's directive did not amount to an English-only rule because it was limited to on-duty areas and, further, that the directive was promulgated after CW1 complained that Complainant and CW2 were speaking about her. Although it was short-lived and did not apply to breaks and lunch, S1's dictate not to use Spanish but to speak English when on duty was a rule requiring employees to speak only English at these times and therefore was, on its face, an "English only" rule. The fact that it did not apply in the break room or cafeteria does not change the fundamental nature of the rule, but goes to whether or not it was justified by business necessity in on-duty areas. Therefore, the AJ's finding that S1's directive did not amount to an English-only rule is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, S1 requested Complainant to speak only English in the office following a complaint by a coworker, CW1, who felt excluded by Complainant speaking Spanish with another employee. Ameliorating the discomfort of coworkers is not, in and of itself, a matter of business necessity which can justify an English-only rule. Therefore, S1's rule in this case was not justified.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Claud S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120160988 (2016) (supervisor's comment that "the direction to speak 'English-only' was on the sign that they read when they crossed the border into the United States" stated a justiciable claim under Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A20555 (2003), the Commission upheld the imposition of a speak-English-only rule where coworkers objected to the complainant's use of Spanish because they suspected he was ridiculing them. In <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An English-only rule is justified by business necessity if it is needed for an employer to operate safely or efficiently. The following are some situations in which business necessity would justify an English-only rule: for communications with customers, coworkers, or supervisors who only speak English; in emergencies or other situations in which workers must speak a common language to promote safety; for cooperative work assignments in which the English-only rule is needed to promote efficiency; and to enable a supervisor who only speaks English to monitor the performance of an employee whose job duties require communication with coworkers or customers.<span class="Italic"> See</span> "English Only Rule: Intentional Discrimination," EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 13, at p. 15 (December 2, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the matter before us, complainant has questioned the validity of being required to speak English during work periods for the consideration of the other employees. The record reflects that two female clerks worked in the same area where complainant was located. The record further reflects that these two neither spoke nor understood the Spanish language. One clerk expressed to complainant's superior that: complainant's Spanish conversations were lengthy; made her uncomfortable because she did not know what was being said; she thought that he was talking about her; and she did not like it. The other clerk complained that complainant appeared to ridicule, criticize and berate them (in Spanish) as indicated by his tone and gestures. Complainant's superiors explained that his Spanish-only conversations were having a negative impact on the work being done, and required that they be held during break periods, or where it doesn't offend the rest of the work force and disrupt the operations. Complainant failed to present any evidence that his superiors <span id="Page_1039"></span>implemented the English-only rule for any other reason. We therefore find that complainant failed to establish that he was discriminated against because of his national origin. Further, construing the evidence to be most favorable to complainant, we note that complainant failed to present evidence that any of the agency's actions were motivated by discriminatory animus toward complainant's protected classes.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Islas v. Postmaster</span> General, 0120070276 (2009), where the complainant alleged that she and two other employees were instructed not to speak Spanish on the job. The supervisor who gave the instruction stated that he did so after receiving a complaint from another employee who believed she was the subject of the conversation and felt uncomfortable. The Commission, in Islas, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">With regard to claim (1), the supervisor stated that she received a complaint from an identified employee that complainant and her two friends/employees were speaking Spanish in a manner that made her believe that she was the subject of the conversation and that she felt uncomfortable. The supervisor indicated that the fact that her employees were speaking Spanish was not relevant so much as the fact that they were engaging in conduct which made other employees feel like they were being discussed negatively. Thus, she instructed all three employees, including complainant, to cease speaking in that manner. The record contains the identified employee's written statement dated October 18, 2004, indicating that complainant and the two employees, described above, "were speaking in Spanish in front of [her] and then laughing, [she] brought it to [the supervisor's] attention because it made [her] feel uncomfortable and like they were talking about [her]."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Upon review, we agree with the AJ's finding that complainant was not subjected to a speak English only rule under the foregoing situations.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.7(b) (a rule requiring that employees speak only in English at certain times must be justified by business necessity); EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Section 623 ("Speak-English-Only Rules and Other Language Policies"); New Compliance Manual, Section 13-National Origin Discrimination (November 22, 2002) ("An English-only rule would be unlawful if it were adopted with the intent to discriminate on the basis of national origin"); <span class="Italic">Funes v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120051364 (December 4, 2006) (finding that no English only rule existed where the manager told complainant to speak English only while on duty); <span class="Italic">Vindas Krych v. United Stated Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A45939 (August 31, 2006) (finding that no English only rule existed where complainant was instructed not to speak Spanish while in the presence of another employee who did not speak Spanish); <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Department of Commerce,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A15109 (January 23, 2003) (finding that no English only rule existed where complainant made a statement in Spanish, and the manager told her to speak English only). The AJ found that the supervisor was reacting to the "negative mariner" of complainant's speech and "not that [complainant) was speaking in Spanish."</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120102010 (2013), the Commission found that the agency did not have a legitimate basis for imposing a "speak English only" rule where some workers felt that employees conversing in Spanish were talking about them. Although part of the Commission's analysis focuses on rejecting the findings of the administrative judge that the supervisor did not instruct employees not to speak Spanish on the workroom floor, the remainder focuses on the conditions for a "speak English only" rule and alternatives to imposing such a rule. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A rule prohibiting employees, at all times in the workplace, from speaking their primary language or the language they speak most comfortably disadvantages an individual's employment opportunities because of national origin. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.7(a). Accordingly, the Commission will presume that such a rule violates Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A rule requiring employees to speak only in English at certain times must be justified by business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1606.7(b). An English-only rule is justified by business necessity if it is needed for an employer to operate safely or efficiently. EEOC Compliance Manual Section 13, "National Origin Discrimination," No. 915.003 (Compliance Manual on National Origin Discrimination), at 13-22 (Dec. 2, 2002). Before adopting an English-only rule, an employer should consider whether there are alternatives that would be equally effective in promoting safety or efficiency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 13-24. As with any other workplace policy, an English-only rule must be adopted for nondiscriminatory reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 13-21. Further, a policy that prohibits some but not all of the languages spoken in a workplace would be unlawful. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 13-22. Not every instruction to speak English constitutes an English-only rule. <span class="Italic">See Vindas-Krych v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A45939 (Aug. 31, 2006) (finding that no English-only rule existed where complainant was instructed not to speak Spanish while in the presence of another employee who did not speak Spanish); <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A15109 (Jan. 23, 2003) (finding that no English-only rule existed where complainant made a statement in Spanish, and the manager told her to speak English only); <span class="Italic">Vega v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01995457 (Dec. 29, 2000) (finding that no English-only rule existed where supervisor made isolated comment and never disciplined an employee for speaking Spanish).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is clear that S1 admonished two employees for speaking Spanish around Christmas 2007, that she instructed two other employees to stop speaking Spanish on March 4, 2008, that she made an intercom announcement, that several employees interpreted the intercom announcement as a prohibition against speaking Spanish at work, and that S2 subsequently issued a letter confirming that employees were permitted to speak languages other than English. The parties, however, dispute whether S1 told employees over the intercom that they could not speak Spanish on the workroom floor. Complainant alleged that S1 stated, "You need to stop speaking Spanish. This is America. We speak English only." S1 and S2 denied that S1 made that statement, and S1 denied that she told employees they could not speak Spanish.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's testimony is the only evidence that S1 expressly stated. "You need to stop speaking Spanish. This is America. We speak English only." The AJ concluded that Complainant's testimony was too inconsistent to be credible. We find, however, that, even if S1 did not utter the words that Complainant attributed to her, other evidence of record nonetheless establishes that the Agency implemented an English-only rule.2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Documentary evidence in the record corroborates Complainant's assertion that employees were told not to speak Spanish on the workroom floor. As the AJ noted, the Letter Carrier's affidavit supports S1's assertion that she asked employees to be respectful and mindful of each other in what they said. The Letter Carrier, however, also specifically confirmed that S1 made an announcement that employees were not allowed to speak Spanish on the workroom floor. Thus, the affidavit supports Complainant's assertion that S1 told employees not to speak Spanish.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Abusive Supervisor Incident Worksheets also support Complainant's assertion. We disagree with the AJ's conclusion that the Worksheet statements indicate that the union steward, not S1, told employees not to speak Spanish. Although two individuals stated that the union steward instructed employees not to speak Spanish on the workroom floor, they also stated that that "management" or a "supervisor" stated that the Agency was an English-speaking environment. Further, another employee also named S1 in connection with the announcement not to speak Spanish. Thus, even assuming that the union steward made a similar announcement, the Worksheets support Complainant's contention that S1 told employees not to speak Spanish.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, S2 acknowledged that S1 made a comment about speaking Spanish during the intercom announcement. Given that acknowledgement, the Letter Carrier's affidavit, and the Abusive Supervisor Incident Worksheets, we find it more likely than not that S1 instructed employees not to speak Spanish on the workroom floor. Accordingly, we find that the Agency implemented an English-only rule from March 8, 2008, the date of S1's intercom announcement, until March 21, 2008, the date on which S2 issued the letter stating that employees were permitted to speak languages other than English.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the English-only rule was not justified by business necessity. There is no evidence that requiring employees to speak only English on the workroom floor was necessary for the safe or efficient operation of the Agency. S2 testified that four employees complained to her that they were being targeted and talked about because they could not understand Spanish, but she did not address why the unnamed employees believed that they were the subjects of conversations in Spanish. Further, there is no evidence of a widespread problem involving language-related interpersonal conflicts or derogatory or intimidating conduct. At most, the evidence indicates that there were a few sporadic, isolated incidents in which non-Spanish-speaking employees believed that they were the subjects of conversations they could not understand. Moreover, to the extent a problem existed, the Agency could have used a nondiscriminatory alternative to address it. For example, given the Agency Handbook policy that S2 quoted in her March 28, 2008, letter, the Agency could have reduced the likelihood of interpersonal conflicts by counseling employees about appropriate workplace conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> Compliance Manual on National Origin Discrimination at 13-24, Example 21.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, given the totality of the evidence, we find that the AJ's determination that Complainant failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that the Agency implemented an English-only rule is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. We find that the Agency subjected Complainant to discrimination on the basis of national origin when, from March 8 to March 21, 2008, it implemented an English-only rule that was not justified by business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent">A "speak English only" instruction is not discriminatory when it requires only that the complainants use English when speaking with customers and there is no evidence that the complainants could not use Spanish in speaking <span id="Page_1040"></span>with customers who preferred that language. <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A20935 (2003). Similarly, a "speak English only" rule is not discriminatory when it is restricted to work-related communications. <span class="Italic">Croak v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120103522 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Frances A. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120132594 (2015), the Commission upheld the supervisor's imposition of a "speak English only" rule where it was limited to work-related communications and an exception was made for Spanish speaking clientele:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to claim 6, Complainant averred that during a CW averred that "the only involvement I had was to type the minutes based upon what was discussed at the meeting that was led by [S]." Report of Investigation (R01), Affidavit E, p. 4. S averred that "based on guidance received from EEOC, I instructed staff at the [facility] that use of a language other than English should be limited to personal conversations, during breaks, and when communicating with claimants and employers not proficient in English. Any job-related topics/issues were to be discussed in English." ROI, Affidavit B, p. 4. Complainant argues that "when I speak Spanish it does not affect my performance so it is not necessary for the business/workplace overall success of my job for me to always speak English. Also here in South Florida there are many Spanish speaking clientele so many times Spanish is also a necessity in the job place." Affidavit A, p. 14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that Complainant was not subjected to a speak-English-only rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.7(b) (a rule requiring that employees speak only in English at certain times must be justified by business necessity); EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Section 623 ("Speak-English-Only Rules and Other Language Policies"); New Compliance Manual, Section 13--National Origin Discrimination (November 22, 2002) ("An English-only rule would be unlawful if it were adopted with the intent to discriminate on the basis of national origin"); <span class="Italic">Funes v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120051364 (December 4, 2006) (finding that no English only rule existed where the manager told complainant to speak English only while on duty); <span class="Italic">Vindas-Krych v. United Stated Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A45939 (August 31, 2006) (finding that no English only rule existed where complainant was instructed not to speak Spanish while in the presence of another employee who did not speak Spanish); <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A15109 (January 23, 2003) (finding that no English only rule existed where complainant made a statement in Spanish, and the manager told her to speak English only).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Complainant argues that so it is not necessary for the business/workplace overall success of my job for me to always speak English," we note that Complainant was not directed to "always speak English." Instead, he was directed to limit Spanish to "personal conversations, during breaks, and when communicating with claimants and employers not proficient in English." With regard to his argument that "here in South Florida there are many Spanish speaking clientele so many times Spanish is also a necessity in the job place." we note that S allowed for this when she permitted Spanish to be spoken when communicating with claimants and employers not proficient in English."</p>
<p class="noindent">There are some instances when an agency may consider the employee's use of a foreign language in imposing discipline without engaging in discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Giannou v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 05900805 (1990), the employee was removed, in part, on charges of making personal telephone calls on government time. The agency relied on the fact that the employee spoke Spanish during the phone calls, and in low, hushed tones, in concluding the calls were personal in nature. The employee also alleged that she had been prohibited from speaking Spanish with another employee in the workplace. The Commission found that employee's use of Spanish was a "reasonable factor to cite" in determining the phone calls were personal. It also credited the RMO's explanation that he instructed the complainant not to speak Spanish with a fellow employee who needed to improve her English communication skills.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Ganir v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A43331 (2005), where the complainant was instructed that it was alright to speak in her native language on personal phone calls, but not for long periods of time. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ganir</span> did, however, remind the agency of its "speak English only" rules:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to complainant's contention that she was instructed not to speak in her native language, the record contains affidavit testimony for SI stating that several of complainant's co-workers had complained to him that complainant was speaking in her native language on the phone for long periods of time. SI also stated that as a result, he informed complainant that she should limit the length of her personal calls and that "speaking in her native language for personal business was okay but not for long periods time." (Report of Investigation, Affidavit B, 142). Although complainant contends that management has addressed this issue on several occasions, she has not proffered any evidence to show that she was ever instructed by management not to speak in her native language during work hours. While, so called "speak-English-only" rules have been found to violate Title VII in some circumstances, here, complainant does not allege the existence of any rule or policy prohibiting the speaking of languages other than English. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.7; EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Section 623 ("Speak-English-only Rules and Other Language Policies"). The incident between complainant and SI, during which he instructed her to limit the length of her personal phone calls in her native language, does not establish the existence of such a rule.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Vega v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995457 (December 29,2000). As such, we concur with the AJ's finding that complainant failed to show that the agency's articulated reasons for its actions are pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, however, that although we find that the agency did not, in fact, have a speak-English-only rule in effect, we remind the agency nonetheless that discrimination based on a speak-English-only policy is a legally distinct type of national origin discrimination. Accordingly, we urge the agency to ensure, via internal assessment, training and other appropriate methods, that none of its facilities maintain, in policy or practice, an English-only rule which violates Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.7(b) (a rule requiring that employees speak only in English at certain times must be justified by business necessity); EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Section 623 ("Speak-English-only Rules and Other Language Policies").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Yee v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942185 (1995), the Commission reviewed a termination of the employee's detail based on her alleged refusal to comply with a "speak English only" instruction. In that case, the employee was talking to a coworker in Mandarin and was ordered by her supervisor to speak English. Although the record is somewhat in dispute, the employee either refused to comply with the supervisor's order, or responded by telling him it was a personal conversation. In any event, it was undisputed that the event was pivotal in the agency's decision to terminate the detail. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Yee</span> found that the agency could consider the employee's refusal to comply with the order as indicative of attitude. However, the Commission found that, because the agency was not able to identify any other incident placing the employee's attitude into question, its stated reason for terminating the detail was pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent">An instruction to an employee to speak English during a conversation with a supervisor is not discriminatory when the reason for the instruction is the presence of another employee who does not understand Spanish. As the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Vindas-Krych v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A45939 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal the agency states, as it did in its motion for a decision without a hearing, that M1 had explained to complainant on more than one occasion that he was not prohibiting her from speaking Spanish, but instead only asked her to refrain from speaking Spanish at that time because E1 did not understand Spanish. The agency notes, as did the AJ, that complainant was not disciplined for the incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that a decision without a hearing is appropriate under the circumstances. We find the material facts are not in dispute and that the AJ's decision required no weighing of conflicting evidence or credibility assessments. We concur that the text of the 2002 memorandum regarding Language Guidelines does not (as complainant alleged) confine complainant's use of a language other than English to when she is at lunch or on a break. In pertinent part, the memorandum provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Supervisors and Managers are required to speak English in the conduct of business matters that involve employees who do not understand the foreign language at issue. Employees who choose to speak languages other than English may do so, as long as their use of another language does not disrupt the workplace and does not interfere with the efficient completion of their duties or the duties of their co-workers. Employees are encouraged to be sensitive to those around them and to recognize that others may feel a sense of alienation and discomfort when they are unable to understand the conversation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the AJ's interpretation of the memorandum (that is, that employees are free to speak any language other than English so long as it does not interfere with the efficient operation of the agency) is supported by the evidence and that the memorandum is not discriminatory on its face.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The March 13, 2003 incident does not establish that complainant was subjected to a speak English only rule. We find that the AJ properly analyzed the undisputed evidence submitted by the parties regarding the events of March 13, 2003. Specifically, M1 requested that complainant not speak Spanish with a supervisor (S1) while in the presence of another employee who did not speak Spanish. Clearly, complainant was unhappy with M1's instruction to her, and made her objection known; however, complainant has not shown that his instruction was discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we find, as did the AJ, that complainant did not submit any evidence to show that the agency's policy, as implemented by M1, was applied in a discriminatory manner, specifically, because of her race. Complainant has submitted no evidence that other employees (not in complainant's protected class) were permitted to speak a language other than English under the same or similar circumstances. Moreover, <span id="Page_1041"></span>nothing in the record shows that complainant received any discipline, or otherwise suffered any adverse action as a result of the incident; nor do we find that the incident, even as portrayed in the documents submitted by complainant's representative, was so severe such that it rose to the level of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the EEOC's position that a speak-English-only rule in the workplace is a burdensome term and condition of employment. In <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Spun Steak Company</span>, 998 F.2d 1480 (9th Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">reh'g denied</span>, 13 F.3d 296 (1993), a divided panel held that such a rule, when applied to employees who spoke both Spanish and English, did not constitute a significant adverse affect on the terms and conditions of those employees. The court remanded the case for further proceedings on whether there was a non-English speaking employee who was adversely affected by the policy. In addition to analyzing the case under the speak-English-only policy of the EEOC, the court also examined whether such a rule created a work environment hostile to Hispanics.</p>
<p class="noindent">In rejecting the EEOC position, the court in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 998 F.2d at 1487-90, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employees argue that denying them the ability to speak Spanish on the job denies them the right to cultural expression. It cannot be gainsaid that an individual's primary language can be an important link to his ethnic culture and identity. Title VII, however, does not protect the ability of workers to express their cultural heritage at the workplace. Title VII is concerned only with disparities in the treatment of workers; it does not confer substantive privileges. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Garcia v. Gloor</span>, 618 F.2d 264, 269 (5th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 449 U.S. 1113, 101 S. Ct. 923, 66 L. Ed.2d 842 (1981). It is axiomatic that an employee must often sacrifice individual self-expression during working hours. Just as a private employer is not required to allow other types of self-expression, there is nothing in Title VII which requires an employer to allow employees to express their cultural identity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Spanish-speaking employees argue that the English-only policy has a disparate impact on them because it deprives them of a privilege given by the employer to native-English speakers: the ability to converse on the job in the language with which they feel most comfortable. It is undisputed that Spun Steak allows its employees to converse on the job. The ability to converse--especially to make small talk--is a privilege of employment, and may in fact be a significant privilege of employment in an assembly-line job. It is inaccurate, however, to describe the privilege as broadly as the Spanish-speaking employees urge us to do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employees have attempted to define the privilege as the ability to speak in the language of their choice. A privilege, however, is by definition given at the employer's discretion; an employer has the right to define its contours. Thus, an employer may allow employees to converse on the job, but only during certain times of the day or during the performance of certain tasks. The employer may proscribe certain topics as inappropriate during working hours or may even forbid the use of certain words, such as profanity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as is its prerogative, the employer has defined the privilege narrowly. When the privilege is defined at its narrowest (as merely the ability to speak on the job), we cannot conclude that those employees fluent in both English and Spanish are adversely impacted by the policy. Because they are able to speak English, bilingual employees can engage in conversation on the job. It is axiomatic that "the language a person who is multi-lingual elects to speak at a particular time is...a matter of choice." <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 618 F.2d at 270. The bilingual employee can readily comply with the English-only rule and still enjoy the privilege of speaking on the job. "There is no disparate impact" with respect to a privilege of employment "if the rule is one that the affected employee can readily observe and nonobservance is a matter of individual preference." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This analysis is consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Jurado v. Eleven-Fifty Corporation</span>, 813 F.2d 1406, 1412 (9th Cir. 1987). In <span class="Italic">Jurado</span>, a bilingual disc jockey was fired for disobeying a rule forbidding him from using an occasional Spanish word or phrase on the air. We concluded that Jurado's disparate impact claim failed "because Jurado was fluently bilingual and could easily comply with the order" and thus could not have been adversely affected. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Spanish-speaking employees argue that fully bilingual employees are hampered in the enjoyment of the privilege because for them, switching from one language to another is not fully volitional. Whether a bilingual speaker can control which language is used in a given circumstance is a factual issue that cannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage. However, we fail to see the relevance of the assertion, even assuming that it can be proved. Title VII is not meant to protect against rules that merely inconvenience some employees, even if the inconvenience falls regularly on a protected class. Rather, Title VII protects against only those policies that have a significant impact. The fact that an employee may have to catch himself or herself from occasionally slipping into Spanish does not impose a burden significant enough to amount to the denial of equal opportunity. This is not a case in which the employees have alleged that the company is enforcing the policy in such a way as to impose penalties for minor slips of the tongue. The fact that a bilingual employee may, on occasion, unconsciously substitute a Spanish word in the place of an English one does not override our conclusion that the bilingual employee can easily comply with the rule. In short, we conclude that a bilingual employee is not denied a privilege of employment by the English-only policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, non-English speakers cannot enjoy the privilege of conversing on the job if conversation is limited to a language they cannot speak. As applied "[t]o a person who speaks only one tongue or to a person who has difficulty using another language than the one spoken in his home," an English-only rule might well have an adverse impact. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 618 F.2d at 270. Indeed, counsel for Spun Steak conceded at oral argument that the policy would have an adverse impact on an employee unable to speak English. There is only one employee at Spun Steak affected by the policy who is unable to speak any English. Even with regard to her, however, summary judgment was improper because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether she has been adversely affected by the policy. She stated in her deposition that she was not bothered by the rule because she preferred not to make small talk on the job, but rather preferred to work in peace. Furthermore, there is some evidence suggesting that she is not required to comply with the policy when she chooses to speak. For example, she is allowed to speak Spanish to her supervisor. Remand is necessary to determine whether she has suffered adverse effects from the policy. It is unclear from the record whether there are any other employees who have such limited proficiency in English that they are effectively denied the privilege of speaking on the job. Whether an employee speaks such little English as to be effectively denied the privilege is a question of fact for which summary judgment is improper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Spanish-speaking employees argue that the policy creates an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation, and intimidation. Under this theory, the employees do not assert that the policy directly affects a term, condition, or privilege of employment. Instead, the argument must be that the policy causes the work environment to become infused with ethnic tensions. The tense environment, the argument goes, itself amounts to a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. at 66, 106 S. Ct. at 2405, held that an abusive work environment may, in some circumstances, amount to a condition of employment giving rise to a violation of Title VII. The Court quoted with approval the decision in <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (5th Cir. 1971), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 406 U.S. 957, 92 S. Ct. 2058, 32 L. Ed.2d 343 (1972):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he phrase 'terms, conditions or privileges of employment' in [Title VII] is an expansive concept which sweeps within its protective ambit the practice of creating a working environment heavily charged with ethnic or racial discrimination.... One can readily envision working environments so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">Vinson</span> is a sexual harassment case in which the individual incidents involved behavior that was arguably intentionally discriminatory, its rationale applies equally to cases in which seemingly neutral policies of a company infuse the atmosphere of the workplace with discrimination. The <span class="Italic">Vinson</span> Court emphasized, however, that discriminatory practices must be pervasive before an employee has a Title VII claim under a hostile environment theory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the employees urge us to adopt a<span class="Italic"> per se</span> rule that English-only policies always infect the working environment to such a degree as to amount to a hostile or abusive work environment. This we cannot do. Whether a working environment is infused with discrimination is a factual question, one for which a<span class="Italic"> per se</span> rule is particularly inappropriate. The dynamics of an individual workplace are enormously complex; we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that the introduction of an English-only policy, in every workplace, will always have the same effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Spanish-speaking employees in this case have presented no evidence other than conclusory statements that the policy has contributed to an atmosphere of "isolation, inferiority or intimidation." The bilingual employees are able to comply with the rule, and there is no evidence to show that the atmosphere at Spun Steak in general is infused with hostility toward Hispanic workers. Indeed, there is substantial evidence in the record demonstrating that the policy was enacted to prevent the employees from intentionally using their fluency in Spanish to isolate and to intimidate members of other ethnic groups. In light of the specific factual context of this case, we conclude that the bilingual employees have not raised a genuine issue of material fact that the effect is so pronounced as to amount to a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">See generally Anderson v. Liberty Lobby</span>, 477 U.S. 242, 250-51, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not foreclose the prospect that in some circumstances English-only rules can exacerbate existing tensions, or, when combined with <span id="Page_1042"></span>other discriminatory behavior, contribute to an overall environment of discrimination. Likewise, we can envision a case in which such rules are enforced in such a draconian manner that the enforcement itself amounts to harassment. In evaluating such a claim, however, a court must look to the totality of the circumstances in the particular factual context in which the claim arises.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In holding that the enactment of an English-only while working policy does not inexorably lead to an abusive environment for those whose primary language is not English, we reach a conclusion opposite to the EEOC's long standing position. The EEOC Guidelines provide that an employee meets the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in a disparate impact cause of action merely by proving the existence of the English-only policy. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR Sec. 1606.7(a) &#x0026; (b) (1991). Under the EEOC's scheme, an employer must always provide a business justification for such a rule. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The EEOC enacted this scheme in part because of its conclusion that English-only rules may "create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation and intimidation based on national origin which could result in a discriminatory working environment." 29 CFR Sec. 1606.7(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not reject the English-only rule Guideline lightly. We recognize that "as an administrative interpretation of the Act by the enforcing agency, these Guidelines...constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance." <span class="Italic">Meritor Sav. Bank</span>, 477 U.S. 57 at 65, 106 S. Ct. 2399 at 2404 (internal quotations and citations omitted). But we are not bound by the Guidelines. <span class="Italic">See Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., Inc.</span>, 414 U.S. 86, 94, 94 S. Ct. 334, 339, 38 L. Ed.2d 287 (1973). We will not defer to "an administrative construction of a statute where there are 'compelling indications that it is wrong.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have been impressed by Judge Rubin's pre-Guidelines analysis for the Fifth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, which we follow today. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 618 F.2d 264. Nothing in the plain language of section 703(a)(1) supports EEOC's English-only rule Guideline. "Title VII could not have been enacted into law without substantial support from legislators in both Houses who traditionally resisted federal regulation of private business." <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO v. Weber</span>, 443 U.S. 193, 99 S. Ct. 2721, 61 L. Ed.2d 480 (1979). "Those legislators demanded as a price for their support that,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, management prerogatives, and union freedoms are to be left undisturbed to the greatest extent possible. Internal affairs of employers and labor organizations must not be interfered with except to the limited extent that correction is required in discrimination practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Statement of William M. McCulloch, <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, H.R. Rep. No. 914, 88 Cong., 2d Sess (1964), reprinted in 1964 USCCAN 2355, 2516 (quoted in part in <span class="Italic">Steelworkers</span>, 443 U.S. at 206, 99 S. Ct. at 2728). It is clear that Congress intended a balance to be struck in preventing discrimination and preserving the independence of the employer. In striking that balance, the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff in a disparate impact case must prove the alleged discriminatory effect before the burden shifts to the employer. The EEOC Guideline at issue here contravenes that policy by presuming that an English-only policy has a disparate impact in the absence of proof. We are not aware of, nor has counsel shown us, anything in the legislative history to Title VII that indicates that English-only policies are to be presumed discriminatory. Indeed, nowhere in the legislative history is there a discussion of English-only policies at all.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the bilingual employees have failed to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, we need not consider the business justifications offered for the policy as applied to them. On remand, if Local 115 is able to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case with regard to employees with limited proficiency in English, the district court could then consider any business justification offered by Spun Steak....</p>
<p class="noindent">Judge Boochever filed a dissenting opinion in the case, as well as a lengthy dissent from the denial of rehearing.</p>
