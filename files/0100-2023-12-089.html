<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-88"><span class="space">14.</span> Other Agency's Employees</h4>
<p class="noindent">"A complaint must be filed with the agency that allegedly discriminated against the complainant." 29 CFR 1614.106(a). That means that a complaint of discrimination may be filed against an agency that is not the employing agency if that agency is allegedly the cause of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Marvella B. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019004741 (2019), for example, the complainant, an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency, filed a complaint against the Department of the Navy, the agency who employed her alleged harasser. The Department of the Navy dismissed the claim in its entirety for failure to state a claim because the complainant was an employee of the EPA and, therefore, she had no standing to raise discrimination claims against the Navy. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Marvella B</span>. disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The claim in this matter involves a discriminatory harassment alleged to have been perpetrated by a Navy employee against Complainant at a work-related conference. Complainant does not allege any wrongdoing by her employing agency. The Agency errs in claiming Complainant, a federal employee working for another agency, has no "standing" to file her EEO complaint against the Navy. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(a) expressly states that a complaint "must be filed with the agency that allegedly discriminated against the complainant." Here, that agency is the Navy. Complainant has alleged that a Navy employee committed acts of discriminatory harassment and that she, through her own management, timely reported the matter to the Navy. Her complaint is properly filed with the Navy. <span class="Italic">See Horvath v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, Appeal No. 01956761 (Oct. 25, 1996) (noting that "the Commission repeatedly has held that a complainant is required to file his complaint against the particular agency which allegedly has discriminated against the complainant regarding a term, condition, or privilege of employment, even where the allegedly discriminating agency is not the employing agency"); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950295 (Aug. 17, 1995) (ruling that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(a) contains "no requirement that the complainant be either an employee or applicant for employment with the defendant agency").</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Carol K. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019004395 (2019), was an employee of the Department of the Navy. Her alleged harasser worked for the Department of the Air Force. Together, they worked on a joint project between the two agencies. When the complainant named the Air Force in her complaint, the Air Force dismissed it because she was not an Air Force employee. The Air Force further determined that it could not be held responsible for any settlement or judgment resulting from the complaint. The Commission reversed the dismissal in <span class="Italic">Carol K</span>., as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a case like the instant one, of co-worker harassment, an agency is responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace where the Agency (or its agents) knew or should have known of the conduct, unless it can be shown that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). The agency can raise an affirmative defense when it shows that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. What is appropriate remedial action will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case, such as the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its opposition to the instant appeal, the Department of the Air Force concludes, without having investigated the matter, that Complainant's employing agency alone, the Department of the Navy, was best situated to have learned of the alleged misconduct of the Air Force employee. The Air Force further concluded after "consulting" with Air Force attorneys and with "various levels of command within the Navy" that the Navy would be fiscally responsible for any settlement or judgment resulting from these allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This claim involves a hostile work environment alleged to have been created by an Air Force employee. Liability for the discriminatory harassment must be determined by examining the actions and decisions made by management at both the Department of the Air Force and the Department of the Navy. Furthermore, implementation of any remedy to be provided in this case might necessarily require the participation of both the Air Force and the Navy. It is the policy of the Commission that, when two agencies bear joint responsibility for an act of alleged discrimination, both agencies are proper respondents and the complaint must be jointly processed. <span class="Italic">See Velez v. Department of Veterans Affairs &#x0026; Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961480 (February 6, 1997). <span class="Italic">See also, Fauntroy v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980259 (finding that Department of Treasury employee allegedly harassed by security guard employed by General Services Administration should be jointly processed by both agencies). This policy ensures that all agencies that are indispensable parties to the adjudication of a complaint are joined. Therefore, we will join the Department of Navy, as a party to this matter and require it to participate in the further adjudication of the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">As indicated in <span class="Italic">Carol K</span>., agencies may also be found to be jointly liable if the complainant is an employee of one agency but under the control and supervision of another. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Drew N. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019003270 (2019), where the complainant, an employee of USAID, alleged discrimination when he learned of race, national origin and color-based rumors spread by employees of the Department of State that led to the suspension of his security clearance. The State Department dismissed the complaint because USAID made the decision to suspend the complainant's security clearance. Before the Commission, <span class="Italic">Drew N</span>. argued:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he determination that the State Department was not involved is inconsistent with the fact that employees from its Diplomatic Security (DOD/DS) are alleged to have made the disparaging comments at issue. Complainant further argues that although employed by the USAID, Complainant remained under the authority and control of the U.S. Embassy DOS/DS Agents in Bangkok, Thailand, where the alleged discrimination occurred. Complainant's representative further indicates that on or about June 13, 2016, DOS/DS agents acted on an unsubstantiated report that Complainant's family was open about nudity and engaged in family bathing. Based on that report alone, DOS/DS agents determined that Complainant had sexually abused his daughter. According to Complainant, on June 15, 2016, he and his family were separated, Complainant's wife and daughter were ordered to stay at a hotel and meet with the Virginia Department of Human Services (DHS) and DOD/DS agents after which Complainant's daughter was separated from her mother and sent to a foster home. Ultimately, the USAID Office of the Inspector General (OIG) interviewed Complainant after he filed a grievance against the Agency for its treatment of his family. Complainant alleges on appeal that the USAID OIG agent threatened Complainant that he would keep his file open and continue to monitor his emails for evidence of misconduct. Ultimately, on December 29, 2017, Complainant was notified that his security clearance was suspended by USAID security, in part due to Complainant's cultural practice of family bathing. Complainant's representative argues therefore that both the State Department and USAID discriminated against Complainant as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission agreed and reversed the dismissal in <span class="Italic">Drew N</span>., writing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A fair reading of the formal complaint establishes that it contains a harassment claim beginning first with the alleged conduct of State Department employees and their investigation into an unsubstantiated report against Complainant that resulted in the separation of his family and his daughter being placed in foster care. However, the alleged discriminatory events also involve USAID and its suspension of Complainant's security clearance as a result of the investigation into Complainant's alleged misconduct. The record establishes that although an employee of USAID, Complainant was under the control and supervision of the State Department in his position with the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that liability for the alleged discriminatory harassment must be determined here by examining the actions and decisions by management at both the State Department and USAID. Moreover, implementation of any remedy to be provided in this case would necessarily require the participation of both the State Department and USAID. It is the policy of the Commission that, when two agencies bear joint responsibility for an act of alleged discrimination, both agencies are proper respondents and the complaint must be jointly processed. <span class="Italic">See Velez v. Department of Veterans Affairs &#x0026; Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961480 (February 6, 1997). <span class="Italic">See also, Fauntroy v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980259. The State Department's decision that Complainant filed his complaint with the wrong agency is inconsistent with the joint <span id="Page_203"></span>responsibility which both agencies bear. This policy ensures that all agencies that are indispensable parties to the adjudication of a complaint are joined. Therefore, the Commission will join USAID as a party to this matter and require it to participate in the further adjudication of the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Citing <span class="Italic">Carol K</span>., the Commission similarly reversed the agency's dismissal for failure to state a claim in <span class="Italic">Alexandria P. v. Secretary of the Air Force and Secretary of the Army</span>, 2022001614 (2022), finding that both the Army and the Air Force bore joint responsibility over the alleged discrimination. The complainant worked on a shift staffed with Air Force and Army employees and alleged that employees from both components subjected her to race and sex discrimination. The Air Force dismissed her complaint for failure to state a claim, concluding that the responsible management official cited was under the control of the Army. The Commission disagreed in <span class="Italic">Alexandria P</span>., writing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We determine that potential liability for the alleged discrimination must be determined by examining acts and decisions by both Air Force (USSF) managers and Army managers. We observed that Complainant was an USSF employee, as was her supervisor who she has said did not take corrective action when she reported the Senior Planner's inappropriate comments. Complainant also named Senior Planner's supervisor as a responsible management official for declining to discipline Senior Planner. Here, where two agencies bear joint responsibility over the alleged discrimination, both the Army and Air Force USSF must jointly process this EEO complaint. Based on a fair reading of the record, the situation in the present case is similar to <span class="Italic">Carol K. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019004395 (Sept. 17, 2019) (holding both the Air Force and the Navy jointly responsible for a complaint by a Navy employee about the Air Force's negative assessment of the Navy employee's performance on the inter-agency project to develop the joint strike fighter aircraft). <span class="Italic">See also Fauntroy v. Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01980259 (Sept. 15, 1998) (joining the Department of Treasury in its employee's complaint against GSA because an on-duty GSA security guard had been sexually harassing the Treasury employee while she was going to and from her Treasury workplace).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Agency improperly dismissed Complainant's formal EEO complaint under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1) because Complainant has stated a claim against both Agencies.</p>
