<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-6"><span class="space">B.</span> DEFINING COMPLAINT CLAIMS</h3>
<p class="noindent">After the agency acknowledges receipt of the complaint, it is required to notify the complainant of the acceptance or dismissal of the complaint. Of course, it also is possible that some claims will be accepted for investigation by the agency, while others are dismissed. There is nothing that prohibits an agency from issuing one letter that both acknowledges receipt and advises of acceptance or dismissal of the claims. However, most agencies issue separate letters addressing each item, respectively.</p>
<p class="noindent">In adopting the 1999 amendments to Part 1614, the EEOC changed the terminology it uses to define the scope of complaints. Previously, the Commission referred to "complaint issues" that were raised in a complaint. In using the term "issues," what the Commission really meant for was claims for relief. One single claim of discrimination may raise numerous legal and factual issues. In adopting the term "claims," the Commission has attempted to focus the attention of agencies away from the subsidiary matters raised and to focus the attention of the agency on the claim or claims for relief. "A claim refers to an assertion of an unlawful employment practice or policy for which, if proven, there is a remedy under the federal equal employment statutes." MD-110 at 5-6. As explained below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-12-006.html#sec3-7">Avoiding Fragmentation</a>," the change was intended to eliminate confusion and reduce appellate litigation over the proper scope of complaints. Even though the Commission adopted this new terminology, it still occasionally reverts to using the term "issues" when it means "claims."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations at Part 1614 make no mention of "accepting" complaints. Instead, 29 CFR 1614.107(a) enumerates the bases on which an agency "shall" dismiss a complaint. Still, the agency is required to inform the complainant of the claims accepted for investigation. MD-110 at 5-1 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within a reasonable time after receipt of the written EEO Counselor report, the agency should send the complainant a second letter (commonly referred to as an "acceptance" letter), stating the claim(s) asserted and to be investigated. If the second letter's statement of the claim(s) asserted and claim(s) for investigation differs, the letter further shall explain the reasons for the difference, including whether the agency is dismissing a portion of the complaint. The agency shall advise the complainant that s/he may submit a statement to the agency concerning the agency's articulation of the claim, which shall become a part of the complaint file. (Dismissals are governed by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a). Additional dismissal guidance is provided in Section IV of this Chapter of the Management Directive.) The agency shall notify the complainant of a partial dismissal by letter and further inform the complainant that there is no immediate right to appeal the partial dismissal. The agency should advise the complainant that the partial dismissal shall be reviewed either by a Commission Administrative Judge, if the complainant requests a hearing before an Administrative Judge, or by the Commission, if the complainant files an appeal of a final agency action or final agency decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">To decide whether to accept or dismiss a complaint, or portions thereof, the first step is for the agency to define the complaint claims. It is error for the agency to dismiss a complaint on timeliness or mootness grounds before defining the claims. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Lisk v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05950896 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision was entirely correct in stating that dismissal on untimeliness or mootness grounds was improper when the agency did not define what the dismissed allegations were. Definition of the issues in a complaint is the essential first step in processing a complaint<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Management Directive (MD) 110, p. 2-19. The agency in its RTR still has not defined the issue or issues, and indeed the RTR suggests that the agency has not recognized that it must do so. Given the age of this case, and the agency's failure to address the matter, the Commission has decided to define the issues in this decision. Now the record before us permits us to reach such a definition; to do otherwise, to simply remand the undefined complaint, would cause only needless delay.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether an agency has properly defined the complaint claims, the Commission will, if necessary, review the EEO counselor's report, the notice of final interview, and/or the formal complaint. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01974075 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Mulligan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01974544 (1998). Where the complainant identifies one specific incident of alleged harassment and further alleges that the harassment is ongoing, she is not required to specifically identify each of the incidents in the formal complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12712 (2001), the Commission found it was error for the agency to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim because the complainant identified only one specific incident of alleged harassment. The Commission reviewed the counselor's report and formal complaint and noted that the complainant made several references to other incidents of harassment. It is worth noting that, in the <span class="Italic">Smith</span> scenario, nothing prevented the agency from requesting that the complainant identify all of the incidents of alleged harassment and later dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim if all of the allegations, taken as true, would not rise to the level of a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">Smith</span> does, however, preclude an agency from taking a general claim of hostile environment and dismissing it without any inquiry into the individual incidents that make up the claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In defining the claims, the agency must carefully distinguish live allegations from background evidence. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01984680 (1999). Failure to properly distinguish between the two can lead to the improper dismissal of allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not pick and choose allegations, but must consider the complaint in its entirety in order to determine the claim or claims raised. In <span class="Italic">Foster v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01962504 (1998), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead of examining appellant's complaint as a whole and determining what appellant was alleging, the agency addressed various allegations in the complaint on a piecemeal basis. By employing this approach, the agency was able to dismiss certain allegations and avoid addressing the issue that is at the core of appellant's complaint. This issue is that various agency officials, including the Commander, the SO, the SO's assistant, the former Director, and the Acting Director, engaged in a pattern of conduct to affect the terms and conditions of appellant's employment, from the start of that employment until appellant's departure. This pattern of discrimination was initially based on appellant's race and/or sex, and later on reprisal for EEO activity as well. This issue appears to be the overriding concern in appellant's complaint. The various allegations mentioned by the agency are merely parts of this general issue. For instance, this alleged pattern of discrimination resulted in limitations being placed on appellant's career progress and her eventual nonselection for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Often the claims are not so easily defined because the process is initiated by a complainant acting without representation. The agency has an obligation to properly channel complaints of discrimination brought to its attention and may not rely on technical interpretations when dealing with employees unassisted by legal counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Czecha v. Department of Commerce</span>, 01831797 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Czecha</span>, the employee had sent a letter to the agency requesting assistance in challenging his nonselection for various positions because of his disability as either grievances or EEO concerns. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Dunker v. Department of Navy</span>, 01831878 (1983) ("A layman is not required to make sophisticated legal allegations to validate a complaint."); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Navy</span>, 01831879 (1983) (an allegation that a younger, less qualified candidate was selected is sufficient to state a complaint of age discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">As demonstrated by the examples below, an agency must read the complaint <span id="Page_142"></span>fairly to define the claims. The agency, in reading the complaint, may be required to draw reasonable inferences from the information presented by the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complainants, particularly <span class="Italic">pro se</span> complainants, are not required to plead with any legal precision and claims must be framed based upon "a fair reading of the record in its totality...." <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Armijo v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120110109 (2012) (complainant did not list retaliation as a basis in his complaint, but told both the counselor and investigator that he was fired for complaining of harassment); <span class="Italic">Guice v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113857 (2012) (complainant's specific reference of precomplaint counseling in formal complaint was sufficient to encompass all issues raised with counselor); <span class="Italic">Tesaro v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113672 (2012) (complainant alleged retaliation for being a union steward in formal complaint but alleged retaliation for prior EEO activity during precomplaint counseling).</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">DeMarco v. USPS</span>, 01830506 (1983), the agency improperly construed an EEO complaint that alleged the employee was prevented from competing for two promotions on an equal basis with female employees who were provided with certain qualifying training. The agency dismissed the complaint on the basis that the employee had already received all of the relief to which he was entitled because he had applied and competed for the positions in question. The EEOC reversed, finding the employee had alleged that he was denied training for the promotion and not that he had been barred from competing for the positions. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Daw v. USPS</span>, 01830508 (1983) ("The appellant's right to have his entire complaint processed and investigated is not dependent upon the agency's interpretation of whether he has adequate relief for the alleged wrong.").</p>
<p class="noindent">While complainants need not plead their complaints with legal precision, the agency is required to properly frame the issues presented by the complainant, no matter how inarticulate. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Darlene F. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120170843 (2017), for example, reversed the agency's dismissal for failure to state a claim, noting that the agency failed to properly frame the complaint as a nonselection:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its December 12, 2016 final decision, the Agency determined that the formal complaint was comprised of the following three claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;On July 23, 2016, Complainant received her investigative report for her prior EEO complaint and discovered that [a named employee] was now the Executive Assistant to the Chief Officer and [another named employee] a Social Service Program Specialist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim (3), however, we find that the Agency failed to properly frame this claim. Upon review of the record, we find that Complainant is not solely alleging that her co-workers were selected for specified positions. Rather, we find that Complainant is alleging that she was not selected for the position of Chief Officer, Readjustment Counseling Services (RCS), Vacancy No. VA-SES-15-1559371-DM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains a copy of the EEO Counseling Report. Therein, it provides, in relevant part, that one of the claims Complainant was counseled on is "on May 16, 2006, [Complainant] became aware that she was denied an opportunity for promotion when the Agency illegally selected [a named employee] for the position of Chief Officer, RCS, Vacancy No. VA-SES-15-1559371-DM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also contains a letter to Complainant dated September 23, 2016. This letter provided that it was closing the informal counseling and set forth that one of Complainant's claims was that she was denied a promotion when a named employee was selected for the position of Chief Officer, RCS, Vacancy No. VA-SES-15-1559371-DM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the record contains a statement from Complainant dated July 3, 2016. Therein, she asserts, in pertinent part, that the selectee for the Chief Officer position lacked experience and Complainant asserts that according to OPM, she is eligible to apply for SES positions. She further states that the Chief Officer position "was repeatedly opened and closed until they managed to get [the selectee] on the [certified list] then he was selected."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that Complainant is alleging that due to manipulation of the selection process and job requirements for Chief Officer, RCS, Vacancy No. VA-SES-15-1559371-DM, she was not selected for the Chief Officer position based on her protected classes. Thus, we find claim (3) sets forth an actionable claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Judie D. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120172781 (2017), reversed the agency's dismissal for failure to state a claim where the complainant alleged discrimination when she was denied a permanent transfer in order to care for her husband who was undergoing chemotherapy treatments. The agency failed to advise the complainant of her associational rights under the Rehabilitation Act, and instead defined her claim as discrimination based on marital status, which is not a recognized basis of discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Judie D</span>. reversed and remanded the claim, finding that the agency failed to assist the complainant to properly frame her claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency improperly dismissed a complaint as beyond the EEO purview where the complainant alleged that he was retaliated against for union activity because of his national origin. <span class="Italic">See Iraha v. USPS</span>, 01830546 (1983). The gravamen of the complaint was not that the employee was treated differently because of his union activity, but that he was treated differently than others who had engaged in union activity because of his national origin. In <span class="Italic">Bird v. USPS</span>, 01830652 (1983), the agency improperly dismissed a complaint on the basis of sex discrimination where the complainant said her termination was the result of a "personality conflict" between her and her supervisor, but also alleged that she was treated less favorably than a similarly situated male employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee alleging that, due to her age, she was required to work overtime and complete additional paperwork, when younger employees were allowed to curtail overtime and paperwork, stated a complaint within the EEO purview. <span class="Italic">Conner v. USPS</span>, 01831907 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">Many agencies have become more astute at defining the claims raised by a complaint, such that they attempt to implicitly dismiss claims fairly raised by a complaint simply by defining the claims accepted in the narrowest of terms. A common ploy is where a complainant frames a nonselection allegation in terms of his or her failure to be placed on the best qualified list or obtain an interview. The agency subsequently defines the claim accepted for investigation as the failure of the complainant to make the best qualified list or be selected for an interview. No mention is made of the actual nonselection. When the complainant later tries to raise the nonselection, the agency dismisses the claim as one not raised. More and more, the Commission has reversed such dismissals by properly focusing on the claims fairly raised by the complainant. For example, in <span class="Italic">Greene v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 01954696 (1996), the Commission reversed such an agency decision, writing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant asserts that she learned of her nonselection on July 22, 1994. On appeal, appellant contends that she contacted an EEO Counselor prior to August 30, 1994, with regard to this issue. We note that the EEO Counselor's report of the initial interview, which occurred on August 10, 1994, indicates that appellant raised the issue of the reorganization, the removal of appellant's duties, appellant's replacement by an employee, who appellant trained and was less qualified than appellant, and harassment. During counseling, these allegations were clarified to indicate that the individual, who replaced appellant and purportedly harassed her, was the selectee for the position of Customer Services Branch Supervisor, who became appellant's supervisor. While the EEO Counselor's final report indicates that appellant did not raise the issue of her nonselection for the position of Customer Services Branch Supervisor until October 1994, we find that the issue was raised at the initial interview on August 10, 1994. Appellant alleged that she was subjected to discrimination when her supervisory duties were removed and she was replaced. The record indicates that her duties were assumed and she was replaced by the selectee for the position of Customer Services Branch Supervisor. Clearly, appellant was disputing the selection of the supervisor. We find that appellant raised the issue of her nonselection with an EEO Counselor prior to the expiration of the 45-day limitation period. The agency has not presented persuasive evidence to the contrary. Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss this allegation of appellant's complaint was improper and is REVERSED. This allegation is hereby REMANDED for further processing in accordance with the ORDER set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's failure to address certain allegations in its acceptance letter cannot be read as a dismissal of those claims. <span class="Italic">Fly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924116 (1993). Claims must be dismissed by a written notice that specifically identifies the claims being dismissed as set forth in 29 CFR 1614.107(b).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the failure of the complainant to challenge the agency's definition of the claims in the acceptance letter may lead to a waiver of any challenged later in the EEO process. In <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120061552 (2008), the complainant did not challenge the agency's definition of the claims in the acceptance letter even though she was advised that if she did not agree with the definition of the claims, she should notify the agency's EEO director in writing. The Commission barred a challenge to the definition of the claims on appeal finding that the complainant had waived her opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent">Defining the claim in an overly narrow manner may work to the agency's disadvantage. In <span class="Italic">Butler v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090010 (2010), disputed a ruling by the administrative judge that fairly read the complainant's allegations encompassed a discriminatory work assignment claim, as well as a hostile environment claim. That ruling was reaffirmed by a second administrative judge assigned to the case. Responding to an agency argument that it was prejudiced by the rulings and had not retained evidence important to its defense, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that AJ-1 improperly redefined complainant's claim to encompass the discriminatory work assignments issue and a hostile work environment claim. We note that the agency twice argued this to AJ-1 and AJ-2, and its arguments were rejected. We find, yet again, the agency's argument in this regard to be without merit. A clear reading of complainant's complaint, combined with the EEO Counselor's Report, <span id="Page_143"></span>shows that the agency should have been on notice that an allegation of discriminatory work assignments were part of her claim. As AJ-2 noted in her decision, the agency self-servingly defined complainant's complaint as narrowly as possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the EEO Investigator asked questions in many of the affidavits taken from agency witnesses regarding complainant's work assignments. The record is not devoid of evidence on this claim. The agency's EEO Investigator neglected to gather the records which would have documented complainant's assignment history. That the agency now regards this oversight as detrimental to its own interests is unfortunate, as the problem was of its own making.</p>
