<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-60"><span class="space">A.</span> AJ RESPONSIBILITIES PRIOR TO ISSUING SANCTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are certain procedural requirements, however, that the administrative judge must follow prior to issuing sanctions for failure to develop an impartial and appropriate record or failing to comply with an order. Pursuant to MD-110, Chapter 6, Part XII. "Sanctions for Failure to Develop an Impartial and Appropriate Factual Record":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.108(b) of 29 C.F.R. requires that an agency develop an impartial and appropriate factual record upon which to make findings on the claims raised in the written complaint. The Commission's regulations explain that an appropriate factual record is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(b). The Commission's Administrative Judges and the Office of Federal Operations have the authority to issue sanctions against an agency for its failure to develop an impartial and appropriate factual record in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where it is clear that the agency failed to develop an impartial and appropriate factual record, an Administrative Judge may exercise his/her discretion to issue sanctions. In such circumstances, the sanctions listed in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3) are available. <span class="Italic">See Petersel v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060075 (Oct. 30, 2008) (Administrative Judge properly drew an adverse inference against the agency when the investigative report failed to include any comparative data on other employees); <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070045 (September 25, 2009) (finding that the agency's delay in completing the investigation within the 180-day regulatory period is no small noncompliance matter and warrants a sanction). Even when an agency eventually completes the investigation during the hearing stage an Administrative Judge may issue sanctions in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before an Administrative Judge may sanction an agency for failing to develop an impartial and appropriate factual record, the Administrative Judge must issue an order to the agency or request the documents, records, comparative data, statistics, or affidavits. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). Such order or request shall make clear that sanctions may be imposed and the type of sanction that could be imposed for failure to comply with the order unless the agency can show good cause for that failure. <span class="Italic">See Rountree v. Dep't. of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 17, 2001). The notice to show cause to the agency may, in appropriate circumstances, provide the agency with an opportunity to take such action as the Administrative Judge deems necessary to correct the deficiencies in the record. This may include curing the defects in the investigation caused by improper interference by the agency's general counsel, if possible; and/or disqualifying counsel from continuing to represent the agency before the Commission. The Administrative Judge also shall provide the agency with a reasonable period of time within which to take the action that the Administrative Judge has deemed necessary. Only on the failure of the agency to comply with the Administrative Judge's order or request and the notice to show cause may the Administrative Judge impose a sanction or the sanctions identified in the order or request.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a difference in the requirements for imposing sanctions for an inadequate investigation and imposing sanctions for other misconduct. When dealing with an inadequate investigation, the administrative judge must give notice of the deficiencies, specify what is required to correct the deficiencies and give notice that sanctions may be imposed for failure to correct the deficiencies. When other misconduct is involved, the administrative judge is not required to specifically explain what a party must do to correct any misconduct. However, the judge must put the party on notice of the consequences of misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07200500411 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the administrative judge imposes a sanction, the basis for that sanction must be fully documented in the record, including the notice to the complainant that failure to comply with the order may subject her to sanctions. In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05823 (2002), the Commission reversed the dismissal of a complaint and remanded the case for a hearing where the basis for the sanction was not properly documented and the complainant presented evidence that she had, in fact, responded to the show cause order:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's final action and the AJ's Order dismissing the instant complaint, each set forth the following facts: the AJ sent an Acknowledgment and Order to the parties on May 4, 2000, providing notice of a pre-hearing conference scheduled for May 16, 2000. Complainant did not respond to this Order and did not appear for the pre-hearing conference. By facsimile dated May 22, 2000, complainant's attorney notified the AJ that she was representing complainant, and additionally indicated that she had previously attempted to notify the AJ of her representation, as well as her inability to appear for the May 16, 2000 conference, but received no response from the AJ's office. On May 23, 2000, the AJ issued a "Show Cause Order" to the parties, including <span id="Page_586"></span>complainant's attorney, requiring submission of a written response within fifteen days of receipt to provide justification for complainant's non-appearance at the conference. On June 20, 2000, after receiving no reply to the "Show Cause Order," the AJ issued a final Order dismissing the complaint pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant's attorney argues that she did timely respond to the Show Cause Order, and submits a letter addressed to the AJ, dated May 30, 2000, sent by facsimile on that same day. The attorney further argues that she telephoned both the agency and the AJ with the message that she was representing complainant, but that she never received a response. The attorney also argues that she contacted the AJ's office on several occasions to request a continuance of the conference date, but received no reply. Complainant's attorney requests that the Commission reverse the dismissal of the instant complaint, and that the hearing be re-scheduled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3) authorizes the Commission's Administrative Judges to sanction either party for failure to fully and timely respond to orders issued during the hearing process, without good cause shown. Such sanctions may include an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information, exclusion of other evidence offered by the party refusing to provide the requested information, or issuance of a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party<span class="Italic">. See also</span> EEOC Management Directive 110 Chapter 7, pp. 9-10. However, these sanctions must be tailored to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. A sanction may be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his or her discretion to impose a harsher sanction. Dismissal of a complaint by an AJ as a sanction is only appropriate in extreme circumstances, where the complainant has engaged in contumacious conduct, not simple negligence<span class="Italic">. Hale v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, review of the record indicates that neither the May 4, 2000, Acknowledgment and Order, nor the May 23, 2000 Show Cause Order, issued by the AJ are in evidence. Absent this evidence, we cannot conclude that either complainant or her attorney had adequate notice regarding either of these Orders sufficient to justify using dismissal of the complaint as a sanction in this case. Moreover, it is well-settled that the agency bears the burden to have evidence or proof in support of its final decision<span class="Italic">. See Marshall v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910685 (September 6, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, although the AJ's dismissal Order indicates that complainant failed to respond to the Show Cause Order, we note that on appeal, complainant's attorney provides a copy of both complainant's May 30, 2000 letter responding to the Show Cause Order, as well as a copy of the facsimile transmittal sheet reflecting transmission to the AJ's office on the same date. Therefore, notwithstanding the AJ's finding that her office received no response to the Show Cause Order, we find that the copy of the May 30, 2000 letter and facsimile transmittal sheet submitted on appeal constitute sufficient evidence to show that complainant made the required written response to the Show Cause Order. We further find that this response was timely because it was received by the AJ's office within fifteen days of the May 23, 2000, date of the Show Cause Order. Therefore, we find that the AJ's dismissal of the instant complaint was improper, and that the case should be scheduled for a hearing as requested by complainant on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Further, in imposing sanctions, the judge must consider the appropriateness of a particular sanction in light of deterring future misconduct. As the Commission held, in reversing dismissal of a complaint as a sanction in <span class="Italic">Peters v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02847 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the AJ did not provide proper notice to the parties prior to dismissing the complaint, nor did he tailor the sanction for the particular case. The AJ issued a Status Report and Order on November 2, 1999, dismissing the complaint because complainant failed to appear for the prehearing conference or telephone to explain her absence. There is no evidence of record that complainant was on notice of the consequences of failure to appear at the prehearing conference nor is there any evidence that complainant would not have been properly deterred from similar failures to appear or that the agency would not have been equitably treated by a lesser sanction, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, excluding witnesses or evidence subsequently proffered by complainant, waiving any objections complainant may have had to subsequent scheduling, etc. We find that based on the present record, dismissal as a sanction under these circumstances was unduly harsh and constituted an abuse of discretion by the AJ. Complainant's actions in this case may evidence neglect, but not contumacious conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge who does not comply with the prerequisites will be deemed to have abused his discretion. This is illustrated by the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Sheppard v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 01A02919 (2000). The administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span> issued a decision in which he granted the agency's motion to impose sanctions on the complainant for failure to respond to its request for admissions. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span> declined to uphold the sanctions because the administrative judge's order did not comply with the Commission's directives in MD-110:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The July 8, 1999 Order did not compel complainant to comply with the agency's May 19, 1999 Request for Admissions. The AJ has not claimed in his decision or in any other Order or correspondence, that the intention of the July 8, 1999 Order was to compel complainant to comply with the agency's May 19, 1999 Request for Admissions. Furthermore, even if the intention of the July 8, 1999 Order was to direct complainant to comply with the agency's May 19, 1999 Request for Admissions, the Order did not set forth any time limit for compliance and did not clarify what sanctions or other actions might be imposed for failure to comply with the Order within any particular time limit.<span class="Italic"> See</span> [MD-110], Chapter 7, Section III(B), n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter, the AJ never ruled on the agency's Cross Motion to Compel the Complainant to Respond to the Agency's Discovery Request and never ordered complainant to comply with the agency's May 19, 1999 Request for Admissions. Therefore, because complainant did not violate any order of the AJ and because complainant did indeed provide a "response" (in the form of a motion to halt discovery) to the discovery request, we find that sanctions were inappropriate in the instant matter. Complainant was simply not given the requisite notice that he was required by a certain date to submit substantive responses to the May 19, 1999 Request for Admissions or be subject to particular sanctions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span> case may be somewhat limited in application because of its unique nature. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span>, in response to the agency's request for admissions, had filed a motion to halt discovery and to compel the production of documents. The Commission, citing to Chapter 7 of MD-110, noted that a party may respond to a discovery request by filing written opposition to the request. The complainant's motion was filed in response to the agency's requests for admissions, therefore, was one of the reasons sanctions were inappropriate in <span class="Italic">Sheppard</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an administrative judge was wide discretion in fashioning sanctions to address specific misconduct, that discretion is not unlimited and sanctions must be tailored to the specific noncompliance involved. In <span class="Italic">Ferebee v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720100039 (2012), the Commission found that the complainant, a large black male, was subjected to harassment on the basis of race and sex when a white female loan representative refused to help him with a loan application and ordered him out of her office. She also engaged in a number of other activities including calling base police officers to come to her office when the complainant tried to drop off the completed loan application. Because of the agency's failure to respond to discovery about the loan program, the administrative judge imposed a wide range of sanctions, including issuing an injunction on issuing further loans until a loan reporting policy was in place and indicating he intended to continue to exercise jurisdiction over the case for 18 months to review loan reports. In finding the sanction in <span class="Italic">Ferebee</span> was not specifically tailored to the misconduct, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, our regulations provide that where a party, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, fails to respond to an order of an AJ, the AJ may, as appropriate, take action against the non-complying party pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3), i.e., an AJ may: (1) draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the non-complying party; (2) consider the requested information to be established in favor of the opposing party; (3) exclude other evidence offered by the non-complying party; (4) issue a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or (5) take other action deemed appropriate, e.g., payment of costs and expenses by the non-complying party. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Before taking any of the actions authorized by the Commission's regulations, an AJ must first issue a Notice to Show Cause to the non-complying party. MD-110, Chapter 7, Section III(D), fn. 6; <span class="Italic">see DaCosta v. Dep't of Education</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, the Commission has held that sanctions, while corrective, also act to prevent similar misconduct in the future and must be tailored to each situation, applying the least severe sanction necessary to respond to the party's failure to show good cause for its actions, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50030 (March 1, 2007); <span class="Italic">Rountree, supra; Hale v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). The Commission has emphasized that the purpose of a sanction is to deter the underlying conduct of the non-complying party. <span class="Italic">See Barbour v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC 07A30133 (June 16, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The factors pertinent to "tailoring" a sanction, or determining whether a sanction is, in fact, warranted, include: (1) the extent and nature of the non-compliance, including the justification presented by the non-complying party; (2) the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; (3) the consequences resulting from the delay in justice, if any; and (4) the effect on the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Gray, supra; <span id="Page_587"></span>Voysest v. Social Security Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A35340 (January 18, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted in Commission decisions, we have the inherent power to protect its administrative process from abuse by either party and must insure that agencies, as well as complainants, abide by its regulations. We have previously issued cases in which we have affirmed actions taken by AJs which were designed to bring to account an agency's non-compliance with the regulations or with Orders issued by an AJ. <span class="Italic">See Matheny, supra</span> (Commission affirmed its right to issue default judgments); <span class="Italic">Waller v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720030069 (May 25, 2007), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520070689 (February 26, 2009) (Commission affirmed its right to issue monetary sanctions in the administrative process). <span class="Italic">See also Footracer v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A46020 (September 25, 2005) (Commission upholding adverse inference drawn by AJ when agency witnesses discussed testimony with one another); <span class="Italic">Elston v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A50019 (October 18, 2005), <span class="Italic">request for recon. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A60283 (January 5, 2006) (Commission affirming default judgment issued by AJ); <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dep't. of Veterans Aff.</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (September 25, 2009) (Commission determining that default judgment in favor of Complainant was appropriate when the Agency failed to conduct an investigation in a timely manner).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that here, the AJ failed to order a sanction which is tailored to the extent and nature of the non-compliance, the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance, the consequences of the delay and the effect on the integrity. We note that the Complainant's ability to present evidence regarding harassment and disparate treatment were not affected by the lack of the evidence requested in his Motion for Discovery. We find that it was appropriate for the AJ to order attorney's fees and costs related to this discovery issue. However, the Commission is concerned with the zealous nature of the AJ's other orders such as enjoining the Agency from providing loans until a reporting policy is in place, a payment of $10,000 to an unidentified entity, and the AJ's maintenance of jurisdiction over the matter for up to 18 months and request of reports to the AJ regarding the CGMA loan program. As to the payment of $10,000.00 by the Agency, the AJ did not indicate who would receive the funds or the reasons for such an award. The enjoining of the CGMA program and the holding of jurisdiction over the matter by the AJ exceeded the jurisdiction and authority of the AJ. We believe that the AJ could have taken other actions which are within the Commission's authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the AJ's finding that the Agency has an obligation to ensure that employees are free from discrimination with respect to a term, condition or privilege of employment. The Commission notes Management Directive 715 (MD-715) is the policy guidance which the EEOC provides to federal agencies for their use in establishing and maintaining effective programs of equal employment opportunity under Section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., and Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. MD-715 provides a roadmap for creating effective equal employment opportunity (EEO) programs for all federal employees as required by Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. Under MD-7I5, the Agency must review its programs to identify the existence of barriers to equal opportunity. The Agency should identify the likely factor (or combination of factors) which has adversely affected the employment opportunities of the group in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency and the CGMA Executive Director did not indicate that the information was not available, but that the request was over-burdensome. We note that the CGMA could provide the Agency with a list of all Agency employees who applied for loans and the disposition of the loan applications. That information can be correlated with the Agency's Human Resources Office in order to determine the rates of approval, partial approval, and denial based on the employees race and sex. The Agency can then, as required by MD-715, analyze the data to determine if a barrier exists for employees based on, among other bases, their race and/or sex. The Agency, pursuant to MD-715, is also required to report data to the Commission annually. We find that a more appropriate order for the Agency would have been to require that the Agency include the information regarding the CGMA loan program in its MD-715 report to the Commission.</p>
