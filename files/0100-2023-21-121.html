<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-110"><span class="space">1.</span> Harassers' Claims Over Discipline</h4>
<p class="noindent">An employee who alleges that he was discriminated against on the basis of race and reprisal when he was removed from his position following an allegation of sexual harassment stated a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01943373 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Robles v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993974 (2002), coworkers disciplined for sexual bantering claimed they were the subjects of discrimination based on sex. In upholding the finding of the administrative judge that the agency disciplined the complainants because they were male, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Robles</span> noted it would not sustain such claims solely on an after-the-fact showing that the discipline was inappropriate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a final matter, we note that the Commission, in a Guidance published after the issuance of the Supreme Court's opinions in the sexual harassment cases of <span class="Italic">Burlington</span> <span class="Italic">Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S. 742 (1998) and <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775 (1998), suggests that agencies establish, disseminate and enforce an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure and take other reasonable steps to prevent and correct harassment<span class="Italic">. See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> (Vicarious Liability), No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). In this Guidance, the Commission addresses the situation at hand, in which accused harassers claim that discipline they received through an internal harassment procedure was discriminatory. The Guidance notes the Commission will not find pretext based solely on an after-the-fact conclusion that the disciplinary action is inappropriate. Where the accused harasser claims that the disciplinary action was discriminatory, "the real issue is whether the employer reasonably believed the employee's allegation [of harassment] and acted on it in good faith, or to the contrary, the employer did not actually believe the co-employee's allegation but instead used it as a pretext for an otherwise discriminatory dismissal." <span class="Italic">See</span> Vicarious Liability, fn. 71, quoting <span class="Italic">Waggonner v. City of Garland Tex.</span>, 987 F.2d 1160, 1165 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision herein does not contradict this Guidance. The AJ's finding of discrimination is not based solely on an after-the-fact conclusion that discipline was inappropriate. Rather, the finding of discrimination is based on the fact that one of the officials involved in investigating FE's claims held a biased view of women which predisposed him to believe FE's version of events rather than complainants, despite evidence that she was exaggerating and misrepresenting relevant events. As such, the agency's decision to believe FE's allegations was not reasonable. We remind the agency that if it conducts an adequate and unbiased investigation into an employee's claim of sexual harassment and determines in good faith that discipline is warranted, the Commission will not find that decision to be discriminatory based solely on a determination that the discipline was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency receives a complaint of harassment, it is required to promptly investigate the claim and, during that investigation, take prompt and effective action to insure that any harassment ceases. This often places agencies in the position of having to separate the complainant and the alleged perpetrator. Reassigning an alleged perpetrator pending an investigation into a harassment charge is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. In <span class="Italic">Sims v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a54115.txt">01A54115</a> (2006), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find that assuming complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case on the bases he alleged, the agency has articulated a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its action. Specifically, the record reveals that complainant was temporarily reassigned to another office while the agency investigated the serious sexual harassment charges brought against him by a subordinate employee. We note that once an employer is aware of sexual harassment, the employer is required to take prompt and effective corrective action to stop the harassment. In the present case, the agency's decision to reassign complainant was for the stated purpose of separating complainant from the accusing subordinate employee while the investigation was being taken. We find complainant has failed to show that the agency's actions were motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Mollett v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072989 (2007), the Commission found that summary judgment was appropriate where the complainant claimed he was instructed not to have contact with female carriers and not to enter a Postal facility. The Commission found there was no dispute of fact that the complainant had been instructed not to have contact with female carriers because of his past conduct and that he was instructed not to enter the facility when he failed to follow those instructions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, in <span class="Italic">Shears v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120070920 (2009), the Commission upheld summary judgment on a claim that a termination for alleged sexual harassment was discriminatory rejecting several attempts by the complainant to create credibility issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, complainant maintained that he established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination because a younger female employee replaced him at the Lake City Post Office. However, the younger female employee was not similarly situated to complainant because she was not accused of sexual harassment. Complainant also claimed that a male co-worker was treated more favorably than complainant because the co-worker was not placed on administrative leave when he was accused of sexual harassment. However, this assertion undermines complainant's discrimination claim because the co-worker is the same sex as complainant, and complainant did not show that he is substantially older than the co-worker. We determine that complainant failed to show that a similarly situated individual not within his protected classes was treated more favorably than he was treated under similar circumstances or otherwise provide evidence that would support an inference of age or sex discrimination. Thus, we find that complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age or sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we further find that the agency provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for issuing complainant the termination notice. Specifically, the Postmaster stated that complainant was issued a termination notice because an employee reported that complainant had sexually harassed her by placing his hands in her pants and pushed her against a case and tried to kiss her. The Postmaster further stated that another employee told her that complainant held her in a "bear hug and started doing a wiggly motion" and grabbed her blouse while making sexual remarks. The Postmaster further stated that she began an investigation concerning these allegations on May 3, 2005, consulted with the Nashville, Tennessee Labor Relations Office, and placed complainant on administrative leave. Additionally, the Postmaster stated that after she learned of these allegations, "it became apparent" to her why one of the accusers had been so visibly upset on March 19, 2005, when the Postmaster saw complainant make physical contact with <span id="Page_917"></span>the accuser while complainant placed mail on a ledge. The Postmaster stated that in that March 19, 2005 incident, she saw complainant make physical contact with the left side of the accuser's body with every part of his body from his right ankle to his shoulder. The Postmaster stated that she approached the accuser after the encounter, and the accuser was trembling and stated, "I hate that man and never want him near me again!"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Postmaster further stated that an administrative investigation was conducted by a Relations Specialist and a Human Resources Specialist regarding the allegations against complainant. The administrative investigation report stated that one of the accusers claimed that complainant grabbed her, pressed against her, and simulated sexual activity on her. The report further stated that the other accuser stated that complainant touched her legs, presented her with a nude picture, put his hand in her pants, attempted to kiss her, and engaged in various other acts of lewd conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his response to the agency's motion for a decision without a hearing, complainant denied that he engaged in the alleged acts of sexual harassment; questioned the credibility of his accusers; objected to the Postmaster's reliance on hearsay reports regarding his conduct; and, criticized the manner in which the administrative investigation was conducted. However, even taking complainant's contentions into account, we do not find that the Postmaster's response to the allegations was unreasonable in this case, in light of the fact that there were two accusers who reported very similar allegations against complainant, and the agency has a duty under EEO regulations to promptly and effectively respond to harassment allegations. Complainant further claimed that the Postmaster also tried to terminate another male employee based on sexual harassment allegations and that the Postmaster has made charges of sexual harassment in the past. However, even if the Postmaster has asserted claims of sexual harassment in the past, we do not find this to be persuasive evidence that the Postmaster harbored animus against men.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, complainant also suggested that one of his accusers' credibility is questionable because she had "no qualms" about reporting a male co-worker who wanted to "go out" with her to management, but claimed that she was afraid to report complainant's alleged behavior to management. However, there is a significant distinction between being asked on a date by a co-worker and the type of physically threatening and demeaning actions complainant was alleged to have engaged in against co-workers. We do not determine that the accuser's credibility is undermined by her claim that she was afraid to report complainant's alleged misconduct. Thus, we find that there is no genuine issue of material fact in this case because complainant failed to provide any evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the agency's articulated reasons for its actions are pretext for unlawful discrimination. Consequently, we find that the AI properly found no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Filing a complaint because another employee alleges harassment does not state a claim. In <span class="Italic">Soria v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120081473 (2008), the Commission upheld dismissal of a complaint alleging that the complaint was subjected to a fact-finding meeting as the result of a sexual harassment complaint by a coworker. In <span class="Italic">Soria</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her complaint, complainant emphasized her claim that she was discriminated against when she was accused of sexual harassment by co-worker 1; resulting in a fact finding meeting. While not directly on point, the Commission has held that to allow the processing of a complaint regarding the participation of employees in the investigation of another EEO complaint would have a chilling effect on the processing of EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">Calloway v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943406 (July 15, 1994). Complainant does not allege that she was disciplined as a result of questions or concerns about her work or the fact finding meeting. We find that the alleged harassment was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to state a claim.</p>
