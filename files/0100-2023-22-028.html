<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-29"><span class="space">F.</span> CAREGIVER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although caregiver status is not protected under Title VII, the Commission has issued guidance on when discrimination due to caregiver responsibilities may violate Title VII if it is based on gender stereotyping. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stella B. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120171497 (2018); <span class="Italic">Camden v. Attorney General</span>, 0120093506 (2012). In 2007, the Commission issued "Employer Best Practices for Workers with Caregiver Responsibilities," and it supplemented that guidance in January 2011. Among the practices the Commission identified as potential Title VII violations are:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">assuming that female workers' caretaking responsibilities will interfere with their ability to succeed in a fast-paced environment;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">assuming that female workers who work part-time or take advantage of flexible work arrangements are less committed to their jobs than full-time employees;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">assuming that male workers do not, or should not, have significant caregiving responsibilities;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">assuming that female workers prefer, or should prefer, to spend time with their families rather than time at work;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">assuming that female workers who are caregivers are less capable than other workers; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">assuming that pregnant workers are less reliable than other workers.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120101227 (2012), the Commission found that the agency did not engage in gender stereotyping when it passed her over for promotion based on her low and negative leave balances that were related to childcare. The complainant alleged she was discriminated against because she was a single, divorced mother. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Ramirez</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant contends that because she was a divorced woman with children, she was treated differently than married male coworkers, who had wives to take care of their children, and therefore did not have to exhaust their leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At first glance, it appears that Complainant is alleging that male workers with caregiving responsibilities received more favorable treatment than female workers with caregiving responsibilities. But upon closer inspection, what she is contending as the basis for unequal treatment is marital status, not sex: single, unmarried caregivers are treated differently than married caregivers, because married caregivers have spouses to take care of their children and do not have to exhaust their leave. The Commission does not have jurisdiction over claims of discrimination based on marital status as they are not within the purview of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Duplantier v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920609 (Nov. 27, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1002"></span>Gender Role Stereotyping of Working Women</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also appears to allege that her supervisor discouraged her from pursuing a detail opportunity in another state because of her caretaking responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII does not permit employers to treat female workers less favorably merely on the gender-based assumption that a particular female worker will assume caretaking responsibilities or that a female worker's caretaking responsibilities will interfere with her work performance. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Unlawful Disparate Treatment of Workers with Caregiving Responsibilities</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, at 11-12 (May 23, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, employers may make the stereotypical assumptions that women with young children will (or should) not work long hours and that new mothers are less committed to their jobs than they were before they had children. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 14. Relying on such stereotypes, some employers may deny female caregivers opportunities based on assumptions about how they might balance work and family responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Adverse employment decisions based on such sex-based assumptions or speculation, rather than on the specific work performance of a particular employee, violate Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 15</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, employment decisions that are based on an employee's actual work performance, rather than assumptions or stereotypes, do not generally violate Title VII, even if an employee's unsatisfactory work performance is attributable to caregiving responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Enforcement Guidance provides an example of an employment decision lawfully based on actual work performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After Carla, an associate in a law firm, returned from maternity leave, she began missing work frequently because of her difficulty in obtaining childcare and was unable to meet several important deadlines. As a result, the firm lost a big client, and Carla was given a written warning about her performance. Carla's continued childcare difficulties resulted in her missing further deadlines for several important projects. Two months after Carla was given the written warning, the firm transferred her to another department, where she would be excluded from most high-profile cases but would perform work that has fewer time constraints. Carla filed a charge alleging sex discrimination. The investigation revealed that Carla was treated comparably to other employees, both male and female, who had missed deadlines on high-profile projects or otherwise performed unsatisfactorily and had failed to improve within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, the employer did not violate Title VII by transferring Carla.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant's allegation is similar to this example. Here, the supervisor's concerns about Complainant's negative leave balance and caretaking responsibilities were based on Complainant's actual negative leave balance and his specific knowledge about Complainant's child, rather than assumptions or stereotypes about female caregivers as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that Complainant did not establish a claim of gender role stereotyping of working women. Therefore, the Commission has no jurisdiction over this claim of discrimination based on marital status.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Buck S. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120150623 (2017), reiterated that caregivers subjected to sex discrimination based on stereotyping about parental roles are covered under Title VII, but further noted that, in the absence of evidence establishing such stereotyping, agencies are free to take action to address an employee's poor performance regardless of his or her parental status. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Buck S.</span> alleged that the agency discriminated against him based on his status as a new father of twins when it forced him to work a part-time schedule with a full workload. The agency countered that the complainant repeatedly missed deadlines and required extensions, prompting the agency to reassign some of his work and discuss his performance. The evidence led the Commission to find that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Buck S</span>. failed to establish that the agency's reason for its action was pretext for discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant contends that management harbored animus against him because he was a new father with the birth of twins. We note that in general, parental and marital statuses are not protected classes covered by the statues enforced in the Federal EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.101(a)-(b). The Commission recognizes, however, that individuals who are also caregivers to either children or the elderly may face sex-based disparate treatment in the workplace. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Unlawful Disparate Treatment of Workers with Caregiving Responsibilities</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, 8-12 (May 23, 2007). Nevertheless, we find that in the instant case, the record reflects that Complainant did not argue that he was treated differently than those outside of his sex or that the management's actions towards him resulted from stereotypes about his role as a caregiver. The record does not reflect, and Complainant does not argue, that management directed sexual stereotypes towards him because of his role as a father. We find that Complainant has not established an inference of sex discrimination by showing that mothers were treated more favorably than fathers were treated under treated similar circumstances. Specifically, Complainant has not alleged that mothers received better treatment than fathers with regard to the assignment of work, leave, or telework. <span class="Italic">See Griner-Esslinger v. Dep't of Health and Human Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 012008266 (Feb. 18, 2011) (complainant failed to establish an inference of sex discrimination by showing that single fathers were treated more favorably). Thus, we find that Complainant failed to provide any evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the Agency's nondiscriminatory reasons were pretext for unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Doe v. Attorney General</span>, 0720090006 (2012), the Commission found that the agency discriminated against the complainant in not selecting her for a lateral transfer by taking into account her family situation. In that case, the complainant had difficulties with her first-line supervisor and was assigned to report to her second-line supervisor. The agency then considered reopening an office in another city and the complainant was sent to take inventory of what was needed. Shortly thereafter, she announced that she was pregnant and, if selected, she would move with her two younger daughters while her husband stayed behind with her step-daughter while she finished high school. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we conclude that the AJ's finding of sex discrimination is supported by substantial evidence. Although the Agency challenged the AJ's factual findings, we find that those findings are supported by the hearing transcript as well as the Report of Investigation. The testimony provided at the hearing and during the Report of Investigation was clear that Complainant's family situation was considered when making the selection for the position in City 2. Rather than simply judging Complainant on her own qualifications, Agency officials believed that Complainant's family should not be separated. Moreover, there was evidence in the Report of Investigation that males, such as Supervisor 1, were not subjected to such considerations when relocations were considered. An employer's adverse employment decision based on gender stereotypes is sometimes well-intentioned and perceived as being in the employee's best interest. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Unlawful Disparate Treatment of Workers with Caregiving Responsibilities</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (May 23, 2007). Such decisions, nonetheless, violate Title VII, even though the employer is not acting out of hostility. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
