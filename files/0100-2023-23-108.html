<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-106"><span class="space">12.</span> Medical Insurance Benefits</h4>
<p class="noindent">Medical insurance benefits provided to employees and their spouses and dependents must be free of disability-based discrimination. The protection applies even though it is the insurance carrier and not the actual employing agency that makes the determination to exclude a condition from coverage. In such cases, though, it is the Office of Personnel Management, as the contracting agency, and not the employing agency that is the proper defendant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Polifko v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01960976 (1997), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span>, <span class="Italic">Polifko v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 05970769 (1998), the Commission overturned the agency's determination that its insurance carrier's exclusion of coverage of the wife of an appellant for breast cancer treatment was not disability-based discrimination. In order to justify a disability-based distinction, the agency must show that it is operating under a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> health insurance plan and that the distinction is not being made as a subterfuge for discrimination. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Polifko</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue presented herein is whether the agency properly determined that Blue Cross/Blue Shield's (hereinafter referred to as "insurance carrier") exclusion of coverage for High Dose Chemotherapy with Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (HD/ABMT) for the treatment of appellant's wife's breast cancer was not a disability based distinction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the agency claims that any differentiation in benefits is not a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. Citing the case of <span class="Italic">Traynor v. Turnage</span>, 485 U.S. 535, 549 (1988) and similar cases, the agency contends that differentiation among similarly disabled individuals has been held not to constitute prohibited disability based discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is not persuaded by this argument. The <span class="Italic">Traynor</span> line of cases is inapposite to the present case for two reasons. First, the cases cited by the agency were not subject to the 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act. Second, <span class="Italic">Traynor</span> did not concern a benefit, like health insurance, which applies to persons with and without disabilities. For these reasons, the Commission finds no merit to the agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Traynor</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency then concludes that the exclusion of ABMT as a treatment for breast cancer was not tantamount to a disability based distinction as it is defined in the Guidance. As noted in the previous decision issued on this matter, a disability based distinction is one which "...singles out a particular disability (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, deafness, AIDS, schizophrenia), a discrete group of disabilities (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, cancers, muscular dystrophies, kidney diseases), or disability in general (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span> non-coverage of all conditions that substantially limit a major life activity)." Guidance at p. 2. However, distinctions which affect both individuals with and without disabilities and which apply to a "multitude of dissimilar conditions" are not distinctions based upon disability. They may have a greater impact on certain persons with disabilities but they do not violate the Rehabilitation Act. Guidance at p. 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the exclusion is not a disability based distinction because the coverage was based on the suitability of the treatment, <span id="Page_1201"></span>not the disability. The Commission finds, however, that the exclusion is a disability based distinction pursuant to the definition cited above. An examination of the language of the exclusion contained in the policy at issue is revealing, inasmuch as it shows that the distinction in this case applies to a specific disability, breast cancer, and affects only persons who have this disability. As such it is neither a broad distinction, nor one which affects both persons with and without disabilities. The assertion that the agency is making a distinction based on medical suitability of the treatment, rather than on disability, is misplaced. The agency is not discussing the suitability of the ABMT in general, but rather its suitability as a treatment for breast cancer. This constitutes a disability based distinction. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the insurance carrier's policy which excludes coverage of ABMT for the treatment of breast cancer constitutes a disability based distinction. We must now determine whether or not the disability based distinction is within the protective ambit of section 501(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that section 501(c) allows the agency to justify the distinction by showing that: (1) the health insurance plan is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> plan, and (2) the distinction is not being used as a subterfuge. There is no dispute that the policy at issue is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> policy. The question remains whether or not the agency has met its burden of establishing that the distinction is not being used as a subterfuge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted in the previous decision, the Guidance contains a "non-exclusive" list of potential justifications for the distinction. In order to establish that the distinction is not being used as a subterfuge, the agency may show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that: (1) it did not engage in the disparate treatment alleged; (2) the disparate treatment was due to the application of legitimate risk classification and underwriting procedures; (3) the disparate treatment is necessary to ensure the fiscal soundness of the insurance plan; (4) the disparate treatment is necessary to prevent an unacceptable change in coverage or premiums of the plan; or (5) the treatment has no medical value. Guidance at p. 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency attempts to argue that it did not engage in the disparate treatment alleged, the Commission finds for the reasons set forth below that this argument is without merit. The agency seems to raise the first justification by arguing that it did not engage in disability based disparate treatment, but rather declined to cover the ABMT for breast cancer based on its "medical suitability." The agency submitted testimony from three witnesses, who offered essentially the same opinion. To summarize, the witnesses claimed that the coverage of ABMT was denied to breast cancer patients in 1993 because scientific evidence as of 1992 (evidence relied upon for the 1993 policy year) did not show that it was safe or effective enough for breast cancer patients when compared to conventional dose chemotherapy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite this evidence, the Commission concludes that the agency failed to show that its definition of "medical suitability" has been applied in a uniform and consistent manner so that similar conditions are treated in the same way as the agency treated breast cancer. Specifically lacking is essential objective criteria the agency used and uses to determine whether or not a treatment is medically suitable. The agency has not shown whether it used any objective criteria for medical suitability in this case, and whether or not the same criteria were used in other similar situations. In this regard, we note that in the previous decision the agency was instructed to provide evidence on other similar conditions where coverage for the treatment was also denied, and the reasons for the exclusion in those cases. For example, one way the agency could have shown consistency in the application of "medical suitability" as a requirement for coverage could have been by submitting evidence on other similar treatments (treatments in the agency's view whose effects were similarly uncertain or ineffective), and the reasons that these treatments were not covered for illnesses other than breast cancer that had similar prognoses. Given the absence of such evidence in the record, the agency has failed to show that it used a consistent definition of "medical suitability," and that such a definition was uniformly applied in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly the Commission finds that there is no evidence to support the distinction pursuant to justification (2), (3), or (4). The agency made no argument and presented no evidence establishing that the disability based distinction was attributable to the application of legitimate risk classification and underwriting procedures in lieu of the disability <span class="Italic">per se</span>. Moreover, the record is devoid of evidence or argument that the disability based distinction was necessary for fiscal soundness of the plan or necessary to prevent a drastic increase in premiums or alteration to the scope of coverage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, it is arguable that the agency is claiming that the treatment does not provide any benefit, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it has no medical value. The agency argues in this regard that the scientific evidence did not establish in 1992 that the benefits associated with the procedure outweighed the risks, when compared to conventional treatment modalities. In order to support justification (5), however, the Commission finds that the agency must submit evidence establishing that the treatment has no medical value, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it was not effective at all. The evidence submitted by the agency does not support this conclusion. The agency argues instead, and submits evidence purporting to show, that the treatment was excluded from coverage for breast cancer, because it was not effective enough.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the agency's burden to submit evidence showing that the disability based distinction in this case was not being used as a subterfuge for discrimination. The Commission concludes that, based upon the evidence contained in the record, the agency has not met this burden. We emphasize that this decision is not reliant upon the validity or invalidity of the agency's scientific evidence, and therefore, we make no medical assessment on the relative merits of the treatment to treat breast cancer. Our decision instead is based upon the agency's claim that "medical suitability" was the justification for the exclusion of breast cancer, and the agency failure to submit objective evidence clearly defining the standard and showing its consistent application.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it denied coverage of ABMT to treat appellant's wife's breast cancer. Specifically, the agency has failed to meet its burden of showing that the disability based distinction involved in this case was not being used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the ADA. Thus, the agency is ordered to remedy the discrimination. As a remedy, appellant asked that coverage for the treatment be awarded to him. This claim for medical expenses is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damages, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the past pecuniary losses that are causally related to the denial of coverage.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">James v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 0120054026 (2007), OPM dismissed the complainant's individual claim that long term disability coverage provided under the Long Term Care Security Act discriminated against individuals with disabilities after an administrative judge denied certification of the claim as a class action. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">James</span>, rejected OPM's arguments that its contracted coverage plan was outside the reach of the ADA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing the agency's argument that the complaint fails to state a claim, we look to the statute and associated regulations for guidance on whether Congress intended the Commission to have jurisdiction over claims concerning discriminatory denial of insurance benefits. The Commission's regulations require an agency to accept a complaint from any aggrieved employee or applicant for employment who believes that he or she has been discriminated against by that agency because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disabling condition. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.103, .106(a). The Commission's federal sector case precedent defines an "aggrieved employee" as one who suffers a present harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05931049 (April 21, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has already decided that insurance coverage is a fringe benefit available by virtue of employment and that denial of insurance coverage concerns a term condition or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">Polifko, supra.</span> By explicit language of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 12112(a)) an employer may not discriminate against an individual with a disability with regard to job applications, hiring, advancement and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. The Commission's regulations interpret this to mean that it is unlawful to discriminate based on an individual's disability in an employer's provision of fringe benefits available by virtue of employment whether or not administered by an employer 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.4(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In terms of whether the agency's contract with a third party falls within the parameters of the ADA, Commission regulations implementing the ADA (42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b) (2)), specifically state:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;In general. It is unlawful for a covered entity to participate in a contractual or other arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting the covered entity's own qualified applicant or employee with a disability to the discrimination prohibited by this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Contractual or other relationship defined. The phrase Contractual or other arrangement or relationship includes, but is not limited to, a relationship with...an organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the covered entity...EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.6 (a) and (b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, it is clear that Congress intended that contractual relationships of a covered employer be scrutinized for whether they discriminate against its employees who are individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the law. Moreover, it is apparent that Congress anticipated that insurance contracts would be scrutinized under the standards imposed by the ADA by the specific inclusion of provisions which address insurance-based decisions. 42 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 12201(c). The statute also includes language specifically permitting review of an insurance contract to determine whether it is a "subterfuge to evade the purposes of [the Act]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">By statute, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible <span id="Page_1202"></span>for administering the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program and pursuant to its authority, awarded a contract as a result of the bidding process. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9002 (Long Term Care Security Act); AJ Order at 5; <span class="Italic">see also Barta v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01991959 (August 17, 2000) (the Commission held that the agency responsible for administering the federal health benefits program is the proper respondent agency). Therefore, the Commission concludes that OPM, in its contractual relationship with the Long Term Care Partners for the provision of this insurance, is the proper party responsible for ensuring that its contract adheres to non-discrimination statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency claims that language in the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program statute states that eligibility determinations will "be subject to review only to the extent and in the manner provided in the applicable master contract" (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9003 (c)(2)). However, there is no indication in this language or in the legislative history that Congress intended to authorize OPM to dispense with its non-discriminatory obligations under civil rights statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's amended final decision finds that this case differs from cases involving the Federal Health Benefits Program where the Commission has decided that the agency bears the responsibility for bringing its contracts into compliance with the Rehabilitation Act. The agency contends that the Federal Employee Health Benefits Act required guaranteed coverage and specifically prohibited the agency from entering into a contract that denies health coverage to individuals based on their health status. In contrast, the agency claims that Congress did not include a similar provision in the Long Term Care Security Act which gave the agency discretion to negotiate with the insurance carrier the review process involving coverage determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not persuaded by the agency's argument that because of the discretionary nature of long term care insurance, it falls outside of the Commission's reach. The provision of long term care insurance, like health insurance, is a fringe benefit of employment for which the agency has responsibilities under EEO laws. The agency offers no specific authority or legislative support for the notion that no administrative body may review these contracts for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the Commission concludes the agency's argument is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the complaint is an impermissible collateral attack on an unfavorable insurance decision and it should be rejected. However, we disagree that complainant is challenging the propriety of the underwriting criteria used to deny him coverage, rather he contends that the insurer's decision was based on his status as an individual with a disability. This kind of claim falls squarely within the Commission's jurisdiction under the Rehabilitation Act and is distinguishable from other impermissible claims we have rejected. Similarly, the Commission has held that complaints alleging the discriminatory denial of health benefits is not a collateral attack on an insurance-based decision, but is a valid claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Klein v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A53675 (October 27, 2005). Thus, we reject the agency's argument and conclude that the complaint states an actionable claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Fornaro v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 0520060303 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Willia M. v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 0120132419 (2018), the complainants, husband and wife, alleged that the agency discriminated against the wife based on her infertility and the husband based on his relationship with his disabled wife when it denied insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization treatments. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Willia M</span>. found that OPM did violate the Rehabilitation Act when it contracted for an employee health benefits plan that excluded from coverage certain assisted reproductive procedures, including IVF:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a complaint alleges that a health-related term or provision of a health insurance plan violates the Rehabilitation Act, the Commission first examines whether the challenged term or provision is a disability-based distinction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arose before January 1, 2009, the effective date of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA). The Commission will therefore use the analytical framework as it existed before the enactment of the ADAAA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find there is substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that the wife's infertility constituted a disability. The medical records indicate that the wife was missing one ovary and two fallopian tubes, and that her doctor diagnosed her with medical infertility and informed her she would need medical treatment in order to reproduce. <span class="Italic">See Bragdon v. Abbott</span>, 524 U.S. 624 (1998) (holding that reproduction is a major life activity under the ADA). The challenged exclusion of ART at issue in this case was a disability-based distinction because, as the AJ correctly found, during the relevant time period, IVF procedures were nearly exclusively utilized by individuals with the physical impairment of infertility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that the exclusion of IVF was not disability-based because IVF was treated in a manner consistent with BCBS's policy of excluding treatments that are not "medically necessary." Consistent with the Plan's brochure and Manual, BCBS's Director of OPM Relations from 1997 to 2000 testified that IVF was excluded because it did not meet the Plan's definition of "medically necessary" in that it does not "treat the underlying condition or illness." The AJ credited the Director's testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our examination of the provisions of the Plan's brochure reveals that the Plan inconsistently and arbitrarily applied its definition of "medically necessary" to exclude IVF while covering other similar treatments. In addition, OPM's Chief of the Office of Insurance Programs and BCBS's Director of OPM Relations acknowledged that the Plan paid for other services that, like IVF, do not cure the underlying medical condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 369-370, 934-935. We therefore determine that the AJ's finding that the exclusion was based on medical necessity is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central question in this case is whether the disability-based exclusion of IVF coverage falls within the "safe harbor" insurance provision of the ADA, as applied to Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. The relevant section for this case is Section 501(c)(3) that provides that the law "shall not be construed to prohibit or restrict a person or organization covered by this chapter from establishing, sponsoring, observing or administering the terms of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> benefit plan that is not subject to State laws that regulate insurance."5 This provision is modified by the proviso that it "not be used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of [the titles of the ADA]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency may prove that its disability-based exclusion of IVF treatment is not a subterfuge because it is justified, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, by legitimate actuarial data, or by actual or reasonably anticipated experience. In support of their position that the exclusion of WC was not disability-based, OPM and BCBS relied on an April 30, 2010 actuarial analysis by the BCBS Association's Chief Actuary. The AJ was not persuaded by the analysis, however, because it was performed nearly forty years after BCBS first began excluding ART services, in as early as 1973. The AJ concluded that, as a result, it "provides no meaningful insight" into the rationale for excluding ART at the time the exclusion-decision was made and therefore could not be used to justify the disability-based distinction. <span class="Italic">Tammy L. Lawrence and Victor M. Lawrence v. OPM</span>, EEOC Case Nos. 100-A2-7218X and 100-A2-7219X (April 3, 2013) (AJ decision), fn. 41.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that OPM failed to provide sufficient evidence or testimony to establish the basis for the 1998-2000 exclusion of ART from coverage. OPM provided no evidence that the disability-based distinction that was in effect from 1998 to 2000 was attributable to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, any application of legitimate risk classification, underwriting procedures, or verifiable actuarial data. <span class="Italic">See. e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Scars Roebuck and Co</span>., 243 F.3d 846, 853 (4th Cir. 2001) (stating that "a factfinder could infer from the late appearance of [the employer's] current justification that it is a post-hoc rationale, not a legitimate explanation for [the employer's] decision....") (citing <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Re/Max Mountain States, Inc</span>., 232 F.3d 808, 813 (10th Cir. 2000) ("We are disquieted...by an employer who 'fully' articulates its reasons for the first time months after the decision was made.")); <span class="Italic">University Hospitals of Cleveland v. Emerson Elec. Co</span>., 202 F.3d 839, 848 n.7 (6th Cir. 2000) ("[I]t strikes us as problematic to...allow the [plan] administrator to 'shore up' a decision after-the-fact by testifying as to the 'true' basis for the decision after the matter is in litigation, possible deficiencies in the decision are identified, and an attorney is consulted to defend the decision by developing creative <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> arguments that can survive deferential review. The concerns inherent in this scenario are even more pronounced where, as here, the administrator has a financial incentive to deny benefits."). In addition, because OPM could not obtain any relevant data for the time-period in question, the study offers no predictions or relevant insights into the potential effect on the Plan had it covered ART from 1998 to 2000. <span class="Italic">See Polifko v. Office of Personnel Mngt</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01960976 (holding that the "agency made no argument and presented no evidence establishing that the disability based distinction was attributable to the application of legitimate risk classification and underwriting procedures....)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on an exhaustive review of the record and the contentions on appeal, including those not specifically addressed here, we find that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it contracted for employee health benefits with an insurance carrier that discriminated against Complainants on the bases of disability (infertility) and disability by association in the provision of health care insurance coverage. The Agency did not meet its burden of showing that the health insurance plan's 1998-2000 exclusion of IVF from coverage was based on sound actuarial principles or related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience, or otherwise justified as not medically necessary. We therefore REVERSE the Administrative Judge's decision, and REMAND the matter for a determination of appropriate remedies including, but not limited to, compensatory damages and attorney's fees.</p>
