<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-82"><span class="space">n.</span> Power to Hire or Terminate</h5>
<p class="noindent">While the general rule is that no one factor is sufficient to establish an employer-employee relationship with the agency, in practice that rule is not followed where the agency holds the power to terminate the employee. An example is provided by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120141480 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, we turn to the issue of Complainant's reassignment and subsequent termination. A significant factor in determining whether an agency is an employer is whether it has the power to terminate an employee. An Agency has <span class="Italic">de facto</span> power to terminate a worker where cutting off his services in most cases results in the removal of the worker by their staffing firm employer. <span class="Italic">International Union v. Clark</span>, 2006 WL 2598046, 18 AD. Cases 932 (D.D.C. 2006), EEOC Appeal No. 0120090933 (United States Marshals Service Power to decide whether a particular Court Security Officer (CSO) could be removed from the contract for failure to meet the qualifications of the job was tantamount to removal power since an adverse agency determination against the CSO in most cases resulted in termination by the contractor).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency required a psychological report clearing Complainant for work. Following Complainant's submission of the report, the Agency's Team Lead expressed concerns about Complainant's performance and behavior, and it the Agency that requested Complainant to be removed from NAVSEA. Within weeks, CACI terminated Complainant. In sum, the weight of the evidence shows that the Agency's decision to have Complainant removed from the Navy Yard assignment resulted in his effective termination by CACI.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, based on the legal standards and criteria set forth herein, we find that the Agency exercised sufficient control over Complainant to qualify as a joint employer for the purposes of the 29 C.F.R. 1614 EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Royce O. v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 2022001231 (2022) ("Because this is a termination case, the Agency's ability to terminate Complainant is an especially significant factor."); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120132731 (2014), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Pietsch v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120090933 (2009) ("Where an Agency's decision to stop the services of a worker results in his being terminated from his private employer, the Agency has <span class="Italic">de facto</span> removal authority."); <span class="Italic">Randolph v. Attorney General</span>, 0120110412 (2013) (agency controlled virtually every aspect of performance including right to terminate and complainant performed normal agency business--security during handling and transportation of detainees); <span class="Italic">Shorter v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120131148 (2013) (finding sufficient agency control where the agency had substantial input into the contractor's decision to terminate her employment, the work was performed on agency premises, the agency controlled many of the work assignments, and she had served fulltime at the agency for approximately two years); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A22997 (2003) (finding insufficient agency control over the contract employee where the contractor still retained ultimate supervisory and disciplinary control).</p>
<p class="noindent">An applicant for hire, through a staffing firm, had standing to bring a discrimination complaint in <span class="Italic">Detra W. v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 2020003147 (2021). In that case, the applicant had "final approval for onboarding" by the agency, but the offer was rescinded because the agency could not honor her reasonable accommodation request to telework. Noting that the agency had "significant input into the denial of Complainant's reasonable accommodation request" and "because this is a hiring case, control over hiring is an especially significant factor in making a determination on joint employment," the Commission found joint control.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission similarly found in <span class="Italic">Millicent H. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120171215 (2017), that the agency exercised <span class="Italic">de facto</span> power to terminate the complainant when it removed her access to sensitive compartmented information and the agency facility. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Regina M. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019001613 (2019) (finding <span class="Italic">de facto</span> power to terminate where agency management abolished the complainant's position when her productivity began to decline and, after the agency's supervisor voiced concerns about the complainant, the complainant's access to the agency site was removed); <span class="Italic">Kenneth M. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120161245 (2016) (in a termination case, finding especially significant that the agency had <span class="Italic">de facto</span> authority to terminate).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Nakesha T. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020003723 (2020), reminded that the power to terminate is not necessarily determinative. All evidence, to the extent it exists, must be considered. Though the Commission concluded in <span class="Italic">Nakesha T.</span> that the <span class="Italic">de facto</span> power to terminate was sufficient to establish joint employment, it also noted the agency's failure to fully develop the record:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the right to control, EEOC does not consider any one factor to be decisive and emphasizes that it is not necessary to satisfy a majority of the factors. In particular, the fact that an individual performs work pursuant to a contract between the federal government and an outside organization and is paid and provided with benefits by that organization, on its own, is not enough to show that joint employment does not exist. Rather, the analysis is holistic; all the circumstances in the individual's relationship with the agency should be considered to determine if the agency should be deemed the worker's joint employer. Enforcement Guidance, "Coverage Issues," at Qs. 1 and 2. In sum, a federal agency will qualify as a joint employer of an individual if it has the requisite right to control the means and manner of the individual's work, regardless of whether the individual is paid by an outside organization or is on the federal payroll. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., at Q. 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_195"></span>The Agency's EEO function did not make an organized effort to gather information relevant to whether the Agency had sufficient control over Complainant's job to be her common law joint employer, resulting in little information thereon. Nevertheless, there is sufficient information in the record to make a determination on this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant worked on Agency premises, and after her panic attack the Agency prohibited her from resuming to do so, preventing her from performing her duties. While Complainant indicated at EEO intake that she was still be employed by her staffing firm as referenced in the FAD, when she later filed her EEO complaint she wrote that she was effectively terminated by the Agency. Complainant confirmed on appeal that she was permanently laid off by the staffing firm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency had <span class="Italic">de facto</span> power to terminate Complainant, which it exercised. <span class="Italic">Millicent H. v. Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120171215 (June 22, 2017).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given this <span class="Italic">de facto</span> power, and the absence of any information that the staffing firm made an independent decision to terminate Complainant apart from the Agency prohibiting her from working on Agency premises, we conclude that the Agency had sufficient control over Complainant's employment to be her common law joint employer.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 05930454 (1994), the Commission found that a complainant employed by a contractor performing work at the Brown's Ferry Nuclear Plant, a government owned and operated facility, may be considered an "employee" of the agency for Title VII purposes where he alleged the agency denied him a security clearance and, as a result, the contractor terminated his employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The test for determining whether an individual is an "employee" under Title VII which the Commission discussed in <span class="Italic">Esther DaVeiga v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930201 (July 13, 1993) specifically provides for an examination of the economic realities. The court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The [economic realities] test requires the application of general agency law principles to established or undisputed facts. The court stated that the extent of the employer's right to control the "means and manner" of the worker's performance is the most important factor. Also considered are such factors as the kind of occupation, with reference to whether the work is usually performed under the direction of a supervisor or is performed by a specialist without supervision, the skill required in the occupation, whether the employer or the individual furnishes the equipment used and the place of work, the length of time the individual has worked, the method of payment, the manner in which the work relationship is terminated, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, by one or both parties, with or without notice and explanation, whether annual leave is afforded, whether the work performed is an integral part of the employer's business, whether the individual accumulates retirement benefits, whether the employer withholds taxes and/or pays social security benefits, and the intention of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See also Mares v. Marsh</span>, 777 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Garrett v. Phillips</span>, 721 F.2d 979 (1983). (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the most important factor to be considered in determining whether appellant was an "employee" of the agency is the extent to which the agency had a right to control, if appellant had been granted employment, his "means and manner" of performance. The record on this point is inconclusive to some degree as to whether appellant could be considered as an "employee" of the agency. Specifically, the evidence of record needs to be supplemented with pertinent information as to whether the agency or the contractor was directly responsible for establishing, for example, appellant's work schedule or reviewing his leave requests if he had been afforded employment as an Electrical Field Engineer within the agency's facility. Furthermore, the record contains limited information as to whether the agency paid appellant's social security taxes or whether appellant accumulated retirement benefits with the agency. Finally, the record does not show what role, if any, the agency had in the appellant's initial hiring and subsequent termination by the contractor. For the aforementioned reasons, we find that the agency's request fails to satisfy any of the criteria for reconsideration of the previous decision. The agency's request is therefore denied.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jordan</span>, the Commission further held that an agency cannot properly dismiss such a complaint until the record is sufficiently developed to make a factual determination on the complainant's status.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency reserving to itself the power to hire, terminate, discipline, and supervise the employee supported a finding of sufficient agency control in <span class="Italic">Stone v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01965608 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant submits a determination by the National Labor Relations Board, finding that appellant was an employee of the agency, and not an employee of the CANUS Corporation. The record also contains affidavits by the Director of Operations for the CANUS Corporation and by Person A, an Instrument Mechanic employed by the CANUS Corporation at the agency's Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. In particular, a review of the foregoing documents indicates that the agency hires and supervises the workers that it receives from CANUS. The agency has the authority to discipline, layoff, and terminate these workers. Further, the agency designates employee classifications and assignments, and sets shifts, hours, overtime, and time off. Although the CANUS Corporation issues paychecks to the workers it supplies to the agency, the base wage and benefit rates are based on the prevailing rates set by the agency and the Labor Council, comprising representatives from six major labor/trade unions. Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency had the right to control the means and manner of appellant's work performance. Therefore, with respect to allegations 1 through 4, appellant was an employee of the agency, and the agency's dismissal of those allegations for failure to state a claim was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency has the final word on whether the contractor hires an employee this constitutes sufficient control under Title VII. For example, in <span class="Italic">Baker v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A45313 (2006), the contractor was required to forward applications to the agency and the agency either approved or disapproved of the candidates. Combined with the fact that all work was performed on agency premises using agency equipment and supplies, this was sufficient to establish the agency as a joint employer with the contractor.</p>
<p class="noindent">Furthermore, the agency may be found to have sufficient control where the evidence suggests that the agency exercised <span class="Italic">de facto</span> power in the selection process. In <span class="Italic">Ward v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01954535 (1996), the Commission remanded the case for further development of the record to determine if the complainant was an applicant for employment where a contractor refused to hire her but the agency exerted considerable control over the selection process. Although the contractor made the final selection for the position, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> found there were substantial indications that the agency had sufficient control of the process to possibly be considered a proper defendant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether the agency's dismissal of allegation 1 was proper, it is necessary to determine whether appellant was an "applicant for employment" with the agency. The phrase "employee or applicant for employment" means only a federal employee or an applicant for federal employment. The phrase follows from similar language in Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC 2000e-16, on which the EEOC Regulations are based in part. Section 717's caption "Nondiscrimination in Federal Government Employment" indicates such a limitation, and courts have so held<span class="Italic">. Neves v. Kolaski</span>, 602 F. Supp. 645 (D.R.I. 1985); <span class="Italic">see also Mares v. March</span>, 777 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1985) (since Section 717 is a waiver of sovereign immunity, its coverage ought to be strictly construed to limit remedies to persons who are clearly under the control of the federal government).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has repeatedly held that the test for determining whether an individual may be deemed an employee or applicant for employment under Title VII is set forth in <span class="Italic">Spirides v. Reinhardt</span>, 613 F.2d 826, 831-32 (D.C. Cir. 1979)<span class="Italic">. DaVeiga v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930201 (July 13, 1993); <span class="Italic">Puri v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920107 (Mar. 5, 1992); <span class="Italic">Bendali v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910067 (Apr. 11, 1991). In <span class="Italic">Spirides</span>, the court indicted that such a determination involves an "analysis of the 'economic realities' of the work relationship," requiring an application of general agency law principles to all the facts and circumstances surrounding the work relationship. The court, however, emphasized that the most important factor to review was the "extent of the employer's right to control the 'means and manner' of the worker's performance." That is, an employer-employee relationship will be more likely to exist when "the employer has the right to control and direct the work of an individual, not only as to the result to be achieved, but also as to the details by which that result is achieved."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 831-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court, however, further indicated that consideration of all of the circumstances surrounding the work relationship is essential, and no one factor is determinative. 613 F.2d at 831-32. Thus, the court listed several other factors to be considered: 1) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether the work is usually done under the direction of a supervisor or done by a specialist without supervision; 2) the skill required in the particular occupation; 3) whether the "employer" or the worker furnishes the equipment used and the place of work; 4) the length of time the individual has worked; 5) the method of payment, whether by time or by the job; 6) the manner in which the work relationship is terminated, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, by one or both parties, with or without notice and explanation; 7) whether annual leave is afforded; 8) whether the work is an integral part of the business of the "employer"; 9) whether the worker accumulates retirement benefits; 10) whether the "employer" pays social security taxes; and 11) the intention of the parties<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 832.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In allegation 1 of the subject complaint, appellant alleged that he was subjected to discrimination when he was not selected for the position of Environmental Specialist at NADEP Pensacola. Here, the agency identified a position that needed to be filled at NADEP Pensacola, submitted a request and statement of work for the position, and reviewed and <span id="Page_196"></span>ranked candidates for the position in question, although the selection was actually made by MANCON. In dismissing allegation 1, the agency noted the following: MANCON controlled and approved leave requests, and supplied its own benefits; the individual in the position in question would not accrue benefits with the agency; and the individual in the position in question was issued a paycheck by MANCON, which also was responsible for social security payments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the present record, we find that we cannot determine whether appellant was an "applicant for federal employment." As previously noted, the most important factor to consider in determining whether appellant was an applicant for employment with the agency, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Spirides</span>, is the extent to which the agency had the right to control the "means and manner" of the performance of the individual in the position in question. While the record contains evidence pertaining to some of the <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> factors, we find, nonetheless, that the agency has not adequately investigated whether it controlled the "means and manner" of the performance of the individual in the position in question. We note that it is unclear from the record, and the agency does not address, the work situation of the individual in the position in question, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, whether the work performed by that individual is usually performed with supervision and the level of skill required, and who assigns work and reviews the performance of the individual in the position in question. Because we are unable to determine whether the agency controlled the "means and manner" of the individual in the position in question, we cannot determine whether appellant was an applicant for employment with the agency. Therefore, we shall remand this matter for a supplemental investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Angelica P. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120172789 (2018), the Commission found that the agency possessed sufficient control over the qualification requirements of the contractor employee, among other things, to be considered a joint employer:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency set the qualification requirements for her position, demanding at least 20 years of experience relevant to task order requirements, experience managing large complex multi-day, multi-hotel large conference events with at least 4,000 participants, and direct experience managing complex events with more than 1,000 scheduled activities over 3 to 4 days with at least 200 activities occurring simultaneously. Except where the person in Complainant's position committed a criminal act or violation of staffing firm policy, the staffing firm was not permitted to remove, divert, or replace her without notifying the Agency. The staffing firm was required to provide the Agency with a written detailed explanation for any circumstances necessitating substituting Complainant for approval by the Agency. Complainant works on Agency premises using Agency equipment. The hours of operation were set by contract between the staffing firm and the Agency Monday Friday, 8 <span class="small">AM</span> to 4:30 <span class="small">PM</span>, with alternate work schedules, as needed. Complainant wrote in her complaint that she that while spearheading the review of the "EMS" system, she provided daily in-depth reports of her findings and progress to her "direct supervisor," the Deputy Director of DAP (federal employee). The Agency did not dispute that these daily in-depth reports occurred, which suggests close review of Complainant's work. She further wrote in her complaint that the Director reported to her staffing firm that her team was not managing its time properly, and the EEO counselor wrote that the Director said that decision to remove Complainant as Team Lead was made in a conversation between the DAP Deputy Director and the staffing firm.</p>
<p class="noindent">In many situations, however, government agencies have a role in the administration of contracts issued to private employers. The fact that the federal agency plays some minor role in the hiring process does not necessarily amount to sufficient control of the employment situation to bring the claim within the ambit of Title VII. Where the private employer retains the authority to reject the agency's hiring recommendations, and also retains the authority to supervise, evaluate, and terminate the employee, sufficient agency control is not established. <span class="Italic">See Grosselfinger v. Agency for International Development</span>, 01921949 (1992). Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Mims v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A21925 (2002), the Commission found the complainant was not an agency employee where the agency made recommendations to the contractor concerning whom to retain, but the ultimate decision was reserved to the contractor.</p>
