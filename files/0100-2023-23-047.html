<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-47"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Nassau County School Board v. Arline</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Initially, the Supreme Court had interpreted the Rehabilitation Act broadly as demonstrated by <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline</span>, 480 U.S. 273, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed.2d 307 (1987)--a case repeatedly cited in with approval in the legislative history of the ADAAA, particularly in the "regarded as" amendment. Arline was an elementary school teacher who previously had tuberculosis in the late 1950s. In the late 1970s, she was discharged after having a third relapse within two years. The school board argued that it did not terminate Arline because of any diminished physical capacity, but because of the risk of contagion to others.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court found Arline was a "handicapped person" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, noting that the definition of "handicapped" was intended to be expansive and that the limiting feature of coverage was the requirement that the individual be "qualified." The Court in <span class="Italic">Arline</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1974 Congress expanded the definition of "handicapped individual" for use in section 504 to read as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[A]ny person who (i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment." 29 U.S.C. 706(7)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The amended definition reflected Congress' concern with protecting the handicapped against discrimination stemming not only from simple prejudice, but from "archaic attitudes and laws" and from "the fact that the American people are simply unfamiliar with and insensitive to the difficulties confront[ing] individuals with handicaps." S. Rep. No. 93-1297, p. 50 (1974). To combat the effects of erroneous but nevertheless prevalent perceptions about the handicapped, Congress expanded the definition of "handicapped individual" so as to preclude discrimination against "[a] person who has a record of, or is regarded as having, an impairment [but who] may at present have no actual incapacity at all." <span class="Italic">Southeastern Community College v. Davis</span>, 442 U.S. 397, 405-406, n.6 (1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a particular individual is handicapped as defined by the Act, the regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services are of significant assistance. As we have previously recognized, these regulations were drafted with the oversight and approval of Congress, <span class="Italic">see Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Darrone</span>, 465 U.S. 624, 634-635, and nn. 14-16 (1984); they provide "an important source of guidance on the meaning of section 504." <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Choate</span>, 469 U.S. 287, 304, n.24 (1985). The regulations are particularly significant here because they define two critical terms used in the statutory definition of handicapped individual. "Physical impairment" is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[A]ny physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine." 45 CFR 84.3(j)(2)(i) (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the regulations define "major life activities" as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." Section 84.3(j)(2)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within this statutory and regulatory framework, then, we must consider whether Arline can be considered a handicapped individual. According to the testimony of Dr. McEuen, Arline suffered tuberculosis "in an acute form in such a degree that it affected her respiratory system," and was hospitalized for this condition. App. 11. Arline thus had a physical impairment as that term is defined by the regulations, since she had a "physiological disorder or condition...affecting [her]...respiratory [system]." 45 CFR 84.3(j)(2)(i) (1985). This impairment was serious enough to require hospitalization, a fact more than sufficient to establish that one or more of her major life activities were substantially limited by her impairment. Thus, Arline's hospitalization for tuberculosis in 1957 suffices to establish that she has a "record of...impairment" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. 706(7)(B)(ii), and is therefore a handicapped individual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioners concede that a contagious disease may constitute a handicapping condition to the extent that it leaves a person with "diminished physical or mental capabilities," Brief for Petitioners 15, and concede that Arline's hospitalization for tuberculosis in 1957 demonstrates that she has a record of a physical impairment, <span class="Italic">see</span> Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-53. Petitioners maintain, however, Arline's record of impairment is irrelevant in this case, since the School Board dismissed Arline not because of her diminished physical capabilities, but because of the threat that her relapses of tuberculosis posed to the health of others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not agree with petitioners that, in defining a handicapped individual under section 504, the contagious effects of a disease can be meaningfully distinguished from the disease's physical effects on a claimant in a case such as this. Arline's contagiousness and her physical impairment each resulted from the same underlying condition, tuberculosis. It would be unfair to allow an employer to seize upon the distinction between the effects of a disease on others and the effects of a disease on a patient and use that distinction to justify discriminatory treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the legislative history of section 504 suggests that Congress intended such a result. That history demonstrates that Congress was as concerned about the effect of an impairment on others as it was about its <span id="Page_1141"></span>effect on the individual. Congress extended coverage, in 29 U.S.C. 706(7)(B)(iii), to those individuals who are simply "regarded as having" a physical or mental impairment. The Senate Report provides as an example of a person who would be covered under this subsection "a person with some kind of visible physical impairment which in fact does not substantially limit that person's functioning." S. Rep. No. 93-1297, p. 64 (1974). Such an impairment might not diminish a person's physical or mental capabilities, but could nevertheless substantially limit that person's ability to work as a result of the negative reactions of others to the impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Allowing discrimination based on the contagious effects of a physical impairment would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of section 504, which is to ensure that handicapped individuals are not denied jobs or other benefits because of the prejudiced attitudes or the ignorance of others. By amending the definition of "handicapped individual" to include not only those who are actually physically impaired, but also those who are regarded as impaired and who, as a result, are substantially limited in a major life activity, Congress acknowledged that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment. Few aspects of a handicap give rise to the same level of public fear and misapprehension as contagiousness. Even those who suffer or have recovered from such noninfectious diseases as epilepsy or cancer have faced discrimination based on the irrational fear that they might be contagious. The Act is carefully structured to replace such reflexive reactions to actual or perceived handicaps with actions based on reasoned and medically sound judgments: the definition of "handicapped individual" is broad, but only those individuals who are both handicapped and otherwise qualified are eligible for relief. The fact that some persons who have contagious diseases may pose a serious health threat to others under certain circumstances does not justify excluding from the coverage of the Act all persons with actual or perceived contagious diseases. Such exclusion would mean that those accused of being contagious would never have the opportunity to have their condition evaluated in light of medical evidence and a determination made as to whether they were "otherwise qualified." Rather, they would be vulnerable to discrimination on the basis of mythology--precisely the type of injury Congress sought to prevent. We conclude that the fact that a person with a record of a physical impairment is also contagious does not suffice to remove that person from coverage under section 504.</p>
<p class="noindent">In enacting the ADAAA, Congress has specifically redefined what it means to be regarded as having a disability. The new definition keeps the language of the original ADA to the extent that it defines disability, with respect to an individual, as "being regarded as having such an impairment," <span class="Italic">id.,</span> but qualifies the provision by referring to 42 USC 12102(3). That provision of the ADAAA states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;An individual meets the requirement of "being regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this Act because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;Paragraph (1)(C) shall not apply to impairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the new definition there is no requirement that the employer regard the individual as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Excluding transitory and minor impairments as defined by the ADAAA, an employer regards the individual as having a disability if it acts based on an actual or perceived impairment. Resolving a conflict in the courts, the Act further provides that an employer is not required to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee who is regarded as having a disability. 42 USC 12201(h).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission elaborated on the reasons behind its original regulations in 29 CFR 1630, app. at 1630.2(l):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rationale for the "regarded as" part of the definition of disability was articulated by the Supreme Court in the context of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline</span>, 480 U.S. 273 (1987). The Court noted that, although an individual may have an impairment that does not in fact substantially limit a major life activity, the reaction of others may prove just as disabling. "Such an impairment might not diminish a person's physical or mental capabilities, but could nevertheless substantially limit that person's ability to work as a result of the negative reactions of others to the impairment." 480 U.S. at 283. The Court concluded that by including "regarded as" in the Rehabilitation Act's definition, "Congress acknowledged that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and diseases are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment." 480 U.S. at 284.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual rejected from a job because of the "myths, fears and stereotypes" associated with disabilities would be covered under this part of the definition of disability, whether or not the employer's or other covered entity's perception were shared by others in the field and whether or not the individual's actual physical or mental condition would be considered a disability under the first or second part of this definition. As the legislative history notes, sociologists have identified common attitudinal barriers that frequently result in employers excluding individuals with disabilities. These include concerns regarding productivity, safety, insurance, liability, attendance, cost of accommodation and accessibility, workers' compensation costs, and acceptance by coworkers and customers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, if an individual can show that an employer or other covered entity made an employment decision because of a perception of disability based on "myth, fear or stereotype," the individual will satisfy the "regarded as" part of the definition of disability. If the employer cannot articulate a non-discriminatory reason for the employment action, an inference that the employer is acting on the basis of "myth, fear or stereotype" can be drawn.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem came to be with Commission's construction of the "perceived as" prong of the definition of a disability--a construction that was also adopted by the Supreme Court in cases such as <span class="Italic">Sutton, supra</span>, is that it permitted employers to discriminate against employees who were perceived as having impairments that did not rise to the level of being substantially limiting with impunity. For example, an employer who knew that an employee had a past history of being treated for mental illness could regard that employee as emotionally unstable and discharge him or her out of fear that the employee could become violent. As long as the employer did not regard the employee as being so emotionally unstable as to substantially limit a major life activity, the employee did not qualify for protection under the third prong of the definition of a disability. As a result, the employee would have had no standing to raise a claim under the ADA even though he or she had clearly been discharged as a result of the employer's perception of mental illness.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the "materially restricts" terminology referred to in the legislative history was not adopted in the final version of the ADAAA, the House Committee on Labor and Education underscored the congressional intent to return to the Court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Arline</span> in H.R. Rep. 110-730, Part I, at 12-14:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When considering whether an individual has been "regarded as having such an impairment," the Committee also rejects the Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>. The Supreme Court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline</span> was cited extensively in the 1990 committee report to the ADA, as it set forth a broad view of the third prong of the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Committee believes the Courts should rely on this standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While retaining the essential language contained in existing law, the Committee clarifies that an individual who is "regarded as having such an impairment" is not subject to the functional test (i.e., required to establish that the perceived or actual impairment "materially restricts" a major life activity) set forth in the first prong of the definition. The bill makes clear that an individual meets the requirement of "being regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under the Act because of an actual or perceived impairment, regardless of whether or not the impairment limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This clarification is necessary because the third prong incorporated the "substantial limitation" requirement from the first prong by reference. However, while the plain language used by Congress when it passed the ADA in 1990 incorporates this requirement, Congress did not expect or intend that this would be a difficult standard to meet. On the contrary, Congress intended and believed that the fact that an individual was discriminated against because of a perceived or actual impairment would be sufficient: "if a person is disqualified on the basis of an actual or perceived physical or mental condition, and the employer can articulate no legitimate job-related reason for the rejection, a perceived concern about employment of persons with disabilities could be inferred and the plaintiff would qualify for coverage under the 'regarded as' test."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This third, "regarded as" prong, was meant to express the Committee's understanding that unfounded concerns, mistaken beliefs, fear, myths, or prejudice about disabilities are often just as disabling as actual impairments, and its corresponding desire to prohibit discrimination founded on such perceptions. Early decisions under the ADA reflected this understanding, as did guidance from federal agencies like the Department of Justice. For example, in <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Happy Time Day Care Ctr</span>., the court rejected the argument that a day care center's refusal to enroll a child with HIV did not establish that they believed that his HIV infection was substantially limiting, and concluded that the child was protected under the "regarded as" prong because "defendants' misapprehensions and fears" about HIV infection were substantially limiting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In line with the Supreme Court's strict interpretation, however, the Court also increased the burden of proof required to establish that the impairment one is regarded as having is a substantially limiting one. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> the court found that disqualification from a single job is insufficient; individuals seeking coverage under the "regarded as" <span id="Page_1142"></span>standard must show that they were perceived as unable to perform a broad range of jobs utilizing the same skills. These restrictive rulings conflict with the Court's earlier recognition in <span class="Italic">Arline</span> that the negative reactions of others are just as disabling as the actual impact of an impairment, a conclusion endorsed by Congress when it adopted the "regarded as" prong.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Committee therefore restores Congress's original intent by making clear that an individual meets the requirement of "being regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual shows that an action (e.g., disqualification from a job, program, or service) was taken because of an actual or perceived impairment, whether or not that impairment actually limits or is believed to limit a major life activity. Because there is no functional limitation requirement under the "regarded as" prong of the definition, the requirement for proving substantial limitation of the major life activity of working under the first two prongs is not applicable to the analysis under the third prong, and EEOC regulations regarding the major life activity of working under the first two prongs are not impacted by this change. The Committee does not intend to convey that EEOC regulations regarding class of jobs/range of jobs under the first two prongs need to be revisited as a result of the clarification of third.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an individual can show that an entity covered by the Act thought that he or she had an impairment (whether or not he or she actually does), and as long as an individual's impairment is not transitory and minor, an individual will qualify for protection under the Act by showing that an entity covered by the Act thought subjected them to an action prohibited under the ADA (e.g., disqualification from a job, program, or service) as a result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the bill relieves entities covered under the ADA from the obligation and responsibility to provide reasonable accommodations and reasonable modifications to an individual who qualifies for coverage under the ADA solely by being "regarded as" disabled under the third prong of the definition of disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as with the other changes expanding coverage, the expansion of the regarded as provision does not mean that an agency cannot act on the basis of an impairment. Instead, it shifts to the agency the burden of demonstrating that any such action is job-related and consistent with business necessity. The Commission's new regulations at 29 CFR 1630.2(l) provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in &#x00A7; 1630.15(f), an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual is subjected to a prohibited action because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not that impairment substantially limits, or is perceived to substantially limit, a major life activity. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to refusal to hire, demotion, placement on involuntary leave, termination, exclusion for failure to meet a qualification standard, harassment, or denial of any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;Except as provided in &#x00A7; 1630.15(f), an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" any time a covered entity takes a prohibited action against the individual because of an actual or perceived impairment, even if the entity asserts, or may or does ultimately establish, a defense to such action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;Establishing that an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" does not, by itself, establish liability. Liability is established under title I of the ADA only when an individual proves that a covered entity discriminated on the basis of disability within the meaning of section 102 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12112.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the accompanying appendix section, the Commission emphasizes that a major purpose of the third prong was to protect individuals from the "unfounded concerns, mistaken beliefs, fears, myths or prejudices" about individuals with disabilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Coverage under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability should not be difficult to establish. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 House Judiciary <span id="Page_1143"></span>Committee Report at 17 (explaining that Congress never expected or intended it would be a difficult standard to meet). Under the third prong of the definition of disability, an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual is subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not "transitory and minor."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This third prong of the definition of disability was originally intended to express Congress's understanding that "unfounded concerns, mistaken beliefs, fears, myths, or prejudice about disabilities are often just as disabling as actual impairments, and [its] corresponding desire to prohibit discrimination founded on such perceptions." 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9; 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 17 (same). In passing the original ADA, Congress relied extensively on the reasoning of <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline</span> "that the negative reactions of others are just as disabling as the actual impact of an impairment." 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9. The ADAAA reiterates Congress's reliance on the broad views enunciated in that decision, and Congress "believe[s] that courts should continue to rely on this standard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the ADA Amendments Act broadened the application of the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability. 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9-10. In doing so, Congress rejected court decisions that had required an individual to establish that a covered entity perceived him or her to have an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. This provision is designed to restore Congress's intent to allow individuals to establish coverage under the "regarded as" prong by showing that they were treated adversely because of an impairment, without having to establish the covered entity's beliefs concerning the severity of the impairment. Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus it is not necessary, as it was prior to the ADA Amendments Act, for an individual to demonstrate that a covered entity perceived him as substantially limited in the ability to perform a major life activity in order for the individual to establish that he or she is covered under the "regarded as" prong. Nor is it necessary to demonstrate that the impairment relied on by a covered entity is (in the case of an actual impairment) or would be (in the case of a perceived impairment) substantially limiting for an individual to be "regarded as having such an impairment." In short, to qualify for coverage under the "regarded as" prong, an individual is not subject to any functional test. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 13 ("The functional limitation imposed by an impairment is irrelevant to the third 'regarded as' prong."); 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 17 (that is, "the individual is not required to show that the perceived impairment limits performance of a major life activity"). The concepts of "major life activities" and "substantial limitation" simply are not relevant in evaluating whether an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To illustrate how straightforward application of the "regarded as" prong is, if an employer refused to hire an applicant because of skin graft scars, the employer has regarded the applicant as an individual with a disability. Similarly, if an employer terminates an employee because he has cancer, the employer has regarded the employee as an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A "prohibited action" under the "regarded as" prong refers to an action of the type that would be unlawful under the ADA (but for any defenses to liability). Such prohibited actions include, but are not limited to, refusal to hire, demotion, placement on involuntary leave, termination, exclusion for failure to meet a qualification standard, harassment, or denial of any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an employer bases a prohibited employment action on an actual or perceived impairment that is not "transitory and minor," the employer regards the individual as disabled, whether or not myths, fears, or stereotypes about disability motivated the employer's decision. Establishing that an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" does not, by itself, establish liability. Liability is established only if an individual meets the burden of proving that the covered entity discriminated unlawfully within the meaning of section 102 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12112.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether a covered entity can ultimately establish a defense to liability is an inquiry separate from, and follows after, a determination that an individual was regarded as having a disability. Thus, for example, an employer who terminates an employee with angina from a manufacturing job that requires the employee to work around machinery, believing that the employee will pose a safety risk to himself or others if he were suddenly to lose consciousness, has regarded the individual as disabled. Whether the employer has a defense (e.g., that the employee posed a direct threat to himself or coworkers) is a separate inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the "regarded as" prong requires proof of causation in order to show that a person is covered does not mean that proving a "regarded as" claim is complex. While a person must show, for both coverage under the "regarded as" prong and for ultimate liability, that he or she was subjected to a prohibited action because of an actual or perceived impairment, this showing need only be made once. Thus, evidence that a covered entity took a prohibited action because of an impairment will establish coverage and will be relevant in establishing liability, although liability may ultimately turn on whether the covered entity can establish a defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As prescribed in the ADA Amendments Act, the regulations provide an exception to coverage under the "regarded as" prong where the impairment on which a prohibited action is based is both transitory (having an actual or expected duration of six months or less) and minor. The regulations make clear (at &#x00A7; 1630.2(l)(2) and &#x00A7; 1630.15(f)) that this exception is a defense to a claim of discrimination. "Providing this exception responds to concerns raised by employer organizations and is reasonable under the 'regarded as' prong of the definition because individuals seeking coverage under this prong need not meet the functional limitation requirement contained in the first two prongs of the definition." 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 10; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span id="Page_1144"></span>2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 18 (explaining that "absent this exception, the third prong of the definition would have covered individuals who are regarded as having common ailments like the cold or flu, and this exception responds to concerns raised by members of the business community regarding potential abuse of this provision and misapplication of resources on individuals with minor ailments that last only a short period of time"). However, as an exception to the general rule for broad coverage under the "regarded as" prong, this limitation on coverage should be construed narrowly. 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 18.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relevant inquiry is whether the actual or perceived impairment on which the employer's action was based is objectively "transitory and minor," not whether the employer claims it subjectively believed the impairment was transitory and minor. For example, an employer who terminates an employee whom it believes has bipolar disorder cannot take advantage of this exception by asserting that it believed the employee's impairment was transitory and minor, since bipolar disorder is not objectively transitory and minor. At the same time, an employer that terminated an employee with an objectively "transitory and minor" hand wound, mistakenly believing it to be symptomatic of HIV infection, will nevertheless have "regarded" the employee as an individual with a disability, since the covered entity took a prohibited employment action based on a perceived impairment (HIV infection) that is not "transitory and minor."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual covered only under the "regarded as" prong is not entitled to reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. 12201(h). Thus, in cases where reasonable accommodation is not at issue, the third prong provides a more straightforward framework for analyzing whether discrimination occurred. As Congress observed in enacting the ADAAA: "[W]e expect [the first] prong of the definition to be used only by people who are affirmatively seeking reasonable accommodations or modifications. Any individual who has been discriminated against because of an impairment--short of being granted a reasonable accommodation or modification--should be bringing a claim under the third prong of the definition which will require no showing with regard to the severity of his or her impairment." Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 6.</p>
<p class="noindent">The new ADAAA provision, along with the Commission's new regulations, is aimed directly at <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> and its holding that the plaintiffs in that case were not regarded as individuals with disabilities because United Airlines only viewed their impairment as disqualifying them from holding the position of global airline pilot and not from a class of jobs or broad range of jobs across various classes.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Seventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">Shell v. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway</span>, 941 F. 3d 331 (7th Cir. 2019), held that "'regarded as'...plainly encompasses only current impairments, not future ones." The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Shell</span> was offered a safety-sensitive position contingent on passing a physical evaluation. The company's policy forbid hiring candidates with a body mass index of 40 or more because those individuals were considered to have "class III obesity" and were "at a substantially higher risk of developing certain conditions like sleep apnea, diabetes and heart disease and the unpredictable onset of those conditions can result in sudden incapacitation." Shell maintained that the Railway discriminated against him on the basis of a perceived disability. The Railway defended that Shell did not have a qualifying disability based on obesity and "no evidence suggested that [the Railway] regarded him as presently having such an impairment." The Seventh Circuit agreed. The case turned on the fact that the Railway's decision was based on impairments that Shell might develop in the future, not impairments that the Railway thought Shell suffered:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time this case was before the district court, Shell had an argument that his obesity qualifies as a physical impairment and thus a "disability" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 12101(1)(A). If that were true, the undisputed facts would support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination because Shell's weight motivated BNSF's decision not to hire him. But our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Chicago Transit Authority</span>, 926 F.3d 881 (7th Cir. 2019) foreclosed that argument for Shell. We held that obesity alone is not a physical impairment under the ADA unless accompanied by evidence that the obesity is caused by an underlying physiological disorder or condition, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 888, and Shell presented no such evidence to the district court. Nor does Shell point to any evidence that BNSF regarded his obesity as having a physiological origin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Shell instead bases his disability claim on those medical conditions that BNSF feared he would develop--sleep apnea, diabetes, and heart disease--which undisputedly qualify as impairments under the statute. The wrinkle, though, is that he did not have those impairments at the time he applied to work for BNSF, and the company held no perception to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Shell spends much of his brief arguing that by refusing to hire him based on the risk of future impairment, BNSF has treated him as if he has the impairments now. That position relies on an assumption that even if BNSF knew that Shell did not currently have the impairments, treating him as if he did would constitute a disability. That view is mistaken. <span class="Italic">See Silk v. Bd. of Trs., Moraine Valley Cmty. Coll</span>., Dist. No. 524, 795 F.3d 698, 706 (7th Cir. 2015) ("In satisfying the 'regarded as' prong, Silk must show that the College perceived him as having an impairment."). The evidence is clear that BNSF did not believe that Shell had any of the feared impairments when it refused his application. Dr. Jarrad submitted a declaration saying that when he made his decision, he did not understand Shell to have one of those impairments. And when BNSF echoed the same in its statement of material facts, Shell's response pointed to no evidence to controvert that fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All of this narrows and lends precision to the question before us: whether the ADA's "regarded as" prong covers a situation where an employer views an applicant as at risk for developing a qualifying impairment in the future. We hold that it does not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find our answer in the first (and usually final) stop for statutory questions--the text. The ADA's "regarded as" prong defines "disability" as "being regarded as having [a physical or mental] impairment." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(C). It is written in the passive voice, resulting in some of the attendant clumsiness that English teachers warn of. Even so, the text plainly encompasses only current impairments, not future ones. The key word is "having," and the EEOC and BNSF quarrel over whether it is a gerund or a present participle. Labels aside, no one would understand the sentence, "Shell is being regarded as having sleep apnea," to mean anything other than Shell is viewed today as currently suffering from sleep apnea. "Having" means presently and continuously. It does not include something in the past that has ended or something yet to come. To settle the technical debate, it is a present participle, used to form a progressive tense. <span class="Italic">See</span> Bryan a Garner, <span class="small">GARNER'S MODERN AMERICAN USAGE</span> 1020 (4th ed. 2016) (defining "present participle" as "[a] nonfinite verb form ending in--ing and used in verb phrases to signal the progressive aspect").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This reading is definitively reinforced by the ADA's specific definition of "being regarded as having such an impairment" in paragraph 3, which is when "he or she has been subjected to an action...because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(3)(A). If the impairment does not yet exist, it can be neither actual nor perceived.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC points to the Dictionary Act's command that "unless the context indicates otherwise...words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present." 1 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1. The Dictionary Act adds little, however, because its general instruction cannot overcome the plain meaning of the ADA's statutory text. Put another way, the "context [that] indicates otherwise" here comes from the ordinary import of the language Congress employed in &#x00A7; 12102(1)(C) and &#x00A7; 12102(3)(A) of the ADA. <span class="Italic">See Rowland v. Cal. Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council</span>, 506 U.S. 194, 199 (1993) ("'Context' here means the text of the Act of Congress surrounding the word at issue...and this is simply an instance of the word's ordinary meaning."); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. STME, LLC</span>, 938 F.3d 1305, 1317 (11th Cir. 2019) ("While it is true that the phrase 'being regarded as having such an impairment' contains present tense verbs, the ADA's plain language and context indicates that the Dictionary Act does not apply here as the EEOC suggests.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find ourselves in good company with this reading of the ADA's text. In <span class="Italic">Morriss v. BNSF Railway Company</span>, 817 F.3d 1104, 1113 (8th Cir. 2016), the Eighth Circuit came to the same conclusion on similar facts. BNSF denied Melvin Morriss's job application for the same reason it denied Shell's--his BMI was over 40. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1106. Morriss, like Shell, argued that BNSF's refusal to hire him based on the risk that he would develop certain medical conditions in the future meant that the company perceived him as having a current physical impairment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1113. The Eighth Circuit explained that "the plain language of the ADA prohibits actions based on an existing impairment or the perception of an existing impairment" but "[t]he ADA does not prohibit discrimination based on a perception that a physical characteristic--as opposed to a physical impairment--may eventually lead to a physical impairment as defined under the Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All other circuits that have confronted the issue agree. <span class="Italic">See STME</span>, 938 F.3d at 1315 ("[T]he disability definition in the ADA does not cover this case where an employer perceives a person to be presently healthy with only a potential to become ill and disabled in the future."); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. BNSF Ry. Co</span>., 902 F.3d 916, 923 (9th Cir. 2018) (noting that the parties agreed "BNSF must have regarded [the employee] as having a current impairment," a reading that "comports...with the statutory text, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of an 'actual or perceived impairment' in the present tense"); <span class="Italic">see also Adair v. City of Muskogee</span>, 823 F.3d 1297, 1306 (10th Cir. 2016) (stating that the employer must have "perceived the impairment at the time of the alleged discriminatory action").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With only proof that BNSF refused to hire him because of a fear that he would one day develop an impairment, Shell has not established that the company regarded him as having a disability or that he is otherwise disabled. Absent this showing, he cannot prevail on his claim of discrimination, and BNSF is entitled to summary judgment.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC advances two other arguments in favor of its contrary reading of the ADA's text. First, the agency points to its Compliance Manual, which provides this example:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">CP's genetic profile reveals an increased susceptibility to colon cancer. CP is currently asymptomatic and may never in fact develop colon cancer. After making CP a conditional offer of employment, R learns about CP's increased susceptibility to colon cancer. R then withdraws the job offer because of concerns about matters such as CP's productivity, insurance costs, and attendance. R is treating CP as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Accordingly, CP is covered by the third part of the definition of "disability."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Compl. Man. &#x00A7; 902.8, 2009 WL 4782113. Though at first blush this example seems to support the agency's contention that future impairments are covered, other agency guidance muddies the water. Foremost, the EEOC's Interpretative Guidance says the definition of "impairment" does not include "characteristic predisposition to illness or disease." 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. &#x00A7; 1630.2(h). If the impairment is susceptibility to colon cancer, then the Compliance Manual contradicts the Interpretive Guidance's statement that a predisposition is not an impairment. And if the impairment is colon cancer itself, the Compliance Manual contains no explanation for why the withdrawal of a job offer based on the applicant's susceptibility to colon cancer is the same thing as treating him as if he now has colon cancer. The Compliance Manual's genetic profiling example is unmoored from the ADA's text and in tension with other EEOC interpretative guidance, so it lacks the power to persuade us away from the statute's unambiguous text.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the EEOC invokes the ADA's purpose, part of which is to combat "society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease." <span class="Italic">Sch. Bd. of Nassau County, Fla. v. Arline</span>, 480 U.S. 273, 284 (1987). But to the extent BNSF's BMI policy reflects a stereotype, it is one about obesity, and Shell's obesity--lacking evidence of a physiological cause--is not a disability that the ADA protects. <span class="Italic">See Richardson</span>, 926 F.3d at 888. While Congress did direct that "[t]he definition of disability...shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals," 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(4)(A), the mandate does not give us license to go beyond the terms of the statute. <span class="Italic">See New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira</span>, 139 S. Ct. 532, 543 (2019) ("If courts felt free to pave over bumpy statutory texts in the name of more expeditiously advancing a policy goal, we would risk failing to 'take account' of legislative compromises essential to a law's passage and, in that way, thwart rather than honor 'the effectuation of congressional intent.'"). We cannot decide the question presented based on broad statutory purposes where the answer is supplied by the statute's plain language.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Shell</span> case turned on the argument that the employer did not regard him as presently having an impairment. Where, however, the employer regards or perceives the complainant as having a present disability and takes an adverse action against the complainant for that reason, liability is likely to result. <span class="Italic">See Irvin W. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019002667 (2020) ("Complainant's obesity is a basis to perceive him as having a disability. The Commission has determined that complainants have been discriminated against based on obesity and related conditions when they suffered adverse employment actions because their employers regarded them as substantially limited in a major life activity.")</p>
