<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-52"><span id="Page_375"></span><span class="space">c.</span> Reasonableness Standard and Good Faith Compliance</h5>
<p class="noindent">However, as a general proposition, an agency's agreement to provide the complainant with a specific position does not insulate the complainant from subsequent events having an effect on his or her work assignment. Where a settlement agreement is silent about the length of time an agency must place an appellant in a position, the Commission will apply a reasonableness standard. In <span class="Italic">Allen v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956930 (1997), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that a settlement agreement that places a complainant into a specific position, without defining the length of service or other elements of the employment relationship, will not be interpreted to require the agency to employ the complainant in the identical job specified forever<span class="Italic">. See Parker v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910576 (August 29, 1991); <span class="Italic">Papac v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910808 (December 12, 1991). Here, appellant was apparently placed in a position as an Industrial Engineer, Senior, EAS-21, no later than July 1, 1993. Appellant and the agency dispute whether the additional duties assigned to appellant and the change in appellant reporting to the Airport Mail Center rather than Processing and Distribution constitute a reassignment. Regardless of whether a reassignment was effected, the settlement agreement does not contain a provision prohibiting reassignments. The "reassignment" did not occur until more than two years after the settlement agreement was executed. Because the agency adhered to the stated terms of the agreement, we find that appellant has not demonstrated a breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Postmaster General</span>, 01970474 (1997), the Commission found there was no breach of a settlement agreement where the complainant held the position specified in the agreement for six years and was ultimately reassigned as the result of an agency restructuring. The agency's compliance with the settlement agreement for five years along with several noted changes in circumstances since its signing constituted a reasonable amount of time in <span class="Italic">Brenton W. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120171245 (2017). Finding no breach, the Commission noted that "a managerial decision to change existing standards in a way that conflicts with a pre-existing settlement agreement is not necessarily a breach once a reasonable amount of time after the execution of a settlement agreement has passed." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brenton W</span>. further counseled the complainant that, because his complaint concerned "an aged settlement agreement," his breach allegations should be considered subsequent acts of discrimination and processed as separate complaints. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A22268 (2002); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01995118 (2001); <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01976247 (1998); section on "<a href="0100-2023-14-090.html#sec5-90">Subsequent Acts</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072219 (2008), the Commission found that the agency had not breached a settlement agreement providing the complainant with reasonable accommodation for her observance of the Sabbath where it had complied with the agreement for 16 years after its execution and the complainant had since transferred to a different facility with different work demands. The Commission did note, however, that the complainant may have new claim for failure to accommodate her religious practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency removes a complainant from a position granted in settlement, the question for the Commission is whether the agency has exhibited "good faith compliance" with the terms of the agreement. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Thorton-Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110779 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that where, as here, an individual bargains for a position without any specific terms as to the length of service, the reasonable intentions of the parties should not be interpreted to include retention in that exact position ad infinitum. <span class="Italic">Papac v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910808 (December 12, 1991); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910576 (August 30, 1991). Rather, when the Agency initially places the individual in the position bargained for, and subsequently reassigns the person from the position, the issue is whether there was good faith compliance with the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Elliot v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950615 (December 13, 1995). In the instant matter, we find good faith compliance by the Agency. The Agency placed Complainant in the lobby director position in 2007 as promised in the agreement, and retained her in that position for over two years. Agency witnesses have adequately explained why, in late 2009, the decision was made to remove Complainant from the position and search for another available position within her medical restrictions. The Agency was not responsible for the decline in work load that resulted in the excessing of clerks, who had retreat rights to certain positions under the relevant collective bargaining agreement. There is no need for this Commission to address the parties' arguments about their respective rights and responsibilities under the collective bargaining agreement. Rather, the placement and retention of Complainant for over two years in the position bargained for, as well as the explanation for her reassignment in 2009, evidences the necessary good faith compliance by the Agency with the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where the settlement agreement provided the complainant with a "permanent change of station" to Hawaii, the Commission found this did not preclude later developments that could change the agency's commitment, though it did leave the complainant with the option of accepting the agreement as modified by later circumstances of returning to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and having his complaint reinstated. In <span class="Italic">Outlaw v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0520100395 (2010), the Commission affirmed its earlier ruling that a transfer of the complainant to Arizona some two and a half years after the agreement was signed was a violation of the agreement, but also found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our prior decision, based on the information before us at the time, the Commission found that the agreement required that the reassignment "will constitute a <span class="Italic">permanent</span> change of station (PCS) move for the Complainant" (emphasis added). Consequently, relying upon the plain meaning of "permanent," the Commission found that the Agency's decision to move Complainant's position to Arizona violated the settlement. However, as noted above, the Agency contends that "permanent change of station" is a term that differs in meaning from simply the word "permanent" viewed in isolation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the Agency declarations provided in their request, the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), and prior Commission decisions reveal that the term "permanent change of station" or "PSC," does not denote an everlasting assignment. Instead, the term is used during the move or detail of an employee to a new location or in returning to an old location. Commission cases have not expressly defined PSC. However, the circumstances wherein the term has been used reflects the absence of lasting location. <span class="Italic">See John W. Bush v. Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01932547 (Feb 7, 1994) (in expressing concern over the complainant's selection for a position, the Agency official noted that the complainant had left for Fort Rucker in March 1990, "and that the Joint Travel Regulation, Volume II, Chapter C4100, states 'that it is neither cost effective nor efficient to provide more than one PCS [Permanent Change of Station] move during any 12 month period.' Noting that appellant had had a PCS move six months earlier, she stated that he would have to meet the following criteria in order to qualify for a second PCS....") Based on this clearer understanding of the terms of the settlement agreement, we modify our previous decision and do not find that the April 2007 settlement agreement entitled Complainant to an unending assignment at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, while the settlement agreement did not did not obligate the Agency to locate Complainant at the Schofield Barracks indefinitely, it is silent as to the timeframe and, therefore, subject to interpretation. We do not conclude that either party has provided adequate grounds for reversing our previous decision's ultimate conclusion that the Agency's October 1, 2009 order, directing Complainant to report for duty to Yuma Proving Ground in Yuma, Arizona, violated the April 2007 settlement. We also find continuing support for our previous finding that all four Liaison Officer positions in Hawaii were moved to Arizona, and no longer existed in Hawaii. While Complainant argues that the other three individuals encumbering those positions did not move to Arizona, it appears they took other jobs in different parts of the country. Therefore, we affirm our previous decision that specific performance of that portion of the agreement is no longer viable and Complainant may either accept this revision to the agreement or return to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and reinstate his underlying complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Bertram K. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2019005506 (2020), the Commission excused an agency's sporadic breaches where the agreement had been in place and substantially complied with for more than 12 years. In 2006, the complainant and agency entered into an agreement that any denials of the complainant's religious accommodation requests would receive a second review. The complainant alleged various incidents of breach. Given the "temporal context" of the settlement, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bertram K</span>., excused the agency's few failures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, therefore, that all these incidents were timely raised as a breach claim, we find no breach. This breach claim must be put in a temporal context. The subject settlement agreement was executed in February 2006. In December 2018, Complainant alleged breach. Therefore, as the Agency has noted, over twelve years had elapsed, wherein the Agency purportedly met its obligations regarding the "second review" reasonable accommodation request issue identified in Provision 7. If, commencing in 2017, it sporadically was incapable of providing with Provision 7, due to the private company scheduling of night shift work on Fridays over which the Agency had no control, the Agency has explained that staffing needs may have led to occasional deviation from its obligations under this provision. Even though we find no breach, we urge the Agency to continue its efforts to adhere to providing second reviews to the religious accommodation requests in the future, as it has done for over a decade.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_376"></span>However, in <span class="Italic">Verdell A. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120152922 (2016), the Commission found bad faith on the part of the agency where the agreement provided that complainant would be transferred to another office in order to avoid contact with certain supervisors, but was silent as to the length of the agreement. Two and a half months later, due to a reorganization, the same supervisors were reassigned to the complainant's new office in supervisory roles. Finding that the agency knew or should have known of the impending reorganization at the time the agreement was reached, the Commission found breach:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an individual bargains for a position, without any specific terms as to the length of service, the Commission has held that it would be improper to interpret the reasonable intentions of the parties to include employment in that exact position forever. <span class="Italic">Holley v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950842 (Nov. 13, 1997). In the absence of a specific time frame in a settlement agreement, it is interpreted to be for a reasonable amount of time. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910576 (Aug. 29, 1991); <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930921 (Feb. 10, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Commission has found that bad faith in negotiating and implementing a settlement agreement constitutes a breach. <span class="Italic">Todd v. Soc. Security Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950169 (June 12, 1997); <span class="Italic">Suter v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120093523 (October 19, 2010) (finding the Agency negotiated in bad faith when, per a settlement agreement, it placed Complainant into a specific building management position, after failing to disclose in negotiations that the building where the position was located was scheduled to close in six months); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Nat'l Endowment for the Arts</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120133264 (Feb. 4, 2014) (finding the Agency negotiated in bad faith when Complainant's manager, a party to the negotiations, made promises of specific performance even though he likely knew that he would not have to fulfill them because Complainant would be terminated two weeks later, purportedly for unsuccessful work performance).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant worked in her new position for approximately two and a half months before learning that S1 and S2 would be transferred to the same office to supervisory roles. The record supports that: the parties to the negotiation were aware that Complainant's only purpose in entering the Agreement was to leave the chain of command of S1 and S2. Based on the reasonable intentions of the parties, we do not interpret two and a half months to be a reasonable amount of time to satisfy the Agreement. Moreover, given the timing and the extent of the organizational changes in the directive, the Agency likely knew or should have known at the time of the negotiation that the possibility existed for S1 and S2 to be transferred to Complainant's new office. Thus, the Agency is in breach because it acted in bad faith during settlement negotiations when it failed to disclose the upcoming organizational changes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the parties' intent in entering the Agreement was for Complainant not to be supervised by S1 and S2. As Complainant requested specific performance, in order to comply with the Agreement, the Agency must provide Complainant with the option of lateral reassignment per our Order below when (and if) S1 and S2 assume supervisory positions within the same office as Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also Davina W. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 2022003512 (2022) ("We find the two-week time frame sufficient to infer that the Agency knew, or should have known, that Former Supervisor would be reassigned to the 11th floor during negotiations.").</p>
