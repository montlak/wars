<h2 class="h2" id="sec11-3"><span class="space">II.</span> THE <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">WARDS COVE</span></span> CASE</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Griggs</span> remained intact for the next 18 years. In 1989, a sharply divided Supreme Court held that once employees show that a facially neutral practice has an adverse impact on a protected group, the burden that shifts to the employer to substantiate that practice is only the burden of production. The assault on <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> began with <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed.2d 827 (1988). The next year, the Court, with four justices dissenting, held that the employees always retain the burden of persuasion in an adverse impact case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 490 U.S. 642, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 104 L. Ed.2d 733 (1989). The Court also set down more stringent requirements for plaintiffs to meet in demonstrating that an employment practice in fact has an adverse impact.</p>
<p class="noindent">The opinion of the Court was written by Justice White and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy. <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> involved the employment practices of a salmon cannery. So-called "cannery jobs," which did not require skilled labor, were filled predominantly by nonwhites. "Noncannery jobs," which required skilled labor, were filled by predominantly white workers. The work, dependent upon the year's salmon run, was mostly seasonal. The cannery and noncannery workers lived in separate dormitories and ate in separate mess halls.</p>
<p class="noindent">The cannery workers brought suit under Title VII, alleging that employment practices, such as nepotism, a rehiring preference, lack of objective hiring criteria, and separate hiring channels for cannery and noncannery workers, resulted in a racial stratification of the work force. The plaintiffs pressed both disparate treatment and adverse impact claims. In support of those claims, the plaintiffs introduced evidence which clearly demonstrated that a majority of the cannery workers were nonwhite, while a majority of noncannery workers were white.</p>
<p class="noindent">The case had a long and convoluted history on its way to the Supreme Court. Essentially, the courts below rejected plaintiffs' disparate treatment claims. Eventually, the Ninth Circuit, <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, remanded the case to the district court on the adverse impact claims, holding that it was the employer's burden to prove that any disparate impact created by its hiring practices was justified by business necessity. The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> and reversed the Ninth Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 2121-23, the Court first addressed the sufficiency of plaintiffs' evidence in establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of adverse impact:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In holding that respondents had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact, the Court of Appeals relied solely on respondents' statistics showing a high percentage of nonwhite workers in the cannery jobs and a low percentage of such workers in the noncannery positions. Although statistical proof can alone make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 339, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 1856, 52 L. Ed.2d 396 (1977); <span class="Italic">Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States</span>, 433 U.S. 299, 307-308, 97 S. Ct. 2736, 2741-2742, 53 L. Ed.2d 768 (1977), the Court of Appeals' ruling here misapprehends our precedents and the purposes of Title VII. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"There can be no doubt," as there was when a similar mistaken analysis had been undertaken by the courts below in <span class="Italic">Hazelwood</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 308, 97 S. Ct., at 2741, "that the. . .comparison. . .fundamentally misconceived the role of statistics in employment discrimination cases." The "proper comparison [is] between the racial composition of [the at-issue jobs] and the racial composition of the qualified. . .population in the relevant labor market." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. It is such a comparison--between the racial composition of the qualified persons in the labor market and the persons holding at-issue jobs--that generally forms the proper basis for the initial inquiry in a disparate-impact case. Alternatively, in cases where such labor market statistics will be difficult if not impossible to ascertain, we have recognized that certain other statistics--such as measures indicating the racial composition of "otherwise-qualified applicants" for at-issue jobs--are equally probative for this purpose. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer</span>, 440 U.S. 568, 585, 99 S. Ct. 1355, 1366, 59 L. Ed.2d 587 (1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear to us that the Court of Appeals' acceptance of the comparison between the racial composition of the cannery work force and that of the noncannery work force, as probative of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact in the selection of the latter group of workers, was flawed for several reasons. Most obviously, with respect to the skilled noncannery jobs at issue here, the cannery work force in no way reflected "the pool of qualified job applicants" or the "qualified population in the labor force." Measuring alleged discrimination in the selection of accountants, managers, boat captains, electricians, doctors, and engineers--and the long list of other "skilled" noncannery positions found to exist by the District Court. . .by comparing the number of nonwhites occupying these jobs to the number of nonwhites filling cannery worker positions is nonsensical. If the absence of minorities holding such skilled positions is due to a dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants (for reasons that are not petitioners' fault), selection methods or employment practices cannot be said to have had a "disparate impact" on nonwhites.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One example illustrates why this must be so. Respondents' own statistics concerning the noncannery work force at one of the canneries at issue here indicate that approximately 17% of the new hires for medical jobs, and 15% of the new hires for officer worker positions, were nonwhite. . . . If it were the case that less than 15 to 17% of the applicants for these jobs were nonwhite and that nonwhites made up a lower percentage of the relevant qualified labor market, it is hard to see how respondents, without more, <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Connecticut v. Teal</span>, 457 U.S. 440, 102 S. Ct. 2525, 73 L. Ed.2d 130 (1982), would have made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact. Yet, <span id="Page_779"></span>under the Court of Appeals' theory, simply because nonwhites comprise 52% of the cannery workers at the cannery in question,. . .respondents would be successful in establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of racial discrimination under Title VII. Such a result cannot be squared with our cases or with the goals behind the statute. The Court of Appeals' theory, at the very least, would mean that any employer who had a segment of his work force that was--for some reason--racially imbalanced, could be hailed into court and forced to engage in the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the "business necessity" of the methods used to select the other members of his work force. The only practicable option for many employers would be to adopt racial quotas, insuring that no portion of their work forces deviated in racial composition from the other portions thereof; this is a result that Congress expressly rejected in drafting Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC s 2000e-2(j); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. at 922-994, and n.2, 108 S. Ct., at ___, and n.2 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). The Court of Appeals' theory would "leave the employer little choice. . .but to engage in a subjective quota system of employment selection. This, of course, is far from the intent of Title VII." <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 449, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 2387, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975) (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals also erred with respect to the unskilled noncannery positions. Racial imbalance in one segment of an employer's work force does not, without more, establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact with respect to the selection of workers for the employer's other positions, even where workers for the different positions may have somewhat fungible skills (as is arguably the case for cannery and unskilled noncannery workers). As long as there are no barriers or practices deterring qualified nonwhites from applying for noncannery positions,. . .if the percentage of selected applicants who are nonwhite is not significantly less than the percentage of qualified applicants who are nonwhite, the employer's selection mechanism probably does not operate with a disparate impact on minorities. Where this is the case, the percentage of nonwhite workers found in other positions in the employer's labor force is irrelevant to the question of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> statistical case of disparate impact. As noted above, a contrary ruling on this point would almost inexorably lead to the use of numerical quotas in the workplace, a result that Congress and this Court have rejected repeatedly in the past.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The peculiar facts of this case further illustrate why a comparison between the percentage of nonwhite cannery workers and nonwhite noncannery workers is an improper basis for making out a claim of disparate impact. Here, the District Court found that nonwhites were "overrepresent[ed]" among cannery workers because petitioners had contracted with a predominantly nonwhite union (local 37) to fill these positions. . . . As a result, if petitioners (for some permissible reason) ceased using local 37 as its hiring channel for cannery positions, it appears (according to the District Court's findings) that the racial stratification between the cannery and noncannery workers might diminish to statistical insignificance. Under the Court of Appeals' approach, therefore, it is possible that with no change whatsoever in their hiring practices for noncannery workers--the jobs at issue in this lawsuit--petitioners could make respondents' <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact "disappear.". . .</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court rejected any "bottom line" statistical approach to adverse impact cases. See below. The Court found that plaintiffs' evidence did not demonstrate a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of adverse impact and remanded the case to the district court for the taking of additional evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Court went on to address two further issues: the question of a causal connection between any employment practices and minority underrepresentation in the work force, and the ultimate burdens of proof in an adverse impact case. On the question of causation in <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 2123-25, the Court found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he law in this respect was correctly stated by Justice O'CONNOR's opinion last Term in <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S., at 994, 108 S. Ct., at 2788: "[W]e note that the plaintiff's burden in establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case goes beyond the need to show that there are statistical disparities in the employer's work force. The plaintiff must begin by identifying the specific employment practice that is challenged. . . . Especially in cases where an employer combines subjective criteria with the use of more rigid standardized rules or tests, the plaintiff is in our view responsible for isolating and identifying the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our disparate-impact cases have always focused on the impact of particular hiring practices on employment opportunities for minorities. Just as an employer cannot escape liability under Title VII by demonstrating that, "at the bottom line," his work force is racially balanced (where particular hiring practices may operate to deprive minorities of employment opportunities), <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Connecticut v. Teal</span>, 457 U.S., at 450, 102 S. Ct., at 2532, a Title VII plaintiff does not make out a case of disparate impact simply by showing that, "at the bottom line," there is racial imbalance in the work force. As a general matter, a plaintiff must demonstrate that it is the application of a specific or particular employment practice that has created the disparate impact under attack. Such a showing is an integral part of the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in a disparate-impact suit under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, respondents have alleged that several "objective" employment practices (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, nepotism, separate hiring channels, rehire preferences), as well as the use of "subjective decision making" to select noncannery workers, have had a disparate impact on nonwhites. Respondents base this claim on statistics that allegedly show a disproportionately low percentage of nonwhites in the at-issue positions. However, even if on remand respondents can show that nonwhites are underrepresented in the at-issue jobs in a manner that is acceptable under the standards set forth in Part II, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, this alone will not suffice to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact. Respondents will also have to demonstrate that the disparity they complain of is the result of one or more of the employment practices that they are attacking here, specifically showing that each challenged practice has a significantly disparate impact on employment opportunities for whites and nonwhites. To hold otherwise would result in employers being potentially liable for "the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances in the composition of their work forces." <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 487 U.S., at 992, 108 S. Ct., at 2787.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next, the <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> Court, 109 S. Ct. at 2126-27, went on to address the burdens of proof in an adverse impact case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Though we have phrased the query differently in different cases, it is generally well established that at the justification stage of such a disparate-impact case, the dispositive issue is whether a challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S., at 997-999, 108 S. Ct., at __; <span class="Italic">New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer</span>, 440 U.S., at 587, n.31, 99 S. Ct., at 1366, n.31; <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S., at 432, 91 S. Ct., at 854. The touchstone of this inquiry is a reasoned review of the employer's justification for his use of the challenged practice. A mere insubstantial justification in this regard will not suffice, because such a low standard of review would permit discrimination to be practiced through the use of spurious, seemingly neutral employment practices. At the same time, though, there is no requirement that the challenged practice be "essential" or "indispensable" to the employer's business for it to pass muster: this degree of scrutiny would be almost impossible for most employers to meet, and would result in a host of evils we have identified above. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 2122.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this phase, the employer carries the burden of producing evidence of a business justification for his employment practice. The burden of persuasion, however, remains with the disparate-impact plaintiff. To the extent that the Ninth Circuit held otherwise in its <span class="Italic">en</span> <span class="Italic">banc</span> decision in this case, <span class="Italic">see</span> 810 F.2d, at 1485-1486, or in the panel's decision on remand, <span class="Italic">see</span> 827 F.2d, at 445, 447--suggesting that the persuasion burden should shift to petitioners once respondents established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact--its decisions were erroneous. "[T]he ultimate burden of proving that discrimination against a protected group has been caused by a specific employment practice remains with the plaintiff at all times." <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 487 U.S., at 997, 108 S. Ct., at 2790 (O'CONNOR, J.). This rule conforms with the usual method for allocating persuasion and production burdens in the federal courts, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. Rule Evid. 301, and more specifically, it conforms to the rule in disparate-treatment cases that the plaintiff bears the burden of disproving an employer's assertion that the adverse employment action or practice was based solely on a legitimate neutral consideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 256-258, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1095-1096, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981). We acknowledge that some of our earlier decisions can be read as suggesting otherwise. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 487 U.S., at 1006-1008, 108 S. Ct., at___ (BLACKMUN, J., concurring). But to the extent that those cases speak of an employers' "burden of proof" with respect to a legitimate business justification defense, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 329, 97 S. Ct. 2720, 2726, 53 L. Ed.2d 786 (1977), they should have been understood to mean an employer's production--but not persuasion--burden. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp.</span>, 462 U.S. 393, 404, n.7, 103 S. Ct. 2469, 2475, n.7, 76 L. Ed.2d 667 (1983). The persuasion burden here must remain with the plaintiff, for it is he who must prove that it was "because of such individual's race, color," etc., that he was denied a desired employment opportunity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, if on remand the case reaches this point, and respondents cannot persuade the trier of fact on the question of petitioners' business necessity defense, respondents may still be able to prevail. To do so, respondents will have to persuade the factfinder that "other tests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also serve the employer's legitimate [hiring] interest[s]"; by so demonstrating, respondents would prove that "[petitioners were] using [their] tests merely as a 'pretext' for discrimination." <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 422 U.S., at 425, 95 S. Ct., at 2375; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 487 U.S., at 998, 108 S. Ct., <span id="Page_780"></span>at 2779 (O'CONNOR, J.);<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 1005-1006, 108 S. Ct., at 2781 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). If respondents, having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, come forward with alternatives to petitioners' hiring practices that reduce the racially disparate impact of practices currently being used, and petitioners refuse to adopt these alternatives, such a refusal would belie a claim by petitioners that their incumbent practices are being employed for nondiscriminatory reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases like <span class="Italic">Rice v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01902474 (1990), the Commission, in turn, followed the lead of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> and <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that facially neutral employment rules, practices, policies or procedures which have significant adverse effects upon members of a statutorily protected group, or which otherwise cause members of a protected group to be denied access to equal employment opportunities are unlawful. <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Antonio</span>, 109 S. Ct. 2115 (1989); <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2777 (1988); <span class="Italic">Connecticut v. Teal</span>, 457 U.S. 568 (1982); <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States</span>, 401 U.S. 424 (1971). Such practices are said to have an adverse impact upon members of a protected class, and it does not matter whether those practices are objective or subjective in nature. <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in disparate treatment cases of discrimination, appellant has the ultimate burden of persuasion under a three-part analysis<span class="Italic">. Wards Cove</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 2126; <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 108 S. Ct. at 2790. Appellant must initially establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by offering statistical evidence that the ostensibly neutral employment practice at issue has a disparate impact upon a statutorily protected group. Once the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of adverse impact has been established, the burden shifts to the agency to provide a business necessity, or at least a reasonable business purpose, to justify the employment practice at issue. Once the agency does so, the burden returns to appellant to show that the challenged practice fails to advance the goals used by the agency as justification for the practice, or that alternative practices with less of an adverse impact upon the protected group are available to achieve the same business ends. <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 2125-2126.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> analysis, however, was short-lived. In 1991, Congress effectively reversed the Supreme Court's ruling.</p>
