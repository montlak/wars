<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-44"><span class="space">H.</span> FAILURE TO ENGAGE IN THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS</h3>
<p class="noindent">An agency's failure to engage in the interactive accommodation process in itself is not a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A14791 (2003). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Broussard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01997106 (2002), found that the AJ incorrectly held otherwise:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ incorrectly held as a matter of law that the agency's failure to engage in the interactive process constitutes a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. "[L]iability nevertheless depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable the [individual with a disability] to perform the job's essential functions." <span class="Italic">Kvorjak v. State of Maine</span>, 259 F.3d 48 (1st Cir. 2001). <span class="Italic">See also EEOC v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.</span>, 249 F.3d 557 (6th Cir. 2001) (summary judgment reversed where there were disputed issues of material fact regarding whether an effective accommodation existed, where agency had failed to engage in the interactive process), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 70 U.S.L.W. 3384 (U.S. Mar. 4, 2002); <span class="Italic">Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n</span>, 239 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2001) (summary judgment was inappropriate because there were factual issues as to whether the employer's failure to continue engaging in the interactive process resulted in denial of an effective accommodation); <span class="Italic">Rehling v. City of Chicago</span>, 207 F.3d 1009 (7th Cir. 2000) (employee cannot succeed on denial of reasonable accommodation claim solely on a showing that an employer failed to engage in the interactive process because that process is not an end in itself; rather, the employee must show that an inadequate interactive process resulted in an employer's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the factual determination, made by the AJ, that the agency failed to properly engage in the interactive process, does not, by itself, demand a finding that complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation. Rather, to establish a denial of a reasonable accommodation, complainant must establish that the failure to engage in the interactive process resulted in the agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Pitts v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130039 (2013), involved a parcel distribution machine operator whose medical condition required access to a bathroom. The agency did not have functioning bathrooms, so she requested to be placed on administrative leave. The agency denied her request and, instead, charged her AWOL for those days. Management officials maintained that they were not aware of her medical condition to explain why they failed to engage in the interactive process. The Commission rejected the agency's defense and found that a reasonable accommodation was available had the agency engaged in the interactive process in <span class="Italic">Pitts</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that Complainant did in fact make the Agency aware that she required use of a restroom due to her medical condition. Because the Agency did not have functioning restrooms, Complainant requested administrative leave. The record included Complainant's request for administrative leave for October 26 and 27, 2011, stating that the "remarks" section that the reason for the leave was a "medical condition." Complainant's request for administrative leave on October 28, 2011, stated "safety hazard." Furthermore, on October 27, 2011, Complainant submitted a Report of Hazard which clearly stated that she was unable to use the restroom due to the lack of running water and that this constituted a hazardous condition for her due to her medical condition. She noted that there was no restroom as of 4:00 A.M. on October 27, 2011. Complainant also averred that when she informed management about the lack of working restrooms, she made it know that she had a medical condition which had been documented in her Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requests in the past.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that S1, S2 and the Manager all averred that they were not aware of Complainant's medical condition. At the same token, S2 noted that he was aware that Complainant had an FMLA claim. We find the statements by S2 to be inconsistent. In addition, the documents provided by Complainant clearly state that the reason for her requests for administrative leave was her medical condition. As such, we find that Complainant's request for administrative leave for October 26, 27 &#x0026; 28, 2011, constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation. We determine that it was the Agency that failed to recognize Complainant's request for administrative leave as a request for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Due to this failure, none of the management officials engaged in the interactive process. However, the Commission has recognized that an agency's failure to engage in the interactive process does not, in itself, constitute a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Social Security Admin</span>., Appeal No. 01A14791 (February 21, 2003). Liability depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the fact that the Agency failed to properly engage in the interactive process, does not, by itself, demand a finding that Complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation. Rather, to establish a denial of a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must establish that the failure to engage in the interactive process resulted in the Agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserted that it provide Complainant with an accommodation, however, not the accommodation she requested. Management noted that Complainant could have used a restroom at a gas station one mile away or at a grocery store three miles away. Complainant noted that her medical condition required her to urinate frequently and that she may not have been able to wait to leave the facility and travel to a location one to three miles away in order to use a restroom. It is the Commission's position that if more than one accommodation is effective, "the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration; however, the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9; <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, No. 915.002, Question 9 (revised October 17, 2002); <span class="Italic">Polen v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970984 (January 16, 2001). Here, we cannot find that the Agency's suggestion of allowing Complainant to travel to another location to use a restroom constituted an effective accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we turn to Complainant's requested accommodation, namely the use of administrative leave for October 26, 27, &#x0026; 28, 2011, when there was no restroom available at the facility. We note that the Agency asserted that there was a portable restroom at the facility during these dates. However., Complainant noted that there was no portable restroom at the workplace at her designated start time of 4:00 A.M. on October 26 and 27, 2011. Further, she noted that she could not wait at the facility without a restroom until one was delivered. No Management Official could provide the exact date or time when a portable restroom was delivered or if Complainant was informed of when it was installed. As such, we find that Complainant showed that she should have been provided with administrative leave for October 26, 27 &#x0026; 28, 2011. The Agency failed to argue or present any evidence that providing Complainant with administrative leave would have constituted a reasonable accommodation. Therefore, we conclude that Complainant established that had the Agency properly engaged in the interactive process, she should have been provided with a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation in the form of administrative leave for October 26, 27 &#x0026; 28, 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mario H. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2021004035 (2022), reached a similar result finding that the complainant's refusal to accept the agency's reasonable accommodation offer "effectively ended the interactive process":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the evidence in the record does not support Complainant's assertion that the Agency failed to engage in the interactive process. Rather, the record reflects that the Agency made a good-faith effort to engage in the interactive process by offering Complainant an interim accommodation, in order to determine if the HT's alleged scent was the cause of Complainant's migraines. The SS's email clearly explained that the proposed relocation was only a temporary measure, and that the CCS would continue to engage with Complainant to determine whether any other effective accommodation could be reached. <span class="Italic">See</span> ROI at 105-106. In response, Complainant stated that the proposed relocation was unacceptable, he saw no need for a meeting, and would seek other methods to address the issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> ROI at 106-107. Therefore, we find that the record supports the SS's statement that Complainant's own actions effectively ended the interactive process. <span class="Italic">See Doloris W. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120150932 (Feb. 10, 2017) (finding that where the Agency did not obstruct the interactive process and made reasonable efforts to communicate with Complainant and provide accommodations based on the information it had, the Agency had not violated the Rehabilitation Act).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ratkovic v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A14761 (2002), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also notes that the AJ was in error when she made the legal determination that failure to engage in the interactive process amounted to a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. The question of whether the agency's actions violated the Rehabilitation Act turns on whether or not complainant received a reasonable accommodation, and if he did not, whether the agency has proven that to provide such would cause an undue hardship....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Florentino S. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120152949 (2016) (an agency's failure to engage in the interactive process will not necessarily result in a finding of disability discrimination where the complainant was otherwise effectively accommodated); <span class="Italic">Barnard v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10002 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cedrick S. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 2020003661 (2021), added:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record is clear that the Agency failed to engage in the interactive process following Complainant's request for an accommodation. Commission precedent establishes, however, that an agency cannot be held liable solely for a failure to engage in the interactive process. <span class="Italic">Mahalia P. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120181487 (Sept. 25, 2019). Liability attaches when the failure to engage in the interactive process results in the Agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Broussard v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01997106 (Sept. 13, 2002), <span class="Italic">req. to recon. den'd</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30114 (Jan. 9, 2013). The sole purpose of the interactive process is to facilitate the identification of an appropriate reasonable accommodation, and an agency's failure to engage in this process does not give rise to a separate cause of action because the interactive process is not an end in itself. <span class="Italic">Broussard, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, a complainant states a claim when he alleges that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process as retaliation for protected activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Scearce v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01A21014 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">A failure to "properly" engage in the interactive process will not necessarily result in a finding of disability discrimination even where the complainant alleges that the agency forced an accommodation on him rather than discussing possible accommodative options with him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hayden R. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142237 (2016). <span class="Italic">Hayden R</span>. involved a complainant who was a full-time mail carrier. In response to a prior EEO complaint, the parties agreed to accommodate the complainant's disability by allowing him to take additional breaks while delivering the mail. After more than one occasion of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, observing the complainant doubled over and out of breath on his route, the complainant's supervisor removed him from his route and asked him to request light duty. The complainant complied with that request. Later, he filed an EEO complainant averring that he was forced to sign the light duty request and that the agency should have engaged in the interactive process with him to find another way to accommodate him in his former position as a mail carrier. The Commission rejected the complainant's arguments in <span class="Italic">Hayden R</span>., finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find the preponderance of the evidence in the record supports the Agency's reasons for its actions, and the record does not establish that the Agency failed to accommodate him. Assuming Complainant is an individual with a disability, we find he was in fact accommodated after he was removed from his former route. Although Complainant's preference was to remain assigned to his former route under the previous arrangement, this is not determinative. The Rehabilitation Act mandates that qualified individuals with a disability be granted an effective reasonable accommodation; however, it does not entitle them to the accommodation of their choice. <span class="Italic">See Castaneda v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01931005 (Feb. 17, 1994); see also EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC No. 915,002, Question 9 (rev. Oct. 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, an employer may ask an employee with a known disability whether he needs a reasonable accommodation when it reasonably believes that the employee may need an accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Question 41. Here, the Agency reasonably believed that the present accommodation was not effective. Although the Agency could have discussed the need for alternative accommodations in a more collaborative manner, we do not find it failed to accommodate Complainant's disability. We have previously held that an Agency's failure to "properly engage in the interactive process, does not, by itself, demand a finding that Complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">Broussard v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01997106 (Sept. 13, 2002). "Rather, to establish a denial of a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must establish that the failure to engage in the interactive process resulted in the Agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., <span class="Italic">see also Humphrey v. Memorial Hosp. Ass'n</span>., 239 F.3d 1123, 1139 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that when an employer fails "to engage in the interactive process, liability is appropriate if a reasonable accommodation without undue hardship to the employer would otherwise have been possible.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The interactive process is not interminable, however. An employee's refusal to accept an effective and reasonable accommodation may bring the interactive process to a halt and result in a finding that the agency fulfilled its obligation under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Otis B. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120152831 (2018).</p>
