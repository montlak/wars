<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-42a"><span class="space">E.</span> HALTING THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS</h4>
<p class="noindent">If circumstances lead to a pause on the interactive process, the agency's obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation does not terminate entirely. For instance, the agency in <span class="Italic">Eleni M. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020001903 (2021), defended its termination of the interactive process where the complainant went on a leave of absence. The Commission held that even where the accommodations were not necessary during the complainant's leave of absence, the agency was still obligated to continue the conversation or, at a minimum, to reengage once the complainant returned to work. In that case, the complainant advised management of an upcoming surgery that would require a reasonable accommodation. The complainant requested a laptop, voice activated software and telework. When the complainant went on leave for the surgery, the parties were still engaged in the interactive process. Management sent an email to the complainant to confirm that she no longer sought accommodations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1316"></span>S1 formally acknowledged Complainant's November 21, 2016 accommodation request. However, S1 also told Complainant, "[o]n November 28, 2016, you informed me your doctor was faxing an excuse to take you out of work beginning the following day. Therefore, you did not wish to proceed with the reasonable accommodation request." (Emphasis omitted). S1 asked Complainant to confirm in writing that she withdrew her request, recalling that Complainant said that she wanted to withdraw her request when they spoke on November 28, 2016. Then, S1 unilaterally halted the reasonable accommodation process, stating it would resume once Complainant provided additional medical documentation and returned to work. Complainant responded on December 6, 2016, by reiterating her November 21, 2016 request for assistive technology, without stating that she withdrew her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission held that even if it could be argued that the complainant temporarily paused on accommodation discussions, the agency should have reconvened those discussions when <span class="Italic">Eleni M</span>. returned to work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the ROI, "Request 1" includes three explicit requests for assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation: on October 20, 2016, Complainant, verbally asked S1 for assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation, initiating the interactive process. On November 21, 2016, Complainant provided S1 with a written request for a reasonable accommodation identifying specific software and assistive technology she sought from CAP. As Complainant's disability was obvious, this request on its own was sufficient to obligate the Agency to act. Regardless, Complainant also attached sufficient documentary support of her disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 6, 2016, Complainant responded to S1's November 30, 2016 email asking her to confirm that she withdrew her accommodation request, by reiterating that she sought assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation during her recovery and upon her return to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency takes the position that Complainant withdrew her November 21, 2016 request based on S1's November 30, 2016 email, as well as Complainant's December 6, 2016 response, where Complainant states: "I did not get to clarify my Reasonable Accommodation Request, however for now it is OBE [overcome by events] for my request to work from home. I may ask again if circumstances change. I will request the Dragon Software when I return to work." We agree that standing alone, in response to a request for written confirmation of withdrawal, this statement could be interpreted as a confirmation. Yet, the very next sentence contradicts an assumption of withdrawal: "I still am requesting the Dragon software and voice recorder for use even once I return to work....It is foreseeable that when I return I will still need the accommodation of technology. I have the intent to finish the CAP application soon." (Emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At a minimum, Complainant's December 6, 2016 response email placed S1 on notice to ensure Complainant had a reasonable accommodation of assistive technology available upon her return to work. However, the next day, Complainant provides medical documentation establishing that she still seeks her November 21, 2016 requested accommodation. The ROI contains a December 7, 2016 note from Complainant's orthopedic surgeon, providing, in relevant part, that after her surgery on December 19, 2016, Complainant would be under post-operative care for three months with an estimated return date of January 17, 2016. The note then states: "Accommodation Request: During recovery [Complainant] would benefit from a speak-to-text software and/or audio recorder." In other words, Complainant would require an accommodation prior to her return to work so that she could telework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that S1 denied Complainant's first request for a reasonable accommodation by improperly terminating the interactive process. Specifically, S1's November 30, 2016 email stated: "I will take no further action with regard to this request at this time. You may re-engage if accommodation is needed upon your return to duty with supporting documentation from your physician." Then, in response to Complainant's December 6, 2016 reiteration of her request, S1 stated the same day: "[in] reference your accommodation request, we will move out when you provide current substantiating medical documentation from your physician. Focus on getting well, we'll deal with everything else when you return."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the evidence supported the Agency's position that Complainant withdrew her November 21, 2016 request, the December 7, 2016 medical document should have re-opened the interactive process. A December 16, 2016 email from Complainant to S1 confirms that she is still working on obtaining more (unnecessary) medical documentation for S1. However, on or about December 20, 2016, S1 improperly terminated the interactive process again by informing Complainant that no further action would be taken until Complainant returned to work and provided updated medical documentation. S1 also effectively denied Complainant's request to telework while she recovered, prior to returning to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency improperly denied Complainants multiple requests for a reasonable accommodation between October 20, 2016 and on and about December 20, 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Eleni M</span>. went on to award compensatory damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission previously found that an agency lacked good faith when responding to a reasonable accommodation request where the agency used the complainant's leave status as an excuse to halt the interactive process. <span class="Italic">See Denese G. v. Dep't of the Treas</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016). Another indication of a lack of "good faith" effort occurs where an Agency's inaction in response to a request for a reasonable accommodation, forces a complainant to take leave for a significant period time, which they would not have had to do if the Agency made a reasonable accommodation available to them. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record does not reflect that the Agency acted in good faith when responding to Complainant's requests for assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation. S1 made efforts to engage in the interactive process for both of Complainant's reasonable accommodation requests, including following up and arranging a meeting with the RA Manager. She also partially granted Complainant's November 21, 2016 request by providing him with a laptop in order to telework as a reasonable accommodation. Yet, there is no evidence that S1 made any meaningful attempt to secure a reasonable accommodation for Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lack of good faith is evinced by S1's improper disability-related inquiries including her <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act, and, in particular, S1's refusal to proceed with Complainant's second request unless Complainant provided her with a completed AR 690-12 Appendix C. Under the circumstances, it was not necessary for Complainant to submit this particular document, and it should not have been a barrier to Complainant obtaining a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant already submitted a reasonable accommodation request and provided S1 with ample up to date supporting medical documentation confirming her need for assistive technology as a reasonable accommodation, specifically, Dragon Software upon her return to work. The AR 690-12 Appendix C is a list of questions to be used as a tool for engaging in the interactive process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency explains that it requires this document in accordance with its internal policies, failure to complete a form is not necessarily a valid reason to delay providing a reasonable accommodation. In her testimony, S1 appears to conflate the AR 690-12 Appendix C with the interactive process itself. Similarly, a December 2016 email to S1, around the time of her surgery, Complainant indicates that she had not completed her CAP form. Complainant's November 21, 2016 request and accompanying documentation identified all of the necessary information, including the specific assistive technology Complainant sought. The form is also not required under Agency policy. AR 690-12, Appendix D states that in order to obtain an assistive technology through CAP, an employee must "confirm request in writing, preferably by completing the CAP Request Form." (Emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has not shown the Agency to be liable for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to the extent that she alleges that on or about July 14, 2018, S1 failed to notify her that her assistive technology arrived from CAP. Complainant reasons that S1 knew that she took FMLA leave because typing without an accommodation harmed her fingers and wrist. S1 was also aware that with assistive technology, Complainant and could have worked with minimal use of her right hand and wrist had she been allowed to return from FMLA. Complainant argues that her August requests to come into work were denied for similar reasons. However, Complainant was on notice that her assistive technology was scheduled to be delivered from CAP around this time, she received emails informing her when it was shipped and when it was delivered, and she did not notify S1. Regardless, Complainant has not shown that S1 would have known to contact her while she was on leave because it was not clear whether Complainant still needed to stay on FMLA leave to care for her mother, whose condition worsened in recent months. Further, Complainant did not call or email her office to inquire whether the assistive technology arrived or ask about it when she contacted the Agency in August 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that an unnecessary delay in providing an effective reasonable accommodation can indicate bad faith and result in a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. EEOC Guidance No. 915.002 at Q. 10, <span class="Italic">Yessenia H. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070027 (Oct. 13, 2015). In determining whether there has been an unnecessary delay in responding to a request for reasonable accommodation, relevant factors would include: (1) the reason(s) for the delay; (2) the length of the delay; (3) how much the individual with a disability and the agency each contributed to the delay; (4) what the agency was doing during the delay; and (5) whether the required accommodation was simple or complex to provide. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at n.38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency created several months-long unnecessary delays, beginning on November 30, 2016, when S1 first notified Complainant that she would not act on his accommodation request until Complainant returned to work with updated medical information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1317"></span>The delay was unnecessary because Complainant already provided sufficient documentation to support her request. Regardless, Complainant submitted the December 7, 2016 medical documentation and demonstrated a continued effort to obtain more (unnecessary) documentation for S1. The unnecessary delay prevented Complainant from efficiently teleworking, despite S1 promptly providing her with a laptop. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Patricia W. v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172637 (Mar. 26, 2019) (agency caused an unnecessary delay where the complainant was provided a reasonable accommodation of full time telework, but it took four months to provide the necessary technical equipment, software, and training). With the exception of December 19 and 20, 2016, S1, after consulting the RA Manager decided to take no further action until Complainant returned to work, with updated medical documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 reasoned that that after surgery and intensive occupational therapy, Complainant may no longer need a reasonable accommodation when she returned. <span class="Italic">See Clayton C. v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120120350 (Nov. 17, 2015) (finding that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process, and rejecting agency's explanation that the complainant's initial request for a reasonable accommodation "expired," given that the complainant's disability was obvious and there was no evidence that the need for the accommodation had been eliminated). S1's reasoning ignores that Complainant's requests for an accommodation were also intended so that she could telework during her recovery (i.e. prior to returning to work). S1 does not acknowledge that the December 7, 2016 physician's note Complainant provided addresses this uncertainty by providing a timeline of her recovery that indicated Complainant would require assistive technology through March 31, 2017. As previously discussed, the record contradicts S1's alternate reason that Complainant withdrew her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 prolonged the unnecessary delay, even when Complainant's February 23, 2017 documentation confirmed that she still had the same limitation, her condition was chronic (so her initial accommodation request from November 21, 2016 was still valid), and she required Dragon Software as a reasonable accommodation. without a reasonable accommodation. By this point, it was definitely foreseeable that the unnecessary delay in obtaining assistive technology would result in Complainant missing work due to flareups of her condition arising from efforts to work without an accommodation. S1 continued not to act despite receiving Complainant's March 20, and 27, 2016 medical documents and upon Complainant's March 20, 2016 return to the office with an obvious disability. S1 attributed her delay in providing Complainant with a reasonable accommodation to Complainant's failure to fully respond to (improper) disability-related inquiries, and insisting that no further action could be taken until Complainant engaged in the interactive process by completing an AR 690-12 Appendix C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant and the Agency both contributed to the delay in providing reasonable accommodations, however the Agency did so to a much greater extent and to the detriment of its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Ruben T. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120171405 (Mar. 22, 2019) (in determining that the agency was responsible for the unnecessary delay in providing the complainant a reasonable accommodation, the Commission considered that complainant was proactive, and the agency ceased its efforts to provide an accommodation when he was temporarily placed on another assignment, and there was "nothing in the record showing that he withdrew or paused his request for the additional software"). Complainant could have been clearer in her December 6, 2016 response email to S1, who interpreted it as a withdrawal of her complaint. However, as previously discussed, S1 should not have ceased her efforts to obtain a reasonable accommodation for Complainant before or after Complainant's email, given the December 7, 2016 medical documents. The record supports that S1 reached out to Complainant multiple times in March, April and May 2017 to obtain the completed AR 690-12 Appendix C. While it is not clear why Complainant failed to provide this document, it is not a sufficient reason to withhold a reasonable accommodation, given that she already provided a reasonable accommodation request and supporting medical documents. S1 also had opportunities to complete the document together with Complainant when they met to discuss accommodations. CAP appears to have been responsive when Complainant contacted them independently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The assistive technology Complainant requested as a reasonable accommodation was simple to provide because it was available through CAP. According to Section 1.3 of the Agency's "Procedures for Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities" the Agency's purpose in establishing CAP was to make assistive technology available to employees that needed it, and not cost individual offices or departments (contrary to S1's assertion). In both verbal and written communications to S1, including the November 21, 2016 reasonable accommodation request, Complainant provided the specific items of assistive technology she believed would make an effective reasonable accommodation. S1 needed only to submit a request through CAP. Appendix D-2 of AR 690-12 provides clear information about how to request assistive technology through CAP, and CAP is identified as a resource in other portions of AR-690-12. That Complainant could obtain the assistive technology independently underscores how obtaining her reasonable accommodation was not a complex process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude the Agency's excessive delay in responding to Complainant's request for reasonable accommodation was in bad faith, entitling her to consideration of an award for compensatory damages.</p>
