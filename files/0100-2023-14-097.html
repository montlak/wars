<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-97"><span class="space">D.</span> DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE AND RATIFICATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">A discussed above in the section on Oral Agreements, in addition to oral agreements entered into in the presence of an administrative judge on the hearing record, there are two other situations where the EEOC has approved oral agreements. Although the principals are similar, the concepts of detrimental reliance and ratification are distinctly different. Under the doctrine of detrimental reliance, the focus is on whether the complainant has taken some action to his or her detriment based on reliance on the oral representations of the agency and whether the complainant's reliance was reasonable under the circumstances. Ratification focuses on the agency's action subsequent to entering an oral agreement and whether those actions exhibit an intent that the oral agreement was binding.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission explained the doctrine of detrimental reliance in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Service</span>, 0120130925 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has alleged that she relied to her detriment on the oral agreement when she resigned from her position. The Commission has enforced an oral settlement agreement applying the principle of detrimental reliance. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Smithsonian Institute</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01965078 (May 16, 1997) <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied, Thomas v. Smithsonian Institute</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970889 (September 25, 2000) (enforcing an oral settlement agreement when the terms of the agreement were not in dispute, the parties had partially performed their respective obligations under the agreement, and in so performing, complainant had justifiably relied upon the agreement to his detriment). However, in the case at hand, we do not find that Complainant's reliance was justifiable. The parties orally agreed to the terms of a settlement agreement. However, on July 26, 2012, the Agency 's Counsel clearly informed Complainant's Attorney that the agreement needed to be approved by the Panel. Despite this information and the lack of a written settlement agreement, Complainant, who had legal representation, went ahead and submitted her resignation letter on July 27, 2012. We find that Complainant was on notice, prior to her resignation, that the agreement needed further approval before it could be finalized. Accordingly, we decline to apply the principle of detrimental reliance in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission applied the theories of detrimental reliance and ratification in <span class="Italic">Polly P. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020001642 (2020), to enforce a verbal agreement against the agency. At the end of a fact-finding conference with the complainant, agency counsel and EEO investigator, the parties had reached a "verbal agreement," which obligated the agency to put the complainant on a detail and the complainant was to withdraw her complaint. Two weeks after withdrawing her compliant, the agency had not reduced the agreement to writing or detailed the complainant. The complainant sought to reinstate her compliant. The agency refused and attempted to modify the terms of the detail. Armed by emails from agency representatives acknowledging the terms of the agreement, the complainant filed a new complaint of discrimination alleging that the agency did not negotiate in good faith. The Commission agreed in <span class="Italic">Polly P.</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he record reveals that Complainant's efforts to resolve her concerns in the underlying complaint were futile and we cannot ignore the Agency's troubling actions. Claim (c) clearly alleges breach of the "verbal settlement agreement," which the Agency erred in dismissing and failing to address, not only when presented in the instant complaint but in earlier communications by Complainant to the EEO office and other Agency officials. Rather than remand the breach allegation to the Agency, the record before us enables further analysis, which we shall engage in for the purposes of adjudicatory economy and clarity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the agreement allegedly entered by the parties on January 24, 2019 was oral.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.603 provides, in pertinent part, that <span id="Page_411"></span>"[a]ny settlement reached shall be in writing and signed by both parties and shall identify the claims resolved." However, the Commission has held that the doctrines of ratification and detrimental reliance may be applied to support enforcement of an agreement that might otherwise be unenforceable. <span class="Italic">See Jacobsohn v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930689 (June 2, 1994). Specifically, where a complainant alters his position in reliance on negotiations and the action is justified, an agreement may be enforced under the doctrine of detrimental reliance. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Smithsonian Institute</span>, Appeal No. 01965078, (May 16, 1997); <span class="Italic">see also Bakery v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A60741 (April 12, 2006) (doctrines of ratification and detrimental reliance were applicable where the Agency orally agreed to provide the complainant with additional overtime opportunities if the complainant withdrew the EEO complaint, the complainant did so in reliance on the agreement, and EEOC ordered the Agency to reinstate the complainant's underlying complaint from the point at which processing ceased).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant executed a withdrawal of Case 2829 on January 24, 2019, at the close of her meeting with Agency officials. By doing so, Complainant altered her position in reliance on the agreement. We find such reliance was justified given the stature of the Agency officials involved and their repeated assurances that the settlement agreement would be ratified. These assurances are documented by numerous emails, including one from later that same day wherein Agency Counsel stated that he was working on the agreement at that moment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant, who did not have a legal representative, asserts that she was coerced by the EEO Investigator and Agency counsel to sign the withdrawal. Agency counsel, in particular, should not have permitted the execution of the withdrawal absent a corresponding settlement agreement when circumstances showed the withdrawal was in exchange for specific Agency actions. A review of Agency correspondence that followed the January 24, 2019 meeting, both among themselves and with Complainant, indicate that they appear to have engaged in a "bait and switch" tactic. When this became evident to Complainant, the Agency refused her attempts to reinstate her complaint, citing the withdrawal she signed. Therefore, we find that a settlement agreement existed based on the doctrine of ratification and detrimental reliance. Where we find a breach, the Commission has two options to remedy the situation: 1) reinstate the complaint or 2) order specific performance. Under the circumstances before us, we find reinstatement of Case 2829 to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant may not maintain that he has relied to his detriment on an oral agreement where he never withdrew the complaints allegedly settled. <span class="Italic">See Kilpatrick v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01980808 (1998) (there can be no detrimental reliance where a complaint was not withdrawn). This is especially true where the agency subsequently consolidated the complaints for investigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hamer v. Corporation for National and Community Service</span>, 01964687 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 01965078 (1997), the Commission found that the doctrine of detrimental reliance applied to an otherwise unenforceable settlement agreement. In reliance upon the orally agreed upon terms of the settlement, the complainant retired from the agency. The Commission found that appellant's reliance seemed justified given the agency officials involved in the negotiations, as well as their assurances that the agreed upon terms had been approved. The agreement at issue in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> was as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The record indicates that the parties reached an oral agreement on February 15, 1996 with regard to the following terms:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The agency would announce appellant's retirement from his position as Assistant Director, Office of Design and Construction, effective February 23, 1996, and appellant would cease any formal job duties as Assistant Director Office of Design and Construction, vacate his office and physical presence at the Office of Design and Construction, and be placed in an administrative leave with pay status until June 1997, when his retirement from the agency would be effected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;During this interim time period, appellant would not be prohibited from seeking outside employment and any conflict of interest provisions contained in any agency directives or applicable statutes would be waived by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The agency would pay appellant the sum of $60,000.00 in compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;The agency would pay reasonable attorney's fees directly to appellant's attorney in the amount of $10,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;The agency would restore any "use or lose" leave which would otherwise be lost during this period and appellant would be compensated for this leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6.&#x2003;The parties would treat all of the terms and conditions contained in the settlement agreement confidentially, except for purposes of lawful enforcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7.&#x2003;That the settlement agreement would be enforceable by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to the agreement, during the week of February 19, 1996, the agency announced appellant's retirement from the agency effective February 23, 1996. Appellant physically vacated his office on February 23, 1996. Subsequently, the agency's Under Secretary and General Counsel reviewed the terms of the settlement, and found them to be unacceptable and, unenforceable with regard to at least one provision, i.e., the waiver of the conflict of interest regulations. The agreement was not reduced to writing and was never signed by the parties. On March 4, 1996, appellant was formally notified that the agency would not execute the settlement agreement. Appellant requested that the agreement be enforced and stated, in the alternative, that he should be permitted to resume his former duties, responsibilities, job title and physical office space. The agency subsequently conducted an office reorganization, abolishing appellant's position. On March 21, 1996, appellant was informed that he should return to work on March 25, 1996. The agency, however, notified appellant that he would not be assigned to his former position, but rather--he would perform "unassigned duties" for the Director of the Office of Physical Plant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By letter dated March 22, 1996, appellant informed the agency of his allegations of breach. According to appellant, the terms of the agreement were finalized on February 15, 1996, with the understanding that compliance would commence immediately, and the agreement would be reduced to writing during the following days and would be signed on February 26, 1996. Appellant maintained that the Director approved the agreement and he was assured during his last week of work that a written version of the agreement would be shortly forthcoming. Appellant claimed that the agency commenced partial performance of the settlement agreement by acceding to the notification of his retirement and his vacating his office and job duties. According to appellant, the agency's failure to fully comply with the agreement has caused him to suffer extensive physical and mental damage. Appellant stated that he has incurred medical expenses, additional attorney's fees, and extensive and severe damages. Appellant requested that the agreement be enforced, and in the alternative, that he be reinstated to his former position, physical office space, and duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we do not have a hearing transcript or its equivalent on which to bind the parties. There is no written settlement agreement as provided for in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.603 and no valid oral agreement as described in <span class="Italic">Acree</span>. We note, however, that there does not appear to be a dispute as to the terms arrived at through the negotiations culminating on February 15, 1996.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we note that appellant argues that the agency should be estopped from denying the existence of an agreement due to the partial performance of the agreed upon terms. Specifically, the agency announced appellant's retirement and appellant physically vacated his office. The Commission has previously held that the doctrine of ratification and detrimental reliance may be applied to support enforcement of an agreement that might otherwise be unenforceable. <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930689 (June 2, 1994). Consequently, we find that the oral agreement negotiated on February 15, 1996, should be enforced under the doctrine of detrimental reliance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, however, found that one of the terms of the agreement was unenforceable as a matter of law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we find that the oral agreement in enforceable, we agree with the agency that provision 2 is not enforceable. Just as a Federal agency cannot incur a financial liability that it is not legally obligated to incur, so an agency cannot agree to violate a statutory provision. <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910892 (March 11, 1992). Consequently, we find that the agreement is enforceable without provision 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After announcing his retirement and having appellant vacate his office, the agency abolished appellant's position and other employees were permitted to occupy appellant's former office. Therefore, we find that specific performance of the terms of the settlement, as set forth above without provision 2, is the appropriate relief for appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission analyzed Thomas purely from the standpoint of detrimental reliance, it is worth noting that there also is an element of subsequent ratification in that case. Specifically, the agency took actions, such as announcing the complainant's retirement, that indicated its intent to comply with terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reaffirmed its holding in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> on reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Smithsonian Institute</span>, 05970889 (2000). On reconsideration, the Commission focused on the high level of the agency officials involved in negotiations and their assurances that the oral agreement would be ratified. The Commission also found that because of the passage of time, it was necessary to alter one of the terms of the agreement and enforce it accordingly:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the first time, with its request for reconsideration, the agency submits a copy of the settlement agreement that was prepared by its Office of Human Resources. The terms of that settlement agreement are similar <span id="Page_412"></span>to those presented by complainant's attorney--i.e., being placed in excused absence status, $60,000 in a lump sum settlement, complainant's retirement effective June 27, 1997, attorney's fees of $10,000, a letter of recommendation, carry over of unused leave, and the withdrawal of complainant's EEO complaints. The agency's version does not include that provision concerning outside employment which the previous decision found unenforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the passage of time since the settlement agreement oriGINAted, some provisions must be reexamined and clarified. As an initial matter, the Commission notes that it is apparent that the provision of excused absence was meant to enable complainant to retire with 30 years of service. This information is gleaned from the agency's announcement of complainant's retirement which references 30 years, along with complainant's SF-171 which indicates he has 3 years of military service and commenced his federal employment in 1970. Given that as of the date of complainant's response to the agency's request for reconsideration--which was beyond his oriGINAl intended retirement date--complainant was still employed by the agency, the Commission finds that any further provision of excused absence or administrative leave would no longer serve its intended purpose. As such, the Commission is not ordering the agency to comply with that provision. However, complainant need not repay any excused or administrative leave he has already received. In addition, the time period connected with the provision dealing with the carry over of unused leave has expired. Further, given that the $60,000 was meant to be paid while complainant was in an excused absence status, the Commission finds that the payment was meant to be compensatory damages. Lastly, the Commission notes that complainant's attorney may submit a request for additional costs associated with getting the agreement enforced, complainant's appeal and the response to the agency's request for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also relied on the doctrines of ratification and detrimental reliance in <span class="Italic">Baker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60741 (2006). In that case, a management official told the complainant he would provide overtime opportunities. The record also contained a letter from an EEO specialist stating the management official had agreed to provide the overtime opportunities if he would withdraw his complaint. Although the Commission found that a settlement agreement existed, it also found the agreement was too vague to be enforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Ormond v. Attorney General</span>, 01A10913 (2001), the Commission declined to enforce an alleged oral agreement where the complainant submitted evidence that he had withdrawn his complaint and an affidavit from his supervisor stating her understanding that he was assigned to a position because of an EEO settlement agreement. In declining to find that a settlement agreement existed, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ormond</span> observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant contends that the parties entered into a verbal informal settlement agreement in August 1995, in resolution of his EEO complaint. Complainant claims that he entered into an agreement with the agency, as represented by the EEO Investigator and Person A, the former warden. Complainant cites an affidavit provided during the investigation of a subsequent EEO complaint (Agency Case No. P-98-9343) as evidence that a verbal agreement was reached. According to complainant, the parties agreed that he would remain in the slot of Employee Development Assistant in the Employee Development Department as long as the slot was open. Complainant claimed that he was reassigned in September 1997 in breach of the verbal agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision the agency found that complainant withdrew his complaint on August 30, 1995. The agency refused to reinstate the withdrawn complaint. In response to the appeal, the agency contends that the parties never entered into a settlement agreement. The agency states that it has no record of a written settlement agreement regarding complainant's EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the complaint was withdrawn by complainant on August 30, 1995. The record contains the affidavit for Agency Case No. P-98-9343 which complainant relies on to support his argument that an informal resolution was reached. In the affidavit, Person B, the Employee Development Manager, states that when complainant was reassigned to her office in 1995, she was told that this was done pursuant to an EEO settlement. Person B also states that it was her understanding that an agreement was signed by Person A and complainant regarding complainant's assignment to the Employee Development Department.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record and the arguments of both parties, we find that there was no binding settlement agreement. The record reveals that the purported agreement was not reduced to writing as required by 29 CFR 1614.603. The Commission notes that we have only upheld the validity of a settlement agreement entered into orally in one type of situation, i.e., when a verbal agreement is reached during a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge. <span class="Italic">Acree v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900784 (October 4, 1990). In upholding the validity of the oral agreement in <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, the Commission relied on the fact that the hearing transcript evidenced the agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, there is no writing to rely on, nor do we have a hearing transcript or its equivalent on which to bind the parties. With regard to complainant's attempt to rely on the affidavit of Person B, we find that this is insufficient evidence to indicate that a settlement was reached with regard to his EEO complaint. The Commission notes that absent written confirmation of the terms of an agreement, it is unable to enforce a settlement agreement. Accordingly, we find that there was no written settlement agreement as provided for in 1614.603 and that there was no valid oral agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Maldonado v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120082173 (2008), the Commission rejected a detrimental reliance argument in finding that a supposed oral agreement reached in mediation did not constitute a settlement of the complaint. The complainant argued that the administrative judge erred in granting summary judgment to the agency while mediation was ongoing. The complainant's representative contended that he reached an oral agreement with the agency representative who was supposed to forward a draft of the agreement for review. The Commission distinguished <span class="Italic">Maldonado</span> from <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> finding that the complainant had not shown she had altered her position as a result of the alleged oral agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a threshold matter, the Commission finds that a settlement agreement did not exist between the parties that resolved the instant matter. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.603 provides, in relevant part, that "fairly settlement reached shall be in writing and signed by both parties..." The record does not contain a written, signed settlement agreement. Oral agreements reached in the presence of an administrative judge and entered into the hearing transcript are binding. <span class="Italic">Acree v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900784 (October 4, 1990). The requirement that the agreement be entered into a hearing transcript is central to finding that the agreement is binding. <span class="Italic">See Newman v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930458 (July 1, 1993) (holding that no agreement had been reached and stating, in contrast to <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, "we do not have the equivalent to the hearing transcript on which to bind the parties."). In the instant matter, there is no evidence of an oral agreement reached and transcribed in the presence of an administrative judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that CR alleges that the concept of detrimental reliance should apply in this matter in order to enforce a verbal agreement, we disagree. While CR cites to <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01965078 (May 16, 1997), in support of his assertion that detrimental reliance should apply to enforce an oral settlement agreement, we find that <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> is distinguishable from the instant matter. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> the Commission found that complainant altered his position by retiring from the agency in response to oral assurances from agency officials that a settlement agreement had been reached. In the instant matter, we do not find that complainant significantly altered her position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, 0120131842 (2013), the Commission rejected the complainant's contention that the parties had on oral agreement where it was made clear to her that final approval of the agreement was contingent upon review by the Office of General Counsel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Commission finds that the parties merely drafted terms. However, it was clearly indicated to Complainant that the formal written agreement would not be completed until the terms were reviewed by OGC. Following OGC's approval, a completed document would have been created which would have been signed by the parties, thereby resolving the complaint. We note on appeal that Complainant asserted that the Commission has previously held that parties can create a binding agreement without a written contract citing <span class="Italic">Page v. Broadcasting Bd. Of Gov</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A15340 (March 20, 2003). We find that the current matter is distinguished from the situation in <span class="Italic">Page</span>. The parties in <span class="Italic">Page</span> had the authority to settle the complaint and were in the process to do so when the EEOC Administrative Judge issued a decision in the Agency's favor. The Agency in <span class="Italic">Page</span> indicated its intention to breach the settlement agreement, thereby acknowledging that the parties had an agreement. This is not the situation in the instant case. Here, Complainant was clearly informed that there was no agreement until OGC reviewed the terms. Consequently, the agency's decision finding no breach, was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant can render an otherwise invalid settlement agreement valid through acceptance of benefits provided under the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Franke v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05A2058 (2003), the Commission relied on the doctrine of subsequent ratification in finding that even though its previous decision in the case determined that the settlement agreement was invalid, the complainant subsequently ratified the agreement by accepting and cashing of $20,000 payment made under the provisions of the settlement. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Franke</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts addressing the analogous issue involving ratification of a release have held that: "A party cannot be permitted to retain the benefits received under a contract and at the same time escape the obligations imposed by the contract.... If a releasor, therefore, retains the consideration after learning that the release is voidable, her continued retention of the benefits constitutes a ratification of the release." (Citations omitted)<span class="Italic">. Grillet v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 927 F.2d 217 (5th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span id="Page_413"></span>also <span class="Italic">Haslach v. Security Pacific Bank Oregon</span>, 57 FEP Cases 702 (D. Or. 1991) ("this retention of the benefit is sufficient to amount to a ratification of the release agreement").</p>
