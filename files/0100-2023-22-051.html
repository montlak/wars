<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-51"><span class="space">b.</span> Pay Band Systems</h5>
<p class="noindent">Pay bands allow for similar jobs to be grouped together within a certain salary range, while also allowing for some pay differentials based on an employee's education, experience, training, level of responsibility and other considerations. EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 10 Compensation Discrimination, No. 915.003 (2000), discusses defenses to Equal Pay Act claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;"Factor Other Than Sex"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EPA permits a compensation differential based on a factor other than sex. While this defense encompasses a wide array of possible factors, the employer must establish that a gender-neutral factor, applied consistently, in fact explains the compensation disparity. An employer asserting a "factor other than sex" defense also must show that the factor is related to job requirements or otherwise is beneficial to the employer's business. Moreover, the factor must be used reasonably in light of the employer's stated business purpose as well as its other practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following are examples of justifications that employers have asserted as factors other than sex, along with a discussion of the appropriate analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Education, Experience, Training, and Ability</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the relative education, experience, training, and/or ability of individual jobholders are not relevant to determining whether their jobs require equal skill, these factors can, in some cases, justify a compensation disparity. Employers can offer higher compensation to applicants and employees who have greater education, experience, training, or ability where the qualification is related to job performance or otherwise benefits the employer's business. Such a qualification would not justify higher compensation if the employer was not aware of it when it set the compensation, or if the employer does not consistently rely on such a qualification. Furthermore, the difference in education, experience, training, or ability must correspond to the compensation disparity. Thus, a very slight difference in experience would not justify a significant compensation disparity. Moreover, continued reliance on pre-hire qualifications is less reasonable the longer the lower paid employee has performed at a level substantially equal to, or greater than, his or her counterpart.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Karen L. v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 2019004749 (2020), provides a good example of a pay band defense in the context of an Equal Pay Claim. In that case, a regional geodetic advisor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration alleged that she was paid less than her male counterpart. The agency defended that the pay differential was based on a factor other than sex, namely the agency's pay band system that set a salary range for each position. The agency further defended its position with evidence that the male employee was more experienced than the complainant. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Karen L</span>. found that the agency proved that the pay differential was based on a factor other than sex:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States Supreme Court articulated the requirements for establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under the EPA in <span class="Italic">Corning Glass Works v. Brennan</span>. 417 U.S. 188 (1974). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of a violation under the EPA, a complainant must show that she or he received less pay than an individual of the opposite sex for equal work, requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility, under similar working conditions within the same establishment. <span class="Italic">Sheppard v. EEOC</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A02919 (September 12, 2000), <span class="Italic">req. for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A10076 (August 12, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a complainant has met this burden, an employer may avoid liability only by showing that the difference in pay is justified under one of the four affirmative defenses set forth in the EPA: (1) a seniority system; (2) a merit system; (3) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production of work (also referred to as an incentive or piecework system); or, (4) a differential based on any factor other than sex. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EPA permits a compensation differential based on a factor other than sex. In order to establish this defense, an Agency must establish that a gender-neutral factor, applied consistently, in fact explains the compensation disparity. EEOC Compliance Manual, Chapter 10: Compensation Discrimination, No. 915.003, (EEOC Compliance Manual) at 10-IV (December 5, 2000). The Agency must also show that the factor is related to job requirements or otherwise is beneficial to the Agency's business and used reasonably in light of the Agency's stated business purpose as well as its other practices. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720040139, <span class="Italic">req. for recons. den</span>., 0520070616 (July 25, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Employers can offer higher compensation to applicants and employees who have greater education, experience, training, or ability where the qualification is related to job performance or otherwise benefits the employer's business." EEOC Compliance Manual at 10-IV. The Commission has noted that such a qualification would not justify higher compensation if the employer was not aware of it when it set the compensation, or if the employer does not consistently rely on such a qualification. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Furthermore, the difference in education, experience, training, or ability must correspond to the compensation disparity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission has recognized that continued reliance on pre-hiring qualifications is less reasonable the longer the lower paid employee has performed at a level substantially equal to, or greater than, his or her counterpart. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Agency conceded that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under the EPA. Thus, the burden shifts the employer to establish that the difference in pay is justified under one of the four affirmative defenses set forth in the EPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find the Agency has shown that the difference in pay was based on a factor other than sex. Specifically, the record shows that the Agency operates under a pay band system that sets the salary range for each position. The Geodesist position at issue was within the ZP-IV level. Within the Agency's pay band system, there were different intervals for each level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional Geodetic Advisor position ranged from intervals 1-3 for new appointees. While the initial offer for Comparative 1 was at the interval 1 level, during negotiations Comparative 1 cited his 25 years of relevant experience and his good reputation in the Agency, industry, academics, and internationally as reasons he should receive a higher salary within interval 2. The record reveals the Agency found Comparative 1 had highly specialized knowledge and experience in the geodetic sciences and was considered a mid-career employee. The Agency had a "significant gap" in coverage for the Regional Geodetic Advisor program in California. The record reflects that the Agency determined based on his knowledge of geodesy and of California in particular it believed he could begin work with immediate effect. Thus, the Agency ultimately offered and Comparative 1 accepted a salary of $118,000. The Agency also offered and Comparative 1 accepted a recruitment incentive in the amount of $10,000. The justification for the recruitment incentive noted that Comparative 1, with regard to the unique knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the Geodetic Regional Advisor, "not only meets all of the criteria, but far surpasses them with the depth of his career experience in geospatial and geodetic research and its applied application."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the initial offer to Complainant in 2015, also in interval 1, was $3,000 more than the initial offer to Comparative 1. Like Comparative 1, Complainant was afforded an opportunity to negotiate a higher salary. During her negotiations, Complainant cited her: (1) willingness to relocate to a different city; (2) the known challenges associated with recruiting a qualified and retainable candidate in this region; (3) the heightened difficulty of performing the basic duties of this position in a region with minimal existing NGS resources and tools; (4) her loss of considerable leave accrual should she accept the position; (5) her loss of a previously negotiated position reclassification to a higher salary level; and (6) loss of established tele-commuting privileges. Complainant noted while her present title is Geologist she spent the majority of her career dealing with geospatial topics: has worked with GNSS in applied scientific settings for nearly 10 years; has been processing survey-quality geodetic data since 2007; possesses over 10 years of science and outreach experience in regular instructional roles as a teaching assistant, guest lecturer and invited speaker; has experience in identifying requirements and opportunities for new geodetic procedures in Alaska, as demonstrated by her design and release of the Alaska Tidal Datum Portal; and has spent the last five years leading and managing extended field projects in Alaska that require high-accuracy geodetic data-collection. After considering Complainant's justifications, the Agency determined Complainant would <span id="Page_1022"></span>only be paid at the entry level. The Agency offered and Complainant accepted a salary increase to $100,000, at the higher end of interval 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find the Agency has shown that the difference in pay between Complainant and Comparative 1 was based on a factor other than sex, namely that the Agency determined that Comparative 1 had significantly more directly related expertise and experience when he was first hired as a Geodesist in 2014. We find that both Complainant and Comparative 1 were afforded the opportunity and both engaged in extensive negotiations regarding their starting salaries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In advancing his justification for a higher salary, Comparative 1 cited his high level of 25 years of experience and cited his good reputation in the Agency, industry, academics, and internationally. During her salary negotiations, Complainant focused on the challenges with relocating, her loss of leave, her loss of telecommuting privileges, the general challenges of recruiting for the regions, and noted her significantly less time performing geospatial duties. The Agency found Comparative 1's approximately 12 years of more experience that Complainant, including directly-related work experience, and from a directly-related field of study placed him in the interval 2, mid-career level. In contrast, Complainant's less overall experience and lesser directly-related experience resulted in her placement in interval 1, entry level. Despite Complainant's contentions, we find no evidence of gender bias in negotiations. Even considering as true Complainant's contention that Person D treated her in a dismissive and rude manner when she sought information about the hiring process, we note that Person D was a facilitator in the negotiation process and not an ultimate decision-maker on the starting salary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding Complainant's salary subsequent to her initial hiring, the record reveals that both Complainant and Comparative 1's performances were subject to annual reviews to determine any salary increase based on pay for performance. The record reflects that both Complainant and Comparative 1 were viewed as high performers, as indicated on their evaluations. We note that subsequent to Complainant's hiring in 2015, in FY 2016 Complainant received a lower performance score of 81 compared to Comparative 1's score of 84 and she received a percentage salary increase of 4.60% while Comparative 1 received an increase of 3.94%. Complainant received a higher bonus of $1,200 that year while Comparative 1 received a $700 bonus. In FY 2017 and FY 2018 both Complainant and Comparative 1 received the same performance scores and the same bonus amounts. However, Complainant received a higher salary increase of 4.70% in FY 2017 while Comparative 1 received a 3.76% increase. In FY 2018 Complainant received a 4.56% salary increase while Comparative 1 received a 2.74% increase. The Agency has established that the continued gap in the pay between Complainant and Comparative 1, was due to the initial pay which was set after negotiations which resulted in Comparative 1 being placed in interval 2 and Complainant starting in the lower interval 1. We find the Agency has established that its performance-based salary increase system is a gender-neutral factor, applied consistently, and explain the compensation disparity between Complainant and Comparative 1. For these same reasons, we find any claim of sex-based wage discrimination under Title VII must fail.</p>
