<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-50_1"><span class="space">1.</span> The "Relevant Position"</h4>
<p class="noindent">[T]he term 'position'" is not limited to the position held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held. <span class="Italic">Jade R. v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0720170032 (2018). In that case, the complainant had functioned successfully in her position for 25 years when the agency reassigned her after her husband was promoted, reasoning that she could not be supervised by her spouse. Following this reassignment, the complainant's performance declined until she became unable to function in the new position. She made repeated requests to management for assistance with the new position, but the agency failed to engage in the interactive process to determine whether there was a reasonable accommodation available that would have allowed her to effectively perform the essential functions of the new position. The Commission found that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Jade R.</span> was a qualified individual and explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record shows that Complainant was employed by the Agency beginning in November 1987, and at the time of the events at issue, she was assigned to the position of Surface Mining Reclamations Specialist working as a Title V inspector. The record further shows that in August, 2012, after Complainant's husband was promoted to a supervisory position, management reassigned Complainant from Title V inspector to Title IV inspector, for the stated reason that Complainant could not be supervised by her spouse. Following this reassignment (which, the AJ found, Complainant objected to), Complainant's performance began to decline until she ceased being able to function in the position. The record shows that Complainant made repeated requests to management for assistance with the new position, but that the Agency failed to engage in the interactive process to determine whether there was a reasonable accommodation available that would have allowed her to effectively perform the essential functions of the new position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ noted that the Agency stipulated that Complainant had a disability covered under the Rehabilitation Act. The AJ also found that the Agency was aware of Complainant's bipolar disorder and that Complainant had performed well in her position for over 25 years before she was transferred. We concur with the AJ's finding that Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability. In so finding, we note that the discussion of "qualified" does not end at Complainant's position of record. The term "qualified individual with a disability," with respect to employment, is defined as an individual with a disability who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The term "position" is not limited to the position held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held as a result of reassignment. Therefore, in determining whether an employee is "qualified," an agency must look beyond the position which the employee presently encumbers. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities</span> <span class="Italic">Act (Enforcement Guidance--Reasonable Accommodation</span>), No. 915.002 (revised October 17, 2002); <span class="Italic">see Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act</span>, Appendix, to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630.2(o).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, it is clear that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability as she had been performing effectively in her prior position for more than twenty-five years. Additionally, we concur with the AJ's finding that the Agency was aware of Complainant's disability, and that by transferring her into a new position, the Agency created the circumstances under which Complainant's performance began to deteriorate. Further, when it became evident that she was no longer able to perform the essential functions of the new position without a reasonable accommodation, despite Complainant's requests for assistance, the Agency failed to engage in the interactive process. Accordingly, we conclude that the AJ's finding that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission previously noted in its appendix guidance to Part 1630, it is the condition of the complainant at the time of the disputed personnel action that is relevant for the purposes of determining whether that complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. Depending on the nature of the case--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, whether it is an initial selection or promotion case, or a request for reasonable accommodation in an existing position--the relevant position for purposes of determining whether a complainant is a qualified individual with a disability can be either the position the complainant presently has or one that he or she seeks. In the former federal sector regulations at Part 1614, this was expressed as the "position in question." In the ADA regulations, this is expressed as "the employment position such individual holds or desires,..." For example, when an employee alleges that he was not promoted because of his disability, the "position in question" is not the position currently held by the employee. It is the position the employee sought through promotion. <span class="Italic">Kahout v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954900 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">"Where an employee has performed a modified position for an extended amount of time, that is the position which is considered for purposes of deciding whether the employee is a qualified individual with a disability." <span class="Italic">Britany C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021001940 (2022); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Velva B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0520180094 &#x0026; 0520180095 (2018). For instance, in <span class="Italic">Britany C</span>., the complainant, who, for years, worked under a modified assignment, alleged disability discrimination when the agency did not allow her to work. The <span id="Page_1154"></span>agency used the non-modified job to determine whether the complainant was a qualified individual and found that she was not qualified because she couldn't perform the essential functions of that job. The Commission explained the modified position should have been used in the analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since December 2010, until being told to go home on July 5, 2019, Complainant worked in the same Modified Assignment (Limited Duty). ROI, Affidavit A, at 18, Bates No. 107 (HRM Manager's July 22, 2019 letter to Complainant). Her duties included spreading mail to carrier routes, casing mail, and nixie mail. The December 2010 Offer of Modified Assignment indicated its physical requirements were lifting, pushing/pulling not to exceed 20 pounds for 2 to 3 hours, reaching above the shoulder for 2 hours, and standing/walking for 3 to 4 hours. This indicates Complainant's medical limitations were the above. The job was six hours daily. ROI, Ex. 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While staying in the same Modified Assignment, her daily hours increased to eight on February 15, 2011. ROI, Affidavit A, at 10, Bates No. 109 (Complainant's statement) and at 28, Bates No. 127 (letter dated December 12, 2012, documenting a grievance settlement). On July 2, 2019, Complainant's restrictions were similar, except the length of time she could stand and walk substantially decreased.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An impairment includes any physiological disorder or condition, such as musculoskeletal. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(h)(1). Complainant's long term bilateral leg, knee and ankle sprains, and lumbosacral sprain are an impairment. Major life activities including walking, standing, lifting and reaching are all impacted by her impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(h)(2)(i)(1)(i). "Substantially limits" is construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the ADA, and is not meant to be a demanding standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (means same as above) at (h)(2)(i)(2)(i)(1)(i). We find that Complainant has met this standard and is an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be a "qualified" individual with a disability, the individual must satisfy the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of their position or one they desire and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). As noted above, the Agency found that Complainant was not qualified because with her medical limitations she was unable to perform the essential functions of her (non-modified) Mail Handler position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an employee has performed a modified position for an extended amount of time, that is the position which is considered for purposes of deciding whether the employee is a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">Velva B. v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request Nos. 0520180094 &#x0026; 0520180095 (Mar. 9, 2018). Complainant performed her Modified Assignment over eight years before she was told to stop. Because the record is devoid of evidence that she was unable to perform the duties of this modified position, she is a "qualified" individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">See Huddleson v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090005 (Apr. 4, 2011) (decision contains same language).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In September 2019, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) accepted Complainant's recurrence of disability claim based on the Agency's withdrawal of her (December 2010) Modified Assignment. It awarded her wage loss compensation for total disability from July 5, 2019 through July 31, 2019. ROI, Affidavit A, at 21, Bates No. 120 (OWCP award letter).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the need for an accommodation is not obvious, an employer, before making a reasonable accommodation, may require that the individual with a disability submit documentation on the need for accommodation. Appendix to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630--Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 1630.9, last &#x00B6;. This also applies to the type of accommodation. Since Complainant's most recent medical documentation on file was from January 2011, the Agency had a right to ask, in June 2019, that she submit an updated doctor's note on her current medical restrictions, and require this before offering her a new accommodation--which the Agency decided would be another Modified Assignment within her medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that S2 told Complainant that when she submitted her updated medical limitations, she could return to work. S2 explained he did not allow Complainant to work on July 5, 2019, because her restrictions in the updated medical documentation she submitted (that day) were unclear, and she submitted revised medical restrictions after July 31, 2019. Complainant resumed working on August 1, 2019. This Statement implies that as soon as Complainant submitted acceptable updated medical documentation, she would be assigned work. This is what Complainant believed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant writes that after she submitted the July 2, 2019 documentation regarding her updated medical restrictions on July 5, 2019, she was not asked for additional documentation. She rhetorically asks the Agency to show her the revised doctor's note on which the new July 2019 Offer of Modified Assignment was based. <span class="Italic">See</span> Complainant's handwritten comments on the FAD, pp. 17, 19. There is no evidence in the record that S2 asked Complainant to submit another doctor's note, nor is there one in the record dated after July 2, 2019. Language in the July 2019 Offer of Modified Assignment paperwork explicitly stated it was based on Complainant's July 2, 2019 medical documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After Complainant was not permitted to work on July 5, 2019, she filed a grievance. Counselor's Report, at 5, Bates No. 63 (Grievance Summary--Step 1). The Grievance Summary, which is signed by S1 reflects the Step 1 meeting was on July 12, 2019, and the Step 1 answer was made on July 16, 2019. It recounts that management indicated Complainant's July 2, 2019 medical restriction letter was unacceptable because it did not say how long she could push/pull/lift/sit. In their EEO investigative affidavits, S1 and S2 did not explain why the July 2, 2019 medical restriction letter was inadequate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Agency's finding that management did not offer Complainant a new Modified Assignment earlier because the July 2, 2019 medical restriction letter she submitted on July 5, 2019, was inadequate. The Agency's Offer of Modified Assignment dated July 17, 2019 and signed on July 25, 2019, was based on the above medical restriction letter, not a later one--of which there is none in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in Complainant's July 2019 grievance, the union argued that Complainant should have been permitted to work in her old Modified Assignment until things were sorted out, and the HRM Manager's letter to Complainant dated July 22, 2019, stated HRM was reviewing her old Modified Assignment to see if a revision was necessary after a recent arbitration award. The HRM Manager separately stated he did not know why Complainant was not allowed to work in her prior limited duty assignment from July 5, 2019 through July 31, 2019. We find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that management's reasons not allowing Complainant to work between July 5, 2019 and July 31, 2019, are not persuasive because it had the options to temporarily allow her to continue working within her old modified assignment and to offer her a new modified assignment earlier.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Huddleson v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090005 (Apr. 4, 2011), the Agency accommodated a complainant's disability with modified job offers for several years. In April 2005, the Agency abolished the complainant's bid position and he was given a new modified assignment outside his medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant informed management of this. The EEOC found discrimination because the Agency did not show it would have been an undue hardship to continue to accommodate the complainant with work within his medical restrictions. We find Huddleson applies to Complainant's case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a thorough review of the record, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant when it did not reasonably accommodate her disabilities by allowing her to work from July 5, 2019--July 31, 2019. In light of our finding of discrimination based on failure to reasonably accommodate, we need not address whether Complainant was also subjected to unlawful disparate treatment.</p>
