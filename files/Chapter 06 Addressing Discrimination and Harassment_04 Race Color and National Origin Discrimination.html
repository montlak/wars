<h2 class="h2">RACE, COLOR, AND NATIONAL ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">You are responsible for treating of all your employees fairly. This includes avoiding and preventing all forms of discrimination in the workplace. When you do this, you also protect your agency from EEO liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and other laws prohibiting discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Can you define race, color, and national origin? There is potential for confusion about the meaning of all three terms, because in the United States we often use color as a synonym for race. When someone is identified as "black," are we talking about color or race? As a practical matter, there is normally no difference. What about "Hispanic"? Does this designate race or national origin?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not only do we regard these terms as at least partly interchangeable in our ordinary language, we don't agree on what they mean. For example, there is no generally agreed upon definition of race. Is someone with one African-American parent and one white parent African-American, white, or biracial? What about someone with a Spanish-sounding name? Is that enough to establish a national origin, regardless of what else may be in the ethnic mix? Is a Muslim employee of Middle Eastern origin protected because of national origin or because of religion?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We often use the term "ethnic groups" to cover all these distinctions. This works, but the term doesn't have an anchor in EEO law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How important is it to make these distinctions? On a practical supervisory level, it isn't very important. Like almost all supervisors, you probably have no intention of discriminating against anyone for any reason. In any case, employees who file EEO complaints that claim discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, or any combination of the three, are free to label their categories any way they wish.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Disparate treatment and harassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Discrimination against members of ethnic groups, however defined, is no different than discrimination on any other protected basis, such as sex or religion. There are two broad categories of discriminatory conduct:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Disparate treatment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Harassment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> As with other forms of discrimination, it is possible for members of a group to discriminate against other members of the same group. And you also need to look out for what some courts call "reverse discrimination." White employees, for example, may be discriminated against by minorities, and by other white employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some supervisors mistakenly believe that EEO law requires them "to treat all employees the same." This is not the case. Your position requires you to treat all employees fairly. That's not the same thing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You can and should treat employees differently, based on differences in their conduct and performance records, experience, and qualifications. That's how our "merit system" works. When you select employees to hire, promote, or train, when you give performance ratings -- even when you make routine work assignments -- you make decisions that treat one employee (or job candidate) differently than another. That's your job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You are most likely to run into EEO difficulties if employees do not understand why they have been treated differently, and decide:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You must be prejudiced against them because they belong to a particular ethnic group.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> And you have treated other employees better because they do not belong to that group or do belong to some other group.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">For example, an African-American employee might allege you selected an Asian employee for a promotion because you did not want to promote an African-American, or because you wanted to promote an Asian (or both).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You cannot avoid this sort of thing by going out of your way to treat members of certain groups favorably because you are afraid of EEO complaints. In itself, this is unfair treatment, and a violation of your merit system responsibilities. It also won't work. After all, every one of your employees is protected under EEO law in one way or another.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The best way to avoid misunderstandings of this sort -- beyond actually treating employees fairly -- is to communicate the reasons for your decisions. You may explain to disappointed employees, for example, that more years on the job will increase their chances of promotion, that their qualifications were not as suitable as those of the successful candidate, or that their performance record was insufficient. This would be a good chance to further explain what a disappointed employee could do to increase the chance of future promotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sometimes the problem is not a misunderstanding -- the problem is an angry employee looking for a reason, any reason -- to appeal a decision you have made. Such employees may file straightforward grievances claiming unfair treatment. Or they may make EEO complaints of "disparate treatment." That's the technical term for complaints in which employees allege you treated them less favorably than similarly situated -- or "comparable" -- employees who did not belong to their race, color, national origin, or other protected group.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Make documented decisions based on merit.</b> What do you do to protect yourself and your agency from this type of complaint? All you have to do is ask yourself two simple questions. Do it often enough, and the process will become automatic, as it should be for every federal manager.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pose these questions to yourself every time you make a decision about employees:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> On what considerations do I base this decision?</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Can I prove my reasons with documentation?</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">So long as you don't, in fact, discriminate, and can show a legitimate justification for your actions, you have no reason for concern. As for documentation, sometimes it comes with the decision. For example, a good performance appraisal is sufficient documentation for a performance rating.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In other cases that may create disappointment, such as promotion or training selections, it is best to nail down the documentation at the time of the decision, if only through notes for your own record. Also make sure your documented justification is specific, rather than vague and general ("The successful candidate was more qualified"). Then you know you will have what you need if an employee wants an explanation, or if you have to defend your decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Watch your language.</b> You will be on shaky ground if a complaining employee can come up with any evidence you have ever expressed any derogatory opinions about the ethnic group in which the employee claims membership. That will make it more difficult to avoid the impression your justification was just a "pretext for discrimination." An explanation like "I was only joking" will not help.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Harassment.</b> As a federal manager, it is your obligation to see to it that inappropriate or offensive words, actions, or materials directed at employees based on race, color, national origin or any other EEO category (or anything else, for that matter) have no place in your unit. When incidents are severe enough or pervasive enough, they are considered harassment, and harassment is a form of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your primary strategy here is to promptly stop inappropriate behavior, to model appropriate behavior yourself, and to take every issue seriously from the moment it is raised. Just don't overreact and treat employees unfairly simply because other employees have complained to you. You are always well-advised to seek advice from your agency HR and EEO specialists.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> Some incidents are considered so severe that even one instance of the use of the wrong word, the display of the wrong symbol, or the telling of the wrong joke at the expense of an ethnic group is enough to trigger a successful claim of harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The following examples are taken from actual cases that appeared before the EEOC:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An African-American medical service assistant for the Veterans Health Administration was subjected to race-based harassment by a coworker. On two occasions, the coworker commented that he "only got his job because he is black" and that she was afraid of him because "he was a big black man." The EEOC found that the coworker's disproportionate reaction of pressing the panic button to summon agency police after a dispute about breaks, along with her comments about the assistant's race, were sufficient to establish her discriminatory motive. The VA was liable because it failed to take appropriate action.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The Department of Defense subjected an African-American store checker to race discrimination when it terminated him for having an altercation with a coworker during his probationary period. A Caucasian employee, who had an altercation with the same coworker, received no disciplinary action.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Race and color discrimination</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Is there a meaningful difference between race and color when it comes to discrimination? Color discrimination occurs when individuals are treated unfairly because of their skin color. It is considered to be an independent type of discrimination that can exist in conjunction with or apart from race discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For example, it is possible for a dark-skinned African-American to claim color discrimination by alleging that lighter-skinned African-Americans are better treated. But this rarely comes up. Generally, there is no practical difference between race and color. We'll discuss them together and for convenience, we'll use "race" to stand for both categories.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When Americans think about race discrimination, we generally think first about discrimination aimed against African-Americans, because of the legacy of slavery, the consistent and open discrimination against African-Americans over time, and the strong feelings that issues of "black and white" tend to arouse in us.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because of the legacy of slavery, discrimination, and persecution, even one particularly serious incident of a derogatory term or symbols used against African-Americans may make your agency liable for race discrimination. The word "boy" for example, when applied to an African-American man, is regarded as a racial epithet and may be quite enough to establish harassment. The display of a noose (or of a drawing of a noose), which evokes the history of lynching, is also sufficient.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Hot buttons.</b> Other racial groups have their own hot-button issues (as do nationalities and members of religious groups). Don't worry, you don't have to make a study of racist literature to find out what is offensive. You ought to be able to spot both harassing intent and harassing effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is the fact of harassment that should be important to you, not your opinion on the particular method used. You may see harmless kidding around, but the intended target is likely to have an entirely different viewpoint.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a manager, it is your job to avoid racial discrimination and to spot harassing behavior, stop it, and make sure it doesn't happen again. In some cases, discipline against the offenders may be necessary. Prompt, appropriate action is the best way to avoid an EEO complaint or, if one is raised, to avoid agency liability. It is also the best way to avoid recurrence.</p>
<h3 class="h3">National origin discrimination</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">National origin refers to the country or region where a person was born or from which a person's ancestors came. The EEOC defines national origin discrimination as treating an individual less favorably because they are from a certain place or has the physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics of a particular national origin (ethnic) group; or using an employment policy or practice that disproportionately impacts people on the basis of national origin and is not shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not only is discrimination based on national origin prohibited, but Title VII also protects individuals from discrimination based on incorrect information, perception, or conclusions about their (or their ancestors') ethnicity or nationality. For example, treating an employee less favorably because of the perception that they are Hispanic/Latino would be national origin discrimination, even if they are not in fact Hispanic/Latino.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The same holds true for individuals who associate with others of a particular national origin. National origin discrimination includes treating someone less favorably at work because they associate with (for example, marries) someone of a particular national origin.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Job assignments is another area of concern. It is unlawful for you to assign or refuse to assign employees to certain jobs, facilities, locations, tasks, or geographic areas; deny promotions; physically isolate employees; or otherwise segregate workers into jobs based on their national origin. For example, Title VII prohibits assigning employees to non-customer contact jobs or to back room jobs based on their national origin.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In some cases, it may not be necessary to name a particular country. "Hispanic," for example, refers to a point of origin of a person or a person's ancestors in any Spanish-speaking country. Nor is it necessary that all an employee's ancestors come from a particular national group for the employee to claim protection under the national origin provision of Title VII.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees have claimed protection on the grounds of membership in "national origin groups" originating in the territory of the United States, but they have not been successful. There is no protection under Title VII for regional origins marked by, for example, a pronounced accent or even an historical claim of nationhood. "Confederate Americans" and natives of a particular state or region are not protected from national origin discrimination. But Cajuns may be protected because of their origin outside U.S. borders in Canada.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Native Americans.</b> Because of their history as recognized nations with which the United States concluded treaties, Native American groups form an exception to the exclusion of points of origin within the United States. But remember, it is never a good idea to treat people unfairly, on whatever basis. It is a violation of your responsibility as a supervisor, and just because someone can't make a successful EEO complaint doesn't mean they can't file another type of appeal or grievance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Some special aspects.</b> The same protections against disparate treatment and harassment apply in regard to national origin as apply when race and color are considered. However, four aspects of national origin discrimination need special attention:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Language discrimination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Accent discrimination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> National dress.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Language discrimination.</b> The "linguistic characteristics" of national origin groups are specifically protected. Why should it be a problem that a federal employee speaks a language other than English? Generally, it is neither a problem, nor any of your business. Agencies that have attempted to impose "English-only rules" in their workplaces have usually failed. Supervisors have no general right to expect employees who have another language in common to speak only English, whether on duty or during breaks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Suppose supervisors who don't know the language in which their employees are communicating feel shut out, or wonder if they are the ones being talked about? What if other employees resent communications by their colleagues in languages they don't understand? Suppose some employees find it offensive that others "don't bother to speak English"?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The short answer is that none of these attitudes have a basis in law or public policy. If you try to act on the basis of resentment against those employees who communicate with each other in languages other than English, or if you do not stop your employees from expressing their resentment, you could be named in a national origin discrimination complaint.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Does this mean an English-only rule is never acceptable? Not at all. It just means that the rule must be:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Justified by a clear business necessity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Limited to circumstances linked to that necessity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Announced to employees with adequate notice.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">For example, it may be reasonable to expect employees engaged in the formal conduct of agency business, such as serving the public or giving and receiving instructions, to speak only English to avoid misunderstandings and permit proper supervision. Just as employees engaged in serving the public can be expected to communicate with each other in a professional and business-like manner, and to avoid private communications of any kind, they can be expected to exchange their professional communications in English. It's also reasonable to require that employees not use another language to mock or purposely exclude their coworkers. Courtesy should be the rule.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The bottom line:</b> Avoid English-only rules whenever possible. They cause resentment among employees who would prefer to communicate in other languages they have in common, and may encourage those who would engage in the sort of harassing behavior that makes for EEO complaints. However, if there is a solid reason to adopt a sharply limited and clearly justified English-only rule, do it. Just be prepared to explain your action. As usual in such sensitive areas, a chat with your HR or EEO specialists in advance of any decision would be a good idea.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Accent discrimination.</b> Among the linguistic characteristics of national origin groups that are protected by law is the fact that some members of such groups speak English with distinctive "foreign accents." Harassment of employees because of their non-native accents in English is clearly national origin discrimination, and you have an obligation to prevent or to stop it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But what if an employee's or applicant's accent is so strong it makes the individual's spoken English difficult to understand? Can this be a factor in selection decisions? Can it even be grounds for removal?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To answer this question properly, you must evaluate:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The level and type of communication demands in the job.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the employee's speech is fairly evaluated as to its intelligibility.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The level, if any, to which the employee's speech intelligibility would present communication difficulties on the job, taking into account any provisions that could be made to overcome any difficulties in understanding the employee.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Before you make any decision, you should consider seriously just how hard the applicant or employee's English is to understand, not only for you, but for coworkers, members of the public, and others the individual may be required to speak with.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You also should consider the consequences of failure to communicate:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Are there serious safety issues, or have problems already occurred?</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Are there likely to be, or have there been, complaints about communication difficulties from your unit's internal or external customers? You need to be sure any complaints are objectively founded and not simply expressions of prejudice.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Are any problems likely to be long-term, or will they be overcome as a new hire works into a new job and a new work group? It may make a difference whether an employee is staffing a call center and making one-time contacts with members of the public (where a thick accent might make for serious problems), or working only with a group of colleagues (where initial difficulties are likely to be overcome with time).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Is it really an accent problem, or is the individual simply incapable of adequate expression in English? The latter problem is much harder to overcome, and may justify negative personnel actions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The bottom line:</b> These questions are very complex. A decision not to hire or to remove an employee from a position because of a foreign accent may be viewed as discriminatory and lead to a complaint. But if you must make that decision -- especially if there are safety or customer service issues -- you can go ahead. Just be sure that you are prepared to justify your actions, you can document problems that may have arisen, and the serious communications difficulties you claim really do exist outside your own ear. As with all sensitive personnel decisions, it is a good idea to consult HR in advance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>National dress.</b> Some employees prefer to wear items of clothing that distinguish their national origin. Often, but not always, these items are also worn for religious reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In general, such items should be permitted since they are protected cultural expressions of national origin. Any harassment of employees on this account would be discriminatory. However, they may be prohibited if they are a clear violation of a dress code applicable to all employees in certain positions (such as a uniform, or "business wear"). Members of national origin groups have no right to "reasonable accommodation" of their dress preferences. Members of religious groups <i>do</i> have such a right, and a dispute over the wearing of a Sikh turban, a Jewish skullcap or a Muslim headscarf would be decided on that basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Security requirements.</b> The validity of a security requirement or the substance of a security clearance decision are not subject to EEO considerations, so long as they are imposed according to the agencies' own procedures and regulations. This means that agencies have the right to impose security requirements that may deny security clearances or employment in some positions to people who are not U.S. citizens, who come from or have spent time in certain countries, or who have close relatives who live in certain countries.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">These rules may have a negative impact on national origin groups. However, a nonselection or other personnel decision based on the inability of an applicant to satisfy security requirements is not discriminatory.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nor is it normally your decision. It is made by those in your agency charged with making security determinations. The key here that the decision not to hire, to remove, or to reassign for security reasons is made because of security requirements based on a clear agency policy, typically as expressed in precise regulations or procedures. It cannot be based on your personal belief, or the belief of your employees, that "those people are unreliable" or "in times like these we ought to hire only real Americans." These attitudes lead straight to serious EEO trouble.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The following examples are taken from actual cases that appeared before the EEOC:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The complainant, a master behavior detection officer with the Transportation Security Administration, was subjected to harassment based on his age (60) and national origin (Irish). His supervisor subjected him to public ridicule about his age and national origin on an almost daily basis. The agency could not avoid liability because it failed to respond effectively to the complainant's repeated complaints.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The complainant, who was Native American, was subjected to a hostile work environment on the basis of her national origin even though slurs and remarks critical of Native Americans were not made directly to her.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The Department of Defense subjected the complainant, an auditor, to discrimination on the basis of national origin (Taiwanese) when, after a contractor complained of a "language barrier," it required her to communicate with the contractor through a supervisor or senior auditor. The agency imposed restrictions on the complainant without taking any steps to determine whether her communications were in fact not understandable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The rules against race, color and national origin discrimination are clear enough, but supervisors and managers regularly get into trouble because of a few simple mistakes that are easily avoided.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Waste your time trying to categorize employees or applicants into groups by race, color, or national origin.</b> Just make sure that you manage in a manner that takes into account the need to identify and eliminate barriers to equity. Also, be sure that you apply diversity, equity, and inclusion principles to your decision-making and that you immediately stop any harassment as soon as you become aware of it.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Justify your personnel decisions with vague or general reasons.</b> These may be regarded as "pretexts" for discrimination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Dismiss derogatory remarks, jokes, or symbols as unimportant.</b> Attacks aimed at ethnic groups are not harmless kidding around. Remember, some words and phrases you hear members of a group hurling at each other in a joking fashion are likely to be regarded as derogatory when used by people outside the group.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Overreact.</b> Just because an employee complains to you about "discrimination" or "harassment" by coworkers or subordinate supervisors doesn't mean it has occurred. All employees must be treated fairly. Investigate promptly, but with care and respect.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Engage in derogatory behavior yourself.</b> Not only does this open you to charges of harassment, and encourage your employees to behave similarly, it will make all your personnel decisions involving members of targeted groups suspect and make it likely your justifications will be dismissed as pretexts for discrimination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Give way to your own or your employees' impatience with foreign accents.</b> Just because you have to try a bit harder to understand an accent doesn't mean you are faced with serious communication difficulties. You must make an effort to understand.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Make your own "security decisions."</b> It doesn't matter if you think employees or applicants with certain national origins are "unreliable." These are matters for agency security policy and those charged with applying it.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Take adverse action against an employee who complains about race, color, or national origin discrimination or supports the claim of another employee.</b> It's against the law to retaliate against employees who raise claims of discrimination or take action to oppose discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What's the difference between "race" and "color"?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The EEOC generally defines color as pigmentation, complexion, or skin shade or tone, but individuals who file EEO complaints are free to self-identify as they wish. Color distinctions within a racial group can be significant and have formed the basis of complaints.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Is "Hispanic" a race or a national origin?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> It is usually regarded as a national origin, but employees who claim it as their race are free to do so. Even "Jewish" may be a self-identified race designation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can employees from certain regions of the United States claim "national origin" protection?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. The origin claimed must be outside the United States. Claims of historical nationhood for areas inside the present United States, such as "Confederate States of America" or "Republic of Texas," won't work. Native Americans, however, are regarded as a national origin group because of their special history, which included recognition of Native American nations by the United States through treaties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Is it possible for members of the majority to be unlawfully discriminated against by members of minority groups?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Although it is not a term used by the EEOC, this so-called "reverse discrimination" does happen, especially -- but not only -- in facilities or units where members of a minority group may be locally in the majority. Members of minority groups also discriminate against other minority groups. Reverse discrimination may also occur because of efforts to redress past discrimination by treating members of minority groups more favorably than the majority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can members of a race, color, or national origin group discriminate against other members of the same group?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What is my best defense against potential charges of discrimination because of race, color, or national origin in my personnel decisions?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Make sure you have a clear, rational, and specific justification for every decision, and that you are prepared to document it. Avoid vague or general justifications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What if I don't intend to discriminate? Can I still get into trouble?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes, you can, if your decision had a discriminatory effect and your justification seems flimsy. Of course, if you are known to have made derogatory remarks about the employee's group, your justification is less likely to be accepted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can a single incident trigger a successful complaint of harassment because of race, color, or national origin?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes, if it is severe enough. For example, referring to an African-American man as "boy" on only one occasion can be considered harassment. Other groups have other symbols or words to which they are specifically sensitive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Do I have a right to establish an English-only rule that covers my worksite?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Generally speaking, no. However, you do have a right to establish English-only rules in limited circumstances for a good business reason, like having employees speak English when working with customers who speak only English. But these rules are not a good idea unless they really are necessary, since they very often lead to EEO complaints. They create resentment on the part of speakers of languages other than English and may encourage harassment on the part of the English-only group. If English-only rules are imposed, adequate notice and full explanation should be given. Consult HR in advance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I ask an employee to improve his speech or refuse to hire an applicant because the individual has a foreign accent that's hard to understand?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You can and perhaps you should, but don't be surprised if you get an EEO complaint. It would be a good idea to consult HR in advance. Just make sure that the individual's accent:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Really is very hard to understand.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Causes performance problems.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Is likely to cause or has already caused serious communication problems even after some time in the job.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I base personnel decisions on national origin if I think there are security considerations involved?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No, not on your own. It is legitimate for agencies to impose security clearance and other security requirements that may have a negative effect on members of national origin groups by excluding them from certain jobs or assignments. However, these decisions must be made in accordance with policy by those charged with implementing security requirements. Individual managers or supervisors cannot make decisions based on their personal belief -- or the belief of their employees or customers -- that members of a particular national origin group are security risks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. If an employee finds a joke or statement offensive, is that harassment?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> A statement or joke is not necessarily unlawful harassment just because an employee is offended. A comment that disparages a sports team may be offensive to a fan, but a person's status as a sports fan is not protected by law. The comment must refer to a group protected by EEO law to be discriminatory harassment. And jokes or comments made in passing that don't seriously affect the work environment may not create much of a problem. But this sort of thing can easily get out of hand, and then you will have a problem.</p>
