<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-7"><span class="space">C.</span> AGENCY KNOWLEDGE OF DISABILITY</h3>
<p class="noindent">The general rule is that an employee must make his or her employer aware of the need for reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation</span>, at pp. 51-52. "To request accommodation, an individual may use 'plain English' and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase 'reasonable accommodation.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, an employer should initiate the reasonable accommodation interactive process without being asked if the employer: (1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation. If the individual with a disability states that s/he does not need a reasonable accommodation, the employer will have fulfilled its obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 51. (Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a failure to provide reasonable accommodation is alleged, the employee must show that the employer had knowledge of his or her disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Tyree R. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120131617 (2015) ("Complainant stated that after he received the larger computer screen, he did not tell management that he still had a problem. ...Rather, he stated that he intended to make it an issue if and when management indicated his job was in peril. Upon review, we find Complainant failed to show that the Agency denied him a reasonable accommodation."); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, 0120120154 (2013) ("Even if Complainant could establish that his blurry vision or other manifestations of a disability caused his performance deficiencies, there is no evidence that a disability prevented Complainant from requesting a reasonable accommodation."); <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A41584 (2005) (agency under no obligation to accommodate depression where only request for accommodation was based on shoulder injury). The employer's obligation to accommodate the employee does not arise until it has knowledge of the disability, as the Statute specifically requires that an employer reasonably accommodate the known limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, unless it would be an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Handwerker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995465 (2000), the Commission set forth three situations that should prompt an agency to initiate the reasonable accommodation process. But the Commission also noted that when an employee declines reasonable accommodation or denies a need for accommodation, the agency's obligation ceases. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Handwerker</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that as a general rule, an employer is not required to ask whether a reasonable accommodation is needed when an employee has not asked for one. 29 CFR pt. 1630 app. &#x00A7; 1630.9. However an employer should initiate the reasonable accommodation interactive process without being asked if the employer: (1) knows that the employee has a disability; (2) knows or has reason to know that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability; and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation. If the employee states that he does not need a reasonable accommodation, the employer will have fulfilled its obligation<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Employment Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, question 39 at p. 51, (March 1, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that while the agency knew that complainant had disabilities, there is no evidence to support a finding that his poor performance was connected to his disabilities or that complainant wanted an accommodation but was in some way prevented from requesting one. Management's testimony supports a finding that complainant was unwilling to engage in any rational dialogue about his performance and did not want to be treated differently from other employees. Moreover, <span id="Page_1267"></span>we find that there is no evidence to support a finding that complainant needed an accommodation to perform the essential functions of his job.... Accordingly, we do not find that complainant ever requested or needed a reasonable accommodation or that the agency was obligated to inquire as to whether he did. We also agree with the AJ's conclusion that it would be purely speculative to infer that because complainant received reasonable accommodation two years later, he required one at the time of the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Knowledge requires only that the complainant disclose the disability to the agency. The agency cannot deny having knowledge of a complainant's disability simply because it does not believe the complainant or disagrees with the reason the complainant gives for his or her disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03970123 (1998) ("Agency officials may not have liked the reasons that gave rise to petitioner's mental condition, i.e., conflicts in the workplace, but those reasons do not negate its legitimacy."). But a complainant cannot withhold information about his or her disability from the agency and still be able to support a failure to provide reasonable accommodation claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mikovich v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11150 (2002) (agency did not deny reasonable accommodation where there was no evidence that it had knowledge of the complainant's disability at the time of his removal).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not sufficient that a supervisor knows something is wrong with an employee. The agency's duty to provide reasonable accommodation does not arise until it is or should be aware that a disabling condition exists. In <span class="Italic">Pascale v. Department of Navy</span>, 03850092 (1986), the Commission upheld a decision of the MSPB finding no disability discrimination when the diagnosis of appellant's condition was not available until two months after she was demoted. The evidence showed that the employee's supervisor knew something was wrong, took no action on diminished work performance for more than one year, referred the employee to an assistance program for suspected drug or alcohol abuse, and eventually ordered a fitness for duty examination. The Commission determined that the agency made adequate efforts to find out whether the employee was ill and could not be faulted that the employee did not exhibit the classic symptoms of epilepsy. The agency's efforts in this case were laudable and cannot be criticized for lack of effort. Apparently, the Commission requires that a specific disability be identified even when the behavior of the employee clearly indicates a problem exists. There is some question as to whether the decision in this case advances the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. The employee was hospitalized with a "seizure disorder" at the time the adverse action became effective. Since epilepsy is controllable with treatment, there is some credence to the argument that the employee should have been given an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance subsequent to diagnosis and treatment. This is especially true with a condition such as epilepsy which can go undiagnosed for a period of time. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">McAuliffe v. Department of Treasury</span>, 01842354 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 01840158 (1987). In that case, the employee suffered from narcolepsy and was terminated for sleeping on the job. Although the employee made some notation of the disorder in his employment application, his supervisors were not aware of the condition and had never seen the application. Apparently, the employee never brought his condition to the attention of his supervisors when confronted with instances of sleeping on the job. Certainly, the supervisors cannot be faulted for disciplining the employee when they had no knowledge of his condition, but it also seems reasonable that noting such a condition on an employment application would be sufficient to notify the agency that some accommodation may be necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">The knowledge required is on the part of the agency and not any individual supervisor. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120132360 (2015), the agency had known about the complainant's attention deficient disorder since 2001 and had accommodated him by giving additional guidance and time on assignments. The complainant's supervisor alleged that he was unaware of the complainant's disability or his need for accommodation. The Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant contends that S1 knew or should have known of his request for accommodation. Complainant states that the Agency granted his request for accommodation on January 3, 2000, for his disability. Complainant further states that S1's June 6, 2011, assignment affected his disability because he was denied guidance, assistance, and additional time to work on the project. Complainant maintains that S1 has not provided him assistance, feedback, and guidance in accordance with his January 3, 2000, accommodation. Complainant states that S1 did not respond to his e-mails dated June 9, July 1, and September 15, 2011, for guidance and feedback with respect to the work he was performing on June 6th assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, according to S1, he was not aware that Complainant's disability was impacting his performance or that he needed accommodation with respect to the June 6, 2011, assignment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 90-91. S1 averred that Complainant never made a formal request for accommodation to him. Notwithstanding S1 contentions, we note that when requesting reasonable accommodation, an employee is not required to use the "magic" words "reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">See</span> Reasonable Accommodation Guidance, at Q.1. Instead, the employee need only inform the Agency that he or she needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Triplett-Graham v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120044720 (Feb. 24, 2006). Here, there is no dispute that the Agency was aware of Complainant's disability and ongoing need for accommodation dating back to January 3, 2000, when it granted his request. Therein, the Agency had granted Complainant's request for accommodation for his ADD based on his psychologist's recommendation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that an agency's duty to provide reasonable accommodation is ongoing. <span class="Italic">See</span> Reasonable Accommodation Guidance, Q.32. Even assuming that S1 was not aware of Complainant's disability, Agency management should have notified S1 of Complainant's reasonable accommodation and ongoing need for such when S1 became Complainant's permanent supervisor in 2003. The record reflects that neither S1 nor any other Agency official provided Complainant with accommodation with regard to the June 6th assignment. We note that Complainant sent S1 at least eight e-mails from June 9 through October 7, 2011, requesting assistance and direction with regard to the work he was performing. ROI, at 272-73, 292-99. The record contains no responses from S1 with respect to any of Complainant's e-mails. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is apparent that S1 neither responded to Complainant's e-mails nor provided him with any assistance with his work. S1 clearly did not engage in the interactive process with Complainant.4 S1 specifically does not dispute that he did not give feedback to Complainant or respond to his e-mails <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 94. We therefore find that Complainant has met his burden of establishing that he was denied reasonable accommodation for his disability as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sager v. Postmaster General</span>, 01982016 (2001), the Commission found the agency's obligation to reasonably accommodate the complainant's hearing impairment by providing an interpreter did not arise where the complainant did not tell the agency that his hearing aids were malfunctioning, he did not request an interpreter and there were no other circumstances that would have put the agency on notice that reasonable accommodation was required. Similarly, the agency knowing the complainant's status as a disabled veteran was not sufficient to put the agency on notice of any need for reasonable accommodation in <span class="Italic">Bustamonte v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A46063 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the complainant is not required to request a specific accommodation, the complainant must at least inform the agency of "the problems posed by the workplace barrier." <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Postmaster General</span>, 01980061 (2001).</p>
