<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-48"><span class="space">2.</span> Official Time Complaints</h4>
<p class="noindent">An allegation that a complainant has been aggrieved by the agency's denial of official time for her representative states a claim for relief. The failure to provide official time deprives an employee of his or her representative of choice and "falls within the ambit of a term, condition or privilege of employment." <span class="Italic">Tarry v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 05920653 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">What has been less than clear over the years is whether the complainant's representative, if an employee of the agency, is also aggrieved by the denial of official time. The most recent trend has been for the Commission to hold that only the complainant, and not his or her representative, has standing to bring a claim of discrimination based on denial of official time for the representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Palacois v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120131794 (2013). For example, in <span class="Italic">Cook v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12408 (2001), the Commission found that an allegation that the complainant was denied adequate time to work on a case as a representative, and required to work at a postal facility instead of his home, did not state a claim for relief. "We find that the complainant lacks standing to bring an EEO complaint, because such a claim lies with the complainant, not his or her representative." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A20032 (2003); <span class="Italic">Lopez-Rosende v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15348 (2002); <span class="Italic">Burns v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05339 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Petrin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986129 (1999), the Commission held a representative is not aggrieved by a denial of official time. Only the represented complainant is aggrieved. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Petrin</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has stated that an allegation pertaining to the denial of official time states a separately processable claim alleging a violation of the Commission's regulations, without requiring a determination of whether the action was motivated by discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Edwards v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 059605179 (December 23, 1996). However, the right to official time for a representative flows from the complainant, and, therefore, a denial of official time for a representative is properly raised by the complainant, and not the representative. We find with regard to those matters where appellant was acting as an EEO Representative on behalf of other individuals, appellant does not have standing to raise the issue of being denied official time. However, with respect to the EEO complaints where appellant was representing himself, appellant has standing to raise the issue of being denied official time.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, if the agency takes some action with respect to the representative other than the denial of official time, the representative is aggrieved for <span id="Page_675"></span>complaint purposes. For example, in <span class="Italic">Radin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A32117 (2003), the Commission found that a union steward stated a claim where he alleged that as a result of his EEO representative activities the agency no longer allowed him to stay after work hours to attend to union business and, unlike other employees, deprived him of use of a Life Planning Center and computer bidding off-the-clock. An action taken against a representative, however, does not aggrieve the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Perrine v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A50334 (2005), the Commission held that an allegation by a complainant that the agency had made adverse entries in his representative's personnel file did not state a claim for relief. The Commission rejected the complainant's argument that the adverse entries had a chilling effect on him.</p>
<p class="noindent">The denial of official time to a representative can aggrieve that individual if it is also alleged the denial is part of a pattern and practice that creates a hostile environment and discourage other employees from engaging in representative activities. In <span class="Italic">McDermott v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a52803.txt">01A52803</a> (2005), the Commission reversed the dismissal of a complaint by a representative alleging denial of official time as part of pattern and practice holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that the agency's decision misdefined complainant's claim. Based on a review of the record, including complainant's statement, we find that a fair reading of complainant's claim reflects that complainant addresses a hostile work environment harassment claim. Specifically, we find that complainant alleged that as a pattern of harassment and retaliation, management unlawfully interfered with her EEO process when the agency took adverse actions against her representative in an EEO hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee's right to EEO representation is sufficiently connected to a term, condition, or privilege of employment so that abridgement of that right by the agency will render an employee aggrieved.<span class="Italic"> See Storey v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970843 (August 5, 1999). The Commission finds that complainant's allegation states a claim of interference with the EEO process. The Commission has held that unlawful retaliation for EEO activity can occur whenever the employer acts in response to protected EEO activity in such way that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity in the future. Even if complainant successfully initiates the EEO process in spite of the interference, complainant could be aggrieved. <span class="Italic">See Binseel v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970584 (October 8, 1998);<span class="Italic"> see also Man v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941344 (June 27, 1996). Accordingly, the agency's final decision dismissing complainant's complaint is reversed. The complaint is hereby remanded to the agency for further processing in accordance with this decision and the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Previously, the Commission held that failure to accord the representative a reasonable amount of official time could lead to two separate complaints; one by the employee and one by the representative. In <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01904019 (1990), the Commission determined that such complaints are not identical, even though they raise the same issues, because they are not filed by the same party:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant contends that he is aggrieved under 29 CFR 1613.212(a), in that his own complaint has been denied proper processing by lack of sufficient official time given to his representative. Appellant contends that such denial not only violates 29 CFR 1613.214(b)(2), which prescribes that appellant's representative shall be given "a reasonable amount of official time" to prepare appellant's complaint but also by 29 CFR 1613.261(a), which states in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainants [and] their representatives. . .shall be free from restraint. . .at any stage in the presentation and processing of a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission determines that not allowing appellant's representative a sufficient amount of official time to prepare appellant's formal complaint as granted by 29 CFR 1613.214(b)(2), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, also amounts to unlawful restraint upon appellant's right to file a complaint pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.261(a), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Accordingly, the Commission finds that appellant is an "aggrieved employee" under 29 CFR 1613.212(a), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, <span class="Italic">Givens v. USPS</span>, 01842668 (1986), the Commission held that an employee who alleges that he was required to use his day off to engage in representation of a fellow employee had stated a complaint within the EEO purview.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a subsequent case, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Morman v. Secretary of Air Force,</span> 01964629 (1997)<span class="Italic">, supra</span>, attempted to bring a class action complaint on behalf of all federal employees with discrimination claims, alleging that the agency routinely misinterpreted EEO regulation regarding representation of coworkers. In <span class="Italic">Morman v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01996146 (2002), the Commission dismissed some claims of the complaint because they were identical to the previous claims and dismissed the remainder of the claims because they found the complainant was not aggrieved by restrictions on his official time for representation purposes. The Commission in the latter <span class="Italic">Morman</span> case explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a May 21, 1999 decision, the AJ construed the instant complaint as claiming that the agency improperly disqualified complainant from representing EEO complainants and that the agency continuously misinterpreted the Commission's regulations on EEO representation. The AJ also determined that the class complaint did not define a "class," but found that complainant claimed that the agency's improper limitation on EEO representation affects "all federal workers alleging discrimination." Based on this framing of the complaint, the AJ found that the Commission's decision in two prior companion cases rendered the instant complaint moot, precluding the need for a determination on class certification. Specifically, the AJ found that in <span class="Italic">Morman v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01963870 (March 17, 1997) (hereinafter referred to as "<span class="Italic">Morman</span>") and <span class="Italic">Binion v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01964629 (March 17, 1997), (hereinafter referred to as "<span class="Italic">Binion</span>"), the Commission held that the agency improperly disqualified complainant as an EEO representative and remanded both cases with the instructions to the agency to meet with complainant to determine a reasonable amount of official time to act as an EEO representative in future cases. The AJ then concluded that the agency should dismiss the class complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its final decision, the agency adopted the AJ's determination dismissing the complaint under 29 CFR 1614.107(a). The agency additionally determined that none of the criteria necessary for certification of a class action were satisfied. The agency dismissed the class complaint, and forwarded complainant's individual complaint to the EEO office for further processing as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant now appeals this determination. In response, the agency repeats the arguments as set forth in its decision, and additionally avers that complainant has no standing to bring a complaint on behalf of those who were purportedly denied the benefit of his EEO representation, or otherwise disadvantaged by the agency's purportedly improper administration of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"> Dismissal of the class complaint on the grounds provided in 29 CFR 1614.107(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, complainant must demonstrate that the class action complaint constitutes an actionable claim not subject to dismissal on any grounds provided in 29 CFR 1614.107(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(5) provides for the dismissal of a complaint when the issues raised therein are moot. To determine whether the issues raised in complainant's complaint are moot, the factfinder must ascertain whether: (1) it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur; and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged discrimination<span class="Italic">. See County of Los Angeles v. Davis,</span> 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979); <span class="Italic">Kuo v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970343 (July 10, 1998). Moreover, the Commission has long held that where a complainant has requested compensatory damages, the potential for said damages means that the matter cannot be dismissed as moot until the agency has at least given the complainant the opportunity to present evidence supporting his claim for compensatory damages and then has either awarded the damages or has shown that the complainant was not entitled to them<span class="Italic">. Hofmann v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970962 (October 28, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of this case, we find that the AJ improperly determined that the instant complaint must be dismissed on the grounds that it was rendered moot by <span class="Italic">Morman</span> and <span class="Italic">Binion</span>. Specifically, we find that the record contains no evidence describing the agency's compliance with the Commission's remand instructions in <span class="Italic">Morman</span> or <span class="Italic">Binion</span> sufficient to conclude that there is "no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur" or that this remedy "irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged discrimination." On the contrary, in footnote 1 of his decision, the AJ indicates that complainant filed several subsequent complaints in which he again claimed that the agency improperly precluded him from acting as an EEO representative. We also find that complainant claimed compensatory damages in the instant complaint. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the instant complaint is not moot, and that the AJ improperly determined that it should be dismissed on these grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, we find that the complaint, as framed by the AJ, must be dismissed on the grounds that it states the same claim that is pending before or has been decided by the agency or Commission<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(1). Specifically, we find that claims 2, 3, 4 and 6, as set forth above, concern complainant's claim that the agency improperly denied his request(s) for official time to act as an EEO representative, and that the Commission previously addressed this same matter in <span class="Italic">Morman</span> and <span class="Italic">Binion</span>. In this regard, we note that if the agency failed to fully comply with the remand instructions in these cases, complainant's recourse was to file an enforcement action with the Commission, not a class action complaint raising this same claim. Therefore, for these reasons, we AFFIRM the agency's dismissal of claims 2, 3, 4 and 6 pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.107(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(8) provides that an agency <span id="Page_676"></span>shall dismiss an entire complaint that alleges dissatisfaction with the processing of a previously filed complaint<span class="Italic">. See Trujillo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950177 (June 13, 1996). The Commission's Management Directive further specifies that if a complainant is dissatisfied with the processing of his EEO complaint, he must bring his allegations regarding the processing of this complaint to the appropriate agency officials<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEO Management Directive 110, (MD-110) p.5-25 (November 9, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claims 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9, as set forth above, we find that complainant claims that the agency improperly administers the EEO process to the detriment of himself as a complainant, as well as to the detriment of those complainants he represents or even possibly to the detriment of all federal employees. Accordingly, we find that these claims must be dismissed because they constitute "spin off" complaints under 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(8). Moreover, to the extent that any or all of the claims set forth above may be additionally construed as a claim that the agency's purported improper administration of the EEO process results in federal employees being deprived of complainant's personal representation, or that of other EEO representatives, we find that complainant has no standing regarding this matter. Instead, it is well settled that claims of improper denial or limitation of EEO representation lie with the complainant, not the EEO representative<span class="Italic">. See Ramage v. USPS,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A10053 (March 23, 2001). Therefore, we find that this claim must be dismissed for failure to state a claim under 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(1). Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the agency's dismissal of claims 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that the agency properly dismissed the instant complaint pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.107(a), and we AFFIRM that determination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, the employee can only protest the official time denied for preparation of his own complaint and not for the complaints of others. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Storey v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01965538 (1997) (an employee who alleges his representative was denied official time to prepare and present the employee's complaint has stated a claim).</p>
