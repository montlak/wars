<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-140"><span class="space">i.</span> $40,001-$50,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bowden v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A00360 (2000), the Commission awarded $45,000 in compensatory damages even though there were several causes for the complainant's emotional distress. The Commission found the agency's retaliatory conduct severely aggravated her symptoms, requiring her to seek ongoing mental health treatment, including medication for depression.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although compensatory damages are awarded to compensate the victim of discrimination for his or her suffering and not to punish the agency for its misconduct, it is reasonable to infer that the more egregious the discrimination, the more harm that is done. In awarding $45,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20063 (2003), the Commission noted, "[t]he more inherently degrading or humiliating the defendant's action is, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action."</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency award of $5,000 was increased by the Commission to $45,000 in <span class="Italic">Cottrell v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A30303.txt">01A30303</a> (2004). In <span class="Italic">Cottrell</span>, the Commission found there were multiple causes for the emotional distress suffered by the complainant. One interesting thing about the <span class="Italic">Cottrell</span> decision is the Commission's notation that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statements submitted by the complainant indicate she was highly traumatized by co-worker office gossip that followed discriminatory not being promoted. We note that multiple people apply for posted promotions, but only one can be selected. Vicious office gossip cannot fairly be said to be a natural outgrowth of not being the selectee for a promotion. The office gossip was a separate event, and there was not a finding of discrimination regarding it.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Servold v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120053029 (2007), the Commission increased an award of $30,000 in damages to $45,000 where the complainant was subjected to sexual comments by a coworker and, on three occasions, entered his office only to find him undressed. In <span class="Italic">Servold</span>, the Commission described the evidence of damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her statement, dated September 24, 2004, complainant averred that she had difficulty understanding how CW, who had gained her "total and complete confidence and trust as a co-worker, a special agent, a fellow Navy comrade, and a fellow believer and brother in Christ could do such a thing." She explained that she became very emotional due to the incidents and experienced shock, disbelief, intense betrayal, fear, anger, and sadness, followed by sorrow, depression and frustration about the events. She further asserted that she had difficulty concentrating and cried most of time. In addition, she maintained that, when she heard that CW was involved in the sexual harassment of other women in the office, she felt sick to her stomach, and for the next ten days, could not sleep. She described herself as very edgy and nervous, and noted that she would shake and her heart would race when people walked up behind her, especially males. She asserted that, even up until the day of her affidavit, she had nightmares and required an over-the-counter sleep aid. She also discussed her need to take a Life Skills course in order to assist her in coping with the incidents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's daughter stated that complainant has suffered a great deal of stress, misery, and torment, and that the strain has caused insomnia, which makes her mindless and exhausted. She further described her mother as high-strung and agitated. She noted that she too was affected, as she has had to assist her mother in dealing with recovery.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's father and brother described complainant as feeling nervousness and fear. Both stated that complainant would call them crying about the situation at work. She told them that she was fearful of losing her job, and both noted that she appeared to feel very helpless, was losing sleep, and was finding it hard to go to work and to concentrate. Her father stated that complainant was hurting emotionally and was getting sick. Her brother noted that the situation was causing her extreme stress and anxiety, and that the situation was becoming unbearable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two of complainant's friends also provided statements regarding complainant's emotional state. One friend described how complainant was having difficulty completing daily tasks because she exerted so much energy worrying about the incidents. She also described how complainant was constantly in fear that another similar incident might occur. This friend provided childcare for complainant so that she could attend counseling services. Complainant's other friend, who was also a coworker, averred that, during the time of the incident, he noticed that complainant seemed frightened to be alone in the office. He described her as being "hyper-vigilant, almost to the point of paranoia." He noted that she related to him that she had difficulty relaxing or sleeping in her off duty time, and that her preoccupations affected her daily life and work performance. He also recalled that complainant told him that she believed that CW had access to her home address and telephone number. As such, she told him that she feared for her personal safety as well as that of her family.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record further reflects that complainant attended 18 one-on-one counseling sessions from August 2002 to March 2003 due to the incidents. In numerous medical records, complainant's psychologist reported complainant's feelings of anxiety, sleep problems, agitation, fearfulness, and gastrointestinal problems. The psychologist noted that, during numerous counseling sessions, complainant described episodes of daily anxiety, increased stress, loss of sleep, depression, and feelings of being overwhelmed. Finally, the record reflects that complainant attended 24 group counseling courses at the Life Skills Learning Center to assist her in coping with the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant required 77 therapy sessions to help manage her major depression, the Commission increased an award of $8,000 in damages by the administrative judge to $45,000 in <span class="Italic">McNeese-Ards v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720090027 (2010). The Commission also noted that the complainant presented the testimony of several witnesses that after her duties were changed following an EEO complaint that the complainant became worried, withdrawn, depressed and fretful and that her emotional state had considerably deteriorated.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Leggett et al. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720120019 (2012), several female rural carriers were subjected to sexual harassment over a several year period of time by a coworker. The Commission increased an award of $40,000 to one of the complainants to $45,000 noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Michelle Laign-Robbins</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ awarded Complainant Laign-Robbins $40,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages from the harm she suffered as a result of the male coworker's harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted earlier, the AJ found that the male coworker's harassment of the Complainants began in approximately 2004. AJ's June 24, 2011 Decision at 2. Further, the AJ noted that the Postmaster stated that he first received complaints about the male coworker from the Complainants in 2003-2004. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that because of the coworker's harassment, Complainant Laign-Robbins began to see a therapist through the Agency's EAP Program in 2007. The EAP therapist noted in 2007 that Complainant was having anxiety attacks at work, she had a racing heart, trouble breathing, ringing ears, and felt edgy, irritable, and fearful. March 24, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 21. The therapist diagnosed her as having a generalized anxiety disorder and a panic disorder caused by the ongoing harassment at work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 22; 23. Complainant Laign-Robbins' physician ultimately prescribed her Lexapro. March 25, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 97. Further, following the February 4, 2008 incident, the EAP therapist met with all the Complainants as a group and diagnosed each of them, including Complainant Laign-Robbins, with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the workplace harassment. March 24, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 121-124.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant Laign-Robbins testified that the coworker's harassment made her feel threatened and she had nausea, severe headaches, queasiness, sleeplessness, and muscle spasms in the back, shoulder, and neck. March 25, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 91; 96. She testified that management's failure to address the male coworker's harassment made her feel very inconsequential. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 92. Complainant Laign-Robbins testified that while she is no longer in the environment and doesn't feel the affects of the male coworker's harassment as much, she still doesn't trust people and she is not as approachable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 100-101.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant Laign-Robbins' husband testified that during the time period of the male coworker's harassment his wife was less pleasant to be around, was irritable, and cried about the harassment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 120-121. Complainant Laign-Robbins' daughter testified that during the relevant time of the harassment her mother was moody, more reserved, and it caused a strain on their relationship because they no longer communicated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 124-125. The record also reflects that Complainant Laign-Robbins also experienced deaths in the family during the time of the male coworker's harassment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 120.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, including evidence not specifically mentioned herein, we find an award of $45,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into <span id="Page_1867"></span>consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Servold v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120053029 (March 29, 2007) (Complainant was awarded $45,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages after a hostile work environment based on sex caused her to feel stress, misery, torment, and insomnia); <span class="Italic">Powell v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A50989 (March 3, 2006) (Complainant was awarded $45,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages when the hostile work environment caused emotional distress. The medical documentation attributed additional factors besides just the discrimination to her medical disorders); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070018 (April 24, 2007) (Complainant was awarded $45,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages when the sexual harassment had a significant emotional impact for her, and testimony by family members substantiated her claim). Accordingly, we conclude that an award of $45,000 will adequately compensate Complainant for the physical and emotional harm she suffered as a result of the male coworker's harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Greg M. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120160345 (2018), increased a $5,000 award to $50,000 where the complainant alleged that due the agency's discrimination "he suffered stress and emotional harm daily for two years in the workplace and after his retirement,...the discrimination caused his sleep to be disrupted with nightmares, made him not want to go to work, made him 'pissed off,' caused him to gain 100 pounds, caused stomach pain and panic attacks, and made him feel hopeless and suicidal,...the discrimination made him withdraw from his wife of 27 years, his children, and other people, [and] his home life 'sucks' now."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ward-Jenkins v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01961483 (1999), the Commission considered the request for $255,000 in nonpecuniary damages, but ultimately awarded only $50,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant testified that subsequent to the reassignment, she became depressed and irritable, lost energy and interest, and abandoned her recreational and social activities. Appellant testified that her involvement in her daughter's school activities decreased on account of her loss of energy and interest. Appellant testified that she experienced anxiety and distress, withdrawal, loss of enjoyment in activities, difficulty focusing and concentrating, insomnia and nightmares, and weight gain. Appellant testified that in 1992 she contemplated committing suicide. Appellant acknowledged that she did not seek counseling until after the conclusion of the liability phase of these proceedings, but testified that it was because she had not realized earlier that she needed counseling....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two lay witnesses who knew appellant during this period corroborated her testimony regarding the change in her personality following her reassignment. The witnesses also confirmed that appellant became unkempt in her appearance, and gained a substantial amount of weight (about 100 pounds) over two years....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by appellant, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $50,000. This amount takes into account the severity and duration of the harm done to appellant by the reassignment, and accounts for the fact that the harm done by the discrimination was an aggravation of a pre-existing condition. Further, this amount takes into account that, unlike cases where greater damages were awarded, appellant's injury did not render her totally incapacitated either for work or in her personal life....</p>
<p class="noindent">Without any medical evidence and based on the testimony of the complainant, family members, and friends, the Commission upheld an agency award of $50,000 for emotional distress in <span class="Italic">Meyer v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01984033 (1999). The Commission further noted that the duration of the emotional distress spanned a two-year period of time while the complainant was under the offending supervisor and that her condition improved when she was placed under new supervision. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Meyer</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to nonpecuniary damages, the agency indicated that appellant produced substantial evidence bearing on injury and causation, which supported a finding of a causal connection between the agency's actions and the resulting deterioration of her emotional condition. After a review of statements from appellant, her friends, and her daughter, and considering the duration of her stress, pain, humiliation, and suffering of approximately 2 years, the agency concluded that appellant was entitled to $50,000.00. The agency noted that in arriving at this amount, it considered the length of time appellant was assigned to the responsible supervisor, the severity of his discriminatory work place behavior towards appellant, and the resulting emotional and physical stress suffered by appellant. The agency further noted that it also considered the statements from appellant's daughter and friends that since being removed from the responsible supervisor's surveillance and control, she began to improve and although "not yet normal...was moving in that direction."</p>
<p class="noindent">From this, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Meyer</span> concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful consideration of the facts in this case, we find that the agency arrived at a fair determination when it awarded appellant nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $50,000.00, pursuant to the settlement agreement. In reaching this decision, we considered a number of factors including: the nature, severity, and duration of the discrimination, and the nature, severity, and duration of appellant's emotional stress and depression and related symptoms, including the post polio syndrome. Specifically, we have carefully examined appellant's explanation of her emotional distress from the incidents complained of based on her statement and supporting information from her friends and daughter. We also considered the fact that appellant did not provide any medical documents pertaining to her physical or mental conditions, including her post polio syndrome. Based on these considerations, we find that $50,000.00 is a proper award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Yeh v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01973721 (2000), the Commission awarded $50,000 in compensatory damages where the complainant was required to seek long-term psychiatric and physical care, including taking antidepressants, and the harm was still ongoing at the time of the decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $50,000 was approved by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01976921 (2000), where the period of harassment lasted three years and the complainant continued to suffer from depression for at least four years after the harassment ended. The Commission noted that the complainant received treatment for clinical depression, including medication, and the complainant's physician attributed that depression to the harassment. The evaluation of the complainant's physician was corroborated by several witnesses who testified that "she has lost the zeal she formerly held for her job and continues to suffer from depression and sadness when she thinks about the harassment she endured." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In addition to depression, the complainant's symptoms included insomnia and other anxiety-related conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01971511 (2000), the Commission awarded $50,000 in damages where the complainant suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and depression, and her psychiatrist reported her symptoms would continue for an indefinite period of time. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching the above amount, the Commission has considered many factors. For example, we considered the severity of the hostile environment that complainant was subjected to during the eleven months at issue. We also considered the nature, severity, and duration of complainant's emotional distress and related symptoms. During the period at issue, complainant, on several occasions, suffered chest pains, irregular breathing, and was unable to care for her daughter throughout the Summer of 1993. She also had to consult with a psychiatrist for treatment of stress and, on December 16 and 17, 1993, she had to go to the emergency room. Her family members also outlined the distress that she underwent during the period. As noted above, complainant's psychiatrist found that she suffered from post traumatic stress disorder, major depression, and paranoia, which he found was related to the harassment she was subjected to.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the agency, we also find that the plain meaning of the agreement, that the agency would pay "proven compensatory damages," allows for the payment of future non-pecuniary damages, i.e., those that arose after the agreement was signed but which are shown to be related to the matters addressed in the complaints. Thus, our total award of $50,000.00 reflects Doctor J's statement that complainant would, for an indefinite period of time, have recurring nightmares, insomnia, flashbacks, nervousness, impaired concentration, periods of sadness, feelings of emptiness, anxiety, and a sensation of being unfairly persecuted.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $50,000 in compensatory damages in <span class="Italic">Dukart v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986798 (2001), where the complainant presented both medical and testimonial evidence that she suffered an extended period of depression and anxiety. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Dukart</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a February 13, 1998 affidavit complainant averred that, because of the PM's harassment she felt hopeless, confused, fearful, angry, and was visibly shaking. She stated that she suffered an inability to concentrate and could not function enough to concentrate on leisurely activities such as card playing. She stated that she had an inability to urinate due to tenseness, and had paranoid and suicidal thoughts, sleeplessness, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, hair loss including the hair on her eye brows, and was divorced from her husband in 1995 as a result of her anxieties. She stated that she would start to shake violently when she talked to others. Complainant averred that, although she made attempts to work, she was unable to hold gainful employment since she retired from the agency based on her physician's advice. She stated that prior to the harassment, she was a productive, ambitious, active, self-confident woman, but is now shaky, emotionally distraught, and mentally confused. She averred that since November 1997, she had been working with her physician to reduce the amount of medication she takes. She stated that she is still in the process of recovering.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's husband averred that prior to working with the PM at the agency, complainant was an energetic, enthusiastic, self-confident <span id="Page_1868"></span>person. He averred she was happy when she was hired by the agency but that there were drastic changes in his wife's behavior during and following the period of harassment. He stated that she came home from work crying and emotionally upset, because the PM raised his voice and stood very close to her while belittling her work ability. He stated that she began having trouble eating and sleeping, and was very nervous. He continued that at the time when complainant's physician recommended that she retire, she would cry for no apparent reason, eat very little, shake continuously, and maintain an inconsistent sleep pattern. She began to think the phone was bugged and that people were following her. He said that following her resignation from the agency, he thought that complainant's condition would improve but it did not. He stated that complainant moved in and out of their home for no apparent reason. He stated that she is still unable to hold a job and will still get a lost look on her face.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, the Commission finds that complainant's statements, the statement of her husband and her doctor all support her contention that her depression and anxiety were caused by the PM's harassment and discrimination. The Commission found the harassment to be on-going and pervasive in its prior decision. Given the severity and duration of complainant's emotional and physical damage including weight loss, hair loss, sleeplessness, fatigue, an inability to urinate and an inability to concentrate which has affected her ability to find other meaningful work, we sustain complainant's claim for non-pecuniary damages of $50,000 as reasonable and comparable to awards in similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on its own case law, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990520 (2002), the Commission awarded $50,000 in damages where the complainant's depression was significant in duration, but the complainant had a preexisting condition at the time of his nonselection. In finding that the agency had erred in awarding $25,000 in damages, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Terrell</span>, the complainant sought compensatory damages in connection with the depression he experienced after not being selected for a particular position. As in Smith, the Commission awarded the complainant $25,000 in non-pecuniary damages for emotional distress. The Commission noted that the complainant had been experiencing numerous problems outside the workplace before the nonselection, including bankruptcy, marital difficulties, and his wife's illness. The Commission found that the nonselection exacerbated the complainant's pre-existing emotional and psychological problems, but to a limited extent. In awarding the complainant $25,000, the Commission took into consideration the presence of various outside factors and two-year duration of the complainant's harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Wallis</span> also had a history of depression before being subjected to a series of acts later found to be discriminatory. The complainant had experienced recurring episodes of depression several years after the incidents in question. The record also established that the complainant would need to be treated for depression for another five years. On that basis the Commission awarded the complainant $50,000 in non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, in the case <span class="Italic">Hogeland v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC No. 01976440 (June 14, 1999), the Commission awarded $25,000 in non-pecuniary because the agency's aggravation of the complainant's pre-existing condition was of limited duration (approximately one year). The Commission noted that the time-factor that contributed to the $50,000 award in Wallis was not present in that case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant is entitled to a non-pecuniary award of $50,000. While the agency is not responsible for complainant's pre-existing condition which began in the early 1980s, it is responsible for the actions it took which aggravated that condition. The record shows that after 1991, complainant's pre-existing seizure disorder, brain disorder and psychiatric disorder substantially worsened. Complainant's seizures increased in frequency and severity after 1991. Specifically, the record shows that complainant suffered frequent seizures at home and work. The seizure episodes included a moderate to severe pain in complainant's left side, a sleep disorder, loss of dexterity, tremors, facial spasms, disorientation, and impaired balance. Complainant was treated with anti-convulsant medication. In addition, the record shows that complainant was depressed, had homicidal/suicidal ideations, and suffered from crying spells. Complainant was treated for major depression with group and individual therapy and anti-depressant medication. Complainant had been hospitalized from January to March 1994 after a suicide attempt. After complainant's release from the hospital he was evaluated by a psychiatrist who found complainant chronically depressed. Complainant's psychiatric condition was described as moderate to severe. During this period the Veteran's Administration increased complainant's rating for his seizure disorder from 10% to 20% and increased his rating for his organic brain disorder from 10% to 30%.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency concluded that complainant's more severe symptoms lasted to about July 1997. While complainant argues that he continues to suffer and will continue to suffer permanently, a review of the record indicates that complainant's symptoms substantially decreased after July 1997. Although we agree that complainant was not symptom-free after July, 1997, we find the post July 1997 symptoms more akin to the pre-1991 symptoms. Accordingly, we find that the harm caused by the agency did not exist after July 1997. We note that there is no medical evidence in the record which supports the finding that the harm caused by the agency continued after July 1997. Accordingly, we find that complainant suffered harm for approximately 6 and 1/2 years (February 1991 through July 1997) as a result of the agency's failure to reasonably accommodate complainant. However, as indicated above, complainant can only be compensated for approximately 5 years and 7 months (from November 1991 through July 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the non-pecuniary award of $25,000 issued by the agency in its FAD improper because we find the harm that complainant suffered as a result of the agency's aggravation of his pre-existing condition to be of an extended duration, more akin to the facts in <span class="Italic">Wallis</span> than those in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, <span class="Italic">Terrell</span> or <span class="Italic">Hogeland</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $50,000 in compensatory damages was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Force v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01995221 (2002), where the complainant suffered significant emotional distress for some three and a half years that was expected to continue for approximately two more years as the result of sexual harassment and a discriminatory transfer. The complainant suffered from a mood disorder prior to the sexual harassment and also experienced personal and domestic problems, including a divorce, that were unrelated to the discrimination. In adjusting the administrative judge's award from $10,000 to $50,000 in nonpecuniary damages, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Force</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychologist's records serves as the basis for most of the evidence regarding her emotional distress, as complainant did not substantially testify at the hearing. Complainant's psychologist diagnosed complainant as suffering from PTSD, which he found was directly related to sexual harassment incurred on the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also reveals complainant was treated by her psychologist between June 1994 and March 1998 and by a psychiatrist between August 1994 and January 1998. In a May 1996 report from complainant's psychologist, he reported: "[I]n my opinion, occupational issues have severely impacted upon, and exacerbated the remission of any symptoms which might have been preexisting."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychologist testified that he did not begin to treat complainant until her work issues arose. He did acknowledge, however, that for eight to twelve months prior to this time, he saw complainant in order to get help with the adjustment of her children to the divorce, and her son's Attention Deficit Disorder. Throughout his testimony, the psychologist took the position that the overwhelming bulk of the stressors in complainant's life during this time was the sexual harassment. He maintained that prior to the sexual harassment, complainant was able to cope with her children's problems, her marital problems, and issues with her mother. According to the psychologist, any financial, parenting, social and family issues were intensified due to the sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, including the psychologist's reports and notes, we agree with the AJ and the agency that complainant suffered other stressors in her life at the time she was subjected to the sexual harassment. We do not find, however, that complainant's parenting or family stressors served as the basis for the majority of complainant's emotional distress during this time. In this regard, we note that we have previously applied to nonpecuniary damages, the theory that a tortfeasor takes his victim as he finds him<span class="Italic">. Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span> EEOC Request No. 05970336 (November 20, 1997). Specifically, we have found that when a party has a preexisting emotional condition which deteriorates as a result of the discriminatory conduct, the additional harm may be attributed to the respondent<span class="Italic">. Wallis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.,</span> 817 F.2d 1290, 1294 (7th Cir. 1987). We have also taken the position that, where a complaining party's emotional harm is due in part to personal difficulties which were not caused or exacerbated by the discriminatory conduct, the employer is liable only for the harm resulting from that conduct. Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at 12 (July 14, 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Vance v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company,</span> 863 F.2d 1503 (11th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the amount by which complainant's emotional condition was exacerbated by the sexual harassment, we note that the record reveals complainant was prescribed 10 mg of Prozac in early August 1994, approximately one month prior to the first instance of sexual harassment. However, complainant's dosage increased four times to 40 mg around the onset of the sexual harassment. In determining the award, we also find that complainant's transfer to Durham was a direct result of the discrimination. There is no indication in the record that complainant would have relocated her family to another city absent <span id="Page_1869"></span>the discrimination. As will be discussed below, the record reveals that the move placed a tremendous amount of stress on complainant as her entire support structure was in Fayetteville.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do note, however, that the record supports the notion that complainant suffered some emotional distress unrelated to the discrimination at the time she was in treatment. In that regard, we have reduced complainant's award to reflect that finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Calculation of Damages Payable</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his reports, complainant's psychologist states that complainant suffered from crying, anger, helplessness, and nightmares. Complainant reported that she was unable to sleep, yet also felt fatigued. She reported flashbacks and nightmares, and was fearful of retribution by the Director when she rejected his advances. Her psychologist reported that complainant appeared, at times, to suffer from the symptoms of depression. Complainant told him that she was confused, and had to focus on what she was doing in order to function on a daily basis. Complainant reported that she gained 30 pounds in six months. In her statement on appeal, complainant stated that she felt suicidal at times.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to her move to Durham, complainant reported that her children suffered from the adjustment due to the move. Complainant herself suffered from feelings of isolation and victimization in the sense that the agency did not help her in the transition. Once she moved to Durham, complainant also reported financial problems, which necessitated the exhaustion of her savings account.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Throughout complainant's treatment, however, complainant discussed other stressors in her life, including conflicts with her children, which her psychologist termed "normal adolescent issues." Complainant also mentioned sadness related to the anniversary of her father's death and conflict with her mother, who she described as "controlling." In addition, complainant discussed with her psychologist the effects of Hurricane Fran, which destroyed her house in the Durham area and necessitated her living in a motel for several weeks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychologist's reports from late in 1996 indicate that complainant was still suffering the effects of the sexual harassment, now two years after the onset of the sexual harassment. For instance, in October 1996, complainant reported that she still thought about the Director and continued having problems sleeping. She later reported feelings of anxiety anytime she went near the VA. Complainant's physician testified at the hearing in June 1998 that complainant will always have flashbacks, and that she required approximately two more years of therapy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his decision, the AJ found that $10,000 was the appropriate amount in which to compensate complainant for the emotional distress she suffered due to the sexual harassment. In support of this award, the agency cited to the AJ, <span class="Italic">Bever v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01953949 (October 31, 1996) ($15,000 in non-pecuniary damages) and <span class="Italic">Sinnot v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952872 (September 19, 1996)($20,000 awarded for non-pecuniary damages).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is a Commission goal to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases. In <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal NO. 01971851 (October 23, 1998), the Commission awarded $75,000 in non-pecuniary damages for compensation for the agency's retaliatory removal when she suffered pain and suffering over a four year period. This included anger, insomnia, flashbacks, nightmares, fear, fatigue, less confidence on the job, and intrusive bad thoughts. In <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997), we awarded $100,000 in non-pecuniary damages in order to compensate the complainant for severe psychological injuries over four years. The complainant's condition, which was expected to continue for an indeterminate period of time, included ongoing depression, frequent crying, concern for physical safety, loss of charm, lethargy, social withdrawal, concern for physical safety, recurring nightmares and memories of harassment, a damaged marriage, stomach distress, and headaches. In <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (October 14, 1998, the Commission awarded $125,000 in non-pecuniary damages for emotional distress, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> depression, anxiety, paranoia, confusion, moodiness, insomnia, social withdrawal, tearfulness, fatigue, loss of libido, loss of self-esteem, chest and stomach pains, digestive problems, and incidents of shortness of breath. The complainant in that case repeatedly sought medical treatment for her problems, including an invasive diagnostic procedure, after she was removed in 1993. The duration of the complainant's emotional and psychological distress and physical illness was found to be from November 21, 1991 to the date appellant was removed, on February 12, 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the severity and the duration of the psychological and physical injuries experienced by complainant in this case, as well as the length of her treatment, the awards the Commission has made in similar cases and the amount provided by the agency, we find that appellant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $50,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Ardjoman-Kermani v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996058 (2002), the Commission increased a $10,000 award by the administrative judge to $50,000 where the complainant was denied reasonable accommodation and subjected to a hostile environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the AJ properly determined that complainant established a nexus between the alleged harm and discrimination. Therefore, we must review whether or not the AJ's award of $10,000 was appropriate. Complainant has requested compensatory damages without providing a specified amount. Complainant testified at the hearing along with three co-workers as to the effect the discrimination had on her. In particular, the witnesses stated that they saw complainant become stressed and that she cried. Furthermore, they testified that her personality changed from being happy to being down. Complainant indicated that she sought medical treatment by the Psychologist and provided medical evidence reflecting her treatment. Further, the AJ noted that complainant received psychological counseling for eight months; the discrimination lasted for eighteen months; and the damage to her foot which was caused by the agency's failure to provide an effective accommodation was permanent. The AJ, however, failed to take into account the issues of disability-based harassment and of complainant's "diminished ability to work and her eventual disability retirement" in awarding compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that complainant was entitled to $10,000 based on the agency's failure to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. Based on our finding that complainant was subjected to unlawful harassment, we determine that complainant suffered addition injury. Taking into account the severity and duration of the harm suffered, we find that complainant is entitled to $50,000 in non-pecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Feris v. Environmental Prot. Agency,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983167 (September 18, 1998) (awarding $35,000 for agency's failure to accommodate complainant's disability over a period of time which resulted in tension, damage to self-esteem, anxiety, anger and sleeplessness); <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 ($75,000 in a failure to accommodate case which resulted in emotional harm to complainant which damaged his relationships with family and friends and reduced his quality of life, as well as resulting in some physical manifestations such as a digestive disorder); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) (awarding $80,000 to an employee who was denied a reassignment and not reasonably accommodated where he presented evidence that, over five years, he became depressed, withdrawn, hopeless about his ability to work independently, cynical, angry, and, during part of the time, experienced ringing in his ears, headaches, teeth grinding, and insomnia). Therefore, we conclude that the AJ properly determined that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages, however, we find that an award of $50,000 is more consistent with our case precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent">Social withdraw coupled with depression led the Commission to award $50,000 in compensatory damages to the complainant in <span class="Italic">Harvey v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120171079 (2018). In an interesting decision where relationships were at the heart of the award, the compensable injury in <span class="Italic">Blanca B. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120171031 (2018), involved the severing of the complainant's relationships with her family and her community at large due to the cultural stigma of having been sexually harassed. The Commission awarded $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Blanca B</span>., but the facts of the case are worth repeating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of events giving rise to this complaint, Complainant was employed as a contract Language &#x0026; Culture Instructor/Curriculum Developer at the Agency's Foreign Service Institute (FSI), School of Language Studies, Arabic Section in Arlington, Virginia. She started working there in April 2008.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 26, 2010, Complainant filed EEO Complaint 1 (DOS-F-037-10) alleging, in part, that the Agency discriminated against her based on her sex (female) when she was sexually harassed. On January 4, 2012, Complainant filed Complaint 2 (DOS-F-032-12) alleging discrimination when her teaching contract was not renewed after August 5, 2011, she was not selected for a full-time teaching position in September 2011, and due to her marriage to a Christian man, she was subjected to a hostile work environment by her colleagues, who called her a bitch and prostitute, the daughter of a dog, threw a shoe at her, and said that she "sold her religion."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant appealed a FAD on Complaints 1 and 2. In <span class="Italic">Blanca B. v. Dep't. of State</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151876 (July 7, 2016), the Commission ruled that Complainant's withdrawal of Complaint 2 was effective, and closed it. On Complaint 1, it found that Complainant was sexually harassed by her first line supervisor in the Arabic Section (S1). Specifically, in May 2008, S1 made a pass at Complainant designed to be construed as a joke, gave her unwarranted attention starting by June 2008, then moved on to sexual jokes and inviting her to a restaurant. By October 2008, things escalated with S1 asking Complainant intrusive questions about her sexual activity and making comments/asking questions designed to get her to talk about sex with him, then in December 2008, <span id="Page_1870"></span>pinching her cheeks and kissing her forehead. In February 2009, things progressed further when S1 put his hand on Complainant's buttock. In March 2009, S1 tried to move her hand to his penis, and in May 2009, repeatedly pressured Complainant to go to hotel. As partial remedy, the Commission ordered the Agency to gather evidence on compensatory damages for the sexual harassment, calculate damages, pay Complainant any damages calculated, and issue a new FAD on damages appealable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On her August 2016 compensatory damages remand statement, Complainant indicated as follows. Her social circle consisted entirely of Middle Eastern immigrants. Everybody she knows is connected in some way with FSI, either as an instructor or the family/close social circle thereof, and all local Arabic language instruction is in some way connected to FSI. S1 heads the FSI Arabic language program, and is highly respected and admired. The culture of her Middle Eastern community is very conservative and manifests by making all things sexual taboo and the subject of gossip. In her culture the man is blameless and not faulted for his sexual advances and women are supposed to control themselves and not encourage a man. This means the women is blamed for the man's advances. When people were interviewed for the 2009 sexual harassment inquiry, word quickly spread to her entire local Middle Eastern community because everyone who knows her knows S1. Blaming her, people labeled her as "dirty" and a "whore." It is socially dangerous for anyone in her culture to associate with someone carrying these labels, lest they be seen as approving and hence "dirty" as well. If she sees a former coworker in public, they turn their back on her, and she can't interact with the Iraqi community, her people. She has become a social pariah who nobody speaks and she literally has no friends. She married a Jordanian man (by September 2016, she knew him for more than four years and was married to him for three), and nobody came to her wedding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant continued as follows. Her family believes what occurred with S1 is her fault (her mother says she must have encouraged him), and blames her for damaging their reputation for saying S1 harassed her. She helped her mother and siblings immigrate to Virginia, and they now shun and won't speak to her, come to her house, and discard any gifts she gives them. Her mother won't visit her only grandchild, her two-year old daughter. Her husband's family was not directly connected to FSI, and liked her very much and they got along well. But about three years ago she attended an event with them at the Jordanian embassy where an FSI Arabic instructor saw her with them, came right up to them asking what they were doing with her, and when they responded they were family, told them about the harassment matter and said they should not associate with her. Since that day, she and her husband can't spend time with his family, and now she is afraid to be seen in public.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated as follows. The shunning dramatically cut her ability to earn an income because locally everyone who works as an Arabic language instructor is connected in one way or another to FSI--either as an Agency employee or working for a staffing firm that contracts with FSI, even if they serve in a different location. When her staffing firm originally placed her with FSI, it paid her $63,000 annually, and now it pays her $19 hourly part-time or as a substitute for clients not directly related to FSI. Since the time of her August 2016 statement, she lost $170,000 in wages, and asks for this amount in lost wages as pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On her emotional state, Complainant stated as follows. The harassment made her and continues to make her feel dirty, she can't stop herself from ruminating almost all the time about what S1 said and did and when she ruminates she feels like a "whore." She is very depressed, irritable, constantly angry, cries nightly, is exhausted all the time, sleeps poorly, has nightmares almost every night about S1 trying to break into her home, regularly has flashbacks about the harassment, and gained 40 pounds. Things were good with her current husband when they first married, but as the years passed she got depressed and angry all the time, and this is destroying their marriage--her husband is the only person who still speaks to her. Her husband often says, "you're not here, you're not with us," her self-esteem is bad, and she lost interest in sex and has not had it in more than a year. She is so sad and angry that she does not have a close connection with her two-year old daughter, is unable to take joy in her development and accomplishments, and while her daughter wants to play with her she does not have the energy to do so. She is a bad mother and worries that she is harming her daughter. Even people who might be willing to associate with her despite her social stigma are turned off because she is not fun to be around.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant continued as follows. Because of her anger, depression, and exhaustion, she cannot establish rapport with her students like she used too, her boss tells her she is unmotivated and he is right, and her performance is much lower, which also contributes to her lower income. She can't concentrate and it feels like her thoughts have slowed. She has panic attacks once or twice a week which make her sweaty and her heart race. She has thought often about suicide. She went to the hospital several months ago for pain, they found a lump in her abdomen which the doctor said might be cancer, but she has not had it checked because she does not care if she lives or dies. Before the harassment she was happy, had friends, and liked to go out. She does not like being alone but has no choice. She requests $300,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages for pain and suffering, loss of health, and damage to her reputation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that she has gone to counseling and seen a psychiatrist several times, can't afford to go regularly, and takes medication for mood. She asked for $5,000 in past pecuniary damages for medical bills, but submitted no receipts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's husband submitted a statement corroborating Complainant's statement from the time he met her and related as follows. Before they married, Complainant really enjoyed spending time with him, his family and friends. The gossip about what happened at FSI had not yet spread to his social circle. But after they married and his family learned about the sexual harassment at a Jordanian community event, they blamed Complainant and worried about their image, which was a turning point for her. Once they became socially isolated, Complainant started ruminating about the harassment, it consumes her, and this has continued for years. He had to quit his job to care for their toddler because Complainant can't take care of her--she does not have the energy. She is depressed, anxious, irritable, angry, can't concentrate, and spends most of her time sitting on the couch, does not play with their daughter because she is too depressed, and no longer cooks or takes care of herself. He corroborated Complainant's account about her nightmares, adding she wakes up from them crying. Several times when they have run errands like go to the grocery store, he has seen people who know Complainant turn their back on her, and she reacts by crying for days afterward, and avoids going out. She can't have friends because no one will associate with her. When he first knew Complainant, she was strong, confident, happy, social, and enjoyed activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Former Coworker 1 at FSI stated that when word got out about her sexual harassment complaint, people labeled her a slut, whore, and "bad woman," and she observed many of their colleagues shun her by refusing to acknowledge her greetings or speak to her, and even turn their back on her when she enters a room. Coworker 1 stated that she continued to acknowledge Complainant's greetings, and two coworkers angrily told her she should not do so. People gossip about Complainant to this day. She used to socialize with Complainant, and while she is in contact with her she has stopped socializing with her because she is difficult to be around in that she constantly talks about the sexual harassment and can't put it behind her. Previously, she was outgoing, lively, friendly, fun to be around and happy. Former Coworker 2 at FSI stated that after Complainant reported S1's sexual harassment, her reputation was destroyed--she witnessed coworkers call her a slut, and refuse to speak to her and turn their back on her call her a slut. When she tried to defend Complainant, coworkers said she is not respectable and she should not defend her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also submitted a September 2016 report by a psychologist prepared for litigation. The report was based on Complainant's compensatory damages affidavit and two one hour visits. She diagnosed Complainant with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which began in 2008, opined it was caused by sexual harassment at work, and that it was exacerbated by ridicule at work, social and familial ostracism, financial loss, and cultural characteristics that leverage shame and humiliation in response to sexual harassment. The psychologist reported that Complainant reported her suicidal ideation worsened in 2015, prompted by the lawsuit, the loss of her reputation and identity, and marital stress.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency awarded the complainant, in <span class="Italic">Blanca B</span>., $5,000 finding itself liable only as to the sexual harassment claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding non-pecuniary damages, the Agency found that it liable only for the finding that S1 sexually harassed Complainant, not the cultural reaction of her peers, family, her husband's family, and other members of the local Middle Eastern or Arabic speaking community. In support of this, the Agency cited <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120130174 (Sep. 5, 2014) (the complainant was discriminated against when after learning of an impending reduction-in-force, he was not selected for one of three slots of a supervisory position for which he applied. He requested $300,000 in nonpecuniary damages, averring that after he contacted an EEO counselor regarding his non-selection his anxiety and depression grew worse because his coworkers, including the three who were hired for the supervisory position and found out about his EEO activity, began to treat him negatively by refusing to talk to or eat in the break room with him. In affirming the agency's award of $5,000 in non-pecuniary damages, the Commission found that the non-selection was not the direct or proximate cause of the emotional harm described by Complainant. Rather, Complainant indicated that a separate source of alleged discriminatory conduct--coworker retaliatory harassment--was the direct and proximate cause of the emotional harm).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency added that Complainant alleged in Complaint 2 that her Muslim colleagues accused her of apostasy with a virulent reaction to her <span id="Page_1871"></span>perceived religious conversion--so the way she described her colleagues as treating her was not solely because of the sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing Commission caselaw, the Agency also found that a complainant cannot recover compensatory damages for emotional distress caused by participating in the EEO process. The Agency observes that the examining psychologist wrote in 2015, that Complainant's lawsuit contributed to worsening her suicidal ideation--this was when it issued its FAD in March 2015 finding no sexual harassment discrimination that was reversed by the Commission in 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission disagreed as to the breadth of the agency's liability in <span class="Italic">Blanca B</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that the damages caused by the ridicule and shunning by her peers, family and community arising from S1's sexual harassment is compensable. We agree with Complainant that this case is more like <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102516, than like <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120130174.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Agency that Complainant has not shown that any injury arising from litigating her EEO complaint in 2015, is compensable. She did not state this injury arose from the appellate litigation causing her to relive the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find it more likely than not that S1's sexual harassment was not the only factor that caused Complainant's depression and anxiety. These other factors include the execution of her brother, which she repeatedly verbalized made her sad. They also include the reaction to Complainant wearing modern clothing and being from Southern Iraq. Specifically, she wrote that in reaction to this, she believed some female FSI colleagues questioned her reputation because of the way she dressed, she was labeled as a southern peasant, and colleagues taunted and laughed at her. Finally, there was a situation at the Agency involving an altercation and resulting inquiry concerning another romantic relationship Complainant was in following the ending of her marriage (see footnote 3 of this decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Still, we find that the sexual harassment by S1 was a significant reason for Complainant being ridiculed by her community both inside and outside work. More importantly, it was a significant reason for Complainant being shunned by this community, her family and her husband's family. She was blamed for S1's actions, hurting her reputation within her community. The sexual harassment, and to a far larger degree the long term shunning caused, at least in part, by it, has and continues to take an immense toll on Complainant--causing a near severing of relations with her family and husband's family, loss of her friends, avoidance of going outside her apartment, ruminating most of the time about the harassment, poor self-esteem, bad depression, poor concentration, irritability, constant anger, poor sleep and exhaustion, crying nightly, gaining 40 pounds, thoughts of suicide, not creating a close connection with her young daughter, lost interest in sex, and being difficult to be around.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, Complainant's contention of severe emotional disturbance starting in 2008, as outlined in the psychologist's evaluation report, is belied by some of her actions, which shows she was functional and doing fairly well. S1's harassment ended by around May 2009. By December 2009, Complainant was able to form a romantic relationship with an FSI male instructor that lasted for a year, continued to work at FSI for more than two years after S1's sexual harassment ceased and wanted to continue working there, then in 2012 or 2013 met a man who she dated for a year before marrying him in late in 2013 or early 2014.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking all these factors into account, we find that Complainant has proven that she is entitled to $50,000 in nonpecuniary damages for pain and suffering and damage to her reputation. This is consistent with amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Santos v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091233 (July 12, 2012) (the complainant was awarded $50,000 in nonpecuniary damages for harassment that caused him anger, fright, resentment, frustration, loss of self-esteem, irritability, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, betrayal, family strain, anxiety, stress, decreased energy, decreased motivation, depression, and diarrhea), <span class="Italic">Harris K. v. Department of Homeland Security</span> (Apr. 24, 2018) (the complainant was awarded $40,000 in nonpecuniary damages for harassment that caused him depression, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, changes in appetite, and to often lock himself in his room at home and to lose his trust in his colleagues). In arriving at the $40,000 figure, we considered that while the sexual harassment by S1 was a factor in causing harm to Complainant, it is more likely than not that other factors also caused Complainant's sadness, damage to her reputation, her being taunted, and shunned long term, the latter of which is the cause of most of her emotional distress as time went on.</p>
<p class="noindent">Rejecting an agency award of $9,000 based on lack of medical evidence, the Commission increased the award to $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Holliday v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A03047 (2002), where the complainant corroborated her own testimony with that of family and coworkers. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Holliday</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted evidence, through her own affidavit as well as affidavits from relatives and former coworkers, of the emotional distress caused by the agency's action. Complainant stated that prior to the retaliation, she was "an upbeat, optimistic and happy person...[who] approached [her] work with a good attitude and was confident in [her] abilities," but that after the retaliation, "[her] whole world was turned upside down." Complainant stated that she found it difficult to report to work each day, began to question her own abilities, lost enjoyment in life, isolated herself from loved ones, and gained weight. Complainant added that she suffered financial difficulties due to the retaliation because she had to retire two years earlier than she planned and had difficulty obtaining employment. Complainant stated that she eventually obtained employment as a part-time bookkeeper earning $6.00 per hour, which is only a small portion of what she earned as a full-time GS-11 agency employee, so as a result, she had to sacrifice her own household and move in with her elderly mother. In addition, complainant stated that her professional reputation, which she worked twenty five years to build, deteriorated along with her self-esteem. Finally, complainant stated that she experienced stress, depression, distrustfulness, humiliation, fear, sleeplessness, exhaustion, headaches, higher blood pressure, and exacerbation of a physical impairment due to the agency's retaliation. Complainant indicated that the effects of the retaliation remain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's children and former coworkers corroborated her statements. Complainant's daughter added that complainant complained about the retaliation daily and cried consistently. Complainant's son stated that complainant remains cynical and much less cheerful than prior to the retaliation. Complainant's former coworkers stated that complainant consistently called them to ask questions regarding matters about which she was very knowledgeable, was obviously stressed, and was placed on medication for high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously noted, the agency considered the absence of medical evidence in the record in awarding complainant $9,000 in non-pecuniary damages. The Commission has previously held that neither evidence from a medical provider nor expert testimony in general is a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for mental and emotional distress, and that evidence may include statements from the complainant<span class="Italic">. Mayo v. Department of Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05990302 (July 21, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, the Commission finds the agency's award insufficient to remedy the severe and persistent harm the agency's actions caused complainant. We find $50,000 an appropriate amount as complainant presented sufficient objective evidence to establish that the agency's actions caused her emotional distress on, minimally, a daily basis for fourteen months. Similar cases with somewhat similar evidence support this award. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Bowden v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A00360 (June 22, 2000) ($45,000 award for non-pecuniary damages where the agency subjected complainant to harassment, which resulted in exacerbation of depression, injury to professional standing, character, reputation, and credit rating, humiliation, physical manifestations, loss of self-esteem, and marital and family problems); <span class="Italic">Turner v. Dep't of Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956390 (April 27, 1998) ($40,000 award for non-pecuniary damages where the agency subjected complainant to sexual harassment and retaliation, which resulted in depression, anger, anxiety, frustration, sleeplessness, crying spells, loss of self esteem and strained relationships); <span class="Italic">Wallis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) ($50,000 award for non-pecuniary damages where the agency retaliated against complainant, which resulted in exacerbation of a preexisting mental condition, loss of reputation, injury to credit standing, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of health).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lazard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02426 (2002), the Commission awarded $50,000 where it determined that some of the acts that caused the complainant emotional distress were not the result of discrimination. The Commission noted it was reducing the award by 50% after comparing it to other cases in which it had awarded $100,000 in damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $50,000 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Germain v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 07A10048 (2002), where the complainant experienced stress, worry, frustration, and anxiety for a period of six years because of the agency's failure to accommodate him.</p>
<p class="noindent">Appeals of damage awards by complainants are not always successful. For example, in <span class="Italic">Savage v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991774 (2002), the appeal resulted in the Commission reducing a $100,000 damage award to $50,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an agency did not provide the complainant with interpreter services over a four-year period, the Commission found $50,000 was an appropriate damages award. In <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15376 (2002), the Commission found the complainant suffered both physically and emotionally because of the discrimination and exhibited insomnia, paranoia, vomiting, depression, and stomach ulcers.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where depressive symptoms were exacerbated by a retaliatory reassignment and continued for some two years, the Commission awarded $50,000 in <span id="Page_1872"></span>damages. In <span class="Italic">Ferrall v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A30054 (2003), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence presented by complainant regarding the nature, severity, and duration of the nonpecuniary harm she suffered as a result of the unlawful retaliation included her own testimony as well as statements from her therapist, former coworkers, friends, and family members. Complainant testified that subsequent to the retaliatory reassignment, she felt humiliated; that she suffered from depression and was prescribed anti-depressant mediation which she took for the next two years and which muted her emotional reaction to other events in her life; that she began to experience numerous physical and psychological difficulties; that these difficulties led to diminished physical activity and consequent related health problems, including weight gain, increased cholesterol level, high blood pressure (requiring medication), and increased knee joint problems. Complainant also stated that she has experienced diminished social activity. The statements provided by complainant's relatives, former coworkers, and friends corroborated her testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's therapist stated that, while he had been treating complainant for anxiety prior to her retaliatory reassignment, after the reassignment she began "exhibiting more symptoms of depression than ever before." The therapist stated that he diagnosed complainant as suffering from "Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood," a condition which "involves one or more periods of depressive symptoms that are identical to Major Depressive Episodes in duration, but with fewer symptoms and less impairment." He added that an "episode" is defined as "either a sad or 'depressed' mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities," and that "[i]n addition, at least two but less than five additional symptoms must be present nearly every day." The therapist identified the symptoms suffered by complainant as including "muscle tension, restlessness, shakiness (physical), sweatiness and clamminess, dizziness and light-headed[ness], diarrhea, nausea, flushes, shortness of breath (a feeling of being smothered), keyed-up (always on edge), exaggerated startle response, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, increased irritability, depression, [and] crying." The therapist also stated that his prognosis for complainant's future mental and emotional condition was "at best moderate," that complainant "will never be able to recover 100%," and that "it has become a way of life for [complainant] to be anxious." The therapist further provided that "while [complainant's] condition began as situational in nature (i.e. job related stress) it has now developed into a personality trait," that complainant "now permanently operates at a more anxious level than the average person, even in a relaxed state," and that "[a]t this point in time it is a struggle for [complainant] to function on a day to day basis as she reports consistent feelings of being burnt-out and unable to continue fighting." The therapist concluded that, even assuming she would not in the future be subjected to high levels of job-related stress, complainant would need to remain in therapy for several years and that she would need to resume taking anti-depressant medication.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">George v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A13775 (2003), the Commission awarded $50,000 where:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that he has been humiliated and traumatized and has developed hypertension, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and sexual dysfunction. In addition, complainant stated that his professional career has been affected in that he suffers flashbacks of the agency's defamation, discrimination and retaliation against him so he can not work as a veterinarian full time. Finally, complainant stated that he experienced family problems. Complainant indicated that the effects of the retaliation remain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's first physician (P1) stated that complainant sought treatment on January 27, 1993 and had hypertension, psychological distress, PTSD, sleeplessness, problems concentrating, withdrawal, flashbacks and crying. P1 stated that complainant's impairments were related to his work environment and employment career problems. His first psychiatrist (P2) stated that he treated complainant on February 1 and March 2, 1993 for Adjustment Disorder and Depressed Type rule out PTSD. P2 stated that complainant's stress seemed to be triggered by two terminations from Federal employment. In a letter dated October 29, 1999, complainant's second physician (P3) stated that complainant was currently under his care for pain, hypertension and sexual dysfunction. P3 attributed complainant's health concerns to employment and career problems. Finally, in a letter dated November 5, 1999, complainant's second psychiatrist stated that complainant was currently under his care for Major Depression and PTSD.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered from stress, anger, and frustration for a period of two years and provided medical documentation to corroborate his testimony, the Commission awarded $50,000 in damages. <span class="Italic">See Gilvin v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A23823 (2003). In <span class="Italic">Gilvin</span>, the complainant also testified that his relations with his family were strained and that he became suicidal. Moreover, he testified he was devastated by not being able to provide for his family and that his removal was a factor that led to his separation from his common law wife.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no reward to an agency because it does not retaliate against an employee who files an EEO complaint. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Arizola v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30132.txt">07A30132</a> (2004), it expects agencies to treat employees who file complaints with "dignity and respect" and such treatment does not mitigate any harm done by discrimination. In upholding the award of an administrative judge of $50,000 to the complainant in <span class="Italic">Arizola</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ awarded complainant $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The AJ emphasized that complainant's physicians reported that complainant suffered from stress-related diseases, including chronic depression and anxiety. She also suffered from headaches, fatigue and uncontrolled tearfulness. Her doctors further reported that her symptoms are job-related, and that they have been ongoing for approximately three years. The AJ also took into account the fact that complainant had been given awards for her work since her demotion and that she had not been disparaged by her co-workers since the discriminating incident. The AJ cites Commission precedent to illustrate that prior decisions support her award of $50,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency argues that the Commission should mitigate the non-pecuniary compensatory damages award in this case because following complainant's discriminatory demotion, she was treated with "dignity and respect" and the employees responsible for her demotion left the Houston District. Moreover, after complainant was demoted she received exemplary ratings and performance-based awards. The agency contends that these factors support a reduction in the non-pecuniary compensatory damage award from $50,000.00 to $15,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Treating an employee with dignity and respect, while it does not always occur, is expected. We cannot reduce the AJ's award of non-pecuniary damages because after retaliating against complainant by stripping her of her supervisory responsibilities and demoting her, the agency thereafter gave her favorable performance ratings and awards. If the agency had given her unfavorable performance ratings and not given complainant awards that she deserved based on her work performance, then complainant may have had an additional claim of retaliation against the agency. We cannot reward the agency for its failure to retaliate; we can only attempt to remedy the discrimination that has occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The letters from complainant's family practitioner and psychologist persuade the Commission that complainant has experienced emotional distress sufficient to justify an award of $50,000.00. The record shows that complainant suffers from stress caused by her work situation. Complainant currently suffers from stress-related illnesses of hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic depression. The stress experienced by complainant has manifested as headaches, fatigue, uncontrolled tearfulness, anxiety, fearfulness, inability to concentrate, profound dysphoria, and it has exacerbated her depression. A sworn and notarized statement from complainant's psychologist, dated January 31, 2003, states that while complainant's condition has improved, he expects that it will be necessary for complainant to continue in treatment for a minimum of two sessions per month for a period of three to four years following the resolution of her case. As a result of the agency's actions complainant feels disgraced among her colleagues, she has lost respect from her peers, subordinates, and superiors, and has suffered irreparable injury to her professional standing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that an award of $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate in this case. We note that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. The Commission finds that the weight of our prior decisions supports an award of $50,000.00 in the instant case<span class="Italic">. See Holliday v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03047 (June 12, 2002) (Commission awarded $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where due to a retaliatory work environment complainant suffered emotional distress daily for at least 14 months, experiencing loss of enjoyment of life, loss of professional standing and forced early retirement); <span class="Italic">see Bowden v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00360 (June 22, 2000) (Commission awarded $45,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where the agency subjected complainant to harassment which resulted in exacerbation of depression, injury to professional standing, character, reputation, and credit rating, humiliation, physical manifestations, loss of self-esteem, and marital and family problems); <span class="Italic">see Wallis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (Commission awarded $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where agency retaliated against complainant, which resulted in exacerbation of a preexisting mental condition, loss of reputation, injury to credit standing, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of health).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Leos v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40017_r.txt">07A40017</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $50,000 in damages based on the complainant's testimony that he:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[E]xperienced emotional distress sufficient to justify an award $50,000.00. The record shows that complainant suffers from long-term <span id="Page_1873"></span>and significant anxiety and depression associated with his treatment in the workplace. He describes profound feelings of low self-esteem and extreme frustration associated with his work environment, where he endured on-going degrading acts by supervisors and co-workers because of his disability, to include being shot at with rubber bands. As a result of this demeaning treatment, complainant is "angry inside" and "hurting deep down," and feels isolated and ashamed because of his deafness. Additionally, complainant testifies that he has problems with sleep because of his workplace treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $50,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30050.txt">07A30050</a> (2004), where the complainant suffered from major depression as a result of discrimination and was unable to work for several months. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to non-pecuniary damages, complainant stated that he has experienced, and will continue to experience, "emotional pain and suffering." Complainant further stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I have been inconvenienced, suffered mental anguish, and endured the loss of enjoyment of life. The humiliation and public embarrassment that I now feel because of the [a]gency's discrimination has diminished my self pride and self worth. I withdraw from people for lack of trust. I still have nightmares and suffer paranoiac episodes. I am no longer able to take joy in watching my child grow, and it is no longer joyous for me to participate in family activities such as dining out, the movies, and holidays. Because of the mental and emotional damage the [a]gency caused me by its discriminatory actions, my life has been forever changed. I will have continual visits to the psychiatrist, forever battle my paranoiac episodes and nightmares, and always be trying to rebuild my trust in humankind.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted various doctor's notes and receipts in support of his request for compensatory damages. In a July 12, 1994 note, Dr. HW stated that complainant would be incapacitated from July 12 until July 20, and would be able to perform his normal duties upon his return to work. In a December 22, 1994 note, Dr. DS, a psychiatrist, stated that he had been seeing complainant since November 28, 1994. Dr. DS diagnosed complainant with Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder "that seems to have been triggered by the terminal illness of his mother as well as stresses at work." Dr. DS stated that complainant had been taking anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications without benefit thus far. Dr. DS stated that because of depression complainant could not function competently at work, but that with "aggressive medication management," he should be able to return to work in three to six months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant subsequently submitted the affidavit of Dr. JS, a psychiatrist whom complainant first consulted in January 1996. Dr. JS stated that he reviewed complainant's medical history as amassed by previous medical providers. Dr. JS diagnosed complainant with "adjustment disorder with depressed mood and adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features" which Dr. JS opined "was brought on or aggravated by his former position as a relief letter carrier with the Postal Service."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, the Commission concludes that the AJ's award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages is supported by substantial evidence of record. Accordingly, the agency will be ordered to pay complainant $50,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $50,000 in damages was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40088.txt">07A40088</a> (2004), where the discrimination exacerbated the complainant's preexisting conditions of depression and an anxiety disorder. The exacerbation resulted in an increase in medications for about one year. The complainant also suffered from strained relations with his family, sleeplessness, humiliation, stress, irritability, loss of reputation and weight loss.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the administrative judge credited the complainant's testimony that she experience enormous stress and health issues, including periods of hospitalization for illnesses caused, in part, by the hostile work environment, the Commission found that an award of $50,000 was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Cain v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 07A40022 (2005), the Commission also noted that the complainant's testimony was corroborated by her physician and her mother.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $50,000 was deemed adequate in <span class="Italic">McCoy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A43628 (2005), where the agency's discrimination exacerbated the symptoms of the complainant's MS. In making the award, the Commission found that the agency was responsible for 75% of the total harm based on the complainant's preexisting condition. The Commission in <span class="Italic">McCoy</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains complainant's statement regarding the harm suffered, as well as, statements from family members and friends. Complainant stated that as a result of the agency's discriminatory denial of her request for reasonable accommodation, she began to feel more fatigued and exhausted from the stress. Complainant was unable to sleep and felt increased numbness and tingling in her extremities. Complainant also stated that she began crying frequently, experienced feelings of hopelessness and fear, and had frequent, severe headaches. Complainant's Deposition Testimony at 19-21. Statements from family members and friends corroborate complainant's statements that she increasingly experienced physical maladies, including numbness and weakness in her limbs and pain and suffered episodes of depression. Further, the statements also provide that complainant was once energetic and outgoing, but is no longer so....</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $20,000 was increased to $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Slocum v. Social Security Administration</span>, 07A40062 (2005), where among the injuries sustained by the complainant was his public humiliation in front of peers.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission had little difficulty upholding an award of $50,000 by an administrative judge where a course offered by the Department of Homeland Security at its Federal Law Enforcement Training Center disparaged Muslims in the wake of September 11th. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rana v. Secretary of Homeland Security,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0720060056.txt">07200600561</a> (2007), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ based her award of compensatory damages on the harm that complainant suffered. The AJ noted that a portion of complainant's distress originated six months prior to the FLETC course. The AJ observed that complainant sought care from a therapist from June 2004 through September 2004, for depression before he attended the FLETC course. In support of his claim for damages, complainant presented a notarized statement from his personal therapist which states that "[i]n reaction to these self-perceived hostile and antagonistic materials, [complainant] has begun to experience decrements in affective functioning." The AJ found that the Agency's discriminatory conduct, including, most notably, the internal memorandum suggesting that complainant may have ties to terrorism, contributed to and exacerbated complainant's pre-existing stress, sleeplessness, and depression and that $50,000 is an appropriate award under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We concur with the AJ that the award is appropriate based on complainant's testimony that the harassment to which he was subjected caused significant stress, withdrawal from others at work, a sense of isolation, sleeplessness, some depression, embarrassment and humiliation. The Commission finds that this amount takes into account the severity and duration of the humiliation complainant endured in the presence of his classmates. We find this award accounts for the fact that the harm done by the discrimination may have been an aggravation of a pre-existing condition. We note the AJ's consideration of complainant's demeanor during the hearing wherein complainant was still so visibly upset by the recounting of the course content and comments made by I1, that he had to excuse himself from the hearing on more than one occasion to regain his composure. Furthermore, we find that this award is consistent with Commission awards in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal Number 01961483 (Mar. 4, 1999); <span class="Italic">Cain v. Department of Commerce,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40022 (Mar. 18, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Washington v. Attorney General</span>, 0520070324 (2007), the Commission denied an agency request to reconsider its earlier decision upholding an award of $50,000 in damages by the administrative judge. The Commission held that the judge properly considered the nature, severity and duration of the harm and that medical evidence was not required to sustain an award of damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the testimony of the complainant, his wife, mother and coworkers supported the claim of emotional distress from a hostile environment, the Commission upheld the award of $50,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Hem v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0720060012 (2008). The Commission also noted that the complainant had presented medical evidence of treatment for emotional distress. However, in the same case, the Commission rejected the complainant's request for pecuniary damages for medical treatment, noting that he had a preexisting condition of Graves Disease and had not shown the treatment was above what would have been required because of the preexisting condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $50,000 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Okezie v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070005 (2008), where the complainant presented evidence from herself, her husband and a coworker. The complainant also presented statements from two psychologists, one of whom had started treating the complainant before the discrimination and was able to comment on the "before" and "after" of the discrimination. The complainant, according to testimony, "appeared 'depressed and withdrawn,'" and her "depression was manifested by weight loss, crying, anhedonia, strained marital relations, poor concentration, social withdrawal and chronic inability to sleep." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $50,000 in damages where the complainant testified that the agency's failure to accommodate her resulted in an exacerbation of her carpal tunnel syndrome. In <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120064557 (2008), the complainant also testified she had difficulty sleeping, was unable to perform household chores, and became depressed and anxious. The complainant supported her testimony with statements from family and friends, but the Commission also noted that much of the claimed distress occurred outside the period of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered emotional stress over an eight-month period, the Commission upheld an award of $50,000 in damages by the administrative judge. In <span class="Italic">Howard v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060026 (2008), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1874"></span>The record revealed that over the course of time referenced in her complaint (eight months), complainant suffered from stress, depression, anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations, constant headaches, inability to function at a normal level which increased on a daily basis, and an increase in her smoking because of the added stress, anxiety, and depression due to her workplace conditions. Complainant provided evidence that established she sought medical treatment and was prescribed Prozac and Zoloft. Medical records also support complainant's contentions that her medical problems, the heart palpitations and high blood pressure in particular, were caused by the stress and anxiety as a result of the agency's actions. As a result the AJ awarded complainant $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we stated earlier, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(a), all post-hearing factual findings by an AJ will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence in the record. A decision regarding compensatory damages is a question of fact, and, as such, an AJ's post-hearing finding regarding damages will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30005 (July 16, 2004); <span class="Italic">Ferrall v. Department of Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30054 (April 23, 2003) <span class="Italic">citing Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.,</span> 532 U.S. 424, 437 (2001); <span class="Italic">McCleese v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A32993 (April 22, 2004). Based on our review of the record as a whole, we find that the AJ, in applying the proper law and regulations, correctly concluded that complainant was entitled to an award of $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. Therefore, we find that the agency has failed to demonstrate that the AJ's decision on non-pecuniary damages is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld a damage award of $50,000 in <span class="Italic">McGee v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060059 (2008), where the agency reassigned the complainant to another facility and put her on a graveyard shift instead of accommodate her in her letter carrier position. One of the effects of the reassignment was that the complainant was no longer able to care for her daughter. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">McGee</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ in this case awarded complainant $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages. The AJ found that complainant, a single mom, could not take care of her daughter when she was placed into the VCT position. As a result of the discrimination, the AJ found complainant suffered anxiety, depression weight gain, physical pains, headaches and a rise in blood pressure. Complainant also suffered from rashes, shortness of breath and sleep problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, including complainant's physician's testimony, we find the AJ's award is supported by substantial evidence. Soon after complainant returned to work in November 2001, she began taking Celexa due to stress she was experiencing. Soon after, her blood pressure increased, and her physician increased the Celexa dosage. Complainant's symptoms progressed, and she experienced a 48-pound weight gain by the time her position was moved to Santa Ana. (HT V. II at pp. 317-336). We find this award is appropriate given the number of years complainant suffered, as well the fact that it is consistent with Commission precedent<span class="Italic">. See Chevis v. USDA,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A50169 (March 31, 2005) ($40,000 in non-pecuniary damages for depression, insomnia, crying spells, change in weight after failure to accommodate); <span class="Italic">Ward-Jerkins v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) ($50,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where the complainant who after being detailed and reassigned suffered a diagnosed acute distress disorder, and aggravation of her depressive condition); <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01981579 (September 7, 2001) ($40,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages due to a denial of reasonable accommodation and intentional disability discrimination where complainant suffered from physical and emotional harm, and was diagnosed with major depression).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency contends that complainant suffered from a pre-existing condition, and that it should only be liable for a reduced amount of damages. We find limited, if any, evidence that complainant suffered a pre-existing condition prior to the events in question. Indeed, the agency's attorney did not question complainant's physician on this issue. That complainant may have suffered from stress and pain from her injuries prior to the discrimination is possible, but most people deal with such day to day stress. Complainant did not begin taking medication for her anxiety until November 2001, when she began conversations with the agency regarding accommodation. Accordingly, we do not find that complainant's award should be reduced.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency award of $15,000 in damages to $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120071802 (2008), where the agency's retaliation was combined with workplace incidents that were found not to be discriminatory. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Stokes</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also noted complainant's testimony that the hostility he suffered at work directly affected his health. Specifically, complainant asserts that his health problems began with stomach pains and headaches, and progressed to the point where he became unable to physically and mentally function. In addition, the record shows that complainant has been under medical treatment since 2003. In addition, complainant asserts that his problems manifested themselves physically (e.g., he gained 60 pounds, was exhausted yet unable to sleep, and suffered motor skill retardation.). His problems also manifested themselves mentally (e.g., he lost interest in everything (including his family), he did not attend to his physical needs and became suicidal). In addition, the agency noted that complainant was hospitalized for a week, and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Following his hospitalization, complainant participated in Intensive Outpatient Therapy three times weekly for several months, then began Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT) three times weekly for five weeks. In addition, complainant stated that he continues to struggle daily and that he terminated his employment on May 23, 2006, due to his medical inability to perform his duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its FAD, the agency concludes that complainant claimed "intense emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of health." Moreover, according to the agency, complainant's evidence shows that he has been emotionally, mentally, and physically incapacitated to the extent that he cannot perform even basic self-care acts such as washing, dressing, and eating, such mild physical activity like walking, or intellectual activity like reading. The agency also noted that complainant lost his ability to function as a husband and father, and is unable to return to any type of employment within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although finding that the administrative judge did not "elaborate" in his decision and that the award was in the upper range for the harm reflected in the record, the Commission upheld a $50,000 damage award in <span class="Italic">Sharma v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080056 (2009). The Commission noted there was little medical documentation in the record, but the testimony of the complainant, corroborated by statements from his wife and son, indicated that he suffered from high anxiety, had nightmares relating to his nonselection, and experienced feelings of hopelessness and humiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $20,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Attorney General</span>, 0720080008 (2009), to $50,000 finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the AJ in his decision, in support of her claim for non-pecuniary damages, complainant and several witnesses supplied testimony regarding her emotional distress. Complainant testified that shortly after her termination, she became embarrassed, cried a lot and had suffered sleeplessness. Complainant further testified that she was afraid, and that she had an intense chest pain, which she thought was a gallbladder problem. As a result, she went to see her doctor. After the diagnosis, it was determined that complainant had a heart attack. She also stated that she continued to see physicians concerning a variety of issues, which includes, but is not limited to depression, anxiety, and chest pain. As a result, she was placed on several medications. Complainant testified that she had lost her "dream job," lost her professional standing within that community and all her friends, all of which contributed to her depression and anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that, in addition, complainant testified that while they were in Traverse City, Michigan, they kept a home in Missouri and she was the one paying for the mortgage. As a result of the termination, she was not able to keep up the mortgage payments and they lost their home. Complainant's husband testified that shortly after the termination, complainant became depressed. They hardly did things as husband and wife anymore, and they were embarrassed to move back to Missouri. In addition, he testified that complainant suffers sleepless nights, low self-esteem and crying, as a result of the termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ concluded that complainant did have some pre-existing conditions prior to joining the agency, namely, she did suffer anxiety and emotional depression prior to joining the agency. However, the AJ found that those conditions were aggravated by the discriminatory conduct of the employer. The AJ noted that the agency, as the tortfeasor, takes the victim as she is and is responsible for the damages proximately caused by this conduct. The AJ found that an award of $20,000.00 was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously noted, complainant has requested $50,000.00 in compensatory damages, and the agency argues that no non-pecuniary damages are warranted. After a thorough review of the record, we find that the AJ properly determined that complainant is entitled to an award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages, however based on the record, we find that an award of $20,000.00 is inadequate to make her whole. The Commission finds that $50,000.00 is appropriate to compensate complainant for her physical and emotional pain and suffering resulting from the retaliatory termination. We point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions. <span class="Italic">See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,</span> 477 U.S. 299, 311-12 (1986) (stating that compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case). The Commission notes that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Cavanaugh v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. <span id="Page_1875"></span>07A20102 (November 12, 2003) (awarding $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where due to discrimination, complainant experienced exacerbation of her depression, anxiety symptoms, increased need for medication, marital problems, negative effect on social life and interaction family relationships, distrust of others, irritability, sleeplessness, and tension headaches); <span class="Italic">Turner v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956390 (April 27, 1998) (providing $40,000.00 where discriminatory harassment caused complainant to experience psychological trauma and physical injury with permanent effects);<span class="Italic"> Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995) (awarding $75,000.00 in a failure to accommodate case which resulted in emotional harm to complainant which damaged his relationships with family and friends and reduced his quality of life, as well as resulting in physical manifestations such as a digestive disorder). Accordingly, we conclude that the amount of $50,000.00 is appropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $35,000 by an administrative judge was increased by the Commission to $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070020 (2010), where the complainant testified he felt devastated and hopeless, lost 50 pounds, was unable to care for an ill parent, experienced uncontrollable crying, and received psychiatric care and medication for depression and sleeplessness. In making the award, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, noted that "this amount takes into account that, unlike cases where greater damages were awarded, complainant's injury did not render him totally incapacitated either for work or in his personal life."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency award of $15,000 to $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Reed v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0210080520 (2011). In that case, the complainant, in addition to his own testimony, submitted affidavits from several friends and coworkers attesting that he had become detached from his family and disengaged at work. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Reed</span>, also noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife stated that in the aftermath of the Agency's discrimination she has had a difficult time coping with his problems. She stated that she has had to seek medical help because of the demand of having to take care of the household and their daughters alone. She stated that Complainant spent many hours on the telephone talking to his co-workers about how was treated at work, which took a toll on the family. Complainant's Wife Affidavit, at 1. Complainant's wife stated that the tension created by Complainant's work situation made it unbearable to live together as a family and caused her to move out from their home in 1998 even though she still cared for and loved her husband. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's oldest daughter (Daughter 1) stated over the five years following the Agency's discriminatory action, Complainant remained in a constant state of tension, and that his body language and lack of interaction with the family created a very tense atmosphere. Daughter 1 Aff. at 1. She stated that her father, formerly outgoing and family-oriented, was now isolated at home, which caused her mother to move out of their bedroom and eventually out of their home. She stated that her father missed her wedding because he did not have the emotional state to deal with family events. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's youngest daughter (Daughter 2) stated that Complainant's job was a major part of his life before the discriminatory event but he always found a way to spend time with his family. Daughter 2 Aff. at 1. She stated that after her father was discriminated against, the look in her father's eyes and his lack of enthusiasm for life deeply saddened her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3. She stated that her efforts to communicate with him in the aftermath of what he experienced at the Agency were met with mean and hurtful statements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 4. She stated that her father also missed her wedding because of his mental state.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's brother, sister, and brother-in-law submitted affidavits as well. All of these affidavits in one form or another indicated that after Complainant was discriminated against, he became further and further removed from the family, and that his attendance at family events diminished. They also indicated that when they saw Complainant in person, he was less talkative and withdrawn. Complainant's brother-in-law referred to Complainant as "reclusive." His sister referred to his condition as "a mood swing." His brother stated that Complainant "would not return any phone calls."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant provided affidavits from twelve former co-workers, several of whom he supervised. One of his former employees stated that Complainant was an effective supervisor but after he was discriminated against, he loss his effectiveness. This employee stated that he and several of his colleagues changed specialties because they could no longer work for Complainant. Another employee confirmed that she and her colleagues knew that whatever Complainant requested of them was reasonable and logical because they watched how he worked but after he was discriminated against he became very guarded in his actions and conversations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's fellow supervisors stated that after Complainant was discriminated against they often discussed Complainant's change in personality among themselves. They indicated that he became preoccupied and withdrawn and that the relationship he had with his co-workers changed drastically. One colleague stated that Complainant became less engaged in the operations of the organization, and described his behavior as "constantly looking over his shoulder" and "approaching paranoia." Another colleague stated Complainant was shunned at work and became an outcast. Still another one stated that before the Agency's action, Complainant was an attentive and resourceful colleague but afterwards he became more distant, reserved and isolated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $50,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Oni v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720100015 (2011), where the complainant was terminated during her probationary period. The Commission found that the termination resulted in complainant's crying and feeling upset, she had problems sleeping, feelings of depression and headaches that caused her to seek medical attention.</p>
<p class="noindent">While compensatory damages awards are intended to compensate a victim of discrimination for the harm done and not punish the offending conduct, there is at times a correlation between the egregiousness of the conduct and the harm done. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Bradstreet v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0210112517 (2012), in awarding $50,000 in damages, "The more inherently degrading or humiliating the defendant's action is, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action. The absence of supporting evidence, however, may affect the amount of damages appropriate in specific cases." The conduct in <span class="Italic">Bradsteet</span> speaks for itself:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In brief, Complainant alleged that male firefighters, were angry that one of the restrooms had been designated for her use as a female, and continued to use it, leaving it consistently unclean with urine puddles and feces on the wall and floor, and rotting food garbage in the trash. The record shows that even one of the Lieutenants regularly used the female restroom despite upper management's directive not to do so, contributing to the other firefighters' apparent belief that the station's leaders did not take the prohibition seriously. The male firefighters constantly complained about Complainant's toiletries and feminine hygiene products in the restroom, and would throw them away on a regular basis. Magazines were left in the restroom ranging from Maxim to Guns and Ammo. A semi-nude suggestive magazine page captioned as "driving miss crazy" was slipped under the locked restroom door. Firefighters made inappropriate comments to Complainant's husband when he visited her at the station, including asking for a picture of her as a teenager to see how hot she was. Complainant also alleged that, as a result of the constant conflict over the restroom, the other firefighters stopped talking to her and left the room when she entered. During a staff meeting, they told her the she was "whining like a little bitch" and they were "tired of [her] shit." Finally, on October 13, 2009, Complainant went on leave due to the stress of the conflict with her coworkers and management's lack of response to it. She did not return to duty until January 6, 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent">In awarding $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Bradstreet</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that Complainant is not entitled to any award of compensatory damages because she failed to file a claim for such following her receipt of the Agency's finding of discrimination. However, the Commission finds that despite the fact that Complainant failed to submit a formal claim for compensatory damages as directed by the Agency in its final decision, a review of the record discloses that Complainant provided significant statements in the record indicating how the hostile work environment harassment negatively affected her, as well as her husband and son. During the course of the investigation, Complainant provided testimony to the investigator stating that the hostile work environment began to affect her health and caused her a great deal of stress as evidenced by symptoms like headaches, and an upset stomach every time she had to go to work. She further indicated that she had trouble sleeping and concentrating, that she suffered depression and anxiety as a result of the hostile environment in which she worked. Complainant also averred that the stress she suffered due to her work environment negatively affected her relationship with her husband and son. The record describes one incident in which Complainant's husband came to work to eat dinner with her and Complainant's coworkers asked Complainant's husband if he had a picture of Complainant when she was 18 so they could see if she was hot. Complainant's husband became upset and Complainant had to hold her husband back. Complainant also averred that she suffered loss of consortium. Moreover, a review of the Agency's final decision discloses that Complainant advised the Agency that she had to call in sick "maybe once or twice per month," because she "didn't want to be there," because of the hostile work environment. In addition, the Agency acknowledged that the work environment degraded her trust that her fellow firefighters would support Complainant in a potentially life threatening situation. Finally, the record shows that Complainant was out of work between October 2009 and January 2010 due to the stress of the harassing events.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant was discriminatorily denied a series of transfers, the Commission found that an award of $50,000 in damages was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">De Los Santos v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0120091233 (2012), the <span id="Page_1876"></span>Commission noted that although the complainant submitted evidence that he was diagnosed with diabetes after the discrimination, the evidence failed to establish causation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted a personal statement in which he stated that the discrimination he suffered will haunt him for the rest of his life. Complainant stated that for more than five years the harassment caused him severe emotional suffering such as mental anguish, anger, fright, resentment, frustration, loss of self esteem, irritability, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, betrayal, anxiety, stress, decreased energy, decreased motivation, and depression. Complainant also stated that he suffered from loss of enjoyment of life due to the harassment and the separation from his family, and that the discrimination and lies spread by the responsible management official damaged his character and his reputation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also stated that for more than five years the harassment caused him physical ailments, such as headaches, upset stomach, difficulty sleeping, stiffness in cervical and dorsal spine, chest pain, numbness in his limbs, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. Complainant also stated that he lost four teeth from gritting his teeth so hard in anger because of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also alleged that he developed diabetes as a result of the discrimination. Complainant submitted a document from a medical examination dated December 23, 2002, which indicated that Complainant has diabetes. Complainant also submitted an April 11, 2007 letter from his physician which stated that he has been treating Complainant for diabetes for approximately three years. The doctor noted that stress can greatly affect glucose levels, and that Complainant reported to him that working away from his family was a constant stressful situation which affected his glucose levels. Notably, both documents were silent about the actual cause of Complainant's diabetes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife and brother submitted affidavits that supported Complainant's assertions. Complainant's wife stated that during their daily conversations about the discrimination, she knew that he was enduring severe mental anguish and severe emotional pain and suffering. Complainant's wife reiterated the emotional and physical ailments Complainant experienced as listed above, and that the discrimination caused her mental anguish and emotional pain as well. She also stated that the failure to relocate him caused a strain between Complainant and the rest of the family. Complainant's brother stated that he had numerous conversations with Complainant about the effects of the discrimination, and he reiterated the emotional and physical ailments listed above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, a coworker who worked with Complainant and observed the discriminatory harassment submitted an affidavit and stated that the discrimination made Complainant angry, upset, stressed, embarrassed, humiliated, and he often talked about how much he missed his family due to the Agency's failure to relocate him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find an award of $50,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See McCoy v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A43628 (Sept. 22, 2005) (Complainant was awarded $50,000 in non-pecuniary damages where discrimination resulted in Complainant experiencing fatigue, exhaustion, stress, hopelessness, fear, and she experienced frequent headaches, lack of sleep, and crying. Complainant's family and friends corroborated her claim); <span class="Italic">Arizola v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30132 (Feb. 4, 2004) (Complainant was awarded $50,000 in non-pecuniary damages after discrimination caused Complainant to suffer for approximately three years from depression, anxiety, headaches, fatigue, fearfulness, tearfulness, and an inability to concentrate); <span class="Italic">Schinner v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03837 (March 7, 2002) (Complainant was awarded $50,000 in non-pecuniary damages where harassment resulted in Complainant feeling humiliated, embarrassed, isolated, ostracized, she suffered sleeplessness and it caused a strain on her relationship with her husband and children); <span class="Italic">Powell v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A50989 (March 3, 2006) (Complainant was awarded $45,000 in non-pecuniary damages where a hostile work environment resulted in Complainant suffering emotional distress, which was corroborated by his wife). Accordingly, we conclude that an award of $50,000 will adequately compensate Complainant for the physical and emotional harm he suffered as a result of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sartini v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120112305 (2012), increased an award of $15,000 in damages by the agency to $50,000 where the agency's failure to accommodate aggravated the complainant's preexisting back condition as well as a preexisting medical condition. The Commission also found that the complainant's subsequent removal for medical inability to perform was not an intervening factor but was the direct result of the failure to accommodate noting that "[h]ad the Agency met its obligation under the Rehabilitation Act, Complainant never would have been terminated." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $50,000 by the administrative judge was upheld in <span class="Italic">Bostick v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720120021 (2013), where the agency denied the complainant's request for overpayment of advanced leave upon her retirement in retaliation for EEO activity. The complainant testified that she suffered from "mental anguish, migraine headaches, depression, a bleeding ulcer and a stroke after the retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $10,000 by the agency was increased to $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Rey v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120123231 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has claimed that she should be awarded $300,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. We note that Complainant had been undergoing treatment for her mixed anxiety disorder and depression and will continue to do so. Complainant has also consistently expressed a profound fear of the Agency official who terminated her from her position with the Agency. Complainant also stated that she had physical manifestations of her emotional distress. Specifically, she experienced headaches, sudden fear for no reason, fear of going out alone, and difficulty sleeping. We note that Complainant had been experiencing these conditions since she was terminated and is in need of some future therapy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $50,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Bostick v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720120021 (2013), where the complainant testified that she suffered mental anguish, migraine headaches, depression, a bleeding ulcer and a stroke after being retaliated against by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jones v. National Security Agency</span>, 0720120011 (2013), the Commission increased an award of $20,000 by the administrative judge to $50,000 noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the entire record, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's finding that Complainant is entitled to compensatory damages for emotional distress and other non-pecuniary harm. Complainant stated that she experienced emotional instability, stress, and anxiety. Complainant alleged that she was subjected to humiliation and significant embarrassment. Complainant asserted that her professional credentials and her reputation was ruined because of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also alleged that she experienced physical ailments because of the discrimination. Complainant described uncontrollable shaking hands, restless nights, headaches, and crying spells. Complainant stated that she suffered from pains and numbness in both legs, tightness and pains in her chest, and numbness and trembling in her upper lip. The stress and pains were so intense at times that Complainant slept very little and lost her appetite. Ultimately Complainant had an EKG because she thought she was having a heart attack, and she had to go to physical therapy treatment for her legs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's testimony was supported by affidavits written by friends, family members, and medical professionals. The record supports the AJ's determination that Complainant began suffering the harm in March 2007 and continued to suffer the effects of the Agency's discrimination at the time of the AJ's decision in October 2011, which is approximately 4 1/2 years. <span class="Italic">See Fonda-Wall v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal Number 0720060035 (July 28, 2009) (Complainant established that her harm continued even after the harassment stopped, and the long term and continuing impact of the Agency's actions were evident during the hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find an award of $50,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Bullock III v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A40101 (Aug. 3, 2005) (The Commission awarded Complainant $60,000.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages after termination when Complainant felt confused, frustrated, angry, embarrassed, and depressed); <span class="Italic">Clafin v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50069 (May 26, 2006) (The Commission awarded Complainant $53,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where discriminatory termination resulted in emotional distress, ruined reputation and professional life, and physical ailments, and her condition was confirmed by her spouse); <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080008 (Nov. 5, 2009) (The Commission awarded Complainant $50,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where discriminatory termination resulted in manifestations that included embarrassment, sleeplessness, crying, chest pain, and anxiety). Accordingly, we conclude that an award of $50,000 will adequately compensate Complainant for the physical and emotional harm she suffered as a result of the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720140023 (2014), the Commission approved an award of $50,000 in damages while rejecting the contention of the complainant, an air traffic controller that he should be awarded additional damages for the stress of working in an environment where a mistake could result in loss of life.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $50,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0720140012 (2015), finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1877"></span>The AJ awarded Complainant $50,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages. While the Agency asserts that this amount is monstrously excessive, we find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's award. In a detailed analysis, the AJ set forth her reason for the award. Specifically, the AJ stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[Complainant] testified that after the October 2010 performance rating he felt like he was being 'held hostage' in Chicago. He had tried repeatedly to leave the CT-3 squad and understood that the low rating meant he would be stuck in the squad for the foreseeable future...Complainant's wife credibly testified that Complainant became increasingly angry and withdrawn during his years in the CT-3 squad. She testified that the family learned to 'walk on eggshells' and to stay away from Complainant after the work week, until he could recover his mood, but that the required recovery period lengthened until it consumed entire weekends.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the discrimination negatively affected Complainant's marriage. The AJ noted that Complainant's wife decided to seek a divorce in July 2012, and the couple legally separated five months before the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the amount awarded is supported by substantial evidence in record and is consistent with Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080520 (Jan. 21, 2011) (Complainant subjected to retaliation, and awarded $50,000.00 in compensatory damages based on testimony from complainant and complainant's family members indicating that complainant experienced emotional mood swings, marital strain, a general loss of self esteem and stopped enjoying life.).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120123467 (2015), the Commission upheld an award of $50,000 by the administrative judge where:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ found that Complainant credibly and emotionally testified with the support of one friend/coworker (Coworker 4) that she suffered from extreme stress, shock, and humiliation, much of which she attributed to perceived harassment partly perpetrated by her coworkers' misbehavior or mistreatment of her. The AJ noted Complainant testified the stress manifested itself in frequent absences from work, headaches, rashes, weight fluctuation, high blood pressure, diagnosed depression and anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, excessively heightened emotions shown by crying spells and panic attacks, and suicidal ideations (showing a re-emergence of a pre-existing psychiatric problem). The AJ noted Complainant also testified that she felt as if her discriminatory superiors (the AO and the Supervisory Fiscal Specialist) "followed her" to her details and that she lost her confidence or esteem and withdrew from her family and friends.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ noted that Complainant stated she did not obtain some relief for her sleep problems until after her recent hospitalization. The AJ noted that Complainant sought but had to stop her EAP counseling sessions, which she also testified provided her some relief. Additionally, the AJ noted that Complainant's testimony showed that in her new job (at time of hearing) she had been successfully accommodated, had job satisfaction, and was performing satisfactorily. The AJ determined that although Complainant clearly suffered severe and numerous mental and physical effects during the relevant time period, as was corroborated by extensive medical and counseling records, she did not prove that all of these effects were attributable to the Agency's illegal discrimination and its reprisal against her commencing in late October/November of 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the AJ found that the medical disclosure violation that Complainant showed does not support any compensatory damage award because the Agency hired Complainant despite that disclosure. The AJ determined Complainant failed to prove that the disclosure contributed to or otherwise caused the Rehabilitation Act violations that were supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the AJ determined that after careful consideration of Complainant's and her co-worker's credible testimony, particularly Complainant's tearful hearing testimony showing a serious re-emergence of her suicidal ideations, as well as her supporting medical and counseling records, Complainant was not entitled to all damages sought on her behalf because she did not prove that all of her claimed damages were proximately caused by the illegal discrimination and reprisal. Moreover, the AJ noted that Complainant did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she would continue to suffer in the future, mental and physical effects proximately caused by such discrimination and reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ concluded Complainant proved by a preponderance of the evidence that she suffered approximately 12 months of the described compensatory damages, i.e., for the period of November 20, 2010, until approximately 3 months after her promotion was effective in September 2011, with some intermittent psychological relief from her details commencing in late November 2010. The AJ found Complainant proved by a preponderance of the evidence that approximately 50% of those damages were directly or proximately caused by the illegal discrimination and reprisal. Thus, the AJ found Complainant proved an award of $50,000.00 in compensatory damages for the mental and physical suffering proximately caused by the Agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1878"></span>An award of $30,000 by the agency was increased to $50,000 on appeal where the complainant's representation of a fellow employee in an EEO complaint resulted in daily harassment spanning two years. In <span class="Italic">Janet B. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120132683 (2015), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was subjected to daily harassment by management for close to two years from April 2009 to February 2011, a prolonged duration. S1's refusal to speak with Complainant without a witness present, and her overall reduction of communication with her was isolating. As part of the harassment, S1 repeatedly did things which made Complainant not only fear the loss of her job, but her law license--her livelihood. Further, Complainant's sudden reassignment from the high profile Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force to lower level cases damaged her reputation within the law enforcement and legal communities, something she greatly valued. We agree with the Agency that as a result of the harassment, Complainant suffered tremendous stress, anxiety, and exacerbation of her pre-existing medical conditions. Complainant disputed that her mother's death in November 2009 was a source of anxiety or depression. She explained that her mother was terminally ill for around four years, and she grieved her mother's condition and anticipated death in 2007. Nothing in the record contradicts this.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Agency that $30,000 is sufficient compensation for Complainant's non-pecuniary damages. The medical evidence shows that there were severe physical manifestations of the stress caused by the harassment it was a contributing factor to Complainant getting shingles and her hypertension. She also got nausea. Further, witnesses described an overall decline in Complainant's health, with at least one indicating it was visible. Complainant feared she would get a stroke from the hypertension, and talked about death frequently, something she did not do prior. On an ongoing bases Complainant dreaded coming to work and was made to feel helpless and unsafe. She had trouble sleeping and would wake up in a panic. Complainant was diagnosed with depression, and required medication for anxiety. She was given cases she was unprepared to prosecute, which caused her panic. She went from vivacious women to someone who was broken and tired who was unable to attend social events. Based on the duration and severity of Complainant's emotional pain and suffering, and also the damage to her reputation, we find Complainant suffered non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $50,000. <span class="Italic">See McCoy v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A43628 (Sept. 22, 2005) (Complainant awarded $50,000 as a result of the Agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation which she stated resulted in her experiencing increased fatigue and exhaustion due to stress. She was unable to sleep, and experienced frequent crying, feelings of hopelessness and fear, and frequent headaches. Statements from family and friends corroborated her claim. Noted pre-existing depression and multiple sclerosis also contributed to her symptoms. <span class="Italic">De Los Santos v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091233 (July 12, 2012) (Complainant subjected to harassment for two years and eight months awarded $50,000 for mental anguish, anger, fright, resentment, frustration, loss of self esteem, irritability, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, betrayal, anxiety, stress, decreased energy, depression, headaches, upset stomach, numbness in limbs, and damage to his character and reputation). Complainant is awarded $50,000 in non-pecuniary damages for her pain and suffering and loss to reputation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where intervening causes also contributed to the complainant's distress, the Commission upheld an award of $50,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120130353 (2015), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's conclusion that Complainant is entitled to $50,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages is supported by substantial evidence in the record. This is because Complainant had a history of depressive disorder, experienced other stressors in her life including the litigation against the Agency, and the fact that Complainant was hospitalized in September 2010 which was nearly nine months after the Agency removed the Interim Nurse Manager from Complainant's work area and five months after the last incident with him. These factors indicate that there were both intervening and additional causes for Complainant's emotional distress and other medical conditions. AJ's Decision, p. 11-12. Complainant takes issue with the fact that the AJ mentioned in her decision that both Complainant's brother and sister suffered from medical problems, including bipolar illness. Complainant argues that the AJ took this into account to reduce Complainant's damages and that it was erroneous because she inferred that Complainant had such a disorder because siblings did. <span class="Italic">See</span> Complainant's Brief. p. 5. However, there is no indication that the AJ made this inference because she mentioned this in her recitation of facts of the case, but not her analysis to determine non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The AJ's discussion of diminishments to Complainant's award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages was based solely on other factors in Complainant's own life. <span class="Italic">See</span> AJ's Decision, p. 10-12.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $12,000 by the agency was increased to $50,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120122924 (2015), where the complainant developed PTSD after being sexually assaulted by an inmate and the agency refused her request to be assigned to an area with no contact with male inmates as an accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As already noted, Complainant was diagnosed with PTSD in February 2009, following the assault in January 2009. By the end of September 2009, almost ten months after the assault, Complainant's mental health provider was still recommending continued treatment. Complainant requested $200,000 in damages for pain and suffering as a result of the Agency's failure to accommodate her PTSD. The Agency determined that an award of $12,000 in compensatory damages was appropriate for Complainant's emotional pain and suffering resulting from the Agency's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding her request for compensatory damages, Complainant wrote that she suffered from anxiety, hyper-vigilance, fear of crowds, and insomnia. She further stated that the assault was particularly painful because she had been molested as a young child, and continued to have flashbacks to this childhood victimization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also provided written documentation from her mental health provider in the form of a July 6, 2009 progress note. The mental health provider noted, "a significant component of [Complainant's] situation is 'second injury,' that is the response of the environment to her assault and recovery. While this cannot be repaired, it is possible that removal from this situation might be of significant assistance to her." The progress note went on to state that Complainant was experiencing anger and frustration with the response to her assault from management and her coworkers. Specifically, Complainant "[r]eported dissatisfaction with the culture and support that she received in her current position and provided specific examples of conflict with supervisors and perceived lack of support by coworkers. She reported that she remains very angry about these situations and the assault...she reported that after the incident she urgently requested assistance but none was forthcoming...." In addition, the mental health provider wrote that Complainant "believe[s] that she will be able to function as a correctional officer if she feels support by supervisors and coworkers," and that she was "interested in pursuing a transfer to another facility and is able to travel anywhere for such a position."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant also submitted a statement from a Licensed Professional Counselor. The counselor states that Complainant is experiencing anxiety, inability to sleep and feeling like she was going to explode. The counselor stated that Complainant reported that she was particularly upset by the fact that when she was being assaulted by the inmate her coworkers refused to step in and help her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Damages in this case are difficult to assess because, while it has been established that Complainant experiences ongoing symptoms and treatment for PTSD, it is unclear from the evidence the extent to which Complainant's emotional distress was caused by the initial January 2009 sexual assault versus the Agency's subsequent denial of her request for reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Grimes v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A10328 (August 27, 2002) (where the complainant has pre-existing conditions, the agency is only liable for additional harm caused by the discrimination). We do, however, find that the evidence shows that Agency's actions in refusing to consider or denying her accommodation requests did cause Complainant significant emotional stress and exacerbated her PTSD. For example, we note Complainant's mental health provider stated that, "a significant component of [Complainant's] situation is 'second injury,' that is the response of the environment to her assault and recovery."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Again, while recognizing the difficulty in quantifying the extent of this "second injury," we conclude that the $12,000 awarded by the Agency in non-pecuniary compensatory damages is inadequate to compensate Complainant for the emotional harm she suffered as a result of the Agency's failure to accommodate her disability. Instead, we find that an award of $50,000 is more in keeping with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Sartini v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112305 (September 19, 2012) (EEOC awarded $50,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where the agency the failed to provide the complainant with a reasonable accommodation which resulted in the aggravation of a preexisting back injury and severe aggravation and exacerbation of Complainant's relatively "stable" mental condition in the form of emotional distress, depression, substantial weight gain, anxiety, paranoia, marital trouble, humiliation, and embarrassment); <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01990520 (February 14, 2002) (EEOC awarded $50,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages to a complainant who was denied a reasonable accommodation for his disability and who experienced an exacerbation of a pre-existing depression); <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A15376 (September 25, 2002), <span class="Italic">req. for recons. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520030082 (January 7, 2003) (EEOC awarded $50,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages to a complainant, who was denied an accommodation for his disability, and who experienced emotional distress, sleeplessness, insomnia, depression, and ulcers).</p>
