<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-97"><span class="space">G.</span> SANCTIONS AT APPELLATE LEVEL</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has long had problems with parties who fail to comply with the requirements of the appellate regulations that the Commission orders in appeals. While complainants posed some of those problems, the vast majority of problems have been generated by agencies that simply fail to comply with basic requirements, such as producing the complaint file or conducting supplemental investigations. Often, the cases come back to the Commission without the complaint file or supplemental investigation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jordy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01971312 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">To deal with the problem, as part of the 1999 revision of its regulations, the Commission included sanctions for parties who fail to comply with the appellate requirements and Commission orders. Under 29 CFR 1614.404(c):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When either party to an appeal fails without good cause shown to comply with the requirements of this section or to respond fully and in timely fashion to requests for information, the Office of Federal Operations shall, in appropriate circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Issue a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Take such other actions as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to address the Commission's request for a supplemental investigation can lead to adverse inferences being imposed on an agency. In <span class="Italic">Lebron v. Postmaster General</span>, 01943052 (1996), the Commission remanded the case with specific instructions to have affidavits taken from selecting officials on why the complainant was not chosen for acting supervisor positions. The failure to follow those instructions led the Commission to draw an adverse inference against the agency; namely, that the agency failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. As a result, a finding of discrimination was entered in favor of the complainant. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Porter v. Navy</span>, 01973979 (1999) (adverse inference appropriate where agency, in a supplemental investigation, did not provide requested information on comparatives); <span class="Italic">Southerland v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960247 (1998) (same); <span class="Italic">Zwettler v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01952255 (1997) (an adverse inference was appropriate where agency did not interview all witnesses on remand and the one witness that agency did interview supported the complainant's contentions of age discrimination); <span class="Italic">Crockett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01934472 (1994) (it is appropriate for the Commission to draw an adverse inference where a case has been remanded for supplemental investigation and, despite two requests, the supplemental investigation is not provided to the Commission).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Prevo v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 01972832 (2000), the Commission imposed an adverse inference on appeal where the agency repeatedly failed to respond to OFO requests for additional information on the qualifications of candidates for the contested position. The Commission drew an adverse inference that the evidence, if produced, would be unfavorable to the agency. The Commission has also imposed sanctions for failure to properly conduct a supplemental investigation in the remand of a mixed case. For example, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0320080085 (2012), the Commission remanded a case for supplemental investigation after the MSPB overturned a finding by its administrative judge that the agency had imposed a 30-day suspension for disclosing information to another complainant and his attorney to assist in an EEO case as retaliation for his own previous protected activity. The Commission imposed an adverse inference against the agency when its supplemental investigation included comparative evidence of other employees with previous EEO activity that had been disciplined for similar disclosures but did not contain evidence on employees who had not previously engaged in EEO activity and made previous disclosures.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A00416 (2000), the agency, in defiance of a Commission order, failed to submit the complete complaint file as required by 29 CFR 1614.403(e), and also failed to show good cause for its failure to do so. Therefore, the Commission decided to sanction the agency pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.404(c) as follows in <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that the agency denied the complainant's hearing request because purportedly it was submitted twelve days late. The agency also failed to investigate the alleged disparate treatment which preceded the complainant's termination because, purportedly, the complainant did not raise the January 25, 1998 incident with the EEO counselor until May 14, 1998, more than two months after the 45-day limitation period had expired. Yet more than two months has passed since the agency was required to submit the complaint file to the Commission. The Commission finds that, given the totality of the circumstances in this case, the appropriate course of action following the agency's failure to timely comply with the Commission's new regulation, and the notices of November 15, 1999, and January 11, 2000, is to not consider the agency's timeliness arguments due to lack of evidence in support of its arguments on the complainant's EEO counselor contact and hearing request.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that likely is limited in application because of the extreme circumstances present, the Commission found an adverse inference was proper as a result of the agency's failure to timely investigate allegations of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Postmaster General</span>, 01963936 (1998), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a preliminary matter, we note that the agency failed to comply with our previous order when it failed to issue a FAD until more than fifteen months after our previous order became final. This delay is particularly egregious in view of the fact that the agency has been neglectful in properly investigating the allegations for over twelve years. Although we accept the agency's contention that the relevant promotion packages were apparently destroyed in the normal course before the appellant first initiated EEO counseling in July 1985, we reject the agency's contention that there is therefore no basis for finding, discrimination against the appellant regarding the 1981 and 1982 promotions. As our previous decision noted, the agency never even processed the appellant's July 1985 allegation for which he filed a formal complaint in January 1986. The allegation was revived only after the appellant again contacted an <span id="Page_626"></span>EEO Counselor three years later in July 1988 alleging, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency "delayed, restrained, and interfered" with the processing of the January 1986 formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have already found that the appellant's January 1986 complaint regarding the breach of the 1981 settlement was timely. If the agency had initiated a timely investigation of that complaint, as it was required to, it might have been possible for the parties to reconstruct the relevant information regarding the 1981 and 1982 promotions with appropriate witness testimony. It is the agency's failure to investigate the January 1986 complaint at all, as well as the agency's subsequent delays in the processing of the several related complaints, that compel us to draw an adverse inference against the agency. There has never been any question that the agency was in breach of the settlement agreement between 1981 and 1985 by failing to remove the record of pre-settlement disciplinary actions from the appellant's personnel records. Now that the agency is unable to provide the relevant evidence to determine what effect that breach had on the appellant's promotion opportunities in 1981 and 1982, because of its own unconscionable dilatory actions, we must draw an inference that the appellant was not selected for either of the two positions because the selecting officials inappropriately relied upon the appellant's record of prior disciplinary actions which should have been removed from his personnel records shortly after the execution of the settlement agreement. Also, because the agency has never provided any explanation for why those records continued to be maintained for so long after the execution of the settlement agreement, we must infer that those records were retained by the agency in reprisal for his prior EEO activity in order to adversely affect his future promotional opportunities and that is in fact what happened in September 1981 and January 1982.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 1999 amendments imposing sanctions in the appellate process were specifically designed to address some of these problems.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dent v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986493 (2000), the Commission imposed adverse inferences where the agency failed to address some elements of the supplemental investigation on remand and allowed vague responses to other elements. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Dent</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant states that he believes that he was discriminated against because of "complaints that he made at [his] branch [office]." In our previous decision, we asked the agency specifically to provide "affidavits from the responsible management officials regarding their knowledge of any of [complainant's] prior EEO activity at the time his reappointment was rescinded or the November 1994 reappointment list was prepared." The agency neither acknowledged nor answered our request. We will, therefore, infer that the alleged discriminating officials were aware of the protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our previous decision, we ordered the agency to explain this apparent inconsistency by providing, among other things: "affidavits from the management officials who submitted the reappointment lists to RO-1 in November 1994, explaining the criteria used for placing the names on those lists, and the reason for not including the [complainant's] name on either of those lists even though he was offered a reappointment in October 1994." We find that the affidavits supplied by the agency in response to all of the questions that we asked were vague, and failed to articulate a reason for this apparent inconsistency. Agency officials repeatedly said that they could not recall the incident in question or the reasons that decisions were made. The agency did not even answer some of the questions that we asked in our Order. When asked for the criteria to choose the people on the list, one agency official, RO-2, recalled that "[i]" an employee was not hired back, [it] was based on [their] last manager's recommendation." Neither RO-2, nor any other agency official could explain what the criteria were in these recommendations, or any of the other criteria for choosing who was on the list. The agency also did not provide a copy of complainant's last manager's recommendation so that complainant would be given a specific, clear and individualized reason as to why he was not reappointed as a TE after he was told in October that he would be. RO-2 went on to state that complainant "was not recommended (by his last manager] and was [therefore] not include[d] on the list." We find it dubious that someone who had been offered reappointment as a TE just one month earlier in October, would not have been recommended by his last manager for reappointment as a TE. For these reasons, we find that the agency failed to rebut the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> inference of discrimination by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. We find, therefore, that complainant was subjected to discrimination based on race, sex, and reprisal when he was denied reappointment as a TE.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 05A00765 (2002), the Commission upheld the imposition of an adverse inference as a sanction on appeal where the agency delayed submission of a supplemental investigation. The Commission found the imposition of sanctions was warranted even though it had the investigation prior to issuance of its decision because "this does not change the fact that the agency's delay in providing this record, as well as its multiple submissions of the wrong records, resulted in the Commission incurring significant administrative expenses, and itself delayed the ultimate issuance of the previous decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The agency is responsible for maintaining the complete complaint file in a case once it is returned to the agency by the administrative judge and is also responsible for producing that record when an appeal is filed. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090050 (2013), the Commission imposed two separate adverse inferences where the agency could not produce a transcript containing most of the testimony of the complainant and her witnesses taken the first morning of the hearing. The agency gave no explanation beyond the assertion that it could no longer find the transcript. The Commission imposed an adverse inference that the complainant was an individual with a disability and that the district reasonable accommodation committee would have likely found a reassignment position for the complainant had it acted on her request for accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission imposed a sanction of default judgment <span class="Italic">Amina W. v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120113823 (2015), where the agency failed to comply with repeated requests to provide OFO with the hearing transcript:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, we find that the Agency has repeatedly failed to comply with EEOC's Orders in this case, including our most recent request for the complete complaint file, and (2) there has been no explanation provided by the Agency for its failure to comply. In the absence of the hearing record, including the hearing transcripts, we are simply unable to properly review whether the record supports the AJ's determination that Complainant failed to establish discrimination or that she was subjected to a hostile work environment. We also find that Complainant is profoundly prejudiced by the Agency's failure to provide the hearing transcript and other hearing documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that, with regard to the fourth factor, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process, should not be underestimated when tailoring a sanction. <span class="Italic">Cox v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720050055 (Dec. 24, 2009). "Protecting the integrity of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process is central to the Commission's ability to carry out its charge of eradicating discrimination in the federal sector." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission must insure that all parties abide by its regulations and orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on all of the above, we find that the most appropriate sanction is a default judgment in Complainant's favor. Accordingly, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant as alleged. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Broadcasting Bd. of Governors</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110117 (Nov. 6, 2014). Our decision to issue a default judgment will effectively emphasize to the Agency the need to comply with Commission orders in a timely manner, as well as ensure that future Agency investigations are adequately developed for adjudication.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120110789 (2013), the Commission found that no sanction was warranted in the unusual circumstances of that case where the agency failed to produce the hearing transcript on appeal. The court reporter died at some point after the hearing and although she had transcribed the administrative judge's bench decision, she did not transcribe the hearing from earlier in the day. The Commission remanded the case to the agency indicating that "it" could request a new hearing. In all likelihood, the "it" is a typographical error as only the complainant and not the agency is entitled to request a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">OFO can impose sanctions where the conduct occurred at the hearing level and a sanction was not imposed by the administrative judge. In <span class="Italic">Moore v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120070573 (2010), the Commission imposed a sanction of an adverse inference where the selecting official's notes were destroyed in contravention of 29 CFR 1602.14. However, the adverse inference was simply that the complainant's nonselection was in part due to personality conflicts with her supervisor and the selecting official and not discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consistent with a recent trend imposing default judgment as a sanction discussed above in the section on Default Judgments, in <span class="Italic">Stoll v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720100007 (2011), the Commission issued a decision in favor of the complainant upholding the administrative judge's findings of discrimination where the agency failed to produce the complete complaint file in support of its appeal, failed to explain its failure and failed to make any argument in support of its appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120092646 (2012), the agency's repeated failures to respond to requests for the complete complaint file resulted in default judgment being imposed as a sanction at the appellate level. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> found that it could impose default judgment as a sanction where the complainant had alleged a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We tried several more times to obtain the hearing record from the Agency. On November 30, 2009, we received what the Agency purported to be the complete complaint file. However, upon closer review of the documents, the Commission found that the documents were not related to the instant complaint, but rather were from another EEO matter that was currently not before the Commission. Subsequently, via e-mails dated August 17, 2011, October 6, 2011, and December 14, 2011, the Commission contacted the Agency to again try to obtain the complete <span id="Page_627"></span>record. In the emails, we indicated that the Agency submitted the wrong record, asked that the Agency submit a copy of the complaint file, the report of investigation, the hearing record and the hearing transcripts for the instant complaint. The Agency failed to respond to the Commission's emails.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Agency's failure to respond to these repeated requests for the complaint file and hearing records, on January 24, 2012, the Commission issued a "Notice to Show Good Cause Why Sanctions Should Not Be Imposed" (Notice to Show Cause). The Notice to Show Cause ordered the Agency to submit the complete file, including the hearing record, or provide good cause why it could not, through evidence and argument, within (20) calendar days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that on February 15, 2012, the Agency sent Complainant's file to the Commission. We note that the Agency only provided the file without specific comment or explanation. We have carefully reviewed the file provided by the Agency. This examination has revealed that the Agency still failed to provide a copy of the hearing record, including the hearing transcripts for the hearing held on March 12, 2009, as we requested. The Agency also provided no explanation for this omission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's failure to submit a complete complaint record, including the hearing record, makes it impossible to determine whether AJ2's findings and credibility determinations were supported by the record. Based on the conduct of the Agency in this case, we find that the imposition of sanctions is warranted. The Commission repeatedly requested the complete complaint file from the Agency. The Agency was on notice that sanctions were possible if the Agency failed to comply. The Agency failed to submit the record requested and, consequently, we cannot conduct a proper review of the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"> Sanctions serve a dual purpose. On the one hand, they aim to deter the underlying conduct of the non-complying party and prevent similar misconduct in the future. <span class="Italic">Barbour v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC 07A30133 (June 16, 2005). On the other hand, they are corrective and provide equitable remedies to the opposing party. Given these dual purposes, sanctions must be tailored to each situation by applying the least severe sanction necessary to respond to a party's failure to show good cause for its actions and to equitably remedy the opposing party. <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (Sept. 25, 2009); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dept of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50030 (Mar. 1, 2007); <span class="Italic">Hale v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (Dec. 8, 2000). Several factors are considered in "tailoring" a sanction and determining if a particular sanction is warranted: (1) the extent and nature of the non-compliance, and the justification presented by the non-complying party; (2) the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; (3) the consequences resulting from the delay in justice; and (4) the effect on the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (Sept. 25, 2009); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dept of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50030 (Mar. 1, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, the Commission finds that: (1) the Agency has repeatedly failed to comply with EEOC's requests for the complete complaint file, including the hearing record, and (2) there has been an excessively long delay with no meritorious explanation provided by the Agency. With the failure by the Agency to provide a copy of the complete record without explanation, the Commission is unable to properly review whether AJ2's findings and credibility determinations were supported by the evidence of record. In this circumstance, we conclude that the most appropriate sanction is default judgment for Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After deciding to issue a default judgment for a complainant, the Commission needs to determine if there is evidence that establishes the complainant's right to relief. One way to show a right to relief is to establish the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">See Royal</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052; <span class="Italic">see also Matheny v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30373 (Apr. 21, 2005). We note that the Commission has previously found that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination sufficient to create an inference of discrimination on the bases of disability and reprisal. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120054332. This is sufficient to support a conclusion, by default judgment, that Complainant is entitled to relief in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Brand v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120113592 (2013). In that case, the Commission imposed default judgment on a hostile environment claim where the agency failed to produce evidence obtained in discovery. OFO ordered the agency to produce the evidence after the complainant timely requested hearing but the agency erroneously issued a FAD. The complainant withdrew his hearing request and asked the discovery evidence be added to the file. The judge ordered the agency to issue a new FAD which it never did. The Commission then vacated the FAD and ordered the agency to supplement the record with the discovery evidence and issue a new FAD. The agency issued a new FAD but despite repeated requests from OFO for the discovery evidence never produced it. In imposing default judgment in <span class="Italic">Brand</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations are perfectly clear with respect to the Agency's obligation to submit the complete record and to do so in a timely manner. "The agency must submit the complaint file to the Office of Federal Operations within 30 days of initial notification that the complainant has filed an appeal." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.403(e). Further, "[a]gencies should develop internal procedures that will ensure the prompt submission of complaint files upon. . .notice that a complainant has filed an appeal." Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), at 9-12 (Nov. 9, 1999). Based on the Agency's repeated failures to submit a complete complaint file, the Commission finds that the most appropriate sanction is default judgment in favor of Complainant as to his hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After deciding to issue a default judgment for a complainant, the Commission needs to determine if there is evidence that establishes Complainant's right to relief. One way to show a right to relief is to establish the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">See Royal</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052; <span class="Italic">see also Matheny v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30373 (Apr. 21, 2005). In the instant case, Complainant alleged that management failed to protect him after he complained that he was harassed by co-workers. For example, Complainant claimed that CW1 has intimidated and taunted him because of his race since December 2005 and management failed to address her behavior despite his reports. Based on the specific circumstances present, and the Agency's failure to produce the hearing record, as well as all discovery conducted pertaining to this specific claim, the Commission finds that Complainant would have established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discriminatory harassment and this is sufficient to support a conclusion, by default judgment, that Complainant is entitled to relief in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Holley v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720110037 (2012) (adverse inference resulted in rejection of agency appeal of administrative judge's fee award where agency failed to produce complaint file).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Shehata v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120102315 (2012), the Commission found that remand to the administrative judge for a hearing was a proper sanction where the agency failed to produce the complete complaint file in a case where the judge had granted summary judgment. The agency contended that it had sent the complaint file and produced evidence of a UPS delivery to the Commission. In response to the Commission's show cause order the agency again provided the file but it contained only the report of investigation and no documentation of what occurred at the hearing level. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120102870 (2013); <span class="Italic">James v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120093668 (2012).</p>
