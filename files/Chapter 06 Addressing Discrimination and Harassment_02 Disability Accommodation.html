<section>
<h2 class="h2">DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">You are probably aware that certain employees with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodation in order to perform their job duties. However, it may be less than apparent to you why reasonable accommodation is such an important goal and where you fit into the picture.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal agencies are charged with being model employers of individuals with disabilities. Regulations, special hiring authorities, hiring initiatives, and executive orders have all been aimed at encouraging agencies to hire and retain employees with disabilities in increasing numbers. Most recently, Executive Order 14035 imposed certain mandates on agencies to ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities, although more guidance is expected in the future on specific requirements. For more on EO 14035, review the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility section in the Demonstrating Professionalism chapter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Rehabilitation Act protects federal employees from disability discrimination. The law's goal is to allow qualified applicants and employees who have disabilities a fair opportunity to compete for and retain jobs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reasonable accommodation is a key component of the law against disability discrimination. A reasonable accommodation is a workplace modification or adjustment that allows a qualified individual with a disability to compete for a job, perform the essential functions of a job, or enjoy the benefits and privileges of a job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many individuals with disabilities don't need any accommodation at all. However, some need relatively minor adjustments, and others might need accommodations that require significant effort on the part of agency employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Good management.</b> As a supervisor, you need to leverage the diversity of all of your employees, including your employees with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities have talents, abilities, and expertise that you can tap into to meet your agency mission. Providing these employees with the tools they need to meet the essential functions of their jobs just makes good business sense.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Individualized assessment and the interactive process</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The interactive process is the informal method used for an agency and an employee to identify the employee's limitations and potential accommodations that could overcome those limitations. The extent of a manager's role in the interactive process depends on the agency involved, but just knowing how the process works can help make you a better manager.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Starting the process.</b> The interactive process essentially starts when an employee requests reasonable accommodation or indicates in some way that a physical or mental impairment is creating a barrier to their ability to perform their duties. As the manager, you may be the first person the employee approaches or you may be in the best position to notice job performance difficulties caused by a disability. Of course, you will have help during the reasonable accommodation process, but as the eyes and ears of the agency, you need to be alert to anything that seems like a request for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> If you are contacted by an employee about an accommodation, handle it as a priority. Any unreasonable delay in starting the interactive process after receiving an employee's request could be grounds for a complaint.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Determining if the impairment is a disability.</b> You generally won't have to make the call about whether an employee has a disability, but you may have to contribute to the decision, so it's best to have a good understanding of what's involved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Therefore, in a nutshell, there are two steps to determining if a condition is a disability.</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> <b>Is there a physical or mental impairment?</b> A physical impairment is any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss that affects a body system. A mental impairment is any mental or psychological disorder.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> <b>Does it substantially limit one or more of the employee's major life activities?</b> Major life activities are things like caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, speaking, breathing, and working. The operation of major bodily functions, such as the immune system, special sense organs and skin, and normal cell growth are also major life activities, as well as digestive, reproductive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic (blood), lymphatic, and musculoskeletal functions.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Texta">The determination of whether any of these major life activities is substantially limited is best left to your HR or EEO office, but it's useful to know that the definition of disability is generous. Examples of physical and mental conditions that are virtually always disabilities when medically diagnosed include:</p>
<ul class="bull-b">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Missing limbs.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Epilepsy.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Cancer.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Deafness.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Blindness.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Intellectual disability.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Autism.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Major depressive disorder.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Bipolar disorder.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Post-traumatic stress disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Determining if the employee is qualified.</b> Employees with disabilities are only entitled to reasonable accommodation if they can perform the essential functions of the position they hold or want with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee with a disability has the education, experience, and other job qualifications necessary for the position at issue but needs certain adjustments to perform the essential functions of the job, it's time to get down to the real work of the interactive process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Interactive process.</b> Briefly, the interactive process is an informal and flexible dialog between the agency and the individual with a disability that is designed to identify the precise limitations of the individual and what accommodations could overcome those limitations. If the accommodation needed is obvious and simple, the process should be relatively quick. More complicated needs may require a lengthy back-and-forth exchange between the parties and possibly outside assistance. Continuous communication is a crucial part of the process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Delay.</b> The EEOC recognizes that some reasonable accommodations are complicated such that reaching an agreement with all parties and implementing the planned course of action can take time, However, an agency that is responsible for unreasonable delay in the interactive process could be found liable for the denial of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In determining whether an agency has unnecessarily delayed in the reasonable accommodation process, the EEOC looks to factors such as: 1) the reasons for the delay; 2) the length of the delay; 3) how much the individual with a disability and the agency contributed to the delay; 4) what the agency was doing during the delay; and 5) whether the required accommodation was simple or complex to provide.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Accommodations</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Your agency doesn't have to choose the accommodation a qualified employee with a disability wants, but it has to provide an effective accommodation unless it can show doing so would be an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reasonable accommodations run the gamut from very simple workspace changes, such as turning a desk to face a doorway, to complex technology, such as unique computer programs. Experts say that most disabilities can be accommodated for a reasonable cost and effort.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although some accommodations are obvious, others take more thoughtful dialogue between the agency and the employee. It's important for all parties to remain open-minded and act in a good-faith spirit of cooperation during discussions about possible reasonable accommodations. It's also important for agencies to keep the interactive process moving. Difficulty in finding the right accommodation or in making an accommodation functional should not stop the communication. Instead, the agency should continue to work with the employee to find solutions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here are several examples of accommodations that may be reasonable. As always, the determination will be based on an individualized assessment of the employee and the job.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Adjustment of a work schedule to accommodate treatment or symptoms.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Flexible work hours.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reallocation or reassignment of nonessential duties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Telework or remote work.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Provision of a sign language interpreter.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Provision of a reader.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Voice recognition software.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Workspace rearrangement.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An ergonomic chair.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Time off to attend an alcohol or drug abuse rehabilitation program.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reassignment to another location.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Change in supervisory techniques.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Memory aids.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reassignment to a vacant position.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Undue hardship.</b> Accommodations are not reasonable if they would create an undue hardship for the agency. Undue hardship is significant difficulty or expense. Because federal agencies generally have very large budgets, expense alone is rarely considered an undue hardship. In the case of federal agencies, a significantly negative impact on business operations is the most likely factor to be considered in assessing undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A proposed accommodation generally would be an undue hardship and therefore unreasonable if it:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Required the elimination of one or more essential duties from an employee's position.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Required the acceptance of a lower standard of performance than is required of other employees in the position.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Required the agency to tolerate misconduct that is not tolerated with other employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Required the agency to place the employee or other employees at a health or safety risk.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Required the agency to make a change that violated a collective bargaining agreement, with limited exceptions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Required the agency to make a schedule change that seriously impacted the rights of other employees such as when the small number of available individuals would prevent the agency from completing necessary tasks or work.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Required the agency to leave a position open indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Short-term accommodations.</b> Agencies are also responsible for accommodating short-term conditions which qualify as disabilities under the ADA Amendments Act if they are sufficiently limiting. The problem is that some agencies may grant an accommodation for a couple of months but never revisit the arrangement, so it ends up continuing for years.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To avoid this, agencies should:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Be clear that the accommodation is being granted for a short-term disability.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Specify in writing how long the accommodation will last.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Specify when the accommodation will be reevaluated.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Specify that the accommodation is not indefinite in length.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Interim accommodations.</b> When all the facts make it reasonably likely that an employee will be entitled to a reasonable accommodation but the accommodation cannot be provided immediately, the agency must provide an interim accommodation, if it is effective and possible without imposing undue hardship. An interim accommodation may be necessary to avoid, for example, a worsening of symptoms, exacerbation of a medical condition, or pain. The EEOC has found that the denial of an interim accommodation while the interactive process was pending can create agency liability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Extending leave.</b> If an employee continues to make repeated requests for extending a temporary accommodation, such as leave, further documentation may be needed. Follow your agency protocol to request the documentation, and make sure it explains whether the employee will return at the end of 30 days, needs another medical reevaluation, and is ever likely to be able to return to work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the doctor says it's not clear whether the person will ever be able to come back, your agency should then discuss options for reassignment fitting the employee's qualifications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Checking back with the employee.</b> After an accommodation is agreed upon, make sure it is actually working for the employee. As the manager, you are in the best position to notice if a chosen accommodation isn't working. If the employee still seems to be experiencing barriers to performing their duties because of their disability, it might be necessary to notify your HR or EEO office in order to reinstate the interactive process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Dealing with coworker concerns.</b> Other employees may be curious about an employee's reasonable accommodation or even feel the employee is somehow being unfairly favored. These feelings might be natural, but you are required to maintain the confidentiality of medical information. Accordingly, you cannot specifically explain the reasons for an accommodation. You can simply say that the agency provides the tools necessary for employees to do their jobs or that the agency complies with the law. Consult your HR or EEO office if you think you need assistance with an appropriate response.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although coworkers are usually simply curious, watch out for any signs that they are acting on any feelings that a reasonable accommodation is somehow unfair. Negative reactions to an employee being accommodated could create a disability-based hostile work environment. If you don't step in to stop any harassing behavior, your agency could be found liable for discrimination.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Personal use items</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency is generally not required to provide an accommodation if it is primarily needed for an employee's personal use. The Rehabilitation Act defines "reasonable accommodations" as modifications that specifically assist an individual in performing the duties of a particular job. Equipment and devices that assist a person in daily activities both on and off the job -- such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, and mobility devices -- are therefore likely to be considered personal items that an agency is not required to provide.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times, however, the line between personal use item and work-related need may not be all that clear. In some cases, equipment that otherwise would be considered personal may be required as an accommodation if it is specifically designed or required to meet job-related, rather than personal, needs. For example, while an agency would not be required to provide an employee with eyeglasses for general use, it may be required to provide an employee who has a vision impairment with glasses specifically needed to use a particular computer monitor at work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also note that although an agency is not required to accommodate an employee by providing an assistive device that is needed both on and off the job, it must make reasonable workplace modifications that allow the employee to use their own device.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Job Accommodation Network, which assists agencies with the reasonable accommodation process, offers the following scenarios to illustrate the distinction between what is considered a personal use item and what is considered a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>SPF clothing.</b> A property inspector was advised by his doctor to stay out of sunlight because of a skin condition. While he stayed indoors during the daytime as much as possible, his job required him to travel between various sites during the day. He asked his employer to provide him with SPF-protectant clothing as an accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employer was not required to provide the requested accommodation under these circumstances. Dealing with sunlight was obviously not a unique feature of the employee's job; it was something he also confronted his personal life. That he chose to stay inside as much as possible on his personal time did not mean that the employer had to provide protective clothing so he could perform his job. Avoiding exposure to the sun was a personal need as opposed to a strictly job-related one.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, the employer would need to consider other possible accommodations, such as adjusting the employee's hours so he was not doing inspections during the sunniest part of the day.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Prescription safety glasses.</b> An apprentice in an electrical technician program requested that his employer provide him with prescription-strength safety glasses. Wearing safety glasses was a requirement of the program, but the apprentice wore prescription eyeglasses and was unable to wear the safety glasses provided.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There's no clear-cut answer to this question and, ultimately, it's up to the employer to determine what is reasonable on a case-by-case basis. However, as the request was for safety glasses, and those safety glasses were required to meet a company safety standard and not a personal need, it was possible the apprentice's request was not a request for a personal use item.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies should consider possible alternatives, such as goggles that could be worn over the apprentice's eyeglasses or side safety shields that attach onto regular eyeglasses to provide additional safety.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Space heater.</b> An agency failed to reasonably accommodate an employee when it did not provide her with the space heater she requested to address the severe pain and inflammation she experienced due to Crohn's disease. The heat alleviated her pain and allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Employee forgoes personal use item.</b> An issue that may arise is whether an agency must consider reasonable accommodations when an employee chooses not to use a personal use item, such as an employee who does not wear their hearing aids at work because they hurt or are uncomfortable. In such a situation, the agency may be required to provide an accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Rehabilitation Act requires agencies to provide accommodations that remove workplace barriers, regardless of what effect medications or assistive devices may have on the employee's ability to perform their job. Therefore, the agency may be obligated to provide an accommodation, even though it is not obligated to provide the personal use item.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For example, an agency may have to provide an amplified telephone or alternative means of communication for the employee with a hearing impairment who chooses not to wear their hearing aids.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Service or emotional support animals</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">If you have read or heard about an increasing variety of animals being used for service or emotional support, you may be concerned about how to handle an accommodation request that involves an animal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The short answer is that these requests should be handled the same way other requests for reasonable accommodation are handled by the agency -- using an interactive process that is respectful, responsive, and tailored to the situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Trained guide dogs.</b> Starting with a relatively familiar situation, suppose a qualified applicant who is blind uses a guide dog. Here are the areas that should be examined by your agency:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Is the applicant an individual with a disability?</b> The applicant is obviously an individual with a disability because they are substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing. There is no need to request medical information to determine if they are an individual with a disability.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Is the applicant qualified for the position?</b> It has already been determined that the applicant has the necessary qualifications for the position.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>What are possible accommodations that would allow the applicant to perform the essential functions of the position?</b> The applicant has a guide dog that is trained to perform the functions they need to get to the job and move around the job site. However, the agency may need to explore such matters as where the dog will go to relieve itself and whether coworker allergies will need to be addressed through air filters or workspace assignments. The agency also will need to address any accommodations needed by the applicant that are unrelated to their guide dog.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Is allowing the guide dog into the workplace an undue hardship for the agency?</b> Because guide dogs are house-trained and conditioned to perform their duties without disrupting others, it would be difficult to argue that allowing a guide dog in the workplace as an accommodation for an otherwise qualified individual would be an undue hardship.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Service dogs.</b> Dogs are increasingly being trained to perform other services for individuals with disabilities. There are few EEOC decisions addressing service dogs. However, the limited case law supports agencies proceeding as they would with other types of accommodation requests.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may request reasonable medical documentation if the individual's disability and/or need for reasonable accommodation are not obvious.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As part of the interactive process, the agency may explore what functions the dog carries out and how they help the individual.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee fails to submit reasonable medical documentation to establish that: 1) they have a disability; and 2) that the dog is specifically trained and necessary to overcome limitations caused by his disability, the agency may decide the dog is not a reasonable accommodation and deny the request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Emotional support animals.</b> More recently, media accounts of emotional support animals, such as ducks and pigs, being taken on planes and other modes of transportation have raised the issue of whether agencies might be required to allow a variety of animals to accompany their owners to the workplace as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Managers should be aware that this is territory that is largely uncharted. Although two sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act limit service animals to trained dogs and miniature horses, the section of the ADA which applies to employment provides no specific guidelines on service animals. The EEOC has not yet provided specific guidance in this area, but you should not reject requests for emotional support animals in the workplace without an individualized assessment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee requests an emotional support animal as a reasonable accommodation, you should seek guidance from the office responsible for addressing reasonable accommodation requests at your agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may seek medical documentation if the employee's disability and/or need for accommodation is not obvious. Using the interactive process, the agency and the employee can explore the employee's needs and possible alternative accommodations that would effectively address the employee's limitations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For example, an employee who requests permission for an emotional support animal because of depression may be accommodated effectively if they are allowed to take breaks to go outside or to call a loved one.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee provides medical documentation that they have a disability and that an emotional support animal is the only effective accommodation to assist them in overcoming workplace obstacles, an agency still may prohibit the animal if it creates an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An accommodation is an undue hardship if it requires significant difficulty or expense, taking into account an agency's operations and resources.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Undue hardship cannot simply be declared if a request is challenging or unusual. An agency must specifically document why the request poses an undue hardship that cannot be overcome.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the case of large, noisy, and/or untrained animals, this documentation may involve a specific but fairly simple analysis. This would also be the case if an employee's job functions are not conducive to caring for an animal at work or if there is no way to separate coworkers who are allergic to the animal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, if the request cannot be denied as an undue hardship, the agency may need to move forward with allowing the emotional support animal to come to work. Experts suggest that an employer can use a written agreement that provides for a trial period during which the request can be denied if the employee cannot keep the animal quiet or under control.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Bottom line.</b> As the model employer of individuals with disabilities, federal agencies must address requests for reasonable accommodation, no matter how unique, with care and respect. If a request is denied, the agency should document the reasons, as well as any efforts to find a different but effective accommodation.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Allergies and chemical sensitivity</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">As increasing numbers of people report sensitivities to environmental triggers, awareness of allergies and chemical sensitivities is growing. For some people, symptoms can be triggered by environmental agents commonly found in the workplace, such as latex, toner, and ink, along with airborne irritants, such as dust, pollen, and fragrance. Other individuals have allergies that can be triggered by foods that are brought to the workplace by coworkers. Exposure to allergens in the workplace may negatively impact employees' productivity and jeopardize their health and safety.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee's allergy or chemical sensitivity substantially limits a major life activity, it may be a disability under the Rehabilitation Act, entitling the employee to a reasonable accommodation. Agencies should treat employees who come to them with allergy or chemical sensitivity issues the same way they would an employee with any other impairment that is a disability:</p>
<ol class="num-ri">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Enter into the interactive process.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Ask questions that are job-related and consistent with business necessity.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Ask the employee what can be done to help resolve the situation.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> Provide an effective accommodation unless accommodating the employee would be an undue hardship.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">This process may take some time and effort, and sometimes a few different solutions may need to be tried before an effective accommodation is found.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Fragrance sensitivity.</b> The most common environmental trigger is sensitivity to fragrance. Although perfumes and colognes are generally what come to mind when discussing fragrance sensitivity, fragrance is added to a surprising variety of daily use items. Air fresheners, scented candles, personal care products, laundry and cleaning products, and even pesticides have fragrance added to them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A recent study found that 11 percent of Americans report sensitivity to common chemical products and 2.5 percent have been medically diagnosed with multiple chemical sensitivity. The number of individuals citing sensitivity to various products was higher among those with asthma.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Typical symptoms of fragrance sensitivity include breathing difficulty, tightening of the throat, headaches, migraines, nausea, difficulty concentrating, and memory loss. Other symptoms include fatigue, dizziness, skin irritation, and muscle pain.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Food allergies.</b> The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases describes food allergies as an abnormal reaction of the immune system to a component of food that sometimes produces a life-threatening response. The NIAI states that food allergies affect approximately 5 percent of children and 4 percent of adults in the United States, with a rising prevalence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some of the major life activities that could be impacted by food allergies include the functioning of the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and/or the cardiovascular system. Severe allergic reactions can be life-threatening.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Accommodation options.</b> Some options for accommodating allergies and chemical sensitivities include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Indoor air quality.</b> Addressing poor indoor air quality can positively affect the whole workforce in terms of making it a better work environment for everyone. If there appears to be an air quality issue, agencies can consider air-quality testing by an industrial hygiene engineer.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>HVAC systems.</b> Maintaining the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems is important. Keeping these systems clean and working properly can control or eliminate any pollutants that may be running through those systems. For example, do not pump air-freshening chemicals through these systems, and make sure there are enough fresh-air exchanges for the room size.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fragrance-free workplace.</b> Create a work environment free of known pollutants like fragrances, pesticides, tobacco smoke, exhaust fumes, and cleaning agents. Do not allow the use of scented candles and "plug-ins," so these pollutants can be avoided in the work area.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Regulating food use.</b> Consider prohibiting certain foods in shared workspace or provide a separate space for coworkers to warm and eat foods that trigger an employee's allergies.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Alternative work arrangements.</b> Look at providing alternative work arrangements, including working from a different office or from home or working a different schedule.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Work environment.</b> Mold and mildew can create serious health issues for people, so ensure that the work environment is clean and dry.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Air cleaners.</b> Air cleaners, and other filtering technology, should be chosen carefully to ensure the proper filtering of air based upon room size and what needs to be filtered.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Social events.</b> Don't require an employee with fragrance, food, or chemical sensitivities to attend social events where people tend to wear scented products or a triggering food might be served.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Meetings.</b> Allow employees to attend meetings remotely, if possible, or to wear a respirator mask.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Cleaning products.</b> Opt for unscented odor neutralizers, instead of products that just mask the odor, and use nontoxic or natural cleaning remedies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Undue hardship.</b> Severe allergies and chemical sensitivities can be difficult to accommodate, particular in certain settings, so accommodation may be an undue hardship. An accommodation is an undue hardship if it requires significant difficulty or expense, taking into account an agency's operations and resources.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, undue hardship cannot simply be declared if a request is challenging or unusual. An agency must specifically document why the request poses an undue hardship that cannot be overcome.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Fragrance policies.</b> An agency may not be required to totally ban fragrances from the workplace because of the difficulty of enforcing such a ban, particularly when a workplace is open to the public. An agency may, however, choose to have a voluntary fragrance-free policy designed to raise employees' awareness about fragrance sensitivities and requesting employees to voluntarily refrain from wearing scented products.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Bottom line</b>. As the model employer of individuals with disabilities, federal agencies must address requests for reasonable accommodation, no matter how unique, with care and respect. If a request is denied, the agency should document the reasons, as well as any efforts to find a different but effective accommodation.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Assume that disability is the same as inability.</b> The key consideration is whether an employee is able to perform the essential functions of a position to the required level of performance -- not whether the employee has a disability.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Assume that an employee has a disability.</b> Some disabilities are obvious, but many are not. It is not your job to determine whether an employee has a disability. Always consult your HR experts.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Delay.</b> Most simple and obvious accommodations can be provided quickly. The EEOC recognizes that more complex accommodations can take time, but an agency that delays unreasonably can be found liable for denying reasonable accommodation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to explore multiple accommodations.</b> Don't make the mistake of simply settling into a struggle over whether you will adopt the one and only accommodation suggested by an employee. Put your imagination and available resources to work to see if other accommodations are feasible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to follow up on accommodations.</b> After an accommodation is agreed upon, make sure to check back with the employee to ensure the accommodation is working.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Tolerate unacceptable performance or conduct.</b> Employees with disabilities must live up to the same standards of conduct and performance as other employees. There is no reason for you to accept less.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Hold an employee with a disability to a higher standard of conduct.</b> The performance standards you apply must be fair and equal with regard to all employees. Whether conscious or unconscious, if you require a higher level of performance from an employee with a disability as compared with other employees, you are inviting a claim of disability discrimination.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Tolerate unacceptable health or safety risks.</b> An accommodation is neither reasonable nor responsible if it would result in your allowing an employee with disabilities or coworkers to be placed at a health or safety risk.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Treat an employee as disabled without a clear indication of disability.</b> Agencies have gotten into trouble because employees have been "regarded as disabled" by managers. Don't assume an employee with an impairment or a health condition has a disability. Always check with your EEO office before granting accommodations based on a disability.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Discuss employee's medical information with other employees.</b> It may be tempting to explain your actions related to the reasonable accommodation of an employee, but by doing so, you would be violating confidentiality rules. If coworkers ask about reasonable accommodation activities in the workplace, seek guidance from your HR or EEO office.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are all impairments considered to be disabilities?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, such as working. The definition of disability is interpreted broadly, so it might include more than you would expect, but don't assume that an employee's impairment or medical condition is a disability. Make sure you contact an EEO specialist or HR to make that determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. When am I required to accommodate a disability?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> When:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You are put on notice of the need for accommodation of the disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee is capable of performing the essential functions of the position with accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are one or more reasonable accommodations available.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Who determines whether an accommodation is reasonable?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Initially, the agency determines whether an accommodation is reasonable. However, the accommodation must be effective, and if the employee is dissatisfied, they may file an administrative appeal or lawsuit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Must an agency provide an accommodation for an employee with a disability within a specific timeframe?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> There is no specific time limit on providing reasonable accommodation. However, agencies are required to respond "expeditiously" to requests for reasonable accommodation. A simple accommodation should be provided right away. An agency may take time to work through a more complicated reasonable accommodation scenario, but it is crucial to make a continuous and concerted effort. The EEOC has found discrimination and liability for damages in cases where agencies have eventually provided accommodation, but unreasonably delayed before doing so. Therefore, it is important to work diligently to move the process forward. Agencies faced with obstacles in processing complex accommodation requests may be able to avoid liability by providing interim accommodations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Am I required to guess which employees have disabilities and come up with accommodations for them?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No, it generally is up to individual employees to let you know they have disabilities and to identify the problems posed at work. An employee doesn't have to use the words "reasonable accommodation" but must provide sufficient information to link a disability to a problem posed at work. If you know an employee has a disability and that they are experiencing workplace problems because of that disability, you may need to start a conversation by asking them if there is anything they need to perform their job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Am I required to provide the accommodation an employee requests?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. An employee may identify a desired accommodation, but you are free to provide a different one if, after engaging in an interactive process, you determine it is effective in meeting the job-related needs of the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Do I have to eliminate the essential duties of a position as an accommodation?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No, you do not have to change or eliminate an essential element of a position. If eliminating a nonessential duty would enable an employee to perform the essential duties of the position, however, you might have to do so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Do I have to reduce workload to accommodate an employee's disability?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Not for any essential duty of the position. Employees with disabilities are required to meet the same performance levels as other employees, either with or without accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I take disciplinary action against an employee with mental disabilities?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes, if the employee engages in misconduct for which you would discipline any other employee. Disability does not provide a shield for inappropriate conduct or unacceptable performance. However, discipline must be fair as compared to that received by other employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does the current use of illegal drugs qualify as a disability?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. However, recovering drug users may be protected if they are no longer using drugs. Check with your EEO office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What should I do if other employees ask about the reasons for an accommodation?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> If questions arise, simply explain that everyone is provided with the tools necessary to do their jobs. You should not discuss an employee's disability with other workers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. One of my employees requested that they be permitted to bring their dog to our workplace as a way to accommodate their anxiety. Do I have to allow such a request?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> In this type of situation, you should consult with HR, the disability program manager, or the responsible reasonable accommodation coordinator. A number of factors go into determining whether an animal may be permitted in your workplace as an accommodation. Once HR and the appropriate agency officials know about the request, they will determine whether allowing the dog to accompany their owner to work would be a reasonable accommodation under the specific circumstances involved. As a starting point, the employee will likely be asked for supporting medical documentation. Officials may then explore alternative accommodations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If it's found that the animal is the only accommodation that would assist the individual in performing their duties, other considerations must be made, like agency policy and exceptions, whether the animal poses an undue hardship to the agency, coworker contact with the dog, and course of action if the animal misbehaves.</p>
