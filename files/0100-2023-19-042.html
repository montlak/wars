<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-35"><span class="space">8.</span> Nonselections and Promotions</h4>
<p class="noindent">In most cases, the agency will defend nonselections and promotions on the basis that it has selected the best qualified candidate for the position. However, that is not the only defense available. The agency can, for example, show that the appellant was not suited for the position without arguing the relative merits of each candidate's qualifications. In <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Department of Army</span>, 01821457 (1983), the agency rebutted the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that he had a critical attitude toward management, was difficult to work with, and had taken excessive sick leave. The agency can also show that the promotion of the complainant would violate merit promotion principles. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ingeborg B. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120141324 (2016) (involving a noncompetitive promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent">The general rule is that the agency is free to choose among equally qualified candidates, provided its decision is not based on prohibited discrimination. "Court and Commission precedent have consistently held that when there are equally desirable candidates competing for the same position, the selecting official may exercise his/her prerogative in choosing between the candidates and, absent discrimination, a trier of fact should not substitute his judgment for the legitimate exercise of managerial discretion." <span class="Italic">Caudillo v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01994832 (2001) (selecting official legitimately selected candidate who, in his estimation, had superior leadership skills). In <span class="Italic">Denzler v. Department of Army</span>, 01821445 (1983), the agency rebutted the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of nonpromotion where it showed that other GS-12 chemical engineers were promoted to GS-13 without the opportunity to make oral presentations and appellant was given several opportunities to make such presentations.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the agency must provide "a specific, clear, and individualized explanation" indicating how it reached its selection decision in order to sustain its burden of production. The Commission applied that standard in <span class="Italic">Ashlea P. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120182299 (2019):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the evidence presented by the Agency is not sufficient <span id="Page_713"></span>to provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation as to why Complainant was not selected for the position for which she was deemed qualified. The Agency explained the general mechanics of the selection process but failed to provide an individualized explanation for Complainant's specific situation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Koudry v. Dep't of Educ</span>., Request No. 0520100196 (Apr. 13, 2010) (discrimination found where agency merely explained the mechanics of selection process, provided list of candidates deemed best qualified, and summarized applications of selectee and complainant, but failed to provide statements from selecting officials explaining how complainant's qualifications were evaluated compared to selectee's qualifications). The record simply does not indicate how the Agency determined which seven candidates would be interviewed, or why Complainant was not one of the seven. Merely indicating that the selecting official, or their designees, have the discretion to interview any or all applicants referred as best qualified is not enough--especially in a case were all of the interviewees, unlike Complainant, had never engaged in protected EEO activity. As was noted above, the Agency acknowledged that the record did not establish who chose the seven interviewees. We would further add that the record also does not identify why they were chosen.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to overcome Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination, and Complainant prevails without having to prove pretext. <span class="Italic">Chhe v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev</span>., EEOC Request No. 0720090008 (Aug. 6, 2010) (the consequence of an agency's failure to meet its burden of production under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is that the complainant, having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, prevails without having to make any demonstration of pretext), <span class="Italic">request for recon. den</span>. EEOC Request No. 0520100584 (Jan. 27, 2011). As a result of the Agency's failure to meet its burden of production, we find that Complainant has established that she was subjected to discrimination on the basis of reprisal for prior EEO activity when she was not selected for an interview, and therefore not selected for the ERB position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Glomski v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955157 (1997), the Commission found the agency failed to meet its burden of production where the agency simply provided the selection procedures and the scores received by the respective candidates with no explanation of how the points were assigned for the various factors. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 01985638 (2001), the Commission found the agency failed to articulate a legitimate reason where the selecting official testified he followed the recommendation of a district director in making promotions, but the agency submitted no evidence as to why the director made his recommendations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01995055 (2001), the Commission elaborated on the agency's burden of production in a nonpromotion case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden of production now shifts to the agency to rebut the presumption by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the non-selections. While the agency's burden of production is not onerous, it must nevertheless provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for the treatment accorded complainant. Complainant is entitled to some rationale for his non-selections that provides him with an opportunity to attempt to satisfy his ultimate burden of proving that the agency's explanation was a pretext for discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, we find that the agency did not meet this burden. In an effort to articulate its reasons, the agency presented testimony from the selecting official (SO) for all positions in the Engineering Service since 1980. SO's testimony however, does not contain any reasons for complainant's non-selections. In point of fact, SO testified that he did not recall any of the non-selections at issue. The record evidence also shows that the agency proffered the testimony of the general foreman (SO2) in the Engineering Service. However, he too, failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for complainant's non-selections.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also did not present any interview notes or other written documentation that would have provided some evidence to support their selections. Thus, the ability to conduct a comparative analysis was effectively thwarted. The Commission notes that the agency conceded that the necessary information could have been obtained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the evidence presented by the agency is not sufficient to provide that specific, clear, and individualized explanation that is required by Burdine to explain why complainant was not selected for the positions for which he was qualified. Instead, the agency's articulation consisted of conclusory statements that complainant was not the best qualified and therefore not selected. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the agency did not articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting complainant. Thus, we conclude that in light of the agency's failure to meet its burden of production, that the agency discriminated against complainant on the basis of his race.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hatcher-Capers v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A60008 (2006), the Commission upheld the decision of its administrative judge that the agency had failed to carry its burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason where none of the screening panel members could recall why the complainant did not make the best qualified list. The record did not contain any of the scores assigned to applicants by the panel and one panel member testified he could "only assume" that the complainant did not demonstrate the skills necessary for promotion. In the absence of any specific reasons for the panel's actions, the agency failed to meet its burden of production. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A50140 (2006), the Commission found that the agency failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason where the selecting official testified he relied upon the recommendations of subordinate directors, but gave no specifics as to why the complainant was not selected.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Clemente v. Attorney General</span>, 0720080012 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recon.</span> 052009075 (2009), the Commission upheld the determination of an administrative judge that the agency had failed to meet its burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason where the selecting official merely described the process and his own reasons for rating the complainant as he did without reference to how the other candidates were rated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next we turn to the AJ's finding that the agency failed to carry its burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). The agency indicated that complainant was not selected for an interview because the selectees were "more qualified" for the position than complainant was, and the CIJ indicated that complainant did not receive enough "highly recommended" votes to garner an interview, and as such, was ultimately not selected for the position. The Commission is cognizant that the agency's burden to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions is not an onerous one. However, as the AJ found, the agency in the present case failed to set forth, with sufficient clarity, reasons for complainant's nonselection such that he has been given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that those reasons are pretext. <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 258 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Parker v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990): <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The CIJ merely stated the process for selection and his own reason for rating complainant as he did. As the AJ found, the record contains no clarification as to what specific qualities made those individuals better qualified than complainant, and it is not sufficient to simply say that the selectees were more qualified than complainant. There must be some evidentiary proof to support this conclusory statement. Moreover, the agency failed to provide the other Supervisory Judges reasons for rating complainant as they did, and as the AJ noted, the CIJ was only one of at least 8 panel members, rating complainant and his reason did not carry greater weight than the other members of the selection panel. We note that, while an agency can choose the selectee it wishes, it must clearly set forth its reasons in order to afford complainant the opportunity to demonstrate that its articulated reasons for choosing the selectee was a pretext for discrimination. We agree with the AJ's finding in this case that the agency failed to do so. Therefore, we, like the AJ, conclude that the lack of specificity as to why the agency chose the selectees instead of complainant makes it impossible for complainant to prove the reasons for not selecting him were a pretext for discrimination. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the AJ's finding of national origin and sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120072888 (2008), the Commission found that the agency failed to present a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason where the selecting officials testified about why they selected the successful candidate, but offered no explanation as to why he was in fact better qualified than the complainant. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn next to the agency's burden to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. We are cognizant that the agency's burden is not an onerous one. Nevertheless, the Commission determines that the agency has failed to set forth, with sufficient clarity, reasons for complainant's nonselection such that he has been given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that those reasons are pretext. <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 258 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Parker v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990): <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997). In the instant case, the Recommending Official (RO) explained the type of person he sought, and provided various reasons why he had chosen the selectee. For instance, RO stated that he chose the selectee because "he was an attorney, with a very strong background in immigration law." In addition, RO stated "Although he had a very short time with CIS, he got very strong recommendations and seemed like a good candidate."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, when asked whether he remembered complainant's application at all, RO stated "I can't say that I do" but noted "I want to say that I gave serious consideration to everyone who applied." RO also explained that he "wanted someone who would be a good writer, had good analytical skills, was very knowledgeable about the work we do, and would be able to represent our agency, not only with the public, but also with other agencies with whom we work. . ." However, the record contains no further <span id="Page_714"></span>clarification as to how RO believed that complainant's qualifications compared with those of the selectee, or specifically why they fell short.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the Selecting Official (SO), he initially noted that RO "reviewed the qualifications of the candidates, the list of candidates, checked some references of the candidates and made some recommendations to me." SO further asserted that he made his selection based on the individuals recommended by RO (which did not include complainant). The Counselor's Report indicates that SO stated that he normally selects the recommended candidate "if there are no particular problems with the candidate." SO asserted that he "independently reviewed the packets of some of the other people who were on the list," but could "not recall" whether he reviewed complainant's packet or not. SO also noted that no interviews were conducted. Although SO listed the qualities that he was seeking (i.e. "an individual who could work independently. . .an individual who had knowledge and abilities, not only in immigration law in general, but more particularly in the area of temporary workers in the US, permanent workers in the US, and some of the issues the Services is dealing with regarding fraud in those areas"), he too failed to provide any clarification as to whether he believed complainant possessed these skills and abilities, or why they did not measure up to those skills and abilities of the selectee. Although SO stated that RO told him that "he did not feel that [complainant's] abilities came up to the level he was looking for," SO explained that RO made this statement after complainant had filed his EEO complaint, when SO had contacted RO to discuss the validity of the formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency can choose the selectee it wishes from any properly constituted certificate. However, an agency must clearly set forth its reasons in order to afford a complainant the opportunity to demonstrate that its articulated reasons for choosing that selectee were a pretext for discrimination. We find that in this case, the agency failed to do so. Therefore, we find the lack of specificity as to why the selectee was chosen makes it impossible for complainant to prove the reasons for not selecting him were a pretext for discrimination. In fact, complainant's first-level supervisor (the District Director, GS-15, Honolulu District, against whom complainant also initially made allegations of age discrimination/harassment) stated, according to the EEO Counselor "that he also questioned the selection made for the SAO position, as the individual did not have much program direction experience. He believed that [complainant] was much more qualified than the selectee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that this record is completely lacking any explanation as to why complainant was not selected for the position or why he was not the best candidate. As a result, we find that the agency failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting complainant. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Target Corp,</span> 460 F.3d 946, 959 (7th Cir. 2006) (employer should have articulated what qualities applicant failed to meet in order to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason such that the applicant knows what evidence to present in order to establish pretext); <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Ridge,</span> 394 F.3d 311, 316-17 (5th Cir. 2004) (employer's statement that employee was not promoted because she was "not sufficiently suited for the job," without further explanation showing how employee failed to meet the employer's standard failed to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason with sufficient clarity to afford the employee a realistic opportunity to challenge the reason as pretext). We note that nothing in the record suggests that complainant was less likely to be trainable for the position or that the selectee was more likely to be successful at the subsequent training than complainant. The agency has therefore failed to provide an articulation of its reasons for not selecting complainant for the positions in question sufficient to overcome complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Prevo v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972832 (March 10, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120132105 (2015) ("We find that the above affidavit testimony is not sufficiently particularized or specific to permit Complainant to mount an evidentiary challenge to any of the explanations offered by the Agency for her non-selection. The affidavits set forth no objective facts to support its vague, generalized conclusions that the selectees were more qualified for the position."); <span class="Italic">Marine V., et al., v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720170001 (2017), discussed below in this chapter under "<a href="0100-2023-26-086.html#sec17-84">Nonselections</a>" (that a preemployment test had produced "good results" in the past was not sufficient to establish a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason where the evidence suggested that the agency used the preemployment written examination as a way to screen out older internal candidates and recruit younger external hires).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Chhe v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0720090008 (2010), the agency apparently focused its efforts on arguing whether the complainant had presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of racial discrimination by arguing that the complainant, who identified herself as a Pacific Islander, was the same as a selectee who was Asian. The agency managed to lose on both counts. First, the Commission found the agency's argument academic because the complainant was from Cambodia and one of the selectees was from the Philippines and, therefore, of a different national origin. That was sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the agency had not satisfied its burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Chhe</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties debated at the hearing whether Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination because one of the selectees identified her race as Pacific Islander, and the debate concerned whether this identification was the same as Asian. It was not disputed that this same individual who was from the Philippines was of a different national origin than Complainant. The Commission finds that the debate was unnecessary given that one of the selectees was a white male who was not from Cambodia. If the AJ had found that the Agency had met its burden of production, the fact that it had selected a female Pacific Islander may have undermined Complainant's claim that she was a victim of race and sex discrimination, but as affirmed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the Agency did not meet its burden of production.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the AJ's determination that the Agency failed to meet its burden of production when it offered an acutely subjective explanation for not selecting Complainant, i.e., she interviewed poorly, and then failed to produce the objective evidence, notes from the interviews, upon which Complainant would rely in her attempt to meet her burden of persuasion. While the Agency argues that the testimony from the two interviewers provided Complainant with a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext, we disagree. A substantial amount of the testimony makes reference to the applications, as opposed to the interviewees' responses; and some of the testimony which does address Complainant's performance in the interview comes from a witness who claimed she could remember very little about the interviews and had no idea why she was asked to participate in the panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The consequence of the Agency's failure to meet its burden of production under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is that Complainant, having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, prevails without having to make any demonstration of pretext. In light of this conclusion, the Commission exercises its discretion not to address whether the Agency violated 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14 or the propriety of the adverse inference.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of an agency failing to meet its burden of production is supplied by <span class="Italic">Myles v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120092511 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the Agency has failed to meet its burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. In its final decision, the Agency articulated that the record did not show where Complainant addressed the KSAs sufficiently, whereas the candidates who made the BQL discussed each of the criteria in detail reflective of the number of points they received. However, we find that this is not a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for Complainant's failure to make the BQL. Although the Agency explained that the BQL candidates scored higher on their applications than Complainant because their applications more thoroughly addressed the assessment criteria, we find that the record does not contain any testimonial or documentary evidence of such a comparison.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the affidavit testimony of P4, P5, and P6 only explained the general mechanics of the application evaluation process and failed to provide an individualized explanation for Complainant's specific score. The testimonial evidence provides no explanation as to why Complainant's application received a lower score or what qualities, if any, made the selectee better qualified for the position than Complainant. In fact, there was no testimony from P4, P5, or P6 specifically mentioning Complainant or the selectee in the context of the selection process, except for P4's testimony that, "[a]t this time, I do not independently recall [Complainant's] application or any of the others, for that matter."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the record does not contain the applications of the selectee or the two other candidates who made the BQL. Although the record contains a "Re-evaluation of Application" from the review panel explaining why Complainant's application received the points it did for each of the twelve assessment criteria, we find that this document provides us with no insight on how Complainant's qualifications were evaluated in comparison with the qualifications of the selectee or the two other BQL candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the Agency failed to articulate a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for its actions, and consequently, Complainant was denied a fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext.<span class="Italic"> See Young v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940517 (Oct. 13, 1995). Thus, the Agency failed to rebut the inference of discrimination by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Therefore, we find that Complainant was subjected to discrimination based on his race, sex, and age when he was not selected for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kitson v. Attorney General</span>, 0720100052 (2011) (explanation that selectee was "positive," had "some vision," and did not require direct supervision lacked sufficient objective criteria to meet agency's burden); <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120100344 (2011) (vague explanation of selection process did not explain reasons for selecting successful candidates and not selecting complainant).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency contends that it chose the candidate with the best <span id="Page_715"></span>experience, it must enter evidence of the respective qualifications of the successful candidates and the complainant into the record in order to meet its burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Obas v. Attorney General</span>, 0120083050 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">For instance, in <span class="Italic">Bart M. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120141479 (2016), the agency was able to avoid liability by providing evidence that the selectees all had more "recent and relevant" subject matter knowledge than the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Minh G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161339 (2016), the agency presented a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the complainant's nonselection where it provided evidence that the complainant's application was disorganized and did not present his experience well.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agency officials may also point to interview notes to establish that the selectee was the best candidate. In <span class="Italic">Ingeborg B. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120141324 (2016), the complainant alleged her nonselection for two positions was discriminatory. Relying primarily on the selecting official's recollection of the interviews, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Ingeborg B</span>., disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the Agency articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not selecting Complainant for the positions at issue. Specifically, as to claim (1), SO-1 affirmed Selectee l's application package and her interview demonstrated that she was the highest-rated candidate. SO-1 explained that Selectee 1 provided complete answers while Complainant was unable to answer all of the interview questions; Selectee 1 was better prepared for the interview; Selectee 1 was able to articulate her relative experience to the position better than Complainant; and Selectee 1 chose a variety of examples to illustrate her experience while Complainant relied on the same examples for each question. Other panel members agreed that Complainant was not as prepared for the interview as Selectee 1 and failed to fully answer the interview questions. As a result, Complainant was ranked third of the three candidates and was not selected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to claim (2), SO-2 asserted that Complainant was not the best qualified candidate for the position because other applicants demonstrated more knowledge and experience with medical coding, the VERA program, and data analytics than Complainant. SO-2 noted that Complainant failed to fully answer questions during his interview. By contrast, selection panelists confirmed that Selectee 2 answered the interview questions accurately, showed that she had a deep insight into the qualifications of the position, and demonstrated that she had extensive experience with coding and auditing of medical coding. As a result, Complainant was ranked seventh of the eight candidates and was not selected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that Complainant failed to show that his qualifications for the position were plainly superior to those of the selectees. In this case, the selectees had attributes that justified their selection, and the selection officials involved all affirmed that they believed that the selectees were better equipped to meet the Agency's needs. In the absence of evidence of unlawful discrimination, the Commission will not second guess the Agency's assessment of the candidates' qualifications. <span class="Italic">Tx. Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 259.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the selected employee fails to meet the minimum qualifications for the position, the agency's proffered reason for promoting the employee is "inherently not credible." <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Attorney General</span>, 01970068 (1999).</p>
