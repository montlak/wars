<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-64"><span class="space">1.</span> Failure to Timely Complete Investigation/Issue Final Agency Decision</h4>
<p class="noindent">For the most part, sanctions for failure to timely complete an investigation are imposed by an administrative judge and the Commission reviews those determinations on appeal. However, the Commission does have the authority to impose sanctions even if none were imposed by the judge and in cases involving a final agency decision. As a result, most cases involving the failure to timely complete an investigation are imposed by judges and reviewed on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining the appropriateness of a sanction where the agency fails to timely complete its investigation or issue a final agency decision, the Commission will consider, among other things, the length of the delay, whether the complainant was prejudiced by the delay, and whether there were any orders in place with which the agency failed to comply. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dudley H. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120171015 (2019) (declining to impose default judgment where the agency timely investigated the complaint, the complainant could show no prejudice, and there were no orders in place, but the agency issued its final decision three months late).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Federal Sector Program monitors federal agencies' EEO programs, and the Commission may also, in its discretion, notify the FSP of an agency's failure to comply with regulations related to timely agency action. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cassy W. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019001419 (2020), for example, declined to sanction the agency for issuing its FAD more than 170 days late, but it did refer the agency's failure to the FSP. Presumably, if the same agency is referred to the FSP with any sort of regularity, that agency will recommend training or issue guidance related to the agency's deficiencies.</p>
<p class="noindent"> It is the totality of the circumstances that will dictate whether sanctions are appropriate. For instance, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Leila G. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120171621 (2020), refused to impose sanctions against the agency where it issued its final action 535 days late, but all other related investigations were completely timely and the complainant was not prejudiced:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there were no delays in the start of investigations, and they were timely completed. Complainant also argues that there is no requirement showing that she was "substantially prejudiced." However, we find that Complainant has not shown that she was prejudiced in any way, nor shown any consequences, caused by the delay.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here, the final decision was not issued in a timely manner. However, the Agency explained that it was due to their erroneous understanding that the complaint was pending a hearing, and we find that the Agency did not act in a manner to warrant sanctions. <span class="Italic">See e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Josefina L. v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120142023 (July 19, 2016), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den'd</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520170108 (Feb. 9, 2017) (finding that the Agency's 571-day delay in issuing a final decision did not warrant sanctions, as complainant did not show she was prejudiced by the delay). <span class="Italic">Jocelyn R. v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120152852 (Mar. 11, 2016) (citing <span class="Italic">Vunder v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A55147 (May 12, 2006) (declining to sanction an agency that issued a final decision after approximately 371 days)). Accordingly, under the specific circumstances of this case, we decline to issue sanctions against the Agency for the delay in issuing the final agency decision. We take this opportunity, however, to remind the Agency of its obligation to comply with Commission regulations in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Arnaldo C. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120121034 (2015), the Commission declined to impose a sanction on the agency for exceeding the time limit for four months and, in doing so, contrasted that case with several others where it upheld sanctions for failure to timely complete an investigation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the investigation, the record reveals that Complainant filed his complaint on February 11, 2008. Complainant agreed to extend the investigation to November 7, 2008, but the investigation was not completed until March 11, 2009. Upon review, we note that the Commission has exercised its inherent authority to enforce its Part 1614 regulations by ordering sanctions in response to various violations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Talahongva-Adams v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081694 (May 28, 2010) (AJ's sanctions affirmed where no investigation began within the 180-day period following the filing of Complainant's formal complaint); <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052 (Sept. 25, 2009) (AJ's sanctions affirmed where Agency did not assign investigator to case until 192 days after Complainant filed complaint, forwarded an incomplete investigative file to the AJ, and did not complete the investigation under 241 days after the complaint was filed); <span class="Italic">Matheny v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30373 (Apr. 21, 2005) (AJ's sanctions affirmed when Agency had not completed investigation over a year after the 180-day deadline and failed to comply with AJ's order to submit the investigative files); <span class="Italic">DaCosta v. Dep't of Education</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (Feb. 25, 2000) (sanctions affirmed where Agency delayed investigating a complaint for over five years despite an AJ's explicit remand for investigation and Complainant's continuous attempts to obtain her investigation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency timely began its investigation, procured Complainant's consent to extend the 180-day deadline an additional 90 days, but did not complete the investigation until approximately four months after the new deadline. However, unlike many recent cases in which we have imposed sanctions for untimely investigations, the Agency in this case promptly began its investigation. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Agency's delay in this case is attributable to contumacious conduct or bad faith. As such, we do not find that the four-month delay in completing the investigation warrants sanctions under these circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Truman B. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120140418 (2017), found that the agency repeatedly failed to follow Commission regulations regarding the timeframes for investigating a complaint and issued a final agency decision 110 days later than required by the administrative judge's order. The Commission ordered the following as sanctions in <span class="Italic">Truman B.</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, we find that the Agency has repeatedly failed to comply with EEOC's regulations in this case, and had not shown good cause for its actions, when it did not complete Complainant's investigation within 180 days, and when it issued the untimely FAD. We also note that, regarding the fourth factor, the effect on the integrity of the EEO process should not be underestimated when tailoring a sanction. <span class="Italic">Cox v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720050055 (Dec. 24, 2009). "Protecting the integrity of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process is central to the Commission's ability to carry out its charge of eradicating discrimination in the federal sector." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission must ensure that all parties abide by its regulations and orders. Based on the specific facts of this case, we find that the most appropriate sanction to address the Agency's conduct is to order the Agency to: (1) post a notice at its Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance and Complaints Review office, located in Fort Belvoir, Virginia regarding its failure to comply with our regulatory timeframes and the AJ's Order; (2) provide training to its EEO personnel who failed to comply with our regulatory timeframes and the AJ's Order; (3) consider taking disciplinary action against these EEO personnel; and (4) pay Complainant's attorney's fees for filing the appeal in this case. Our decision to sanction the Agency in this matter will effectively emphasize to the Agency the need to comply with Commission orders in a timely manner, as well as ensure that future Agency investigations are adequately developed for adjudication in accordance with regulatory timeframes.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Alexis D. v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 0120162663 (2018), however, the Commission declined to impose default judgment against the agency for issuing a final decision more than 200 days after the deadline even though the agency had been sanctioned in the past for violating Commission regulations. In so doing, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Alexis D.</span> relied principally on the fact that the complainant had suffered no prejudice by the delay, but also credited the agency's excuses that it had had significant employee turnover in the EEO office, a large caseload, and office relocation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Calvin D. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120171662 (2018), issued its final decision 465 days late. The Commission went easy on the agency in <span class="Italic">Calvin D</span>. ordering only that the agency post a notice at its EEO Compliance and Complaints Review office and provide training to its EEO personnel who failed to comply with the regulatory timeframes. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kayce L. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2019002439 (2022) (declining to impose default judgment against an agency issued its final decision 1,312 days after the complainant's request for a final decision; choosing, instead, to "notify Federal Sector Programs (FSP) which monitors the federal agencies' EEO programs of the Agency's failure to comply with the regulations regarding the timely issuance of final agency decisions"); <span class="Italic">Alda F. v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0120171676 (2018) (where the agency issued its final decision more than two years late and provided no explanation for the delay, but the complainant failed to show that she was prejudiced by the delay, the Commission ordered the agency to post a notice regarding its failure and to provide training to EEO personnel who were responsible for the failure); <span class="Italic">Crysta T. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120171275 (2018) (where the final agency decision was issued more than a year late, but the complainant failed to show prejudice, the Commission ordered the agency to post a notice regarding its failure and to provide training to EEO personnel who were responsible for the failure).</p>
<p class="noindent">Though the complainant did not win her case on the merits, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Emelda F. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720170024 (2017), did uphold an administrative judge's grant of attorney fees as a sanction against the agency for its failure to process the complaint in a timely manner. In that case, <span id="Page_590"></span>the complainant's attorney became involved at the counseling phase of the complaint. Despite the attorney having made timely counselor contact and filing a timely formal complaint, the agency delayed processing by five months. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Emelda F</span>. found that the agency's failure to comply with regulations and act according to its obligations caused the complainant to incur attorney fees that would not have otherwise been charged and awarded reimbursement of those fees associated with the agency's failures.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Natalie S. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120180466 (2020), the Commission upheld an administrative judge's order limiting the agency's defense to the contents of the report of investigation as a sanction for issuing a corrected ROI while the case was outside of the agency's jurisdiction and for providing inadequate discovery responses. A second administrative judge, who was later appointed to the case, modified that order by allowing two rebuttal witnesses to testify. The complainant alleged abuse of discretion. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Natalie S</span>. disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJs have full responsibility for the adjudication of the complaint, including overseeing the development of the record, and have broad discretion in the conduct of hearings. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(a) and (e). This responsibility gives the AJ wide latitude in directing the terms, conduct, or course of EEOC administrative hearings including discovery, and the determination of whether to admit evidence, or permit or compel the testimony of witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109; EEO MD-110, Chap. 7, &#x00A7; III.D; <span class="Italic">Douglas F. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120122183 (Dec. 4, 2015); <span class="Italic">Andy B. v. Dep't of Veterans Aff</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120131912 (Oct. 28, 2015); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120122616 (Jun. 23, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJs did not abuse their discretion during the hearing process. We note that the Agency has not challenged the sanctions issued against it, so we do not address if those sanctions were appropriate. We only consider whether additional sanctions were warranted. Many of the arguments raised on appeal were raised by Complainant during the pendency of the hearing request and were addressed in the AJs' orders, including denials of Complainant's motions for entry of a default judgment and imposing sanctions against the Agency. Although Complainant may disagree with the rulings, the record does not lead us to conclude that the AJs abused their discretion or committed legal error in the issuance of their orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that during the hearing, Complainant only objected to the allowance of the testimony of two rebuttal witnesses called by the Agency and its use of exhibits during the hearing that had not been previously introduced. Complainant also addressed the objection in her written closing statement and in her appeal brief. The basis for Complainant's objection was the sanctions order issued by AJ-1. In the order, AJ-1 sanctioned the Agency as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"> As appropriate sanction for the Agency issuing a corrected [report of investigation] while the case was outside its jurisdiction, failure to participate in the discovery process (by abiding its own agreement to make certain individuals available for depositions), the Agency will be limited to the content of the ROIF. The Agency will not be permitted to call witnesses or submit additional exhibits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that by allowing the testimony of two witnesses, AJ-2 acted within her discretion. Consistent with AJ-1's sanctions, the Agency was not allowed to present its case in chief. The two witnesses called were called by the Agency as rebuttal witnesses. Further, AJ-2 could modify a prior order based on the development of the record before her. Her modification is not a violation of the sanctions order, as Complainant argues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note in this regard that AJ-2 stated during the hearing that in her pre-hearing memorandum, she advised the parties that if rebuttal testimony were necessary, she would provide the Agency an opportunity to specifically identify the necessity for rebuttal testimony. AJ-2 also stated that Complainant would be given the opportunity to object. The AJ did both at the hearing. We note also that Rebuttal Witness-1 was mentioned throughout the investigative report and her rebuttal was limited by AJ-2 to a January 24, 2017 meeting. She was asked only two questions each by Agency counsel and Complainant's counsel. Even if the testimony were not allowed, the substantial evidence of the record supports the ultimate conclusion that the Agency did not discriminate against Complainant. Regarding Rebuttal Witness-2, who was allowed to testify, she was deposed by Complainant. The use of the veteran's preference (claim 6) was not clear to AJ-2 and, thus, AJ-2 determined that Rebuttal Witness-2 would provide that clarification to her. The Commission also notes that AJ-2 did not allow the Agency to submit additional exhibits, which was consistent with AJ-1's sanctions' order, and Complainant has acknowledged that no exhibits were admitted.</p>
