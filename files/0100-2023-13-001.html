</header>
<p class="noindent">After acknowledgment and acceptance of a complaint, and definition of the claims, the case proceeds to the investigative stage. Agencies may conduct their own investigations, arrange for another agency to conduct investigations, or contract with an outside entity to conduct investigations. Even when the investigation is done by another agency or an independent contractor, the agency remains responsible for the content and timeliness of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has given agencies wide latitude in the manner in which they conduct investigations. Both agencies and individual investigators have their own peculiarities and idiosyncrasies in investigative techniques. Any technique that develops the record in a manner sufficient to reach a conclusion on the underlying allegation of discrimination is acceptable.</p>
<p class="noindent">For years, agencies have complained about the expenditure of resources on "frivolous" complaints. One of the main expenditure of resources has been on the investigation of those complaints, particularly because there is no evidentiary threshold for investigation. As discussed in <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec3-1">Chapter 3</a>, a complainant need only allege that a personnel action has been taken, or that a term, condition or privilege of employment was affected because of a protected basis, in order to state a claim and trigger the investigation stage of the complaint process. Because of this low threshold, the EEO complaint process is often used by employees to air minor grievances, real and imagined, that have little if anything to do with discrimination. The problem is that raising the threshold for stating a claim would eliminate many legitimate discrimination complaints simply because at the outset of the complaint the employee was unable to marshal sufficient evidence to survive dismissal. The Commission's solution to this dilemma has been to change the standard under which agencies conduct investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although agencies have long complained of the need to investigate what they view as frivolous complaints, they have been slow to grasp significant changes in the Commission's position on investigations over the past several years. Historically, agencies were required to conduct a "thorough" investigation of the complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.216(a) (1986). The regulation went on to specify a number of required items for inclusion in the investigative report. In 1992, with the abolition of Part 1613 and the adoption of Part 1614, the Commission gave agencies wider latitude in the investigative techniques that could be employed, but still required the agency to develop a "complete and impartial factual record." 29 CFR 1614.108(b) (1992). Between 1992 and 1999, not much changed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 1999 amendments to the Commission's regulations at 29 CFR Part 1614 brought about significant changes to the standards for investigation. Under the revised regulations, at 29 CFR 1614.108(b), the agency must develop "an impartial and appropriate factual record" of the claims raised in the complaint. There is no longer any mention of a "thorough" or "complete" record. The change took place because of the Commission's concern that investigators were misinterpreting the completeness requirement as a mandate that all investigations be the same. By using the term "appropriate" in its current regulations, the Commission's intent is to emphasize that all investigations are different and what is appropriate for one case may not be for another. As the Commission explained at 64 Fed. Reg. 37,655 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The current regulation requires a full and fair investigation of every complaint that is not dismissed. Some have interpreted it to require the same amount of investigative effort in each case. That interpretation is not reasonable or desirable and is inconsistent with EEOC's private sector charge prioritization procedures. The Commission believes that the proper scope of an investigation should be dictated by the facts at issue and that a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach wastes resources and needlessly delays resolution of that complaint and all other complaints. The investigation and the amount of effort expended should be appropriate to determine the issues raised by the complaint. To remedy the misconception that more is required, we have revised sections 1614.106(e)(2) and 1614.108(b) to remove the word "complete" and replace with "appropriate." An appropriate investigation is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> MD-110 at 6-4 to 6-5. In other words, in the standard circumstantial evidence case where the complainant can point to little or no evidence of pretext, not much investigation is required to meet the new standard. The new standard, to develop an "appropriate" record, is elaborated upon in MD-110, as discussed in the section on the "<a href="0100-2023-13-005.html#sec4-6">Role of the Investigator</a>," below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In accepting the complaint, the agency must define the claims involved in order to determine the nature and scope of the investigation. Because complainants are not required to file detailed complaints, there is often a need to further refine the claims as stated in the complaint. The EEOC offered the following guidance in its former Complaint Processing Manual, Chapter 6. MD-107 (September 1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even though the allegations contained in a complaint meet the regulatory requirements...agency officials should not accept for investigation any allegations which are so vague or general that no specific issues can be defined for investigation. If such vague or general allegations cannot be made more specific by reference to the EEO Counselor's report, the official should give the Complainant an opportunity to furnish more specific information on such allegations in an attempt to define the issue or issues which the employee or applicant is raising. If the Complainant is unable or refuses to furnish such information within a reasonable period of time specified by the agency, the official should <span class="Italic">cancel</span> the complaint for failure of the Complainant to prosecute them and advise the Complainant, in writing, of his/her rights of appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Part 1614, at 29 CFR 1614.102(b)(6), provides that each agency is required to</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[e]nsure that full cooperation is provided by all agency employees to EEO Counselors and agency EEO personnel in the processing and resolution of pre-complaint matters and complaints within an agency and that full cooperation is provided to the Commission in the course of appeals, including granting the Commission routine access to personnel records of the agency when required in connection with an investigation....</p>
<p class="noindent">The investigation process requires a certain amount of cooperation between the complainants and agency EEO offices. MD-110 at 6-3 to 6-4 explains the responsibilities of those involved in the process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Director of Equal Employment Opportunity</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Director of Equal Employment Opportunity shall ensure that 1) all new investigators receive at least thirty-two (32) hours of introductory investigator training before conducting investigations and that all investigators receive at least eight hours of continuing investigator training every year, 2) the claim(s) in a complaint are thoroughly investigated, 3) all employees of the agency cooperate in the investigation, and 4) witness testimony is given under oath or affirmation and without a promise that the agency will keep the testimony or information provided confidential.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Director will also ensure that individual complaints are properly and thoroughly investigated and that final actions and final decisions are issued in a timely manner in accordance with 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.110.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Director also must ensure that there is no conflict or appearance of conflict of interest in the investigation of complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Investigator</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Equal Employment Opportunity Investigator is a person officially designated and authorized to conduct inquiries into claims raised in EEO complaints. The authorization includes the authority to administer oaths and to require employees to furnish testimony under oath or affirmation without a promise of confidentiality. The investigator does not make or recommend a finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A new investigator must have received, at a minimum, thirty-two (32) hours of investigator training before s/he conducts an investigation; experienced investigators must receive eight hours of training every year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Complainant</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant must cooperate in the investigation and keep the agency informed of his/her current address. If an agency is unable to locate the complainant, the agency may dismiss the complaint, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to locate the complainant and the complainant has not responded within fifteen (15) days of the notice of proposed dismissal. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the agency has provided the complainant with a written request to provide relevant information or otherwise proceed with the complaint, coupled with a 15<span class="Italic">-</span>day notice of proposed dismissal, a failure to respond could result in dismissal of the complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(7); Chapter 5, Section IV.B.1 of this Management Directive.</p>
<p class="noindent">The training requirement for investigators was first implemented in the November 1999 revisions to MD-110, and is discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted, the failure of the complainant to cooperate in the investigation can lead to dismissal of the complaint. Such dismissals are addressed in depth in Chapter 3 in the sections on "<a href="0100-2023-12-232.html#sec3-218">Abuse of Process</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-12-223.html#sec3-209">Failure to Prosecute or Cooperate</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The culmination of the investigative stage of the complaint process is the report of investigation. The requirements of the report of investigation are covered in detail later in this section.</p>
<p class="noindent">In theory, agencies have 180 days from the receipt of the complaint to complete an investigation. 29 CFR 1614.108(f). In practice, a large number of investigations are not completed within the 180-day time frame. There are several reasons why the 180-day period is exceeded, including the number <span id="Page_300"></span>of investigations an agency must conduct, the amount of resources allocated to the agency EEO office, the availability of witnesses, the scope of the investigation, and the diligence of the investigator as well as the complainant. If the regulatory period passes without the complainant receiving notice that the investigation is completed, he or she may request a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge at any time after 180 days. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the alternative, the complainant may continue to await completion of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In response to criticism that agencies have failed with impunity to meet the 180-day regulatory requirement for completing investigations, the Commission has issued several default judgments, as well as other sanctions, against agencies for failing to timely investigate complaints that are discussed in <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec8-1">Chapter 8</a>. In addition, effective September 24, 2012, the EEOC amended its regulations at 29 CFR 1614.108(g) as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the agency does not send the notice required in paragraph (f) of this section within the applicable time limits, it shall, within those same time limits, issue a written notice to the complainant informing the complainant that it has been unable to complete its investigation within the time limits required by &#x00A7; 1614.108(f) and estimating a date by which the investigation will be completed. Further, the notice must explain that if the complainant does not want to wait until the agency completes the investigation, he or she may request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, or file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court in accordance with &#x00A7; 1614.407(b). Such notice shall contain information about the hearing procedures.</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec4-2"><span class="space">I.</span> TRAINING FOR INVESTIGATORS</h2>
<p class="noindent">As part of its effort to improve agency investigations of complaints, the Commission is encouraging efforts to develop a more professional attitude among investigators. The 1999 version of MD-110 required that all new EEO investigators must receive an initial training session, and all EEO investigators must receive training annually. MD-110 at 6-1 to 6-3 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All new EEO investigators, including contract and collateral duty investigators, must have completed at least thirty-two (32) hours of investigator training <span class="Italic">before</span> conducting investigations. Individuals serving as EEO investigators as of the date of this publication may also benefit from such training. Agencies have, however, the discretion to decide whether to make this training available to current investigatory staff. In addition to the training requirement for new investigators, all investigators are required to receive at least eight hours of continuing investigator training every year. The Commission has developed training courses to satisfy this requirement and offers them to agencies through its Revolving Fund Program on a fee-for-service basis. Agencies may also develop their own courses to satisfy this requirement or contract with others to provide training, as long as the training meets the standards provided below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standards for New Investigator Training Requirement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency should provide training on the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;An overview of the entire EEO process pursuant to 29 CFR Part 1614. This segment must emphasize important time frames in the EEO process, including relevant time frames for investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The role and responsibility of an EEO Investigator, as described in this Management Directive.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;A thorough presentation of the relevant statutes including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, and the Equal Pay Act of 1963, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>. This module must explain the theories of discrimination relevant to these statutes, including disparate treatment, adverse impact, and reasonable accommodation theories. This module must provide detailed instruction concerning issues attendant to fragmentation. <span class="Italic">See</span> Chapter 5, Section III, of this Management Directive.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Case management issues, including information on practical techniques concerning the timely investigation of complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Remedies, including compensatory damages, attorney's fees, and costs. This module must provide investigators with practical information on how to gather relevant information in cases where remedies, attorney's fees, and costs are at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;Investigative techniques, such as the gathering and analysis of evidence. Participants should be provided with an opportunity to get practical, hands-on experience during this module on topics such as interviewing witnesses, making credibility determinations, and the gathering and reviewing of documentary evidence. Participants should be provided with case studies to work with so that investigative skills can be effectively developed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standards for Continuing Investigator Training</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The continuing eight hours of investigator training every year is intended to keep EEO investigators informed of developments in EEO practice, law, and guidance, as well as to enhance and develop investigatory skills. Agencies are encouraged to conduct a needs assessment to determine specific investigative staff training needs. The Commission anticipates that this eight hours of continuing investigator training will include segments on legal and policy updates, regulatory and statutory changes, and investigative skills development.</p>
<p class="noindent">Investigators previously had no formal training requirements. This resulted in a wide discrepancy in the knowledge and competence of investigators. Although eight hours of training a year for existing investigators is not a great deal, it is certainly an improvement over no training requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted in MD-110, the Commission provides some training courses, both for new investigators and existing investigators. Agencies may also provide their own training or contract out with other training entities, as long as the training meets the Commission's requirements.</p>
