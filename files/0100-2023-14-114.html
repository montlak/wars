<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-114"><span class="space">1.</span> Broad Application and Scope of the OWBPA</h4>
<p class="noindent">For years, the Commission had held that if the complainant did not allege age discrimination in his complaint, the agreement was not required to meet the requirements of the OWBPA, meaning that the protections of the OWBPA were only triggered when an employee raised an age discrimination claim before entering into a settlement agreement containing a waiver provision. For example, in <span class="Italic">Remedios v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A12336 (2002), the Commission found the complainant did not have the right to have his complaint reinstated because the agreement did not meet the minimum requirements of the OWBPA. The complaint only involved allegations of race and sex discrimination even though the agency included a provision to the effect that the agency admitted no liability under Title VII, the ADEA and the EPA. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Sheehy v. National Security Agency</span>, 0120072655 (2008) (Commission refused to void agreement where complaint and amended complaint did not specifically allege age discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, however, did an about-face on its position in <span class="Italic">Hester S. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 0120121983 (2016), holding that OWBPA applies to waivers of ADEA rights or claims regardless of whether those rights or claims were raised before the execution of the waiver agreement. The decision is significant enough to reproduce it in relevant part here:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of events giving rise to this complaint, Complainant worked as a Program Operations Analyst, GS-12, at the Agency's Dallas, Texas District Office. Beginning in February 2010, Complainant requested several reasonable accommodations for her disabilities, which she maintains had not been granted by 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a meeting with management on April 19, 2011, the Agency's District Director offered Complainant the following three options: 1) placement on a performance improvement plan (PIP); 2) reassignment to an Investigator position; or 3) her agreement to retire effective June 3, 2012. After the meeting, Complainant contacted the union local president and union steward. On April 21, 2411, the District Director sent Complainant an email that contained a proposed agreement and resignation letter for her to consider. On April 25, 2011, Complainant initiated contact with an EEO Counselor. At that time, Complainant alleged that she had been discriminated against on the basis of disability and in reprisal for protected EEO activity when she was issued a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) and denied a reasonable accommodation. On May 19, 2011, Complainant agreed to extend counseling to pursue Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) within the EEO process. On June 10, 2011, during a follow up interview with an EEO Counselor, Complainant expanded her bases to include race (Caucasian), national origin (Hispanic American of Mexican origin), sex (female), and age (54 years old).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 10, 2011, Complainant's attorney notified the District Director of her representation of Complainant. Also, on May 10, 2011, Complainant and her attorney met with union officials. During the meeting, Complainant and her attorney presented a counterproposal to the Agency's draft settlement agreement. After the meeting, Complainant's attorney informed the Agency that its proposed agreement was unacceptable and would be rejected unless certain "deal breaker" language was removed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Settlement Agreement</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 11, 2011, the union president presented Complainant with a settlement agreement, which Complainant signed. The settlement agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;In exchange for not placing the Employee on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), the Agency will do the following:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Formal EEO Complaint</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 10, 2011, following an unsuccessful attempt at ADR, Complainant filed an EEO complaint in which she alleged that the Agency harassed and discriminated against her on the bases of race (Caucasian), sex (female), national origin (Hispanic), disability, age (54 years old), and in reprisal for prior protected EEO activity arising under the Rehabilitation Act when the Agency failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Final Agency Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a final decision dated February 2, 2012, the Agency dismissed Complainant's complaint on the basis that it was moot or, alternatively, failed to state a claim because it was resolved by a settlement agreement. Specifically, the Agency found that Complainant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the settlement agreement with the Agency, although she did not have a final consultation with her attorney. The Agency noted that Complainant could have opted not to sign the agreement and to move forward with her EEO complaint, but she did not do so. The Agency further noted that Complainant submitted her letter of resignation the day before she signed the agreement, although she had counsel at that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Validity of Waiver of Age Claims Under the OWBPA</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency generally maintains that it properly dismissed Complainant's age claim because she agreed to waive her right to file the claims raised in her complaint. The Agency notes that Complainant affirmed within the release agreement that she entered into it voluntarily and knowingly. Upon review of this matter, we note that this is insufficient to waive age claims. In so finding, we note that the Age Discrimination in Employment <span id="Page_426"></span>Act (ADEA) prohibits employers from discriminating against individuals age 40 and older because of age. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a). In 1990, Congress amended the statute by passing the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA). OWBPA &#x00A7; 201, 104 Stat. 983. As the Supreme Court has pointed out, the purpose of the statute is "clear from its title." <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Ops</span>., 522 U.S. 422, 427 (1998). It was "designed to protect the rights and benefits of older workers...via a strict, unqualified statutory stricture on waivers." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 263, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1990) (Senate Report) (stating that "the Committee intends that the requirements of [the statute] be strictly interpreted to protect those individuals covered by the Act"), reprinted at 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1509, 1537. In essence, "[t]he OWPBA governs the effect under federal law of waivers or releases on ADEA claims and incorporates no exceptions or qualifications." <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, at 427.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In keeping with this purpose, the OWBPA provides that an individual "may not waive" an ADEA claim "unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)1). However, unlike non-age claim waivers, the OWBPA explicitly defines "knowing and voluntary" through a list of required actions that must be undertaken before waiving age claims. Thus, the OWBPA "sets up its own regime for assessing the effect of ADEA waivers, separate and apart from contract law's generalized requirements." <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, 522 U.S. at 427. Specifically, the statute explains that waivers "may not be considered knowing and voluntary" unless, "at a minimum," they satisfy enumerated requirements found at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)1)(A)-(G). The requirements for waiver/release of ADEA claims are:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A)&#x2003;the waiver is part of an agreement between the individual and the employer that is written in a manner calculated to be understood by such individual, or by the average individual eligible to participate;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B)&#x2003;the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims arising under this Act;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">C)&#x2003;the individual does not waive rights or claims after the date the waiver is executed;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">D)&#x2003;the individual waives rights or claims only in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individual is already entitled;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">E)&#x2003;the individual is advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">F)&#x2003;(i) the individual was given a period of at least 21 days within which to consider the agreement; or (ii) if a waiver is requested in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program offered to a group or class of employees, the individual is given a period of at least 45 days within which to consider the agreement; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">G)&#x2003;the agreement provides that for a period of at least 7 days following the execution of such agreement, the individual may revoke the agreement, and the agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until the revocation period has expired.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(A)-(G).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant had not yet filed an age claim at the time she entered into the settlement agreement that purported to waive her claims against the Agency. We note that we previously have held that the protections of the OWBPA are only triggered when an employee raises an age discrimination claim before entering into a waiver/release agreement. For example, in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Department of the Treasury</span>, the Commission held that "Complainant did not raise age discrimination in the underlying complaint; therefore, the Agency's failure to comply with the OWBPA is irrelevant." <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30633 (May 2, 2003). Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Sheehy v. National Security Agency</span>, the Commission found that Complainant should have been given OWBPA protections specifically because she raised age as a basis for her complaint before entering into a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Sheehy</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520100403 (Feb. 27, 2012). Further, we have held that when an underlying complaint does not raise any allegations of age discrimination, OWBPA protections are not necessary when such a complaint is settled. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120140708 (Mar. 11, 2014); <span class="Italic">see also Lewis v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120071468 (Aug. 8, 2008) (settlement agreement does not violate the OWBPA because there is no evidence that Complainant made claims of age discrimination before entering into settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, upon further review of this issue, we conclude that our previous cases interpreted the OWBPA too narrowly. We now hold that the OWBPA applies to waivers of ADEA rights or claims regardless of whether the rights or claims were raised before the execution of the waiver agreement. This is consistent with the stated intention of Congress to vigorously protect the rights and benefits of older workers through the OWBPA by imposing a "strict, unqualified statutory stricture on waivers" of age claims. <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, 522 U.S. at 427.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly, the Supreme Court has recognized the applicability of OWBPA waiver requirements to age claims that had not yet been filed at the time a waiver/release was executed. For example, in <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, an employee/plaintiff signed a release of all claims against her employer as part of a termination agreement. <span class="Italic">Oubre</span>, 522 U.S. at 424. The release at issue did not comply with the requirements of the OWBPA. The employee/plaintiff did not file an ADEA claim against the employer until after the execution of the release that purported to waive her ADEA claims. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Oubre</span> applied OWBPA waiver requirements and found that the release could not waive plaintiff's ADEA claim because it did not comply with those requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As such, the Court made it clear that age claims cannot be validly waived unless the requirements of the OWBPA have been met, even if the age claim purportedly waived by a release was not filed until after the execution of the waiver. Likewise, federal circuit courts have applied OWBPA requirements to waivers that predated the filing of corresponding age claims. <span class="Italic">See Ruehl v. Viacom</span>, 500 F.3d 375 (3d Cir. 2007) (waiver did not comply with OWPBA where age claim filed after plaintiff signed release); <span class="Italic">Thomforde v. Int'l Business Machines Corp</span>., 406 F.3d 500 (8th Cir. 2005) (waiver did not comply with OWBPA where plaintiff signed release upon termination months before filing age claim); <span class="Italic">Tung v. Texaco, Inc</span>.,150 F.3d 206 (2d Cir. 1998) (release did not comply with OWBPA where plaintiff filed age claim after signing release). To the extent that the Commission has held differently in the past, we no longer are following that precedent. Thus, we find that the release at issue here must comply with the requirements of the OWBPA to validly waive Complainant's age claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying OWBPA's requirements to this waiver, we find that the waiver fails to meet the requirement of specifically referring to rights or claims arising under the ADEA. Further, the waiver does not state that Complainant was advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement. Additionally, contrary to OWBPA requirements, Complainant was not given a period of at least 21 days within which to consider the agreement. Further, the waiver did not give Complainant a seven-day period in which she could revoke the agreement after its execution. As such, we find that the waiver does not constitute a valid waiver of Complainant's age discrimination claims; therefore, Complainant's age claims must be reinstated by the Agency. <span class="Italic">See Daniels v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120103252 (May 31, 2012) (agreement purporting settlement of age claim void where it did not mention Complainant's rights or claims under the ADEA, there was no indication that he was advised in writing to consult with an attorney, there was no indication that he was given a reasonable period of time in which to consider the agreement, and it did not state that complainant had seven days to revoke the agreement after he signed the agreement); <span class="Italic">see also Oubre</span>, 522 U.S. at 428 (failure to comply with the OWBPA's stringent waiver safeguards will void the settlement agreement only with regard to the ADEA claims); <span class="Italic">Sheehy</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520100403.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's <span class="Italic">Hester S</span>. holding effectively requires that any settlement agreement entered into with a complainant 40 years of age or older, who could invoke the protections of the ADEA, include an OWBPA provision.</p>
<p class="noindent">Notably, including a provision with OWBPA requirements in settlement of a complaint that does not allege age discrimination does not invalidate the agreement. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120141436 (2014). In <span class="Italic">Canada v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A12056 (2002), the Commission held that it was error for the agency to reinstate a complaint on the basis that the settlement agreement did not comply with the OWBPA where the complainant requested specific enforcement of the agreement. In so holding, the Commission noted, "The OWBPA is for the benefit and protection of the complainant, not the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Etamadi v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A23218 (2002), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the settlement agreement was void <span class="Italic">ab initio</span> because it did not comply with the OWBPA where the complainant had no desire to invoke the protections of the OWBPA to void the settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission has held, without any significant discussion, that the OWBPA applies to federal employees, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Healey v. Postmaster General,</span> 01966598 (1997), it is at least arguable that the Act does not apply to federal sector ADEA claims. The ban against age discrimination in federal employment is contained at 29 USC 633a. Subsection (f) of that provision specifically provides that no "personnel action of any department, agency, or other entity referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this Act, other than the provisions of section 12(b)...." Section 12(b) is codified at 29 USC 631(b). It is at least arguable that 29 USC 626(f)--the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act--does not apply to federal employees. Such an argument would be bolstered by the fact that Congress is presumed to have knowledge of the laws it passes and, because the exclusion from other statutory provisions existed at the time Congress passed the OWBPA, it must have intended that the Act not apply to federal employees. The Commission has not directly addressed this argument. Certainly, the safe course is to include the requirements of the OWBPA in any settlement agreement affecting a complainant's ADEA rights.</p>
