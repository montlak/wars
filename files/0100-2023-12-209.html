<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-195"><span class="space">I.</span> IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Under 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(1), an agency is required to dismiss complaints that are identical to complaints pending before the agency or the EEOC, or that have already been decided by the agency or the Commission. A similar prohibition against identical complaints was set forth at 29 CFR 1613.215. There is also a requirement for agencies to dismiss complaints that are or were the subject of pending civil actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(3). In order to be dismissed under 107(a), there must have been a previous complaint. Initiation of counseling does not constitute a complaint for purposes of 107(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Berkebile v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01A31271_r.txt">01A31271</a> (2004); <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01996393 (2001). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Sarmiento v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00867 (2001) (holding that a second complaint is properly dismissed where the complainant previously initiated counseling over the same matter and withdrew from counseling).</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110, at 5-23, states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint states the same claim that is pending before or had been decided by the agency or Commission except in those cases where a class action complaint is pending. The Commission has interpreted this regulation to require that the complaint must set forth the "identical matters" raised in a previous complaint filed by the same complainant, in order for the subsequent complaint to be rejected. <span class="Italic">Terhune v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950907 (July 18, 1997); <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dep't. of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910613 (Aug. 1, 1991) (interpreting 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1613.215(a)(1), the predecessor of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission interpreted the previous regulation as applying only to those complaints where the date of the most recent incident, the prohibited bases alleged, and the facts resulting in the alleged discrimination were identical. <span class="Italic">See Van Horn v. USPS</span>, 01830347 (1983). The current regulation has been similarly applied. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 01961940 (1997) (agency erred in dismissing claims involving denial of official time, since claims were for different days than those previously accepted for investigation).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the failure to allege all possible bases of discrimination does not permit a complainant to resubmit the complaint by alleging the additional bases of discrimination. A complaint which recites the same facts as a previous complaint, but alleges discrimination on the basis of race, sex and national origin, as opposed to only national origin, will be dismissed as identical to the earlier complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robbins v. USPS</span>, 01830664 (1983). Similarly, a complaint alleging the same set of facts, but implicating different responsible management officials, will also be dismissed as identical to the previous complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Madelaine G. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120160836 (2016) ("the prior and instant complaint both concern the same time, place, incident, and parties."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Kennith M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120162447 (2016) ("the discovery of new comparators does not give rise to a new complaint"). The dismissal of a complaint on the basis that it states matters identical to a previous complaint is an adoption of the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">See Rivera v. USPS</span>, 01821838 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden is on the agency to establish that the complaints are identical. <span class="Italic">See Barker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01990099 (2001); <span class="Italic">Kerrigan v. USPS</span>, 01830355 (1983). The Commission conducts an independent review of the respective complaints to determine if they are identical, and the agency must provide a copy of the complaints for the purposes of review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dreher v. USPS</span>, 01821746 (1983). The agency must submit specific evidence regarding the former complaint, such as a counselor's report or copy of the formal complaint, to establish that it is identical to the instant complaint. <span class="Italic">See Barker, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complaints are not identical simply because they are related. The issues raised in the complaints must be identical before the agency can dismiss the latter complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Tuckwell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01923099 (1992), the Commission differentiated a complaint that a coworker was creating a hostile working environment from a complaint that the agency failed to provide relief from the harassment when the situation was brought to its attention:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.215(a)(1) provides, in pertinent part, that an agency shall reject a complaint of discrimination which "states the same claim that is pending before or has been decided previously by the agency." The Commission has held "that a complaint must set forth the identical matters as contained in a previous complaint filed by the same complainant, in order for the subsequent complaint to be rejected." <span class="Italic">Russel v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910613 (August 1, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the appellant alleges "that the agency failed to provide immediate and effective relief from sexual harassment." The agency rejected this allegation because the "crux" of the allegation was accepted for investigation in complaint DON-91-00228-014. In complaint DON-91-00228-014, the agency accepted appellant's allegation that "she was being subjected to a hostile work environment generated by management's resentment of her EEO activity, evidenced by the creation of an offensive work atmosphere in which it is commonly believed that women must encourage sexual advances to receive favorable treatment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a thorough review of the record, the Commission finds that the allegations raised by appellant in Complaint DON-91-00228-014 are not identical to the issues raised by appellant in her present complaint. In Complaint DON-91-00228-014, filed on April 29, 1991, appellant alleged that she was subject to discrimination by the "creation by (male supervisor) of offensive work environment in which it is commonly believed that women must encourage sexual advances to receive favorable treatment." The EEO Counselor's Report in the present complaint reveals that appellant alleged, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the Personnel Director "failed to provide immediate and effective relief from sexual harassment and protection from reprisal for complaining about it from June 1991 (approximately June 4, 1991) until March 2, 1992." The EEO Counselor's Report summarizes appellant's allegations that the Personnel Director "did nothing" when appellant told her about threats of a defamation suit against her (complainant) and when appellant requested a reassignment. Because the allegations on this issue in the present case concern the activities of the Personnel Director after June 1991, the Commission finds that the complaint does not involve the same claim in DON-91-00228-014, which concerns the alleged offensive work environment created by the male supervisor. Consequently, the agency's decision on this issue is vacated and the complaint is remanded to the agency for additional processing.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Roebuck v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01953475 (1996) (holding that the agency erred in dismissing such a complaint as identical). However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Roebuck</span> also found the complaint about lack of response was not properly the subject of a second complaint. Because the agency is required to demonstrate, in order to avoid liability, that it took prompt and effective remedial action, the second complaint is subsumed in the first complaint. <span class="Italic">Roebuck</span> clearly represents the better view since prompt and effective action is an element of a sexual harassment claim. See <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a>, below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Keval v. Department of Labor</span>, 01830836 (1983), the appellant was not placed on the highly qualified list for a promotion after he failed to submit his latest performance appraisal and an updated resume. The agency dismissed the complaint as identical to a previous complaint where the appellant had failed to make the best qualified list due to the same failures. The EEOC found that 29 CFR 1613.231(b) prohibited the filing of a complaint where the claim of discrimination giving rise to the complaint was already considered by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complaint which alleges that the agency has failed to comply with its own order resolving a previous EEO complaint is not identical to the initial underlying complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hurley v. Department of Army</span>, 01830502 (1983). A complaint alleging discrimination on the basis of a notice of proposed removal and a complaint alleging discrimination in the actual removal were not considered to be identical. <span class="Italic">See Clements v. USPS</span>, 01841018 (1985). The proper course of action was to consolidate the two complaints. Under the current regulations, a complaint may not be filed over a proposed personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant cannot avoid having a complaint dismissed as identical to a previous complaint merely by naming a different ADO when the same underlying personnel action is at issue. <span class="Italic">Tijerina v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01924623 (1993). In that case, a complaint that the employee's second-line supervisor denied him a promotion was dismissed as identical to an earlier complaint alleging complainant's first-line supervisor failed to promote him.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complaint alleging that the agency failed to upgrade an employee's position and a later complaint alleging that she is being paid less for doing the same work as others are identical complaints. In alleging that she was being paid less for substantially the same work, the complainant essentially was alleging that her job was improperly classified. <span class="Italic">Albrecht v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01934832 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a complaint involves the same kind of personnel action does not mean that it is identical to a previous complaint where an intervening event changes the surrounding circumstances. An employee who files a grievance over a denial of a career ladder promotion alleging discrimination is not barred from filing an EEO complaint four months later over denial of the same promotion when, in the interim, the complainant received a new performance appraisal and subsequently requested the promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Daniels v. EEOC</span>, 05890605 (1989). The performance appraisal, along with the passage of a reasonable amount of time, sufficiently distinguishes the actions so that they are not identical. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Mislan v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01981857 (1999), the Commission held that a complaint that the employee was discriminatorily denied a transfer as a resolution to her complaint was not the same as the original complaint involving denial of a transfer. By contrast, a complaint which alleges discrimination in a temporary promotion is identical to a complaint that alleges discrimination when the position is converted to a permanent position where the original selectee still holds the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Somers v. Secretary of the Navy</span>, 01913175 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">Time is an element the complaints must share in common to be considered identical. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vissing v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, 05890584 (1989). A complaint that the agency engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against older employees in selection for higher-level positions prior to a date <span id="Page_257"></span>certainly is not identical to a complaint alleging the agency continued to engage in the same practices after that date. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971836 (1997) (two complaints over denial of transfer to same position are not identical where each complaint relates to a different period of time).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a complaint that an agency has failed to issue a timely decision on a matter is identical to the underlying complaint on that matter. In <span class="Italic">Ricci v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01996487 (2000), the Commission found an allegation that the agency had failed to issue a timely decision on reclassification appeals was identical to a complaint that the positions were not properly classified. On the other hand, a complaint over the agency's subsequent decision to disband the section where the classification appeals were pending was not identical to a complaint that the positions were improperly classified. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Ricci</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Examiners argue that the agency's failure to make a timely decision constitutes a separate claim. The Commission addressed a similar matter in <span class="Italic">Merz v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00317 (March 7, 2000). In <span class="Italic">Merz</span>, the complainant alleged that "management deliberately delayed and constructively prevented a review of their...[RNDE and RR] job classifications by making negligible changes in the position description so that a completely new classification appeal would have to be initiated." <span class="Italic">Merz v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00317 (March 7, 2000). The Commission found that this matter stated the same claim as her prior complaint--alleging discrimination from the agency's failure to upgrade the RNDE position from a GS-11 to a GS-12<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> The Commission reasoned that both claims "ultimately concern...her position not being upgraded."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present complaint, as in <span class="Italic">Merz, supra</span>, the RNDE's raised only one claim. The agency's failure to make a timely classification decision involves the same matter as the dismissed claim--the agency's failure to upgrade the position. Complainants' dissatisfaction with the position description also concerns the same matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The claims concerning the agency's decision to disband the Reconsideration Review section, and claims (a)-(d) above, are not the same matter raised by the upgrade claim. The agency's failure to address these claims, despite consolidating them with the upgrade claim, is tantamount to dismissal of the claims. The record reveals that the agency was aware of these matters, and accepted the claims for investigation. We find no grounds for dismissal of these claims. Therefore, the agency's dismissal of claims (a)-(d), and the claim concerning the agency's decision to disband the Reconsideration Debt and Disability Branch in New York is reversed....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regardless of whether OPM's decision should have restricted the agency to its classification decision, it is clear that the agency has changed supposedly binding classification decisions. In <span class="Italic">Carton v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05990214, the Commission did not consider whether the agency overturned OPM's classification decisions despite its lack of apparent authority to do so. In light of this evidence, the Commission finds that the individual complaints are not moot--they survive dismissal because the agency overturned OPM's classification decisions in other circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">That the employee has requested identical relief in two complaints does not mean the claims raised by the two complaints are identical. <span class="Italic">In re Treff</span>, 05860397 (1987). The underlying claims of the complaints must be analyzed to determine if they are identical.</p>
<p class="noindent">The previous complaint, even if identical in claims to a subsequent complaint, must be either "pending or adjudicated" to be dismissed as raising the same claims. <span class="Italic">Franklin-Mason v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01892914 (1989). When the previous complaint is withdrawn at the appellant's request prior to completion of the investigation, it is no longer pending before the agency nor has it been adjudicated.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an agency is required to dismiss any complaint that raises the same claims as a complaint currently pending before it, this does not mean that the agency must dismiss the later filed complaint in every instance. In some instances, it may be appropriate to dismiss the initial complaint. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Healy v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940548 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The allegation that the agency neglected the EEO process by failing to conduct a three-way conversation with appellant's attorney was alleged in both the instant complaint and in a later-filed complaint, 1-H-1187-93. The Commission has decided to reconsider the question of whether the agency dismissed the allegation from the appropriate complaint. Under the circumstances presented in this case, the Commission is persuaded that the agency's choice was correct. Both of the complaints containing the allegation were pending at the time of the agency's FAD. Thus, the agency's dismissal did not technically violate 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a), which requires dismissal of a complaint or a part of a complaint that "is pending." While normally it would be logical and orderly to dismiss a later-filed allegation, it was not so here. The record shows that the allegation was first raised in the context of the later-filed complaint. Appellant initiated counseling on the later complaint on October 6, 1992, and did not raise the allegation in the context of the instant complaint until filing the formal complaint on November 18, 1992. In addition, the allegation is better processed as part of the later-filed complaint because it is like and related to the other allegations in that complaint. All of that complaint's several allegations relate to alleged improper processing of agency complaint no. 3-S-1464-92.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the agency did not explain the basis for its choice at the appeal stage, or report that the later-filed complaint was well along in processing. Had it done so, the previous decision could have been more inclined to consider the factors above and to affirm the agency's decision. Nevertheless, the above factors were apparent from the facts available at the appeal stage, and we find that it was error not to consider them. Moreover, we note that the later-filed complaint has been investigated and is at the hearing stage. Permitting the later-filed complaint to proceed will further administrative efficiency and economy. Therefore, the Commission reverses the portion of the previous decision which vacated and remanded the allegation to the agency. We affirm the agency's dismissal of the allegation from the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complaint that raises the same claim as a previous complaint is not identical unless the complainant is the same as the one who previously filed the complaint. In <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01904019 (1990), both the complainant and his representative filed separate complaints alleging that the agency had not given the representative a reasonable amount of time to prepare the formal complaint. The Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the employee's complaint on the basis that it was identical to the representative's complaint. "The Commission...determines that the language of 29 CFR 1613.215(a)(1), which states, in pertinent part, that the agency shall reject a complaint 'that states that the same claim is pending before...the agency' applies only to complaints previously filed by the complainant himself and not to those filed by a third party, such as appellant's representative." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that in order to dismiss a complaint as identical to a complaint decided by or pending before the agency, the previous complaint must have been in the EEO realm. In <span class="Italic">Higginbotham v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01961739 (1996), the Commission held that dismissal under 1614.107(a) was improper where the complainant had previously attempted to have her grade changed through an audit by a position classifier.</p>
