<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-17"><span class="space">1.</span> Awareness Personnel Action Is Final</h4>
<p class="noindent">Usually, under the "reasonable suspicion" standard the question is whether the employee should have been aware that the action may have been discriminatory at the time it was taken. On rare occasions, although the complainant may suspect that a personnel action is discriminatory, the complainant may not be on adequate notice that the personnel action is final. Since a complaint would be premature until the action occurs, the uncertain status of the action means that the time frame for initiating counseling does not begin to run. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Onderko v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01951328 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1614.105(a)(2) provides that "the agency or the Commission shall extend the 45-day limit...when the individual shows...that he or she did not know and reasonably should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred..." Although appellant was aware that he had not been granted an award in November 18, 1993, and that two other younger employees had in fact received awards, the record does not show that appellant was officially denied such an award. The Commission agrees with appellant that until June 3, 1994, his local director was still trying to get approval for the award. We find that the 45 day limit started running on June 3, 1994, when appellant retired and had not received the award for which his local director had been trying to get approval since May 1993. Based on our review of the record, we find that appellant contacted an EEO counselor within the prescribed time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gillespie v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01972334 (1998), found that the complainant made timely contact with a counselor even though she did not respond to gossip about her nonselection. The Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Gillespie</span>, however, that under some circumstances, the time limits may begin to run before an employee receives official notification of a personnel action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, while the triggering date for the 45 day time limit for contacting an EEO Counselor commences with the time when an individual should have a reasonable suspicion of discrimination, individuals are not required to act immediately on every item of gossip or speculation. In the instant matter, we find that even if appellant was aware on October 18, 1994 that some persons were saying that appellant had not been selected, it was not unreasonable to wait two more weeks until she received official notice of her nonselection. Thus, it was reasonable for appellant to conclude that she had 45 days from her actual, written, official notice of nonselection to contact an EEO Counselor. The Commission does not hold in the instant case that aggrieved individuals may always wait to form a reasonable suspicion of discrimination until receipt of the "official," notice of nonselection. In the instant matter, however, the agency has not provided enough evidence to show that appellant was informed of the nonselection more than 45 days before she contacted an EEO Counselor. Therefore, we find that the agency improperly dismissed the complaint for untimely EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Chon v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01991912 (2002), the Commission found that the time period for initiating counseling did not begin to run on the date the complainant oriGINAlly received her annual performance rating. In that case, the performance rating was not accompanied by documents referenced in the comments that were supposed to be attached. The complainant contacted the director of human resources and requested an extension of the time period for requesting reconsideration of the appraisal until she received the documents. The extension was granted and the Commission held that the time period for initiating counseling did not begin to run until the date the complainant received the documents.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee must be reasonably diligent in attempting to ascertain conditions affecting her status with the agency. <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 01830157 (1983). The fact that an employee did not discover a mistake in recording her seniority date until eight years after it was made would not toll the statute of limitations. The EEOC did not doubt that factually the error was not discovered until alleged, but noted that the employee had it within her control to discover the error in a timely fashion. However, the mere fact that an employee was briefly at work during a several month period when he was otherwise on leave was insufficient to establish that the complainant had actually seen an email advising him of his nonselection. In <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120120599 (2012), the complainant was in the office for only one hour from May 23 through August 1. The fact that the complainant could have read an email advising him of his nonselection during that hour was insufficient to establish he did read the email.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the employee must be reasonably diligent in ascertaining conditions that affect employment status, the agency must also be responsive to attempts to acquire information. In <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01975375 (1998), the Commission found that the agency's pattern of delay in responding to the complainant's requests lent credence to the complainant's assertion that he did not immediately suspect discrimination. The Commission noted that the agency was slow to provide him with the information he requested regarding a work analysis. The complainant provided ample evidence of his attempts and as a result was not deemed "negligent" in trying to ascertain his status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">It is possible that an employee may not suspect an earlier personnel action was discriminatory until a subsequent action is taken. For example, the receipt of a performance evaluation was the event that triggered a reasonable suspicion that the denial of an earlier advanced sick leave request was discriminatory. <span class="Italic">Foster v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05930882 (1994). Even though the complainant was required to schedule sick leave in advance for maternity purposes while male coworkers were not required to schedule sick leave in advance, she was justified in initiating an EEO complaint several months after the incidents where she did not realize, until receiving her performance evaluation, that her use of leave negatively affected the evaluation. The complaint was timely because it was not until the supervisor indicated that the leave had negatively impacted on her appraisal that she became aware of the disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Peets v. Postmaster General</span>, 05950725 (1996), the Commission tolled the time limit for contacting a counselor where the complainant did not contact a counselor within 45 days of denial of a transfer. The agency cited appellant's attendance and safety record as a reason for the denial. The Commission found it was not until the complainant subsequently received a performance evaluation that mentioned his depression that the complainant had a reasonable suspicion of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant is not aware that a personnel action has taken place due to her absence from the agency, the time to contact an EEO counselor may be tolled. In <span class="Italic">Washington v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10097 (2001), the Commission found that confusion surrounding the actual date of the complainant's removal, coupled with a leave period under the Family Medical Leave Act, rendered the complainant's EEO contact timely:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_45"></span>In her complaint, complainant alleged that the notice of removal issued on January 12, 2000, was not issued by her immediate supervisor; and on April 6, 2000, she was informed by her supervisor that she was not to report for work on April 10, 2000, because she had been removed from the agency back on January 12, 2000. In its decision, the agency stated that the alleged discriminatory action took place on January 12, 2000, but complainant did not contact an EEO Counselor until April 10, 2000, which was beyond the 45-day time limit set by the regulations. On appeal, complainant contends that she worked at the agency until February 23, 2000, when she took leave under the Family Medical Leave Act in order to have surgery, and it was not until April 6, 2000, that her supervisor told her that she had been removed. Since the agency proffers no evidence to dispute complainant's contentions on appeal, the Commission finds that her EEO Counselor contact was timely after her actual removal of April 6, 2000.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a 1992 Postal Service "restructuring" that was not conducted pursuant to RIF regulations, the Postal Service first gave employees traditional retained-pay, retained-grade status--i.e., those employees who were downgraded during the "restructuring" were given the same benefits as those downgraded during a RIF. Many of the affected employees, who were preference-eligible veterans, filed appeals with the MSPB alleging that the restructuring was really a RIF and they had been deprived of the procedural protections of a RIF. In an effort to block Board jurisdiction over the cases, the Postal Service gave its employees indefinite retained-pay, retained-grade status. Under this indefinite status, employees were essentially promised they would retain their current level of pay and, at least on paper, their current grade level until further notice. The Postal Service then argued that the indefinite status deprived the Board of jurisdiction over the appeals because the employees had suffered no injury. In addition to the fact that the argument did not prevail before the Board, the change to indefinite status also permitted some employees, who had previously retired, to file timely complaints of discrimination. Those employees alleged they had been misled into choosing retirement based on their belief that the retained-pay, retained-grade status would last only two years. In <span class="Italic">Purson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952494 (1996), the Commission held that such a complaint, filed after the complainant became aware of the indefinite status, was timely and stated a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that appellant retired effective on November 20, 1992. Appellant contends (and the agency does not contradict) that when her position was abolished she sought information from the agency concerning her possibilities. Appellant further contends that she was specifically informed by the agency that her only options were assignment to a lower level position or termination, and that if she received a lower level assignment, she would only receive saved salary for a period of two years and after that time, she would be paid at the level of the new position. The Commission notes that the record shows that the agency does not deny nor contradict appellant's assertions regarding the information provided to her which resulted in her early retirement. Appellant alleges that faced with the alternatives presented by the agency, she chose the early retirement option provided by the agency. Eight (8) months later appellant alleges that she became aware, by reading an agency magazine, that the agency had extended saved grade and rate to all the agency employees who remained in their positions: an option not provided to her at the time of her retirement and, as the record shows, an option that was never presented to appellant. On the date appellant read the magazine article, July 16, 1993, and after confirming with the agency that this was indeed the agency policy, appellant alleges that she felt discriminated against because the agency misinformed her concerning her options.</p>
<p class="noindent">Analyzing the <span class="Italic">Purson</span> case under the reasonable suspicion standard, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency claims that appellant should have filed an EEO complaint when she became aware that other younger males were offered PCES positions while she was not. The Commission notes that appellant's complaint does not merely allege that she was discriminated against because she was not offered a PCES position. Rather, her complaint alleges that the agency misinformed her regarding the policies it would adopt regarding employees affected by its reorganization. After allegedly informing appellant that her only options were assignment to a lower level position or termination, and that if she received a lower level assignment, she would only receive saved salary for a period of two years and after that time, she would be paid at the level of the new position, on July 16, 1993, the agency announced that it had extended saved grade and rate to all the agency employees who remained in their positions. Appellant alleges that the agency forced her into involuntary retirement because if the agency had provided her this information she would not have retired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, after becoming aware about the agency's policy on July 16, 1993, appellant suspected discrimination and initiated EEO contact 33 days later. Therefore, appellant has provided persuasive evidence showing that on November 20, 1992, she did not know that she had been discriminated against and that she only developed a reasonable suspicion of discrimination when she was notified regarding the agency's policy regarding saved pay and saved grade/benefits; that is, during the 45-day period preceding her EEO Counselor contact.</p>
