<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-142"><span id="Page_960"></span><span class="space">H.</span> REPRISAL-BASED HARASSMENT</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also has applied the analysis adopted in sexual harassment cases to an allegation of harassment based on reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Postmaster General</span>, 01940362 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has recognized a claim of retaliatory harassment. Essentially, the complainant alleges that the agency created a hostile environment because of his or her EEO activity. In recognizing such a claim in <span class="Italic">Antol v. Secretary of Defense, DLA,</span> 01952879 (1996), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has consistently held that Title VII affords all employees the right to work in an environment free from retaliatory intimidation. <span class="Italic">See Charbonneau v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930504 (August 5, 1993). The Commission has found that retaliatory harassment intended to deter an employee from filing or pursuing EEO complaints constitutes such a threat to the EEO process that, even when the complainant is a former employee, "such allegations state a claim within the Commission's regulations because of the potential that retaliatory harassment may constrain other employees who desire to pursue EEO remedies." <span class="Italic">See id.; Quinones v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920869 (May 14, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's complaint alleges that his Commander intimidated him in an effort to deter him from using the EEO process by discussing his EEO complaints when appellant's attorney was not present and by making clear that appellant should not file any more EEO complaints. Appellant further alleges that this was done because of appellant's sex and disability and in reprisal for appellant's prior EEO complaints. We find that this allegation is sufficient to state a claim for retaliatory harassment intended to deter appellant from using the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Charbonneau, supra; Quinones, supra.</span> Therefore, the agency improperly dismissed appellant's complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did not describe the precise parameters of such a claim. Presumably, it would follow the same basic guidelines as sexual harassment hostile environment; that is, the complainant must show that, because of his participation in the EEO process or opposition to discriminatory practices, he was subjected to a hostile, offensive, or abusive environment. What is not clear is whether the Commission would apply the same severe or pervasive requirement to retaliatory harassment claims, or whether even one such incident could sustain a claim. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cannon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954440 (1996) (holding allegation of hostile environment based on reprisal states a claim for relief).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 05940797 (1996), the Commission attempted to elaborate on the claim of a hostile environment based on reprisal. However, the Commission instead hopelessly confused the analysis in <span class="Italic">Jackson,</span> meandering back and forth between an analysis based on disparate treatment and one based on hostile environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, appellant claimed that beginning in 1990, the harassment was no longer of a sexual content. At the close of the hearing, appellant added a claim of retaliation to her complaint. In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal appellant must show that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the agency was aware of her protected activity; (3) she was subsequently subjected to adverse action by the agency; and (4) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Inc.</span>, 425 F. Supp. 318 (D. Mass.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976). The previous decision found that although appellant set forth a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation, the agency articulated a legitimate reason for its action. The Commission notes, however, that the previous decision appears to focus only on one incident of retaliation alleged by appellant, the April 1991 breaking into her desk drawer. It is clear from the record, however, that appellant has alleged a pattern of harassment. Nonetheless, there is no mention made of the other incidents of retaliation such as failing to transmit phone messages, refusing to order supplies, lowering appellant' s performance appraisal, removing her and then rescinding the removal, abusive counseling, etc.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency attempts to explain the incidents attributed to the alleged harasser by simply denying that they occurred. Specifically, the alleged harasser testified that he never ordered that a telephone be removed from appellant's cubicle, he never counseled her in an abusive manner in front of others, he did not refuse to order supplies for her, nor did he erase messages for her. The preponderance of the evidence, as shown by the testimony of numerous witnesses, establishes that the alleged harasser did treat appellant differently from the other employees. Specifically, the Building Equipment supervisor testified that the alleged harasser ordered him to remove the telephone from appellant's cubicle. Moreover, other witnesses testified that the alleged harasser failed to give appellant supplies, told her to remove her head phones when others were not similarly reprimanded, and ordered that a new typewriter and adding machine be given to the other clerk. The Commission finds that the uncorroborated testimony of the alleged harasser is not worthy of belief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also finds that the agency's reasons for lowering appellant's performance appraisal, removing her, and subsequently reassigning her to a different craft are also unworthy of belief. S1 claimed that he lowered appellant's performance appraisal after he receive complaints from other coworkers about her work. The Commission finds, however, that once again there is no documentation in the record to support this assertion. Given the time period that this occurred, it is more likely that retaliation motivated the agency's action. In addition, although S1 claimed that appellant was initially removed because she used her computer for personal business, he later admitted that others charged with the same offense were not similarly removed. Similarly, although S1 testified that he reduced appellant in grade and reassigned her to another craft for this reason, these actions were later found to be in violation of the agency's collective bargaining agreement. The Commission also finds it noteworthy that after appellant was restored to her position through the grievance process, she was returned under the supervision of the alleged harasser, who she claims forced her to use sick leave unless she accepted a custodial position, stared at her, and generally continued to harass her until the end of 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The harassment of an employee that would not occur but for the employee's race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability or religion is unlawful, if it is sufficiently patterned or pervasive. <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138-39 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The Commission finds that the agency's actions in this case are sufficiently patterned and the preponderance of the evidence establishes that they occurred because appellant complained of sexual harassment. In order to remedy the discrimination, the agency is instructed to provide the corrective action as outlined in the order below....</p>
<p class="noindent">As with any case of retaliation, the complainant must show that the harassment is causally connected to the protected activity. Although the timing of events can certainly be evidence of that causal connection, the Commission has found harassment based on retaliation despite the passage of three years between the complainant's prior EEO activity and the harassing conduct. <span class="Italic">Leatherman v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01983615 (2000). The complainant alleged that her second-line supervisor directed her first-line supervisors to "lean on her" in an effort to retaliate against her for her previous protected activities. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Leatherman</span> found sufficient evidence of causal connection, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that because complainant's protected activity took place in 1991 and the LOR [letter of reprimand] was issued in 1994, an inference of reprisal cannot be drawn. While the period of time between the protected activity and the alleged retaliation can be telling, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case can be established by other evidence tending to establish retaliatory motivation<span class="Italic">. See Hochstadt; see also Wibstad v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972699 (August 14, 1998). We find that complainant provided sufficient evidence on which to base an inference of retaliatory motivation. Specifically, complainant alleged that a hearing on the sexual harassment case involving S2, for which she previously gave a deposition, was scheduled for 1995 and that she was retaliated against not only due to her 1991 deposition, but to discredit her testimony at the 1995 hearing. The agency failed to respond to this claim. Moreover, co-workers indicated that management promoted an atmosphere of intimidation and made trouble for employees who did not fall into line, such as complainant. One co-worker (CW6) testified that when she began working for the agency in November 1991, S2 told her not to associate with complainant. Another coworker (CW5) testified that S1, at the direction of S2, forced her to write a memo saying complainant "put work off on her." Based on this evidence, we find that complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation in regard to the issuance of the LOR.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, we find that the harassment faced by complainant was motivated by her EEO activity. First, we have already determined that the LOR was motivated by retaliatory animus. Second, as noted above, the agency's attempt to legitimately explain the harassment is unworthy of belief. Moreover, co-workers indicated that management promoted an atmosphere of intimidation and made trouble for employees who did not fall into line, such as complainant. The agency argued that the lapse of time between complainant's original 1991 EEO activity, and the conduct in question was too long to support a finding of retaliatory motivation. In so arguing, however, the agency offered no rebuttal to complainant's claim that the hearing on the 1991 sexual harassment case was upcoming in 1995 and that the agency desired to discredit her before this hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the Commission in <span class="Italic">Leatherman</span> also found that evidence of a general atmosphere of intimidation of employees who did not "fall into line" was relevant to the complainant's harassment claim. Also significant to the Commission's determination of harassment in <span class="Italic">Leatherman</span> was the fact that the hearing for which the complainant provided testimony some three years earlier was impending. This provided a reason for the delay in the onset of the harassing behavior at issue, and allowed the complainant to establish the requisite causal connection.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05642 (2000), a case involving <span id="Page_961"></span>retaliatory harassment, the Commission found that conduct occurring on one day, when considered in light of the overall environment, was sufficiently severe to constitute a hostile environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this instant case, we find that Manager's conduct on March 21, 2000, sufficiently severe as to rise to the level of an actionable claim of retaliatory harassment.... First, complainant has provided several witness statements attesting that the Manager's voice during the incident was hostile, threatening, and excessively loud. Secondly, we find that the Manager's inquiry about where to obtain a handgun was done in the presence of complainant with the purpose of threatening him with serious bodily violence. Moreover, complainant contends that the Manager frequently treats him in a hostile, demeaning, threatening manner, as evidenced by the "I got your number Buddy" statement, and the fact that the Manager was identified as a danger in a safety talk. Thus, complainant contends that the March 21, 2000, although particularly severe, is not an isolated incident, but part of on-going harassment due to a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A04103 (2000), the Commission found harassment based on retaliation where the complainant's supervisor failed to address the spread of rumors after the complainant reported them as sexual harassment, proposed to discipline the complainant for taking direct measures to stop the rumors, and required the complainant to "sign a statement agreeing to refrain from contacting the subordinate for one year...." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> found that this conduct by the supervisor was based on a retaliatory motive and was "reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in a protected activity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Small v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100031 (2012), the Commission found a hostile environment based on retaliation where all of the actions were motivated by desire to retaliate against the complainant for requesting reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's finding of reprisal. Complainant filed prior complaints against S1, S1 was aware Complainant had prior EEO activity as evidenced by the fact that she signed the June 2003 settlement agreement with Complainant, S1 agreed not to provide negative information if Complainant sought transfer to another facility and then followed Complainant to the new facility within a month of his transfer. Then, S1 failed to satisfy the Agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation. We agree with the AJ that S1's contentions for failing to provide accommodation are "unworthy of credence for a seasoned supervisor." We conclude that the timeline here, the history between Complainant and S1, and the adverse actions S1 took against Complainant support such a finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that, over several years since 2004, S1 publicly referred to him as an overweight television character, tried to isolate him from his coworkers, subjected Complainant to greater scrutiny than other workers, sought a fraud investigation against Complainant regarding his workers' compensation absences, talked about Complainant and his EEO matters to others, made an unwanted visit to him while he recuperated at a hospital, rode by Complainant's house and had her husband do the same, controverted his workers' compensation claim with derogatory statements about his health and personal activities, and contacted Complainant's neighbor inquiring about his whereabouts. We find that hearing testimony, most notably testimony from S1 and other Agency officials, as well as documentary evidence support Complainant's contentions. Further, the record shows that S1 sought to remove Complainant from the carrier craft and Agency rolls. Consistent with the AJ, we consider these harassing incidents as background evidence for S1's retaliatory motive and agree that such motive was the basis of her denial of reasonable accommodation. In sum, we find that substantial evidence of record supports a finding of hostile work environment harassment based on reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's failure to take prompt and effective corrective action will lead to a finding of liability just as it does in sexual harassment cases. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120084008 (2014), the Commission found that the complainant, an EEO official at the facility, was subject to a hostile environment based on sex and reprisal and that the agency failed to take prompt and effective corrective action. That case involved a campaign of harassment by an employee who was antagonist to the EEO office as well as EEO in general. Among other things, the employee posted a page on the agency's intranet making parody of the Trail of Tears entitled "Trail of Beers." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has established that she is a member of two protected classes, by virtue of her sex and having engaged in prior protected EEO activity, and that she was subjected to conduct based en her membership in these two classes. Complainant not only engaged in protected EEO activity on her own behalf, but she was the Agency's first full-time EEO Specialist at MSIC. She raised issues with management regarding GW's "Trail of Beers" and the Christmas Social. By doing so, she drew the ire of GW and many employees at MSIC who believed they could no longer wish each other "Merry Christmas," even though this is not what she had advocated. She was labeled the "EEO Gestapo," and GW's "Lord of the Laser" cartoon depicted her as "Ms. E.E.O'Doofus." Complainant testified that the Director told her that that GW "resents the EEO system." GW's cartoon used sexual imagery and language in reference to Complainant, which many co-workers recognized as such, and recognized that Complainant was the individual it was intended to depict. Complainant also argued that GW had published a "parable" which insinuated that her husband was lucky to be losing his vision as he would no longer have to look at her. Additionally, a box of fliers was delivered to her office with the word "Dufus" written in black marker on the box.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no question that Complainant found this conduct to be unwelcome. She stated in her Brief that, since her return to the Agency in May 2003, she avoids EEO activities at MSIC, tends to stay in her office, avoids the cafeteria where she would be likely to encounter GW and friends of GW, and she tries to avoid any contact with GW. Although the Agency did not accept the issue for investigation, Complainant also argued in her brief that employees in the workplace are openly hostile to her, which has had the effect of denying her a rotational assignment to another office because the employees in that office did not wish to work with her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the harassment had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with Complainant's work performance and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. The Agency maintains that the re-publication of the "Lord of the Laser" cartoon on GW's public Internet website removes it from a connection to the workplace, and that it therefore cannot have interfered with Complainant's ability to function at work. The Agency also argues that Complainant had voluntarily gone to GW's website and opened the link to the cartoon, thereby exposing herself to the content. However, we find that the hostile environment consisted of more than just Complainant's exposure to the content of GW's website. GW announced his website at an EEO training class in September 2005, thereby reintroducing it into the workplace, after which many employees apparently went back to their desks and pulled up the site to view its content. Many then discussed it in the workplace. There is testimony in the record from CO-2 that, after GW announced his website, he "heard about it up and down the hall." (OCI transcript, pp. 201-202). The Agency further maintains that the actions of GW were not reasonably likely to deter a complainant or others from engaging in protected EEO activity, and that there was no evidence to support the proposition that GW published his cartoon to dissuade Complainant from participating in EEO activities. (Agency's Brief, p. 8). However, CO-1 testified that she had told a co-worker that she had decided against consideration in the IG (Inspector General) office: "And I said I wouldn't be an IG, just like [ ], afraid the same thing would happen to me that's happened to [ ], you know, because she's had a tough time since she was the EEO counselor." (OCI transcript, p. 180).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserted that it took the Agency two months to block employees from being able to view GW's website from Agency computers; there is no evidence of record to the contrary. In the absence of any justification for the Agency's delay, we find that taking two months to block GW's website on MSIC computers is not prompt, corrective action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proof of one incident of reprisal does not, however, support a finding of hostile environment harassment where the agency offers legitimate reasons for all the other actions taken. In <span class="Italic">Minardi v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120054829 (2007), the Commission found that a supervisor had engaged in an act of reprisal when, during a performance discussion, he told the complainant that "[y]ou have said negative things about me in your EEO complaint[,] and [y]ou are your own worst enemy and engaging in self-destructive behavior." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Minardi</span>, found that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Commission finds that complainant has not established that she was harassed on the bases of her national origin, sex or in reprisal. We find that record evidence does not indicate that a discriminatory animus based upon her prior EEO activity or on her protected classes was the motivation behind management's actions. Specifically, we find compelling JE's testimony that he had concerns regarding complainant's conduct, performance, and leave issues, and we further find that the record supports his concerns. For example, complainant possessed a substantial negative leave balance; her written work product required revisions; she arrived at erroneous conclusions of law; she did not send her closed cases to the file room to be processed by the Legal Reference Staff; over an 18 month period, she only placed one of her numerous rulings on the pre-LEXIS database; she did not respond to emails or telephone calls in a timely manner, if at all; and she did not comply with the flexiplace requirement that she check in with JE, the Branch Chief, choosing instead to call his secretary. While complainant may disagree with management's assessment of her work, she fails to <span id="Page_962"></span>establish that said assessment is inaccurate, and the record supports many of the agency's concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission finds that complainant and JE appeared to have experienced interpersonal conflict, but with the exception of the May 29, 2002, EPR meeting, nothing in the record indicates that said conflict was due to her prior EEO activity or a discriminatory animus based on her protected classes. We note that, while statements made in May 29, 2002, EPR meeting might have deterred a reasonable person from engaging in EEO activity, the record reveals that, for every action taken by management, be it tangible or part of an alleged pattern of harassment, the agency articulated a legitimate nondiscrimination reason for the action, and the record supports that action. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that complainant has failed to prove that she was subjected to a hostile work environment on the bases of her race, national origin, sex, or in reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05A10338 (2002) (holding that one incident where federal police officers publicly confronted the complainant and questioned him about making threats against a coworker was sufficiently severe or pervasive to state a claim of hostile environment harassment). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Barton-Daugherty v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A12141 (2001) (one incident involving a vulgar remark, a remark about complainant's professional knowledge and abilities, and screaming at complainant and having her escorted off agency premises was sufficient to state a claim of hostile environment where all three incidents were allegedly perpetrated by the same supervisor). The Commission has also held that increased work scrutiny, standing alone, can be sufficient to create a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Caswell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21643 (2002) (sex and reprisal case; holding that allegations that a supervisor constantly questioned complainant about when he would finish his route, followed the complainant, and monitored his work more closely than that of other employees stated a claim of hostile environment harassment). But interactions relating to routine work assignments and the like, generally, do not rise to the level of harassment. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120132733 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, incidents concerning routine work assignments, instructions, and admonishments are neither severe nor pervasive and therefore do not rise to the level of harassment. <span class="Italic">See Bass v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082167 (July 30, 2010). The incidents Complainant cites as evidence of harassment involved training, assignments that related to the operations of the various clinics through which Complainant rotated, attempts by the SMSAs to provide Complainant with on-the-job training as an MSA, and a routine midyear assessment of Complainant's performance during his probationary year. The incident concerning S1's inquiry into whether Complainant had expressed thoughts of suicide is a workplace safety issue. All eight incidents identified by Complainant clearly fall within the category of work-related actions. Complainant has therefore failed to establish the element of hostility and the harassment inquiry ends. We now address his constructive discharge claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">An offending official's physical proximity to the complainant during an incident is not always indicative as to whether the incident is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to rise to the level of harassment. In <span class="Italic">Jess P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120161001 (2016), the Commission held that complainant's claim that his supervisor "got in his face and screamed and threatened him, saying 'Do you think I'm scared of you? I'm not scared of you'" based on his age and in reprisal was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of complainant's work environment. <span class="Italic">Jess P.</span> also addressed the effect of the complainant's emotional harm on this analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following a review of the record we find that Complainant has not shown that the action complained of was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of Complainant's employment. We note in this regard that the incident occurred once and did not include any epithets concerning Complainant's age or prior involvement in protected EEO activity. While Complainant contends that the supervisor's actions have left him feeling, "stressed." We note that the Commission has long held that where an allegation fails to render an individual aggrieved, the complaint is not converted into a cognizable claim merely because complainant alleges physical and/or emotional injury. <span class="Italic">See Larotonda v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933846 (March 11, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Core v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960887 (1998), held that the subjective prong of the harassment test is fulfilled where the comments contribute, in part, to a mental breakdown. Noting that psychological harm is not, under <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, an element of a hostile environment, the Commission stated that "while a showing of psychological injury is not necessary, it may be probative as to whether or not comments were unwelcome and were considered hostile and abusive to appellant."</p>
