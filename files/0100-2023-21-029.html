<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-28"><span class="space">2.</span> Sexual Conduct</h4>
<p class="noindent">As part of a showing of hostile environment sexual harassment, the complainant must show that she was subjected to "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature." 29 CFR 1604.11. There are really two components of this <span id="Page_821"></span>showing: the conduct must be sexual in nature and it must be unwelcome. The criteria for evaluating whether the conduct is unwelcome is addressed below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-21-015.html#sec12-16">Unwelcome Advances</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, there is no requirement that the alleged conduct be overtly sexual in nature. Sexual conduct can take a variety of forms and innuendo can be a strong component of any sexual conduct, regardless of whether it is harassment<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Markham v. White</span>, 172 F.3d 486 (7th Cir. 1999). It is important to bear in mind that sexual harassment is really a subcategory of discrimination based on sex. It is not the sexual nature of the conduct that Title VII directly prohibits; rather, it is conduct based on the target's gender that is prohibited. Conduct that rises to the level of creating a hostile environment is illegal not because of its sexual content, but because it is based on sex. It is quite possible for a complainant to demonstrate a gender-based hostile environment even where no conduct of a sexual nature is involved. See above.</p>
<p class="noindent">In assessing whether words or conduct amount to sexual harassment, the EEOC will look at the circumstances and nuances that surround the incident. <span class="Italic">Bible v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01832791 (1985). In that case the supervisor's admission that he called the employee "kitten" did not prove sexual harassment where he also testified he called another employee "dolly" and there was no other evidence to suggest harassment. The Commission stated that poor judgment does not amount to sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In accord is <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Labor</span>, 01830894 (1983), where the Commission stated that conduct which a complainant alleges constitutes unwelcome advances must be examined in light of the "totality of the circumstances." The Commission did not decide whether looks could amount to unwelcome advances, finding that there was no factual support for complainant's uncorroborated allegation. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">McManus v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880625 (1988) (stating that "[n]on-verbal communication," such as staring, is included in the definition of sexual harassment under the category of "physical conduct").</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to state a claim of hostile environment harassment, it is not necessary that the complainant allege the conduct is overtly sexual in nature. Nor is it necessary that she allege the conduct is specifically directed at her. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Secretary of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 01942324 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has described the behavior of her supervisor which she finds offensive: her supervisor walks past or stops to talk to two women that sit near her and, repeatedly, he places a hand on her coworker's neck. Appellant describes the conduct she sees as physical and verbal contact of a sexual nature. Although appellant has not alleged physical contact with her supervisor, it is inferred that she is uncomfortable with her supervisor's procedures of communicating with his staff, and she alleges that it has resulted in a hostile work environment. The Commission finds that appellant has described what she considers to be an abusive and hostile working environment. At this stage of the EEO process, it is sufficient to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example is provided by <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120093073 (2011), where the Commission noted that while conduct such as placing candy on the victim's desk and calling him "Tom-ass" were "not usually of a sexual nature, they occurred in the context of the [harasser's] overtly sexual conduct, such as romantic propositioning, indecent exposure, and unwanted exposure to sexually-oriented materials in the workplace, and contributed to the overall sexually hostile environment for Complainant."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bosley v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120120510 (2013), the Commission found that the administrative judge erred in concluding that the conduct was not sexual where the perpetrator wore a pair of shorts that accentuated his penis at times making it look like he had an erection. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bosley</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that G wore his shorts in a manner that made his penis prominently outlined, sometimes visible, and sometimes having the appearance of being erect. The AJ specifically credited the testimony of Complainant and other witnesses over G's denial. On appeal, the Agency does not argue that Complainant's testimony lacked credibility. Thus we accept the AJ's finding on this point. However, we find that the AJ erred in concluding that this was not conduct of a sexual nature. While it may be true that G never even spoke to Complainant, he wore his shorts in a manner that enabled his penis to be on display. We find this to be inherently sexual conduct, and Complainant found it unwelcome. We disagree with the AJ's characterization of Complainant's belief that G did this because she was female as too "speculative." Harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex. <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc</span>., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that a reasonable person in Complainant's position would find the conduct to be sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile work environment. There is no suggestion in the record that this occurred on one or two isolated occasions but rather continued over a period of five to six months. As the AJ found, the Agency's response was inadequate. The Agency took over six months to conduct an investigation; did nothing to separate G from Complainant during the investigation; the harassment did not end until after Complainant's work assignment changed and she was moved to another area; and there is no evidence to suggest the Agency took any appropriate steps to ensure that it would not recur. Thus, we conclude that the Agency is liable for the harassment.</p>

<p class="noindent">Ironically, while the EEOC was issuing its holdings in cases like <span class="Italic">Hill</span>, it took the opposite position in a case in the Third Circuit brought by one of its own employees. The Third Circuit rejected the Commission's arguments that the conduct involved in that case was not sexual and held that a claim of hostile environment sexual harassment need not be supported by evidence of blatantly sexual conduct. It is sufficient if the plaintiff demonstrates an intention to discriminate on the basis of gender. <span class="Italic">See Spain v. Gallegos</span>, 26 F.3d 439 (3d Cir. 1994). (Tony Gallegos was Chairman of the EEOC and was named in his official capacity in the suit.) In that case, the plaintiff stated a sexual harassment hostile environment claim by alleging that her supervisor allowed rumors that they were having an affair to continue over her protest. Although no conduct of a sexual nature occurred, the plaintiff maintained that, because of the rumors, she was ostracized by fellow employees, the integrity of her job performance was impaired, and she suffered embarrassment. The plaintiff contended the rumors were generated by numerous private meetings she had with her supervisor as a result of his attempts to illegally pressure her into lending him money. The district court dismissed her claims of sexual harassment after ruling that evidence on what actually occurred at the meetings with her supervisor was inadmissible. In reversing the ruling of the district court, the court of appeals in <span class="Italic">Spain</span> relied heavily on its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Andrews v. Philadelphia</span>, 895 F.2d 1469 (3d Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Of particular significance in <span class="Italic">Spain</span> is the court's notation that certain sexual misconduct carries with it an implicit or inherent intent to discriminate. The plaintiff was not required to adduce specific proof that the conduct was directed at her because of her sex. As the court in <span class="Italic">Spain</span>, 26 F.3d at 448-51, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first element of a hostile work environment claim under <span class="Italic">Andrews</span> is that the employee have suffered intentional discrimination because of her sex. 895 F.2d at 1482. Spain's charge that she suffered such discrimination can withstand a motion for summary judgment as to this element. We have just recounted Spain's contentions and the evidence she offered to prove them concerning the rumors and their multiple effects upon her environment and advancement. We find that the first <span class="Italic">Andrews</span> element is satisfied because the crux of the rumors and their impact upon Spain is that Spain, a female, subordinate employee, had a sexual relationship with her male superior. Unfortunately, traditional negative stereotypes regarding the relationship between the advancement of women in the workplace and their sexual behavior stubbornly persist in our society. Because we are cognizant that these stereotypes may cause superiors and co-workers to treat women in the workplace differently from men, we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that Spain suffered the effects she alleges because she was a woman. Consequently, Spain has made "out a case under Title VII" by showing "that gender [was] a substantial factor in the discrimination, and that if [Spain] had been a man she would not have been treated in the same manner." <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1485 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that there is no suggestion in the record that males who worked with Nelson were harassed similarly. However, the district court erred in requiring Spain to produce evidence that males in a similar position were treated differently. A jury reasonably could conclude that if Spain had been a male, rumors would not have started that she had gained influence with Nelson through physically using her sex, particularly the ability to create problems for a fellow employee who "rubbed her the wrong way." Our discussion above leads us to believe that even if a male had a relationship bringing him into repeated close contact with Nelson, it would have been less likely for co-workers to have believed that the relationship had a sexual basis. Thus, the resulting poor interpersonal relationships, negative evaluations, and denial of advancement might not have occurred for a male as they allegedly did for Spain, inasmuch as the situation which caused them simply would not have been created. Furthermore, while it is true that the rumors also implicated Nelson, the rumors did not suggest that his involvement in the alleged relationship had brought him additional power in the workplace over his fellow employees, and the employees had no reason for resenting him in the way they did Spain. Accordingly, he did not have to endure a hostile working environment brought about due to his sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, Spain's allegations that Nelson's improper conduct first created the conditions under which the rumors developed and then perpetuated them distinguishes Spain's claims from claims in other scenarios which might not support a sexually hostile work environment cause of action. <span class="Italic">See King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572. Thus, this is not a case in which the rumors concerned the behavior of a co-worker outside of the workplace, or in which rumors developed as the result of other employees' misperception of a supervisor's and an employee's frequent but necessary, job-related interaction. Rather, here there are factual <span id="Page_822"></span>questions for trial of whether the rumors developed and persisted as a result of Nelson's improper behavior. As in <span class="Italic">Jew</span>, the situation here was "not merely one of idle gossip about an alleged office romance." 749 F. Supp. at 959. Consequently, Spain properly has alleged, and supported with materials developed in discovery, that the rumors directed at her and her resulting ostracization and adverse evaluation for advancement purposes were both sex-based and intentional.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching our conclusion on this point we have paid particular attention to the distinction we drew in <span class="Italic">Andrews</span> between sexual misconduct in which the intent to discriminate "is implicit, and thus should be recognized as a matter of course" and "actions [which] are not sexual by their very nature." 895 F.2d at 1482 n.3. Thus, an employer by its conduct might create conditions which all its employees, without regard for sex, reasonably consider as harassing and yet the employer would not discriminate on the basis of sex. Accordingly, where an employee claims sex discrimination predicated on sexually neutral conduct it may be necessary for the employee to establish that the employer's motives for its actions were sexual. If the discrimination of which Spain complained was predicated merely on the demands for loans, her case might be of that nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, Spain's allegations are not predicated on sexually neutral conduct. Rather, she alleges that the harassment resulted from the rumors that she was having an affair with Nelson. Thus, the harassment directed against her as a woman had a sexual orientation by its very nature. Overall, we are satisfied that Spain has offered evidence that she suffered intentional discrimination because of sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second requirement for demonstrating a sexually hostile work environment is that the discrimination must have been pervasive and regular. <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1482. In determining that Spain's claim can withstand a motion for summary judgment as to this <span class="Italic">Andrews</span> element, we note that she has alleged that the rumors developed over a period of several years between 1986 and 1990 and manifested themselves through her continuous interaction with her colleagues and supervisors. Moreover, Nelson's loan solicitations and the private meetings allegedly occurred throughout this time, continuing in particular after Spain had asked him to put an end to the rumors. Therefore, there is a fact question for trial as to the pervasiveness and regularity of Nelson's conduct and the impact of the rumors on Spain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the discrimination must have affected Spain detrimentally, the subjective requirement of <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, as later recognized in <span class="Italic">Harris</span>. As we discuss above, Spain has contended that she perceived herself to be subject to an abusive environment as manifested through her co-workers' and supervisors' interaction with her. Thus, determination of the particular effect of the rumors on Spain is another question of fact for the jury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, the fourth requirement to demonstrate a sexually hostile work environment is that the discrimination must be such that it would have detrimentally affected a reasonable person of the same sex in Spain's position. The Supreme Court explained this requirement in <span class="Italic">Harris</span>: "Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive--is beyond Title VII's purview." __ U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 370. In <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, the Court held that under Title VII conduct can be actionable as harassment creating a sexually hostile work environment, even though it does not affect seriously an employee's well-being or lead the employee to suffer injury. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at __, 114 S. Ct. at 370-71. Spain has alleged that she faced an environment in which her co-workers treated her as an outcast and in which her supervisors evaluated her negatively for advancement. Thus, the alleged workplace hostility manifested itself both in the immediate interaction between Spain and her colleagues and in connection with her consideration for a promotion in 1990.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize, of course, that, as the EEOC points out, Title VII does not require fellow workers to socialize with an employee they dislike. Appellee's br. at 11 n.6. However, we must accept Spain's allegations and draw inferences from them in her favor, and Spain has alleged more than that her co-workers disliked her. She has presented proof of injury directly flowing from the sexually hostile work environment. Consequently, we find that there is a factual question of whether a reasonable person in Spain's position would have been affected detrimentally by the environment she faced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, the final factor for determining whether there was a sexually hostile work environment is the existence of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[L]iability exists where the defendant knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action." <span class="Italic">Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc.</span>, 867 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">see Hicks v. Gates Rubber [Co.</span>, 833 F.2d 1406, 1418 (10th Cir. 1987)]. Thus, if a plaintiff proves that management-level employees had actual or constructive knowledge about the existence of a sexually hostile environment and failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action, the employer will be liable. <span class="Italic">Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d [251, 255 (4th Cir. 1983)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">895 F.2d at 1486<span class="Italic">. See also Bouton v. BMW of N. Am.</span>, 29 F.3d 103, 105-11 (3d Cir. 1994). Spain contends that the EEOC took no action to stop the harassment even though managers at three levels recognized the situation she faced: Butler, app. at 340, Nelson, app. at 120, 125, and Spain's immediate supervisor, Bruce Bagin, app. at 80. In particular, she charges that she informed Nelson of the rumors and asked him to put an end to them, app. at 77, 230, but that he did nothing. App. at 121. Therefore, Spain's allegations and evidence of her superiors' knowledge of the environment and their indifference to it are sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment as to this element of her claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its ruling, the district court stated that Title VII does not require a supervisor who is the object of a rumored affair between himself and a subordinate to "embarrass himself" by denying the rumors. App. at 31. Yet, without further qualification or explanation, this statement is too broad. As we already have indicated, if the employer knows of the harassment, it is obligated to take prompt remedial action. We do not suggest that Title VII required that Nelson personally deny the rumors. However, assuming that Spain's allegations regarding the rumors are true, the law did require management personnel to take remedial action. Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the EEOC predicated on the court's interpretation of the EEOC's obligation under Title VII. Overall, we think that it is clear that Spain has established the requirements for a claim of a sexually hostile work environment under <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, and that material issues of fact remain for trial. Thus, the district court erred in barring Spain from going forward based on the evidence she intended to offer to prove these claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we have predicated our result on <span class="Italic">Andrews</span> and <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, we nevertheless will discuss <span class="Italic">Jew</span>, as it seems to be the only reported case dealing with circumstances similar to those here. The district court first distinguished <span class="Italic">Jew</span> on the grounds that the supervisor in this case, Nelson, was not involved in spreading the rumors and was, in fact, an object of them. App. at 34. However, as Spain points out, <span class="Italic">Jew</span> does not suggest that the supervisor in that case was involved in spreading the rumors, nor did <span class="Italic">Jew</span> rely on such a consideration. Furthermore, on the record, it could be concluded that Nelson personally was involved in spreading the rumors due to his alleged involvement in creating the conditions under which they developed and were perpetuated, and due also to his refusal to take steps to end them. Thus, with respect to this aspect of the district court's ruling, it appears that the court seized upon a nonexistent distinction between this case and <span class="Italic">Jew</span> and then applied it improperly to Spain's allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court also pointed out that in <span class="Italic">Jew</span> the rumors suggested that the plaintiff had used a sexual relationship to gain favor, influence and power with an administrative superior. Accordingly, the court asked Spain what evidence there was of that type of situation here. Yet, in so asking, the court ignored Spain's offer of testimony by a co-worker that another employee warned him to stay away from Spain because she could get him in trouble with Nelson due to her relationship with him. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 35-36 (court proceeding of July 15, 1993);<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 168 (deposition testimony). Thus, there was evidence that the rumors alleged that Spain had attained influence with Nelson through the use of a sexual relationship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we recount above, however, the attorney for the EEOC argued that this testimony regarding Spain's alleged influence was based upon her having the "boss' ears," as opposed to their having a sexual relationship. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 36. Yet, the record indicates that the EEOC's recollection of the co-worker's testimony was incomplete, in that the co-worker testified to the relationship between Spain and Nelson as the reason for Spain's potential influence over other employees before further explaining that Spain had Nelson's "ears." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 168. Therefore, the district court erred to the extent that it may have accepted the EEOC's account of the co-worker's testimony in determining that Spain did not allege that the rumors involved her use of a sexual relationship to attain influence. Furthermore, Spain offered evidence that a supervisor rated her poorly for advancement purposes on account of the rumors and her resulting poor interpersonal relationships. Thus, there was an additional reason for the court not to have distinguished <span class="Italic">Jew</span> on the grounds that the plaintiff in that case used a sexual relationship to her advantage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, while the district court correctly pointed out that this case does not involve allegations of overt sexual harassment, such as the posting of cartoons and the other activities described in <span class="Italic">Jew</span>, we have noted that "[i]ntimidation and hostility toward women because they are women can obviously result from conduct other than explicit sexual advances." <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1485 (<span class="Italic">quoting Hall v. Gus Constr. Co.</span>, 842 F.2d 1010, 1014 (8th Cir. 1988)). It would have been erroneous, therefore, for the district court to have barred Spain from going forward on the grounds that she had not alleged overt instances of harassment equivalent to those in <span class="Italic">Jew</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, our analysis of the requirements of Title VII leads us to hold that <span id="Page_823"></span>the district court erred in barring Spain from proceeding with her sexual discrimination and harassment claims. Spain has presented evidence that she was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment in the form of rumors among her colleagues that she was involved in a sexual relationship with her superior. These rumors allegedly developed and continued due to the superior's conduct. Moreover, they allegedly led her fellow employees to shun her and her supervisors to evaluate her poorly for advancement purposes. Furthermore, the management personnel did not take remedial action to eliminate the rumors. We are satisfied that considering all the circumstances, and given Spain's unique allegations, she should be allowed the opportunity to prove her claims regarding the sexually hostile work environment she allegedly faced.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mangano v. Attorney General</span>, 01971055 (1999), the Commission found that rumors of an affair with a supervisor created a hostile environment for the complainant where the rumors were allowed to persist over an extended period of time and spread to other offices of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps because the claim has been labeled as "sexual harassment," both complainants and agencies have a tendency to focus on whether the conduct is "sexual" in nature. This obscures the fact that at the heart of all sexual harassment claims is a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex. Whether the conduct is deemed to be "sexual" or not, there is no claim for a violation of Title VII where the underlying conduct is the result of a personality dispute and is not premised on the sex of the alleged victim. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Hodges v. Postmaster General</span>, 01934568 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record, the Commission finds that appellant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment. The Commission agrees with the agency that appellant has not demonstrated that the conduct directed at him was sexual in nature or that, but for his sex, he would not have been subjected to the treatment. The Commission concludes that appellant's affidavit did not depict how the alleged offensive behavior by the co-worker was sexual in nature. The alleged incidents of staring and walking through appellant's work area do not alone suggest that the co-worker was making sexual advances or engaging in verbal or physical conduct sexual in nature. Furthermore, there is no indication that appellant's sex was the reason for the co-worker's behavior. The evidence indicated that there had been a dispute between appellant and the co-worker involving their past relationship when appellant represented the co-worker in another sexual harassment claim. Appellant failed to relate how the alleged offensive behavior was sexual harassment rather than the result of the disagreement and the ensuing tension between the two employees. Although the co-worker had filed sexual harassment claims against appellant, this did not establish that alleged conduct by the co-worker toward appellant was based on sex. Appellant provides no support for his allegation that sexual harassment allegations against him are part of a scheme to harass him due to his sex.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Dravis v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A42369 (2005) (complainant failed to prove conduct was sexual where all prior complaints failed to mention sexual conduct).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that unwelcome sexual harassment is combined with other obnoxious behavior of a nonsexual nature does not remove the complaint from the ambit of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Schreier v. USPS</span>, 01853313 (1987). Furthermore, calling an employee "pet names which made him uncomfortable, social invitations, flirting, and isolated incidents of rude behavior that may have made an employee uncomfortable are insufficient to rise to the level of sexual harassment." <span class="Italic">See Cazenave v. Postmaster General</span>, 03880050 (1988). Merely staring at a female employee does not constitute sexual harassment where there is no other evidence of conduct that is sexual in nature. Although the employee testified the supervisor constantly stared at her "backside," coworkers only corroborated that the supervisor stared at the appellant and not at any particular part of her anatomy. <span class="Italic">See Westfall v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922687 (1993). The Commission noted that such conduct could constitute harassment based on sex, but found there was insufficient evidence that the staring was so severe or pervasive as to create a hostile working environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">"Evidence of the general working atmosphere involving employees other than the appellant is relevant to the issue of whether there existed a hostile work environment that violated Title VII." <span class="Italic">Velez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902746 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Vinson v. Taylor</span>, 753 F.2d 141 (D.C. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd in relevant part and rev'd in part</span>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986)); <span class="Italic">Delgado v. Lehman</span>, 665 F. Supp. 460 (E.D. Va. 1987); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">McGinnis</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (testimony of coworker that she found comments sexually offensive is relevant to the existence of a hostile work environment).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the offending supervisor is a "toucher" and has also embraced male employees does not preclude a finding of sexual harassment. In <span class="Italic">Copsey v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912674 (1991), the Commission found evidence of touching of a male employee to be inconsequential where several female employees had testified that the supervisor had continually touched them. The Commission found that "but for" the complainant's sex, the supervisor would not have engaged in repeated touching to the manner and extent that he did.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether conduct is sexual in nature is not determined solely by the part of the body that is touched. The context of the touching also must be considered. For example, in <span class="Italic">Christian v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942005 (1995), the Commission found the touching of a breast was not sexual in nature where the contact was purely accidental.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission held in the past that in evaluating whether conduct is sexual in nature, the respective sexes of the complainant and the alleged perpetrator are not outcome determinative. In <span class="Italic">DePaul v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912729 (1992), the Commission found that one female worker had sexually harassed a coworker. The Commission in <span class="Italic">DePaul</span> focused on the sexual nature of the conduct and not on the sex of the victim and the harasser:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, after a careful review of the entire record, that appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of hostile environment sexual harassment. First, appellant, a female, belongs to a statutorily protected group. The next inquiry is whether appellant was subjected to unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. A review of the testimonial evidence of appellant, her witnesses, the female coworker and the supervisors, establishes that despite appellant's protests the female coworker verbally harassed and intentionally touched appellant on several occasions. The verbal conduct included comments directed specifically at appellant which were sexual in nature, and ongoing remarks of a clearly sexual nature directed at the workforce in general. The coworker's comments to appellant included questions such as whether appellant would be sexually satisfied by scantily clad men and women pictured on postcards; inquiries regarding the sex lives of appellant and her children; and, statements about the coworker's ability to sexually satisfy appellant's son. The record establishes that the female coworker also physically touched appellant on four occasions. The first incident occurred in August 1989 when the female coworker sat on appellant's lap, commenting on appellant's breasts and their ability to have "fun" with them. The second incident, on November 4, 1989, involved the female coworker pushing her breasts up against appellant's and shouting, "Oh our tits touched. I hope she got the same thing out of it as I did." The next two incidents, both occurring on November 13, 1989, consisted of the female coworker rubbing her lower body against appellant's thigh in a humping motion and attempting to run her breast down appellant's arm. The Commission agrees with the AJ that the physical conduct to which appellant was subjected was a sexual nature, particularly considering the coworker's comments which accompanied the actions. The Commission finds additionally that the record establishes that the verbal conduct of the female coworker was clearly sexual in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DePaul</span>, after finding the conduct was unwelcome because the complainant repeatedly asked the coworker to cease and also sought the intervention of her supervisors, the Commission addressed the issue of whether the harassment was actually based on sex, or whether it was based on the fact that the coworker personally disliked the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, appellant must show that the harassment complained of was based on sex. In finding that the female coworker's conduct was not based on appellant's sex, the AJ relied to some extent on the fact that the coworker's verbal outbursts were directed at the workforce in general, which included males and females. In addition, the AJ found, with regard to the coworker's verbal and physical conduct, that, rather than being based on sex, the conduct was the result of a personality conflict. Although there is evidence that appellant and the coworker did not get along and that appellant attempted to familiarize the coworker with her religious beliefs, the Commission disagrees with the AJ's conclusion that the coworker's conduct was not based on sex. Rather, we find that the nature of the conduct, particularly the physical contact of appellant's intimate body parts; the explicitly sexual connotation of the language employed; the fact that much of the conduct could not be directed at a male; and, the testimony of several witnesses that the female coworker did not single out male employees, as she did appellant, necessitates a conclusion that the conduct was based on appellant's sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">Cases involving sexual harassment are assessed on an individual factual basis. "[N]ot all acts of sexually implicit conduct such as off-color remarks, personal invitations to go on dates, occasional touching or expressions which may be viewed as sexual innuendo are sufficient to establish unlawful sexual harassment." <span class="Italic">Buckner v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01850059 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Buckner</span>, the Commission found the complainant must, at a minimum, identify specific conduct or behavior of a "sexually explicit nature" that interferes with work performance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has significantly retreated from that position and held that to constitute sexual harassment the conduct complained of must be at least generally sexual in nature. <span class="Italic">Steele v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931500 (1994). Under <span class="Italic">Steele</span>, conduct, even if deemed inappropriate, cannot constitute sexual harassment if there are no sexual overtones in the conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant and the agency reached a settlement agreement. Appellant agreed to withdraw her EEO complaint. The agency agreed that, henceforth, appellant would be treated with respect and dignity and shielded from sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_824"></span>The relevant facts are undisputed. Approximately five months subsequent to the execution of the settlement agreement, the coworker employed an intermediary to forward a Bible to appellant and twice sat down at a patio table at which appellant was seated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant asserts that the foregoing incidents constitute a breach of the settlement agreement. The Commission disagrees. In <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank F.S.B. v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 62-67 (1986), the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that sexual harassment, though not necessarily affecting an employee's economic benefits, may take the form of a hostile or offensive working environment. A <span class="Italic">sine qua non</span> in the definition of sexual harassment is the requirement of conduct that is sexual in nature<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11. Taken either as individual incidents or together, the coworker's August 1992 actions do not constitute sexual conduct. While the coworker's furtive delivery of a Bible was inappropriate, it can not be considered sexual conduct. Furthermore, joining her at a communal table does not constitute sexual conduct, notwithstanding the tour superintendent's instruction to avoid all future contact with appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that the coworker's actions in August 1992 did not constitute sexual harassment, we agree with the agency's determination that it did not breach the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the case arose in the context of an allegation that the agency breached an agreement specifically prohibiting future sexual harassment, the Commission did not review the factual situation to determine if the conduct constituted gender-based harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in several cases, the Commission appeared headed toward a definition of "sexual" that is narrower than simply expressing a romantic interest in someone. More and more, it appears the Commission is viewing sexual harassment from a purely prurient perspective. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wyteh v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01942888 (1995), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that appellant has not established that some of the incidents were of a sexual nature. A reasonable person in appellant's circumstances would not view the alleged comments about her hair style, and the isolated question about her perfume to be of a sexual nature....</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01934718 (1994), the Commission found the terms "sweetie pie" and "bitch" were not sexual in nature when directed by one male employee at a male coworker. The Commission did not indicate whether it would consider the terms as being sexual in nature if they were directed by a male employee toward a female coworker. Presumably, the terms could be considered as sexual in nature depending on the context. In <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, the context indicated the terms were meant to reflect upon the appellant's sexual orientation--a fact that takes the terms outside the ambit of Title VII. However, as discussed below, the Commission has now reversed itself and found that sexual orientation and transgender status fall within the ambit of Title VII's prohibition against sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, <span class="Italic">Baker v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A14062 (2002), the Commission held that the fact that the complainant had participated in practical jokes in the workplace was evidence that conduct directed toward him, such as calling him "fag" and "queer" and an incident "when he was hog tied leaving him sexually exposed," was not based on sex. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Baker</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant does not suggest that his harassers were motivated by sexual desire. Nor does complainant produce comparative evidence indicating that women at the facility are treated differently. However, on appeal, complainant argues that the agency undermined his masculinity when he was called "fag" and "queer" in a sexually pejorative manner, when he was hog tied leaving him sexually exposed, and when his manhood was mocked by his co-worker's teasing. In light of these arguments, and in recognition of the authority cited above, the Administrative Judge should have considered whether complainant was harassed in such sex-specific and derogatory terms as to make it clear that the harasser was motivated by general hostility to the presence of males in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence, that the harassers were motivated by hostility toward males. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered the social context in which the challenged behavior occurred<span class="Italic">. Oncale</span> at 81. Complainant, himself, admits that during the time he alleged that he was harassed, he participated in a number of practical jokes. The record reveals that employees would hide work carts for other employees, put lubricant on doorknobs, put pieces of tape across coffee cups, glue lunch buckets on tables, glue lockers shut, and paint steering wheels. In light of this behavior which occurred at the time of the incidents raised by complainant, it is not clear that the conduct challenged by complainant was based on sex. We are nevertheless dispirited by the conduct of complainant's co-workers and the agency's failure to intervene.</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, it must be noted that the focus on whether conduct is sexual in nature, ultimately, goes to the question of whether the conduct can be properly characterized as sexual harassment, or gender-based harassment. The fundamental question in either case, under Title VII, is whether the complainant can prove the conduct is based on his or her gender.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where touching and "terms of endearment" are part of the work environment and are engaged in by both males and females, the complainant will not be able to establish a claim of sexual harassment. A good example is provided by <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120070800 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission next addresses the AJ's finding of no discrimination. We find that the AJ's decision that complainant did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment or harassment based on sex was based on substantial evidence. That complainant was not discriminated against by being subjected to a sexually hostile work environment is also based upon substantial evidence. Complainant testified that she was called by what she herself described as "terms of endearment" including names such as "baby," "sugar," "darlin" and "honey" at work by both female and male co-workers and supervisors. She also testified that she was touched, pinched on her cheek and observed co-workers rubbing and "grinding" when they hugged each other. Concerning being pinched on the cheek, she testified that the Distribution Clerk, a female, called her "sweetheart" and "darlin," and pinched her on her cheek on one occasion. She also stated that some carriers who came to the cage to get her mail had grabbed her arm and held on to it. Complainant also testified that she felt isolated and mocked by the staff after she posted a note on her "cage," asking not to be called by the names to which she objected and not to be touched.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find complainant failed to establish that a sex-based or a sexually hostile work environment existed in her workplace. Whether sexual harassment creates a hostile work environment is a question for the trier of fact. In <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, the Court explained that the trier of fact must determine the existence of sexual harassment in light of "the record as a whole" and "the totality of circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents took place." <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding touching, complainant testified about one event when the Distribution Clerk came to the cage where complainant was working, called complainant "sweetheart," and pinched complainant on her cheek. The Distribution Clerk admitted that she did address complainant as "sweetheart" but she denied ever touching complainant. Complainant testified that one of her managers was a "touchy-feely" person who liked to talk and touch. When asked how the manager touched her, complainant stated that she could not say; that she did not know whether the touching was sexual; and that she did not like touch-feely acts. When complainant was asked if the manager touched her on her arm or shoulder, complainant stated: "It's just if...if I would--I would most of the time have to approach her, in terms of getting some kind of information. And that was just how she reacted. And she basically reacted like that to everyone." The manager testified that she did not consider herself a "touchy-feely" person and denied complainant's accusation. She stated that one day she called complainant "sweetie"; complainant objected; and she never addressed complainant in that manner again. The manager also stated that she meant no harm by calling complainant "sweetie." Complainant also testified that in terms of getting the mail, various carriers would come to her cage and grab her arm and hold on to her arm. The record indicates that in obtaining mail from complainant, a carrier's hand might touch complainant's hand during the exchange of mail. Complainant also testified that after she posted the note about not wanting to be touched, the touching by the carriers "basically" stopped.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the hugging, when complainant was asked how employees would hug one another, she stated: "I don't quite know--I mean, I don't quite understand what you're trying to get [a]t." She further testified "I do not know how to categorize a hug. Some of them would hug particularly close and they would grind and rub" and she stated that she did not know whether that action could be considered as a friendly hug or greeting. Asked again, how individuals would hug one another, she stated that they would "hug and rub and go through the exchanging of names." The record indicates that hugging occurred within the workplace but with no sexual connotation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not support a finding that the alleged hostility about which complainant testified was attributable to her sex; neither did the incidents about which she testified have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with her work performance or creating an objectively hostile, intimidating, or offensive work environment. Complainant did not testify that anyone hugged her and although there is testimony about touching, complainant did not testify that she was subjected to any inappropriate touching as a result of her sex. Complainant was the only witness to testify about "rubbing" and "grinding" when other employees hugged each other.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that complainant appeared not to have a positive working relationship at the Old National Station, a place where she had not been working very long and where, according to complainant's own testimony, she may have been perceived by employees as trying to run the operation. Complainant testified that she began working at the Old National facility in May 2004. Complainant also testified that when <span id="Page_825"></span>an employee bid to a new place, the new person was the new kid on the block and the new person would have to do all the dirty work. She testified further that a new employee was fair game for everybody to try to use as a "flunky."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that when complainant brought her concerns to management that management responded by showing a film on sexual harassment and by also informing employees, some of whom complainant specifically identified as calling her by names she did not want to be addressed by, to address complainant by the name she requested and not to engage in hugging or touching her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While complainant testified that employees called each other by the very same nicknames that complainant had objected to in order to mock complainant, we cannot find that the actions created an objectively hostile work environment permeated with sex-based harassment. Complainant also testified that after she posted the note and after a meeting concerning harassment, there were no other incidents of what she considered to be sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">A few courts have held that, irrespective of the intent of the perpetrator, conduct or language which is not gender neutral can create a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Winsor v. Hinckley Dodge</span>, 79 F.3d 996 (10th Cir. 1996), the court of appeals rejected the findings of the district court that the conduct was not sex-based because it was based on personal animosity toward the plaintiff and not on her gender. The court of appeals found that where the conduct and epithets used were gender-based, the intent of the harassers simply was not relevant. The <span class="Italic">Winsor</span> court, 79 F.3d at 1000-01, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiff argues that many of the incidents described above were inherently sexual in nature, and that, therefore, the district court erred in finding no sexual harassment. We agree. Although some of the incidents were gender neutral, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the invasion of plaintiff's desk, the blocking of the doors, the door slamming, the hood slamming, and the spiked drink, the other incidents occurred only because plaintiff was a woman. That is, even if the motivation behind plaintiff's mistreatment was gender neutral, as found by the district court, the manner in which her coworkers expressed their anger and jealousy was not. Rather, plaintiff's coworkers often chose sexually harassing behavior to express their dislike of plaintiff, conduct which would not have occurred if she were not a woman.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is beyond dispute that the incident with the salesman during plaintiff's first week was overtly sexual. A man's act of pushing a woman against a wall, placing his knee between her legs, and calling her a "f'ing bitch," can be nothing other than sexual harassment. So too, the cartoon directed at plaintiff, depicting a woman pulling up her skirt and spreading her legs, was overtly sexual and harassing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The names plaintiff was called, both verbally and in the form of notes, were also sexual in nature. "It is beyond dispute that evidence that a woman was subjected to a steady stream of vulgar and offensive epithets because of her gender would be sufficient to establish a claim under Title VII...." <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 53 F.3d at 1539; <span class="Italic">see also Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d 251, 254 (4th Cir. 1983) (holding that sexual harassment includes the use of "extremely vulgar and offensive sexually related epithets addressed to and employed about [plaintiff]"). Such words are recognized as "intensely degrading, deriving their power to wound not only from their meaning but also from 'the disgust and violence they express phonetically.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Over the course of her employment, plaintiff was called a "whore," "floor whore," "curb whore," "curb side cunt," and "bitch," on a consistent basis. These sexual epithets have been identified as "'intensely degrading' to women." <span class="Italic">Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.</span>, 824 F. Supp. 847, 883 (D. Minn. 1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">Katz</span>, 709 F.2d at 254); <span class="Italic">see Burns v. McGregor Electronic Indus., Inc.</span>, 989 F.2d 959, 964 (8th Cir. 1993) (noting that use of "bitch," "slut," and "cunt," to woman was harassment based on her sex); <span class="Italic">Huddleston v. Roger Dean Chevrolet, Inc.</span>, 845 F.2d 900, 902 (11th Cir. 1988) (detailing incidents of sexual harassment, including comments by other salesmen calling plaintiff a "bitch" and a "whore"); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. A. Sam &#x0026; Sons Produce Co.</span>, 872 F. Supp. 29, 35-36 (W.D.N.Y. 1994) (holding that "the term 'whore' is usually gender-specific and is certainly more offensive when directed at a woman," and noting that "a man calling a woman a 'whore'--thereby reducing her to an illicit sexual being--is a direct affront to her self-respect rather than a simple vulgarity that might offend her sensibilities") (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The words "honey" and "baby," although not overtly sexual, may be sexual in nature if their use occurs based only on the recipient's gender<span class="Italic">. See Hicks</span>, 928 F.2d at 971; <span class="Italic">Jenson</span>, 824 F. Supp. at 880 (holding that "pet names" and terms that persons in romantic relationships might use such as "honey" and "babe" are sexual in nature). We express no opinion whether the use of such terms, in and of themselves, could create a hostile work environment. In this case, however, we are constrained to view the new manager's use of "honey" and "baby" as part of the pattern of sexually derogatory names directed at plaintiff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that plaintiff's abuse was motivated by gender neutral reasons is irrelevant. The Ninth Circuit faced a similar situation in <span class="Italic">Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co.</span>, 25 F.3d 1459 (9th Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 115 S. Ct. 733, 130 L. Ed.2d 636 (1995), where plaintiff's supervisor called her sexually explicit names and publicly suggested that she perform a sexual act with customers<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1461. The district court held that the supervisor's conduct was not sexual harassment because he was consistently abusive to both men and women, and therefore the behavior was not based on plaintiff's gender. The appellate court reversed, holding that although the supervisor abused both men and women, the abuse of women was different because it "relied on sexual epithets, offensive, explicit references to women's bodies and sexual conduct."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1463. Noting that "[i]t is one thing to call a woman 'worthless,' and another to call her a 'worthless broad,'" the court held that the supervisor's abuse of plaintiff centered on the fact that she was female<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1464; <span class="Italic">see also Burns</span>, 989 F.2d at 965 (rejecting claim that verbal abuse was gender neutral because it was motivated by dislike of plaintiff, noting that dislike of plaintiff did not excuse subjecting her to a "steady stream of sexual harassment").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Testimony by defendant's former manager that "floor whore" is an industry term does not negate its sexually derogatory character. Just as we would not sanction an industry term that is facially derogatory to a particular racial or ethnic group, we cannot accept the argument that industry use of an inherently sex-related term neutralizes its detrimental effect on women. Moreover, there is no evidence that the term was directed at any other salesperson during plaintiff's employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding no sexual harassment, in light of the sexually explicit statements, pictures, and notes directed at plaintiff, and the sexually offensive physical contact to which plaintiff was subjected by one of her coworkers. We also conclude that the incidents were sufficiently pervasive as to create a hostile work environment<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, __ U.S. __, __, 114 S. Ct. 367, 371, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993) (identifying factors to be considered in determining whether environment is hostile). The uncontradicted evidence demonstrates "an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at __, 114 S. Ct. at 370.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the court makes clear in <span class="Italic">Winsor</span>, intent in cases involving hostile environment harassment is not relevant as long as the plaintiff can show that the conduct at issue: (1) had the effect of creating a hostile environment; (2) was based on gender; and (3) was sufficiently severe or pervasive. This is consistent with EEOC guidelines that describe hostile environment harassment as "conduct [which] has the <span class="Italic">purpose or effect</span> of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a)(3) (emphasis added.) In the <span class="Italic">Winsor</span> case, it is clear from the nature of the terms used by the harassers that they could only be directed at women. Therefore, whether the words were intended to harass the plaintiff is irrelevant as long as their effect was to create a hostile working environment.</p>
