<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-24g"><span class="space">9.</span> Psychiatric Illnesses</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission is vigilant in requiring that agencies actually prove there is a substantial risk in cases involving psychiatric illnesses because of the tendency to regard such individuals as a risk. A good example of the Commission's vigilance is <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a40794.txt">01A40794</a> (2006). In that case, the complainant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and the agency determined he was not qualified to be employed as a sandblaster because of concerns that his medication might cause him to react to extreme temperatures. The Commission found that the complainant could perform the duties of a sandblaster even though there was some medical evidence that questioned his ability. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will now proceed to the issue of whether the agency satisfied its burden of proving that its failure to hire complainant was justified. A direct threat is defined as "a significant risk of substantial harm" which cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The agency cannot exclude qualified individuals with disabilities from employment based upon fear of a future risk of injury. <span class="Italic">Zarate v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00415 (January 8, 2001); <span class="Italic">Holmes v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01977073 (October 20, 2000). Rather, the agency must make an individualized assessment of whether the individual poses a "direct threat" of substantial harm, taking into account: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); <span class="Italic">Selix v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we do not agree with the agency's conclusion that hiring complainant for the Sandblaster position would have posed a direct threat to either his safety or that of his co-workers. In reaching this conclusion, we will focus on elements (3) and (4) of the above analysis. We do not find that the agency established that the re-emergence of complainant's symptoms would have been likely or imminent had he been hired. In this regard we note Doctor B's statement, in her June 19, 2000 letter, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is my opinion that while [complainant] has demonstrated a relatively high level of function in the recent past, the very nature of his condition is such that there is always the potential for relapse. Because of the potential for insidious onset of psychosis and other symptoms of schizophrenia, it is unsafe for him to work in any number of high responsibility/high risk/or environmentally challenging jobs where such symptoms may go unnoticed with catastrophic results.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Doctor B's position does not take into account the fact that complainant had been successfully treated by olanzapine for more than 18 months before he applied for the position, in November 1998, Doctor H wrote that "I anticipate that he may be able to continue to be symptom free on a dose as low as 5 mg." In March 2000, Doctor H wrote that complainant's prognosis was "fair to good," and that he was managing his "ongoing psychological stressors," reasonably well. Doctor B merely speculated that complainant, for whatever reason, might not receive adequate amounts of his medication at some point in the future. Although Doctor H stated that she was unable to predict the future course of complainant's illness, we find that any fair reading of this comment would not lead one to conclude that she was warning the agency that there was a significant risk that a re-emergence of complainant's symptoms was likely or imminent. Doctor B also failed to take in account the fact that complainant had been performing duties in the work environment without a re-emergence of his symptoms for 10 months when he was selected. We find that complainant's successful performance of the duties and responsibilities of the position, over a period of time, is probative on the issue of whether a re-emergence of his symptoms would have been likely or imminent had he been hired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1295"></span>In her September 7, 2000 letter to complainant, A-l indicated that she was concerned about the possible side effects of the medication that he was required to take. She noted that, among other things, Doctor B stated that, "sleepiness, agitation, nervousness and dizziness" were possible. A-l indicated that these possible side effects concerned her because of the "impacts on [complainant's] cognitive functions would likely slow [his] reaction time and impair [his] judgment." A-l also stated that, "this would create an unacceptable level of imminence of risk in the hazardous environment to you and your co-workers." During her deposition, A-l was asked what her concerns were if complainant were in the position. She answered that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Any, any safety hazard...I really don't know what he may do. As in the prior case and one case was a suicide attempt. There could be anything that he could do that could endanger himself or others at the work place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A-l's Deposition at page 81.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A-l acknowledged, however, that she was not aware of anything like this taking place during complainant's employment<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatrics Disabilities</span>, 915.002 (3/27/97), page 34 (the Guidance), the Commission stated that an individual does not pose a direct threat solely because s/he takes a medication that may diminish coordination or concentration for some people as a side effect. The Guidance goes on to state that whether such an individual poses a direct threat must be determined on a case-by-case basis, based on a reasonable medical judgment.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> An employer must determine the nature and severity of the individual's side effects, how those side effects influence his/her ability to safely operate machinery, and whether s/he had safety problems in the past when operating the same or similar machinery while taking the medication.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Clearly, the agency did not meet its burden in this case. Neither Doctor B nor A-l made any attempt to evaluate whether complainant experienced side effects from his medication that made him a direct threat. Instead, they relied upon their subjective judgments about the side effects that some people may have had while using olanzapine. Likewise, neither Doctor B nor A-l took in to account that fact that complainant had worked in the hangar for ten months, while using olanzapine, without incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we are also concerned by the statements made by Doctor B in her June 19, 2000 letter and her deposition. These comments, at the very least, create the appearance that Doctor B's recommendation to A-l was not based on whether complainant's employment constituted a direct threat, but on a concern that removing him at some future point might be problematic for the agency. This clearly contradicts Doctor B's claim that she was solely concerned with complainant's medical qualifications as determined by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120064483 (2008), the Commission found that the agency was justified in terminating the complainant from his security screener position during his probationary period where, among other things, he sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service requesting that 350 trillion dollars be credited to his tax account. He also advised the Bank of America that he was creating a new currency--"Jamerican Offset Bank Notes." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the agency conducted an objective individualized assessment of complainant by providing him with a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he could perform the duties of his position. Both the agency's psychiatrist and complainant's personal psychiatrist concluded that complainant's symptoms are permanent. Complainant felt that people were after him, that the government was conspiring against him, and that he had a computer in his stomach that controlled him. Further, he routinely heard derogatory voices, he believed that he had the authorization to print Federal Reserve Notes and create his own currency, and he was unable to maintain focus in the work environment. While complainant's personal psychologist stated that complainant was qualified and able to perform the functions of his position if he took medication, complainant admitted to not taking his medication on a daily basis. The agency's psychologist opined that complainant's inability to maintain a regulated medication routine made complainant's condition worse, as the delusional voices were fighting for attention and making it harder for complainant to focus at work. Further, complainant's inability to speak in front of people and the increase in his paranoia when surrounded by large crowds further amplifies the likelihood that complainant would pose a harm to himself or someone else. The distractions due to the paranoia and the derogatory voices make likely that complainant would not be able to respond appropriately if an emergency situation were to arise, and therefore represents a significant risk of substantial harm. Further, we agree with the agency that no reasonable accommodation exists that would eliminate the risk of harm or reduce it to an acceptable level. Therefore, we AFFIRM the agency's finding that complainant is not qualified for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant's position involves a security clearance and evidence of a psychiatric condition surfaces during a reinvestigation of the clearance, a subsequent examination is job-related and consistent with business necessity and there is no requirement that the evidence be medical in nature. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sanders v. National Security Agency</span>, 0120073987 (2010), the agency ordered the complainant to undergo a psychiatric evaluation when her security investigation revealed evidence of paranoid ideation. The complainant believed that, as a result of an EEO complaint by her husband, their home had been broken into and their computer files erased and that her husband's credit card had been canceled. She also alleged that during the examination, the psychologist called her "delusional" and said that the complainant's marriage was a "pathological marital relationship." As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Sanders</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that, even if we assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination as to all alleged bases, the Agency articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions; namely, that Complainant's five-year reinvestigation was due and that, during the investigation, information was discovered which called into question Complainant's fitness for holding a security clearance. The Commission notes that the information regarding Complainant's belief that her home and computer were broken into came from Complainant's coworkers and supervisor. Several of the coworkers reported that the information that they gave had come directly from Complainant. Based on this information, the investigative report for Complainant's security investigation was forward to the Agency's psychologist for evaluation. The Commission has long held that employers may require a medical examination or make disability related inquiries of an employee only if the examination is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span> (July 27, 2000) (web version) (Guidance), at 5. This requirement is met when the employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that (1) an employee's ability to perform the essential job functions is impaired by a medical condition; or (2) that an employee poses a direct threat due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance at 14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Commission finds that the Agency's referral of Complainant for an evaluation was lawful, and is supported by substantial evidence in the record. The evidence shows that it was the Agency's standard practice to forward any questionable information to the Agency's psychologist for evaluation. The Commission finds that Complainant has not presented any evidence which suggests that procedures were not followed or that the timing of the reinvestigation was somehow linked to the processing of her husband's EEO reports.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, the Commission found that the psychiatric evaluation of a prison cook was not job-related and consistent with business necessity where the complainant requested accommodation for a physical condition. The agency contended the psychiatric evaluation was necessary because the complainant's physician could find nothing physically wrong with the complainant and recommended a psychiatric evaluation. In <span class="Italic">Cofield-Gipson v. Attorney General</span>, 0120073270 (2010), the Commission violated the Rehabilitation Act explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the Agency failed to meet its burden showing that a psychological evaluation was needed in this case. Complainant alleged that she was hurt physically and a psychological evaluation had no bearing on whether she could perform the essential functions of her job, or whether she posed a direct threat. The Agency indicated that it sent Complainant for a psychological evaluation because her doctor could not find anything physically wrong with her. However, the Agency has presented no evidence that Complainant's mental state was at issue or that it felt that she was unable to perform the essential functions of her position because of a mental condition. In this regard, we note that the criteria the agency provided to Doctor E all pertained to Complainant's physical injuries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that the Agency ordered this psychological examination and the records from it for reasons that were not job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See Bernal v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080038 (June 17, 2008) (holding that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it requested medical information when it did not believe that Complainant's medical condition impaired his ability to perform the essential functions of his modified position). Herein, the Agency has failed to meet its burden. We conclude that the Agency did not demonstrate that the psychological inquiries Complainant was required to undergo were job-related or consistent with business necessity. Therefore, the Agency has violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Colon v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03930153 (1994), the Commission addressed a defense of disability discrimination in the context of an employee assault on her supervisor that was prompted by incidents of <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment. The employee presented persuasive evidence that she had suffered sexual abuse as a child and suffered from PTSD. During the assault, the employee had a "dissociative response" in which she envisioned the supervisor as her childhood abuser. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Colon</span> agreed with the finding of the MSPB that the employee was not a qualified person with a disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1296"></span>Finally, the Commission must address petitioner's claim of mental disability discrimination. To assert a claim that she was discriminated against because of a disability, petitioner must satisfy the threshold requirement that she is a disabled person as defined by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a) defines a person with a disability as one who:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;has a record of having such an impairment; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;is regarded as having such an impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute in the record that petitioner meets the regulatory definition of a person with a disability. The evidence in the record clearly establishes that petitioner suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, and that this condition is widely recognized as disabling. The medical evidence reflects that it has substantially limited petitioner's ability to carry on virtually all of her major life activities at times, inasmuch as it has completely incapacitated petitioner to the point that she has been hospitalized in the past.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, in order to avail herself of the protection of the Rehabilitation Act, petitioner must also show that at the time the agency issued the discipline in this case, she was a "qualified individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, could have performed the essential functions of the position in question." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6). In appropriate circumstances, a determination may be required as to whether petitioner can perform the essential functions of the position in question without constituting a danger or risk to herself or others. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Commission finds that at the time the removal decision was made, petitioner failed to establish that she could perform the essential functions of her position without endangering the health and safety of herself or others. Specifically, at that time, there was no evidence that petitioner's condition was treatable, and that she was a good candidate for rehabilitation. Although petitioner submitted evidence of her successful rehabilitation in her petition for review submitted to this Commission, and although we commend petitioner for her efforts, we find that such evidence was not available at the time the agency made its decision to remove petitioner. Thus, we conclude that it would have been impossible for the agency to predict that petitioner would pose no threat to herself and others. In fact the record reflects that petitioner became violent on at least two prior occasions. Although petitioner argues that her misconduct was a single, isolated event, and that the prior incidents of violence were either provoked by sexual harassment or unrelated to her employment, it was not unreasonable for the agency to consider this prior history of violent behavior when it made the decision to remove her in September 1989. Although the evidence reflects that petitioner was able to return to work without incident, we find that evidence to support her return to work was not available in September 1989. It is petitioner's burden to submit such evidence, inasmuch as she has the burden of establishing that she is a qualified person with a disability. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the agency did not discriminate against petitioner on the basis of her mental disability when it issued its decision to remove in September 1989.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Colon</span> decision is also discussed in Chapter 12 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-21-016.html#sec12-17">Violent Responses to Harassment</a>." As noted in that discussion, the result in the case is not as problematic as the rationale. Ultimately, appellant's removal was mitigated to a 180-day suspension because the assault was provoked. In addition to the criticisms noted in the <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a> discussion, there is a difficulty with the Commission's conclusion that the appellant was not a qualified person with a disability. The Commission concluded that the appellant was not a qualified person with a disability because, at the time the agency made its decision to remove her, there was no evidence she could perform the essential functions of her position without posing a risk to others. To the contrary, the evidence suggests that the appellant was able to perform her essential duties when she was not being subjected to sexual harassment. Moreover, it does not seem an undue hardship to require that an agency provide a work environment free of sexual harassment; in fact, that is the law.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission noted in its decision, subsequent to her removal, appellant successfully sought treatment for her condition. Yet the agency was determined to have no obligation to afford an opportunity for rehabilitation because of the Commission's finding that appellant was not a qualified person with a disability. It does not seem a stretch of the law to hold that the appellant was a qualified person with a disability, that her violent reaction was prompted by illegal sexual harassment, and that the agency should, in those circumstances, be required to give the appellant an opportunity to undergo treatment and demonstrate rehabilitation. The problem with this approach is that it is not unreasonable for the agency to insist that appellant remain away from the work site until such time as treatment can progress to the point where the agency has a reasonable assurance that violence will not recur.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, just as the Commission formulated special rules to deal with the issue of sexual harassment, it may need to explore the desirability of special rules to deal with mental disabilities that find their roots in sexual abuse. Otherwise, it appears the punishment for the victim may equal or, as in this case, exceed the punishment to the perpetrator. It is hard to believe that such a result can really further either the purposes of Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
