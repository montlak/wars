<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-77"><span class="space">5.</span> Failure to Avoid Harm</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency can avoid liability for supervisory harassment if it can show, in addition to the fact that it exercised reasonable care in preventing and correcting harassing behavior, that the complainant "unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, <span class="Italic">supra.</span> The burden is on the agency to show that the employee's failure to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities to avoid harm was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency cannot establish an affirmative defense based on the complainant's <span id="Page_902"></span>failure to complain where high level management was otherwise aware of the harassment, displayed discriminatory attitudes, and failed to act on complaints of racial harassment brought forward by coworkers of the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120070003 (2008), the complainant was subjected to overt racial harassment over a two-year period which included being called "lazy," "incompetent," and a "black bitch." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Richardson</span>, rejected the agency's argument that it should not be held liable for the harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the agency failed to prove the affirmative defense. A credible witness testified that the Director threatened him with retaliation because the witness assisted African-American employees with. EEO complaints. The witness further testified that the Director referred to African-Americans as "those people" and stated that African-Americans had inferior writing skills. Another witness testified that he did not report the harassment to the Director because the Director was "part of the problem." Additionally, a witness testified that he informed ADD that African-American employees were subjected to a hostile work environment, but ADD stated that "we don't have anything to discuss" because the witness refused to identify the complaining employees, who wanted to remain anonymous. We determine that the record does not contain evidence that the agency took or attempted to take corrective action in this case, and there is no indication that the agency disciplined S1 or ADD for their actions. Thus, we find that the agency is liable for the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith-Riggins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093837 (2011), the Commission gave a good explanation of the reasons why a subordinate employee may delay reporting alleged harassment and how that delay is not necessarily a failure to avoid harm:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the second element of the affirmative defense, the Agency argues that Complainant failed to timely inform the Agency of previous harassing incidents, such as the January 2007 utterance of a racial epitaph or the March 2007 bikini comment. Because Complainant did not immediately inform the Agency about these, and other work-related incidents, Complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of the opportunities to prevent or correct the Postmaster's behavior and avoid the harm from the September 29, 2007 incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree. Our Enforcement Guidance cautions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A determination as to whether an employee unreasonably failed to complain or otherwise avoid harm depends on the particular circumstances and information available to the employee at that time. An employee should not necessarily be expected to complain to management immediately after the first or second incident of relatively minor harassment. Workplaces need not become battlegrounds where every minor, unwelcome remark based on race, sex, or another protected category triggers a complaint and investigation. An employee might reasonably ignore a small number of incidents, hoping that the harassment will stop without resort to the complaint process. The employee may directly say to the harasser that s/he wants the misconduct to stop, and then wait to see if that is effective in ending the harassment before complaining to management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC No. 915.002, at 29-30 (June 19, 1999) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant averred that she initially ignored the white male employee's attempts at humor, and he eventually stopped his jokes. We find it reasonable that Complainant ignored the male employee's unwelcome remarks in January 2007, hoping that he would stop without resorting to the complaint process. We also find it reasonable that Complainant did not immediately report the first incident of sex-based harassment, the March 2007 bikini comment, because of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the comment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We point out that Complainant was not totally passive with respect to the other work-related incidents. On several occasions, she directly asked the Postmaster to stop certain types of misconduct, and those conversations appeared to have successfully changed the Postmaster's conduct. For example, the Postmaster acknowledged in her affidavit that Complainant talked to her about feeling incompetent after the Postmaster snatched mail out of Complainant's hands in front of a customer. The Postmaster averred that she changed her subsequent behavior by quietly calling Complainant over to correct her. The Postmaster also recalled that Complainant had told her she found the Postmaster's whistling to be distracting and annoying, and so the Postmaster tried to refrain from further whistling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Overall, we find that Complainant took reasonable steps to avoid harm when she ignored several early incidents and on other occasions directly told her harasser to stop certain types of misconduct. Since these strategies successfully halted or reduced some of the unwelcome conduct, it was reasonable for Complainant to not report these incidents to the Agency at large during this time. It was reasonable for Complainant to finally report to the Agency about misconduct two weeks after suffering a public humiliation and a physical touching on September 29, 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the second element of the affirmative defense. We conclude that the Agency is vicariously liable for the Postmaster's supervisory harassment based on sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. West</span>, 218 F.3d 725 (7th Cir 2000), the court found that the case must be remanded because the lower court made no findings as to whether the employee's failure to report the alleged harassment was unreasonable. The lower court held that the employee was subjected to a hostile work environment, but that the VA was protected from liability by the affirmative defense set forth in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The factual scenario in <span class="Italic">Johnson, supra</span> at 728, indicates egregious sexual conduct by the Chief of Police toward his secretary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From August 28, 1990, to September 1993 Johnson worked as secretary to Karl Williams, the Chief of Police at the Hines VA Hospital. Shortly after Johnson started to work for Williams, he began to express a crude sexual interest in her. The first incidents took place on September 19, 1990. Williams invited Johnson into his office and locked the door to both of their offices. Holding a condom in one hand, he pulled down his pants and exposed himself. When someone knocked at the door, Williams zipped up his pants and instructed Johnson to act calm. Later that day, Williams took Johnson to a hotel. After disrobing and instructing Johnson to do the same, they had sexual intercourse. Johnson testified that she neither wanted nor desired to have sex with Williams but did so out of fear that she would be terminated if she rejected his advances. The next day, Williams gave Johnson a greeting card with a pre-printed message stating "[i]t's nice to be able to share the simple things of life with you: a quiet walk, a candlelit dinner, an evening by the fire...sex that registers on the Richter Scale." He signed the card "Luv 'Chief' a/k/a Will a/k/a Maurice a/k/a Batman a/k/a Darkman."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The incidents did not stop there. They continued through 1991, with Williams engaging in a variety of inappropriate sexual behavior. He often touched Johnson inappropriately, for example, by trying to separate her legs as she moved from her desk to her typewriter and pressing his chest against her back while she was typing. When Williams learned Johnson was dating another man, he began verbally abusing her. Williams also gave Johnson a Valentine's Day card on February 14, 1991, which read "I can't imagine loving you more than I do today...but tomorrow I will. HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, SWEETHEART."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While all of this was going on, Johnson did not report Williams's conduct, because she was afraid of being fired. The Valentine's Day card, however, seems to have been the last straw. One week after she received it, she informed her co-worker, Valerie Davis, of Williams's harassment. Davis encouraged her to report Williams to an EEO officer, but Johnson refused. In the summer of 1991, when her probationary employment period was coming to an end, Johnson told VA Associate Director James Jones, Williams's supervisor, that Williams was spreading false rumors that she and Williams were romantically involved. Johnson, however, did not tell Jones about the other incidents of harassment. Jones confronted Williams about Johnson's allegations (without mentioning her name), but Williams denied that he was involved with any of his employees. In September 1991, Johnson applied for three other jobs in order to avoid further contact with Williams. She was not selected, even though she was qualified for the positions. (Williams had no input into the decisions.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In January 1992, Johnson met with Dr. Joan Cummings, Director of Hines Hospital, and told her about the harassment. Cummings instructed Johnson to file a formal complaint with an EEO counselor, which Johnson did on February 28, 1992. Cummings then appointed an administrative board to review Johnson's complaint. Although Cummings declined Johnson's offer to drop the complaint in exchange for a promotion elsewhere in the hospital, on May 21, 1992, Cummings transferred Johnson to an equivalent position in another area as a temporary corrective measure while the investigation was ongoing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In June 1992, Johnson started seeing a therapist, complaining that she was suffering from hallucinations, substance abuse, and depression. The EEO investigation ultimately concluded that Johnson had been sexually harassed. Cummings reviewed the EEO report and, on November 9, removed Williams as chief of police and sent him to a different area, transferred Johnson back to her old job, and assigned her to a new supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court remanded the case to determine whether the employee's failure to report the conduct and protect herself from further harm was unreasonable. The court in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 218 F.3d at 731-32, faulted the lower court for failing to consider this issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The problem with the district court's decision does not lie, however, in its factual findings with respect to the first element of the defense. It lies in the absence of the court's consideration of element 2, which requires <span id="Page_903"></span>a finding about whether "the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any protective or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." In other words, it is the VA's burden to show that Johnson acted unreasonably. The district court made no findings at all about the reasonableness of Johnson's failure to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities the VA provided. Even though the district court's failure to state explicitly what it was doing would not require a remand if the court's factual findings were sufficient for us to draw our own legal conclusions, <span class="Italic">see Brooms v. Regal Tube Co.</span>, 881 F.2d 412, 420 (7th Cir. 1989), we do not find this to be such a case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On this record, a trier of fact could rationally come to either conclusion on the second element: that Johnson behaved reasonably, or that she did not. The VA stressed the fact that it took Johnson nearly a year to report the harassment, which is surely an element in its favor. But, as the district court itself acknowledged, her failure to do so may have stemmed from Williams's threats and intimidation, which convinced Johnson (still at that point a probationary employee) that to take any action would come at the price of her job. Such a reaction may not be unreasonable<span class="Italic">. Cf. Caridad</span>, 191 F.3d at 295 (finding employee's failure to report harassment unreasonable where it was based on fear of her co-workers' reaction). There was evidence that Williams threatened Johnson, verbally abused her, and even threw mail in her face. A trier of fact could find that Johnson was under severe emotional and psychological stress as a result of the harassment. Her co-workers observed that she appeared fearful and introverted when she was working for Williams; at one point, when Williams had her backed into a corner, she yelled "I'm going to scream!" Eventually, she consulted a therapist to help her through the hallucinations, substance abuse, and depression she suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This presents a factual issue on the affirmative defense that was never resolved by the district court, and that cannot be resolved by this court on appeal. It is more than a loose end, as its resolution will be determinative of the VA's liability and the outcome of Johnson's case. We therefore conclude that the proper course is to remand for further proceedings on this point.</p>
<p class="noindent">No doubt, the fact that the employee was a probationary secretary who was harassed in an egregious manner by her supervisor, a high level agency official, makes the <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> case amenable to a factual finding that her failure to act was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "social context" of the work environment as it relates to a complainant's failure to avoid harm was discussed in <span class="Italic">Art B. v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 0120142109 (2016). In that case, the complainant alleged a hostile work environment when, among other things, he was subjected to a prank where the Captain told him that he would be transferred the next day, that he was the "whitest Black man that worked there," and was lazy and always late. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Art B</span>. admitted that "joking banter" was the norm and that he often participated in the pranks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a claim of harassment, Complainant must show that: (1) he is a member of a statutorily protected class; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome verbal or physical conduct involving the protected class; (3) the harassment complained of was based on the protected class; (4) the harassment had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the work environment and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) there is a basis for imputing liability to the employer. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Homeland Security (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120113331 (July 1, 2014). The evaluation "requires careful consideration of the social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experience by its target." <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc</span>., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to element (5), an agency is subject to vicarious liability for harassment when it is created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742 (1998). Where the harassment does not result in a tangible employment action, an agency can raise an affirmative defense, which is subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, by demonstrating: (1) that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, and (2) that the complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunity provided by the agency or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Industries, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant alleged that Agency supervisors harassed him by, among other things, playing a prank on him, making race/color-based derogatory comments, and telling him he should wear a bucket on his head. Complainant, however, acknowledged that he often engaged in joking banter with the police captain. Complainant stated that he would have found the prank funny if it lasted five minutes, instead of hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, the Commission has repeatedly found that claims of a few isolated incidents of alleged harassment usually are not sufficient to state a harassment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence that Complainant exhibited discomfort with the atmosphere that permeated the workplace prior to the time that Complainant raised the issues with the EEO Counselor. Significantly, Complainant and the alleged responsible management officials named in the complaint are of the same race and described themselves as having similar skin color. Complainant further acknowledges that he had not complained of harassment based on his race or color to his immediate supervisor or the EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the evidence of record does not establish that the Chief knew that Complainant had been subjected to harassing conduct by Captain 1 or Sergeant 1. It is unfortunate that the Chief played along with the prank, but the Chief viewed it as a harmless joke at the time. There is no evidence of any adverse personnel action in this case. Finally, the record shows that the Agency took prompt corrective action, which Complainant concedes, stopped the harassment. Accordingly, we find that there is no basis for imputing liability to the Agency for the incidents that occurred before Complainant complained to the EEO Counselor.</p>
