<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-26"><span class="space">16.</span> Inherently Dangerous Positions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Where the nature of the position is "inherently dangerous," the <span class="Italic">Mantolete</span> test can be satisfied by "even a small chance of dysfunction on the part of the handicapped person...." <span class="Italic">O'Riordan v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01920206 (1992). In that case, the Commission found the "Criminal Investigator position is such a position, imposing great stress on the physical, mental and emotional resources of an incumbent, while at the same time demanding a consistently high level of judgment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Even though the complainant's condition was controlled through medication, he had not exhibited any symptoms for four years, and he was amenable to allowing the agency to monitor the level of lithium in his system, the Commission found the agency fulfilled its reasonable accommodation obligation by reassigning the employee to a less demanding position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, however, reopened the case in <span class="Italic">O'Riordan v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05920815 (1993). This time the Commission concluded, after reviewing the record, that there was insufficient medical evidence from which to conclude that the complainant had even a small risk that his condition would deteriorate as long as he stayed on medication. Although the Commission, on reconsideration, specifically noted that a bipolar depression would not automatically disqualify someone from holding a criminal investigator position, it found the complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability because of his repeated failures to stay on medication. The Commission, on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">O'Riordan</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the record evidence indicates that appellant's disability posed no probability of harm to himself or others as long as appellant took his medication and had his blood lithium level checked on a regular basis. The agency's Acting Director, Office of Human Resources, determined that appellant was medically fit for the position under the agency's Single Agency Qualification Standard based on the two fitness-for-duty examinations, one by a physician and one by a agency-appointed psychiatrist. Appellant's treating psychiatrist also had informed the agency that as long as appellant takes his medication as prescribed, his illness should not interfere with his work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the record indicates that there existed a reasonable probability, as of the effective date of the reassignment at issue, January 15, 1988, that appellant would fail to consistently take his prescribed medication and to submit to the medically required lithium blood level tests. According to the treating physician's notes on appellant's treatment, he had to admonish appellant as recently as February 12, 1987 about his poor medication compliance and his failure to appear for lithium blood level tests or a physical examination since December 1985. Appellant's failure to take his medication daily is also evidenced by his January 26, 1988 affidavit statement that he could go without lithium "for a long time" since it built up in his blood system. Appellant failed to present any medical evidence proving that he has consistently taken his medication and lithium blood level tests since his psychiatrist's admonishment on February 12, 1987. In addition, appellant represented at the hearing that he had his lithium level tested every couple of months, but then admitted that sometimes it had been three months "or whatever." (HT 457). Thus, as to the nature and duration of risk, the record indicates that appellant neglected to consistently take the prescribed medication and blood lithium level tests from December 1985 to February 1987 and possibly continued to do so until the hearing in July 1991, even though his treating psychiatrist explained to him the importance of doing so. Moreover, appellant clearly understood the importance of taking his medication consistently as indicated in his interview with the agency-appointed psychiatrist in the spring of 1988. Given this evidence, and the fact that appellant failed to introduce any medical evidence indicating that his behavior changed following the treating psychiatrist's admonishments in February 1987, we conclude that the risk that appellant would not follow the prescribed course of treatment was imminent when he was reassigned on January 15, 1989.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next consider the severity of the risk stemming from appellant's failure to follow the prescribed course of treatment. Because Criminal Investigators may be subject to physical attack and, thus, must be prepared to defend self and others, resorting to the use of firearms as a last resort, good judgment is an essential function of the Criminal Investigator position. Given appellant's significant thought disturbances which necessitated hospitalization in 1981 and 1984 prior to the prescription of lithium, and the risk of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of attention could have in situations calling for the use of a firearm in the defense of self and others, we conclude that the severity of the risk, that is, the potential for harm, of appellant's not following the prescribed course of treatment, is extremely high. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees v. William Von Raab</span>, 489 U.S. 656, 670 (1989) (Customs employees who are allowed to use deadly force perform duties "fraught with such risks of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of attention can have disastrous consequences").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because of the potential for life-threatening harm stemming from the use of potentially deadly force in the daily work of the Criminal Investigator position, because the medical evidence indicates that appellant presented no probability of substantial harm to himself or others only as long as he continued to take his prescribed medication and to maintain the appropriate lithium levels in the blood, and because appellant's medical history indicates that he did not consistently take the prescribed medication and required blood lithium level tests, we conclude that the agency has shown that appellant cannot perform the essential functions of the Criminal Investigator position without endangering the health and safety of himself or others. Accordingly, we conclude that appellant was not a qualified person with a disability for the Criminal Investigator position. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Salmon Pineiro v. Lehman</span>, 653 F. Supp. 483 (D. Puerto Rico 1987) (court rejected a proposal that plaintiff be allowed to control his epilepsy through medication where plaintiff had demonstrated an unreliability in taking the prescribed medication). We further conclude that the agency appropriately accommodated appellant's bipolar disorder by reassigning him to the Intelligence Research Specialist position which, at the time of the reassignment, had the same grade-level career ladder promotion potential as the Criminal Investigator position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03840005 (September 4, 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, Special Panel No. 1 (February 27, 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we advise the agency that since our finding that appellant was not a qualified person with a disability for the Criminal Investigator position is based on appellant's failure to take the prescribed medication and lithium blood-level tests, the finding does not foreclose other individuals with a bipolar disorder from holding Criminal Investigator positions. The agency must make an individual assessment of each individual's ability to perform the essential functions of the Criminal Investigator position without endangering the health and safety of himself or others.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission now consistently takes the position that "an essential element of a Special Agent position requires that Special Agents are at all times either engaged in, or are able and prepared to engage in, aggressive law enforcement activities." <span class="Italic">Sacco v. Attorney General</span>, 03A10104 (2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Baker v. Attorney General</span>, 01972309 (2001)).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dugger v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01922457 (1992), the Commission found that an agency could, without any individual inquiry, ban the employment of insulin-dependent employees from positions such as that of criminal investigator. Though never specifically overruled, <span class="Italic">Dugger</span> has been superseded by a plethora of cases requiring an individualized analysis of the complainant's condition and the risk involved. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Dugger</span> found::</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he issue then becomes whether appellant could conceivably be placed in a situation where he would be unable to engage in the diabetes-related activities necessary to avert hypoglycemia, and to the point where its attendant and encroaching symptoms would impair his ability to discharge his duties such that he and those agents depending upon him would be placed in life-threatening situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Commission notes in appellant's favor that the equipment needed to keep appellant's diabetic condition under control is extremely portable and can be carried in the pockets of appellant's jacket and trousers, that the insulin pen looked like an ordinary writing instrument and so could disguise the fact that he needed to take injections of insulin, and that a pen light sufficed for those times when he had to take a blood test in poor or no light. Furthermore, if food was not available when the blood test showed that his blood glucose was low, he could take six glucose tablets which he always carried with him as a substitute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As negative factors in appellant's diabetes-related activities, the Commission notes that appellant's doctor stated that appellant was required to take insulin at least once daily, no matter what and that during surveillance activities, appellant should take 5-10 minutes every three to six hours to check his blood glucose and, if appropriate, take some food or sugar at that time. Then, too, the agency Diabetologist emphasized that appellant's employment would put him in a position of unacceptable danger owing to the long, unpredictable, and hazardous <span id="Page_1302"></span>nature of the duty, the necessity for covert surveillance, and prolonged strenuous bouts of physical activity, all in situations where his diabetes may not be disclosed and the possibility of a lack of food existed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission determines that there conceivably might be situations where appellant might have to keep suspects under surveillance for periods up to a week or more, including mobile, high-speed pursuits of such suspects and frequent changes of locale, which could prevent appellant not only from eating meals but from replenishing his portable supply of glucose tablets, insulin, and blood-testing paraphernalia as well. Living as an undercover agent could also bring about the same potentially fatal separation from food and medicine, as appellant tried to avoid police surveillance and pursuit to maintain his cover. In this regard we note that appellant's own doctor stated that appellant had to have an insulin injection at least once daily, no matter what. Furthermore, he testified that during surveillance activities, appellant should take 5-10 minutes every three to six hours to check his blood glucose and, if appropriate, take some food or sugar at that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we note that appellant has successfully monitored and controlled his diabetic condition under hazardous conditions to date as a Criminal Investigator for another departmental agency, we note that such hazardous conditions lasted only a few days at most, during which time appellant was always able to accomplish his daily diabetes-related tasks. They thus did not test appellant's ability to endure hazardous conditions over an extended period of time without daily injections of insulin, or ingestion of food or glucose tablets, or with being unable to test blood sugar levels every three to six hours. While we do not find it probable that appellant would be in a situation where he could not replenish his portable supplies of diabetes-related paraphernalia every few days or so to accomplish the above tasks, nevertheless, such a situation could conceivably arise, and arise very suddenly, given the unpredictable surveillance and undercover demands placed on a Criminal Investigator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the absence of daily insulin injections or lack of meals or glucose tablets could then quickly bring on a hypoglycemia attack. This in turn could critically impair appellant's ability to function, thus potentially placing his colleagues as well as himself in a life-threatening situation, given the criminal class of persons with whom he would necessarily be involved as an Investigator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we take judicial cognizance of a U.S. District Court decision upholding the right of another--federal agency to exclude all insulin dependent diabetics from similar special agent or investigative specialist positions. The Court ruled that such a blanket exclusion did not violate Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, owing to the risk, although the likelihood may be small, of suffering a severe hypoglycemic occurrence. The Court found this risk unacceptable in view of the danger of serious harm to such agents or specialists, their co-workers, and uninvolved third parties, as well as potentially serious harm to and disruption of agency operations, should such a hypoglycemic reaction occur. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Meese</span>, 47 FEP Cases 828, 841 (E.D. Pa., 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that appellant has failed to establish by the necessary preponderance of the evidence that he was discriminated against on the basis of physical handicap (diabetes mellitus), or that the agency's use of OPM-approved medical standards restricting the employment of diabetics on the basis of unacceptable risk rather than following the guidance of FPM-339, which permits the employment of diabetics in hazardous positions on a case-by-case basis, was discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A10035 (2003), the Commission found that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it disqualified an applicant with monocular vision from the position of Customs Inspector. The Commission found that the agency had not conducted an individualized inquiry to determine if the complainant's visual limitations posed a direct threat to himself or others. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Spencer</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because it is clear that the agency did not hire complainant because of his disability, we do not apply the indirect evidence method of proof used by the AJ, but rather proceed to the issue of whether the agency has satisfied its burden of proof to establish that its disparate treatment of complainant based on his disability was justified by a direct threat to safety<span class="Italic">. Van Parys v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01991100 (Aug. 22, 2001). A direct threat is a significant risk of substantial harm which cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(r). If an individual poses a direct threat as a result of a disability, the employer must determine whether a reasonable accommodation would either eliminate the risk or reduce it to an acceptable level. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(r) App. If no accommodation exists that would either eliminate or reduce the risk, the employer may refuse to hire an applicant<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The determination that an individual poses a direct threat must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to perform safely the functions of the job, considering a reasonable medical judgment relying on the most current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's expert on human performance and job task analysis for the development of medical standards testified that the Final Report of the agency's medical guidelines for Customs Inspectors which she prepared was developed to look at the "level of severity of each disease [condition] that allow[ed] for safe job performance." HT at 479-80, 485, 488. However, no evidence showed how complainant's apparent disability and compensations were assessed against the job tasks, nor even that complainant was notified that his lack of a full visual field and stereopsis were disqualifiers. Indeed, as seen above, the only explanation for complainant's rejection was contained in the February 7, 1997 letter which recited complainant's lack of distance vision as a disqualifier. Complainant adequately responded to this, but was given no opportunity to respond to the agency's assessment of his depth perception and peripheral vision. Moreover, the agency made no attempt to determine if a reasonable accommodation would either eliminate the perceived risk or reduce it to an acceptable level. While the agency formed some conclusions about complainant's capabilities from studies of monocular individuals, nowhere did the agency individually assess complainant's vision deficiencies and compensations to determine if his deficiencies posed the same risks as found in the studies. Indeed, the agency seems to have given little if any weight to complainant's history of safe, and even exemplary, performance in jobs involving duties and risks similar to those characteristic of the Customs Inspector position for which he applied<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. 1630.2(r) (relevant evidence of whether an individual with a disability poses a direct threat may include evidence of the individual's experience in previous similar positions).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the position involves public health and safety that fact does not excuse the agency from conducting the individualized analysis necessary to determine whether the individual is a direct threat to himself or someone else. For example, in <span class="Italic">Elias v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120070808 (2009), the Commission found that the agency was justified in disqualifying the complainant for an immigration inspector position where an individualized assessment of the complainant's diabetic condition established he did not have the condition adequately under control. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Elias</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most significantly, the record reveals complainant suffered from blurry vision when his sugar became elevated, and he was also suffering from some of diabetes more advanced problems, including diabetic retinopathy and microalbuminuria. Complainant's own medical practitioner, when responding to the agency's request for more information, confirmed that complainant had poor control of his diabetes, and that he was suffering from changes in kidney function. The record also reveals complainant had difficulty complying with his medication regimen, as well as his physician's guidance regarding diet and exercise during the three-year period prior to his application. These factors did not instill confidence in the medical review team that complainant's situation would improve.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's application was reviewed by a contract physician as well as two Reviewing Medical Officers of Federal Occupational Health, U.S. Public Health Service. These individuals reviewed the essential functions and the physical demands of the position, which include the ability to defend oneself from attack and irregular work hours, and found that complainant would not have predictable access to breaks for food or to use the restroom. This would make him more susceptible to fluctuating sugar levels, which could impair his judgment and cause vision disturbances. Indeed, complainant had already experienced vision problems while driving. Accordingly, we find that the AJ's decision finding the agency satisfied its burden to establish direct threat is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case can be distinguished from <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03948 (July 30, 2003), where we found the agency failed to show that complainant's diabetes constitutes a direct threat to himself or others in the position of Special Agent. In <span class="Italic">Harrison,</span> we found the agency failed to conduct an individualized assessment because it failed to take into consideration complainant's past work history, and prior medical history. Here, the agency looked at both as part of its assessment. Complainant's medical practitioner from the VA corroborated the agency's medical findings. Furthermore, there was no evidence that complainant, who would be required to carry a handgun in the Immigration Inspector position, had ever worked with a handgun in any prior security position such that his abilities could be assessed. The individual in the <span class="Italic">Harrison</span> case had not had complications from his diabetes, which had been controlled. As explained above, this is not the case for complainant. Furthermore, in this case there is significant evidence that the agency has medically qualified over 100 suspected diabetics for the Immigration Inspector position. Finally, we note that complainant has not requested nor identified any accommodation which would reduce the threat to himself or others and enable him to perform the essential functions of his job.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example is provided by <span class="Italic">Atkins v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120073522 (2010), where the agency gave the complainant, who was an insulin-dependent diabetic, waivers from the medical standards required by the job conditioned upon exercise, diet and better control of his blood sugar levels. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Atkins</span>, described at length the process by which the <span id="Page_1303"></span>agency made an individualized assessment of the complainant's condition and the possible risk:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's finding that the Agency met its burden under the direct threat analysis requirement. The Program Manager of the Medical Review Board (MRB) and MSP testified that, in a situation where a Park Ranger is found not to meet a particular medical standard they are immediately given an option to appeal. Hr'g Tr., at Page 128, 131. The Program Manager makes an initial decision as to whether or not the medical standard which was not met can be waived. Hr'g Tr., at Page 131. In situations where additional information is needed, as was necessary in Complainant's case, the case will be referred to the MRB for a full review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The employee will have an opportunity to appeal there, and a Medical Review Officer (MRO) will make the initial decision regarding the waiver instead. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the MRO notified the Program Manager that Complaint did not meet the applicable medical standard and explained the specific reasons why. Hr'g Tr., at Page 132. As a result of fluctuations in his blood sugar levels, the MRO informed the Program Manager that Complainant was subject to sudden incapacitation, poor decisionmaking, and dizzy spells. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In a critical time-sensitive and life threatening situation, Complainant's medical condition in its unstable state could mean a loss of the employee's life, another employee's or park visitor's life. Hr'g Tr., at Page 138. The record reflects that Complainant was given an opportunity to provide additional information to the MRO to aide in her decision making. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Special Agent in Charge testified that if the employee is still found to fail to meet the applicable requirement, the employee can appeal to the MRB. The purpose of review from this board is to permit the employee with an opportunity to present information on how they have been able to perform in the position at issue. Hr'g Tr., at Page 133. We find this is the most critical piece of the Agency's direct-threat analysis. It is at this point that the Agency engages in an individualized examination of whether the particular employee can safely perform in the position. At this phase in the process the Agency also has an opportunity to present information used to conduct a risk-management analysis, in order to determine if risks outweigh employees work history, or if a failure to meet the standard is of such a nature the Agency no longer feels it should take the risk. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant appeared before the MRB once and was granted a total of two waivers of the medical standard, over a period of three years, before his law enforcement commission was permanently revoked. Hr'g Tr., at Page 135. The record reflects that the MRB granted the first waiver because it determined that Complainant was sincere in his assertion that he would comply with the conditions set forth in a waiver in an attempt to stabilize his medical condition. Hr'g Tr., at Page 138. The MRB also gave tremendous consideration to the fact that Complainant has never suffered from any of the possible side effects of his unstable condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The conditions of Complainant's waiver included: (1) participation in an active exercise program, to be monitored by his supervisor; (2) weight loss; (3) conversion from eyeglasses to soft contact lenses; and (4) production of logs regarding blood sugar or Hemoglobin A1c test results. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The stipulations were placed on Complainant with his full agreement in the hope that these changes would have the effect of stabilizing his condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was granted the second waiver because he had shown some compliance with the restrictions placed on him in 2002 under the first waiver. Upon his second review in 2005, three years later, Complainant was placed on light duty. The record reflects that the evidence established that Complainant had failed to comply with the stipulations of his waiver as his blood sugar levels were again wildly fluctuating. Hr'g Tr., at page 141. This evidence was obtained directly from Complainant, upon request, in the form of HA1C test results. Hr'g Tr., at page 142.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency did explore Complainant's unique abilities as they pertained to the Park Ranger position, and in fact, waived the medical standard with restrictions in an effort to assist Complainant in stabilizing his medical condition. The Agency took these measures prior to permanently revoking Complainant's law enforcement commission and even before placing him on light duty. <span class="Italic">See</span> Hr'g Tr., at Page 141. Complainant was given the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with the waiver conditions and he failed to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> Hr'g Tr., at Page 141-42. We find that the Agency successfully demonstrated that Complainant's condition posed a significant risk of a high probability of harm through an individualized assessment that considered the required factors pursuant to and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). Further, we find that the Agency gave Complainant the opportunity to fulfill his duties as a Park Ranger with law enforcement authority with reasonable accommodations in the form of a waiver with restrictions, with which he failed to comply.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the employee worked in a nuclear power plant, the Commission found that the agency was justified in removing the employee from the workplace and conducting a fitness-for-duty examination based on his disruptive and threatening behavior at staff meetings. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120121877 (2014), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reveals that the Agency had a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that Complainant may not be able to safely perform the essential functions of his job or that he posed a direct threat. Specifically, many individuals stated that Complainant's behavior and attitude abruptly changed in the workplace, which made his supervisors concerned for his ability to safely perform his job. Complainant became insubordinate, disruptive, and threatening with his supervisors and during staff meetings, and his behavior towards his coworker was threatening and harassing when he allegedly locked her in his office and made sexually crude comments. Agency policy requires a manager to remove an employee from the nuclear environment if an employee is suspected of a behavioral issue. Agency policy also requires that the employee can only be returned to work after he or she has been determined to be fit to "safely and competently" perform his or her duties. The specific facts of this case support the Agency removing Complainant from the workplace and having him perform a fitness for duty evaluation to determine whether a medical condition made Complainant unable to perform the essential functions of his job or whether he posed a direct threat to himself or others.</p>
<p class="noindent">The duty to accommodate extends to applicants for employment and, as a result, an agency may have to provide for reasonable accommodation during the application process. In reversing a grant of summary judgment for the agency in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120110248 (2015), the Commission found there was a genuine dispute of fact over the agency's refusal to allow an agent applicant to use his hearing aid during the audio test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may require, as a qualification standard, that an individual not pose a direct threat. A "direct threat" is defined as "a significant risk of substantial harm" which cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The Agency has the burden of proof regarding whether there is a significant risk of substantial harm. <span class="Italic">See Massingill v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01964890 (July 14, 2000). A determination as to whether an individual poses such a risk cannot be based on an employer's subjective evaluation or, except in cases of the most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. <span class="Italic">See Selix v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000). Rather, after identifying the risk, the employer must conduct an individualized assessment that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). This assessment must be based on objective evidence, not subjective perceptions, irrational fears, patronizing attitudes or stereotypes about the nature or effect of a particular disability or of disability generally. Relevant evidence may include input from the individual with a disability, his work history or experiences in previous positions, and opinions of medical doctors who have expertise in the particular disability or direct knowledge of the individual with the disability. If it is determined that an individual does pose a direct threat because of a disability, the employer must determine whether a reasonable accommodation would eliminate the risk of harm or reduce it to an acceptable level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that Complainant posed a direct threat due to his hearing loss, and thus the Agency properly restricted his law enforcement duty. The Agency stated that a bulk of the Special Agent's time is spent in the field investigating subjects, executing warrants, and performing other law enforcement duties in potentially dangerous environments. The Agency stated that a Special Agent's hearing ability, and in particular the ability to localize sounds, is essential to his ability to carry out his law enforcement duties without endangering himself, his fellow Special Agents, and/or the public.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency must now establish that a reasonable accommodation will not eliminate the risk of harm or reduce it to an acceptable level. Complainant requested that he be allowed to wear a hearing aid during the audiogram and functional hearing tests to meet the hearing requirement. Complainant provided evidence that showed that he was able to pass an audiogram similar to the Agency's examination with the assistance of a hearing aid. Additionally, the Agency allows Special Agents to wear hearing aids in the field.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that a hearing aid cannot be given as a reasonable accommodation. Specifically, the Agency stated that Special Agents must meet the hearing requirement without a hearing aid because hearing aids may malfunction, break, or become dislodged in a law enforcement scenario. The Agency also asserted that hearing aids are inappropriate because they cause "localization confusion."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals that there is evidence that may undermine the Agency's argument that hearing aids are not acceptable because they may break or become dislodged during a law enforcement scenario. Specifically, the record establishes that the Agency allows individuals with vision impairments to use glasses as a mitigating measure during <span id="Page_1304"></span>the vision portion of the medical examination, and also allows Special Agents to wear glasses while out in the field. Similar to hearing aids, glasses could also break or become dislodged while a Special Agent is in a law enforcement scenario. Evidence in the record establishes that the Agency acknowledged the conflicting vision and hearing policies, but was not able to come to a decision that would rectify the conflict.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that he has been able to adjust to any issues with localization of sound when he is wearing a hearing aid, and localization confusion is not an issue for him. Specifically, Complainant stated that all he has to do is turn his head to localize a sound. Further, Complainant inquired to the Agency about a particular type of hearing aid called a "lyric device" as a reasonable accommodation when he takes the hearing test and while he is working in the field as a Special Agent. The lyric device is implanted in the ear canal and the individual can shower, sleep, and exercise with the device without fear of it becoming dislodged. Additionally, because the lyric device is inserted so far down the ear canal, hearing is supposed to sound more natural and provides less distortion, better directionality, better high frequency gain, and less occlusion.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission remanded the case for hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere fact that the employee's position involves some aspect of public safety, however, does not mean that it is inherently dangerous. For example, in <span class="Italic">Evey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01970918 (2000), the Commission rejected the agency's contention that a nurse was a direct threat to patient safety because of a hearing problem. The Commission's analysis in <span class="Italic">Evey</span> focused on the inability of the agency to show a single instance of jeopardizing patient safety:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Commission finds that the agency has not demonstrated that allowing the complainant to remain in her position constituted a direct threat. Initially, it is not apparent to the Commission that RO 1 and RO 2 had sufficient justification for concluding that the complainant constituted a safety hazard and ordering the FFDE. Not only had the complainant been performing successfully in her position, but neither individual was able to identify a single instance when she did not respond appropriately in an emergency situation and/or placed a patient at risk. Instead, it is apparent that the impetus for the FFDE was unsupported fears rather than actual facts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even more troubling, however, are the agency's actions in the aftermath of the FFDE. Physician A's findings were inconclusive on whether the complainant constituted a risk, let alone a substantial risk. In this regard, although RO 1 and RO 2 were concerned that the complainant's hearing loss would prevent her from responding to emergencies, Physician A found that she "hears alarms, buzzers, phone and most other ward noises" and that her hearing loss could be accommodated "with personnel talking a little louder and fac[ing] her." 4 Furthermore, although concerns were expressed that the complainant's walking limitations would create similar risks, the report does not support RO 3's conclusion that the complainant had "extreme difficulty walking." When the Board initially considered Physician A's findings, it did not conclude that the complainant constituted a substantial risk. Instead, it merely recommended that the complainant be required to lose 32 pounds within a year and that she become certified in CPR within three months. Although the Board subsequently changed its opinion and found that the complainant constituted a hazard, the Commission questions the validity of that conclusion. Not only did the head of the Board testify that he felt pressured to change his prior recommendation, but he also testified that the Board never actually discussed whether allowing the complainant to remain in her position constituted a risk. The Commission is cognizant that the one safety hazard cited by the agency for which there is support is the complainant's inability to become certified in CPR. It is apparent from the record, however, that nurses who are unable to get certified are allowed to continue in their positions until such time as they can successfully perform the demonstration. What that indicates is that nurses who do not receive their CPR certification are not considered direct threats. Therefore, the Commission concludes that it was the complainant's other perceived problems that are responsible for the conclusion that she constituted a direct threat.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds insufficient evidence to support the agency's conclusion that allowing the complainant to remain in her position constituted a direct threat. For that reason, and because the complainant has established that she could perform the essential functions of her position, we find that she is a "qualified individual with a disability."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the third step of the analysis requires the complainant to demonstrate that she was removed from her position and that there is a causal connection between the removal and her disability. The complainant has clearly made such a showing, to the extent her removal was specifically premised on concerns related to her disabilities. Accordingly, because the complainant has satisfied all three elements, we find she has established that the agency discriminated against her based on disability when it removed her from her position.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant's disabling condition prohibits her from lifting more than 15 pounds or using more than minimum force in pushing, it would be a undue burden on the agency to accommodate that condition for a position that might place the complainant in emergency situations. <span class="Italic">Norvanis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01923183 (1992). In that case, the Commission upheld the agency's decision to deny the complainant a postal inspector position since there was no reasonable accommodation the agency could provide that would permit the complainant to perform the essential functions of the position. The Commission determined that it was necessary for the agency to assign postal inspectors to emergency situations requiring the use of physical force and that it would be an undue hardship on the agency's operations to waive the requirement.</p>
