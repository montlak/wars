<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-86c"><span class="space">2.</span> Hospitals/Veterans Affairs</h3>
<p class="noindent">One agency where there is a conflict between the agency's responsibility to provide a harassment-free workplace, even if the harassment is engaged in by third parties, and the agency's responsibility to service its clientele is the Department of Veterans Affairs. "[A]gencies running healthcare facilities have an obligation to protect their employees from discrimination and harassment by patients and their visitors." <span class="Italic">Caroline B. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020000978 (2021).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Baker v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120071840 (2007), the Commission found that the complainant stated an actionable claim of hostile environment harassment where she alleged that management would not enforce rules requiring that male patients not sleep in the nude or view pornographic material. The complainant alleged that agency management was encouraging sexual harassment of female nurses by not enforcing the rules.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on <span class="Italic">Baker in Caroline B. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2020000978 (2021), the Commission held the agency liable for the harassment of a patient and his family against the complainant nurse. Caroline B. (black) alleged that the patient resident and his family made racially charged statements to her like "[my husband] is white and he comes first [regarding daily care]," "I can't wait for Trump to take office and get rid of all of y'all," and "all of y'all are liars." The family also referred to the complainant as "'the help'" or "'house staff,'" an allusion to slavery terminology in the United States." The complainant notified management of the harassing behavior on several occasions, but little was done to stop the harassment. Finding the agency liable, the Commission <span id="Page_913"></span>emphasized that agency healthcare facilities have an obligation to protect their employees from discrimination by patients and visitors:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e conclude that the existing evidence of record, even without a hearing, shows that judgment in favor of the Agency was inappropriate. The evidence of record is sufficient to establish that Complainant repeatedly reported to management that she was subjected to race-based harassment by R1's family members over a period of months, and further shows that management's responses were inherently ineffective. The AJ erred by determining that the conduct directed at Complainant was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to establish harassment in violation of Title VII and overlooked the extent of the Agency's responsibility to protect its employees from non-employee harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency must take reasonable care to protect its employees from discriminatory harassment. EEOC's <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> (June 18, 1999), Part V.C., Section 1 ("Policy and Complaint Procedure"). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.11(e), an agency (or its agents or supervisory employees) may be held liable for the acts of non-employees, it the agency "knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action." Commission precedent supports that an agency's obligation to take appropriate and immediate corrective action in response to an allegation of non-employee harassment is not diminished when the complainant's job duties necessarily involve more interaction with non-employees, allowing for increased potential for non-employee harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An example that has been discussed extensively is employer liability for sexual harassment by inmates toward the staff in prison facilities. <span class="Italic">See Larae S. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC DOC 0120143209 (Mar. 9, 2017) <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081287 (Apr. 23, 2009), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 0520090501 (Aug. 17, 2009) (discussing <span class="Italic">Freitag v. Ayers</span>, 468 F.3d 535 (9th Cir. 2006)). Likewise, this obligation does not diminish when the non-employees at issue are customers, regardless of the underlying dynamic of reliance between employer and customer. This holds true, even where the employee's job responsibilities include treating customers with deference. <span class="Italic">See Silas T. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019003996 (May 24, 2021) (agency liable for harassment where management told the complainant, a server at a restaurant, that there was no basis for removing a customer who, on multiple occasions, harassed him during his shift, threatened him and called him a homophobic slur, because the harasser "was a paying customer"), <span class="Italic">citing Pinter v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01985163 (July 9, 1999) (the agency erred in ruling that the complainant failed to state a claim because the alleged harasser was "merely a patron" of appellant's work facility), <span class="Italic">citing Cf. Folkerson v. Circus Enterprises, Inc</span>., 107 F.3d 754 (9th Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Las Vegas Hilton Corp</span>., 841 F. Supp. 1024, 1028 (D. Nev. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significant to this case, the Commission has previously recognized that agencies running healthcare facilities have an obligation to protect their employees from discrimination and harassment by patients and their visitors. In <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120071840 (July 20, 2007), we determined that a female nurse alleging that the agency failed to act on her repeated complaints that male residents at the facility where she worked regularly exposed themselves to her and watched pornographic videos within her view, stated a claim of harassment. The Commission rejected the agency's reasoning that because the complainant was a "Licensed Practical Nurse and makes bed checks or rounds between 12 midnight and 1:00 A.M. From the standpoint of a reasonable person and taking into account the daily duties of [the complainant] including the context in each of [the complainant's] claim[s], it would be reasonable to assume that these events would not be rendered as harassment and hostile work environment incidents." <span class="Italic">See also, Alonso T. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151355 (Aug. 24, 2017), <span class="Italic">Raney v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01976936 (Feb. 29, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that harassment based on an individual's race is actionable. To prove her harassment claim, Complainant must establish that she was subjected to conduct that was so severe or so pervasive that a "reasonable person" in her position would have found the conduct to be objectively hostile or abusive. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Sys. Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Mar. 8, 1994). Complainant must also prove that the conduct was taken because of her race. Only if Complainant establishes both of those elements--hostility and motive--will the question of Agency liability present itself. <span class="Italic">See Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice 915.002 (Jun. 18, 1999), <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Sys. Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Mar. 8, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence of record is sufficient to establishes that R1's family members repeatedly made racially charged and/or offensive comments to Complainant. Moreover, Complainant, S1 and S2, all indicate, through their testimony, that R1's family members exhibited a heightened expectation of deference from Complainant. Complainant also provided many examples where S1 and S2 appeared to tolerate, and even reinforce, R1's family members' expectation of significant deferential treatment from her to an extent that it sometimes undermined her ability to effectively do her job. For example, when RW asked Complainant why she did not leave her cart to the right side of R1's door, and Complainant explained that the location of the cart was not relevant, but asked RW if there was anything she needed. RW left and complained to S1, who immediately instructed Complainant to be careful how she spoke with patients' families. Complainant testified that S1's response both encouraged RW's harassing behavior and had the effect of undermining Complainant professionally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S2 conceded that she and Complainant had multiple conversations about R1's family members, particularly RW, including RW reference to her as "house staff." S2 also stated that she numerous complaints from other staff regarding RW's "aggressive" behavior and manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account all the evidence of record, we conclude that, as discussed in more detail earlier in this decision, RW's conduct towards Complainant and management's deference to it was sufficient to create a hostile work environment for Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To avoid liability for a hostile work environment/harassment arising from the conduct of a non-employee, an agency can raise an affirmative defense by offering evidence that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). An appropriate remedial action will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case, such as the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps. <span class="Italic">See Larae S. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC DOC 0120143209 (Mar. 9, 2017), <span class="Italic">citing Complainant v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 9, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies have successfully established that they took "immediate and appropriate corrective action" after a complainant reported non-employee harassment by, among other things, submitting evidence of the remedial actions taken and the effectiveness of those actions. <span class="Italic">See Elenore F. v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120171156 (July 17, 2018) (agency not liable for sexual harassment after the complainant reported that a male stranger inappropriately touched and kissed her while she was on her route, because evidence supported that management responded by immediately encouraging her to call the police, initiating OIG and supervisory investigations, reassigning her to another route, then to a call center position, and following the remedial actions, it is undisputed that no further harassing incidents occurred). In <span class="Italic">Larae S</span>., the Agency established that it was not liable for harassment where the complainant, a prison guard, was subjected to sexually aggressive acts by inmates on numerous occasions, because the agency provided documentation that it took numerous and thorough corrective actions once it was on notice of the harassment. Among other things, the agency installed physical barriers to shield workers from inmates acting inappropriately or throwing projectiles, imposed disciplinary actions or withheld yard privileges as a consequence for harassing behavior, moved repeat offenders to designated cells with window covers, and collaborated with the U.S. Attorney's Office to prosecute incidents of sexual aggression by inmates. Significantly, the agency in <span class="Italic">Larae S</span>. empowered staff to file incident reports, which it continued to process, and led to tangible consequences for inmate harassers, decreasing the instances of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An example of a health facility employer avoiding liability for harassment by a non-employee can be found in <span class="Italic">Alonso T. v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, where a nursing assistant was subjected to harassment by a patient's wife ("PW"). EEOC Appeal No. 0120151355 (Aug. 24, 2017). As the complainant passed PW in the hallway, PW directed a racially charged epitaph at him. He immediately notified the charge nurse, who in turn notified the Nurse Manager. Both nurses supported the complainant when he asserted that he would no longer enter that patient's room, and they both agreed that he should not have to work near the patient's family when they visited. (The complainant specified that he did not want to be transferred). The Nurse Manager spoke with PW shortly after the incident, notifying her that her comment toward the complainant was unacceptable and inappropriate, and if PW acted inappropriately toward staff again, the Nurse Manager would call the police. PW claimed she had not acted inappropriately but the complainant was in the way while staff members were trying to lift the patient out of his wheelchair and were doing it wrong. The Nurse Manager reiterated that PW was not to make inappropriate comments to staff again.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The remedial actions described in <span class="Italic">Elenore F.,</span> <span class="Italic">Larae S</span>., and <span class="Italic">Alonso T</span>., all involved separating the complainant and the harasser to the extent practicable, and placing the harassers on notice (with the exception of Elenore F. where this was not possible) that they would be subject to a tangible consequence should the harassment continue. In each case, <span id="Page_914"></span>the complainant had access to effective reporting mechanisms to seek resolution after experiencing non-employee harassment. The evidence supported that the complainants' act of reporting the harassment led directly to immediate and appropriate action by the agencies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The immediate and appropriate corrective actions identified in <span class="Italic">Elenore F</span>., <span class="Italic">Larae S</span>., and <span class="Italic">Alonso T.,</span> were demonstrably effective. Following the agencies' remedial action, the harassment either ceased (<span class="Italic">Elenore F</span>. and <span class="Italic">Alonso T</span>.) or decreased dramatically with demonstrated continued efforts by the agency (<span class="Italic">Larae S</span>.). Conversely, instances where an agency takes remedial action, but the harassment reoccurs, are considered evidence of the agency's failure to take appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Lemons v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081287 (Apr. 23, 2009) (harassment escalated after the agency took remedial action) <span class="Italic">citing Logsdon v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40120 (Feb. 28, 2006) (taking only some remedial action does not absolve the agency of liability where that action is ineffective).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Simply initiating corrective action or taking remedial action that only has a temporary or partial impact on the alleged harassment is insufficient to establish an affirmative defense of immediate appropriate corrective action. In <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Department of Justice</span>, the Commission determined that the agency's remedial action of instructing an inmate that the complainant repeatedly reported for harassment, "not to do it again," then returning him to the complainant's unit was not only ineffective, but made the complainant more vulnerable to harassment. <span class="Italic">See also, Trevor H. v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720140023, 2014 (July 24, 2014) (affirming finding of hostile work environment based on sexual orientation, where the AJ noted that the Agency failed to take strong action to protect its employees, but rather, "did nothing more than to tell both employees to behave professionally). Likewise, the Commission has long considered the duration of an agency's failure to respond once they are placed on notice of harassment when determining that an agency failed to take appropriate action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Trey M. v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120180781 (July 23, 2019) (agency liable for harassment where it failed to take immediate and appropriate action, when, for nearly a year, the complainant reported ongoing harassment by a coworker ("C1") and the coworker's non-employee boyfriend, while on the job, and the agency erroneously told the complainant that the matter was "personal," refused to take any action other than providing C1 with information about the employee assistance program, then the agency assigned C1 to work Complainant's route, then subjected Complainant to threats of relocation, and transfer when she reported continuing harassment), <span class="Italic">see also, Silas</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record includes documentation that S1 and S2 took statements from staff following the June 28, 2017 "educated fool" incident and the August 6, 2017 incident, but there is no other evidence that S1, S2 or the Nursing Manager took similar action in response to the ongoing harassment Complainant contends occurred and was reported between October 2016 and August 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although S1 and S2 both state that they spoke individually with RW, and at "family meetings," there are no contemporaneous notes about what was discussed, nor did they notify Complainant of any steps they were taking to end the alleged harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In September 2017, S2, having received additional concerns from other staff regarding RW, organized a meeting with RW and several other Agency officials. The date of the meeting and the names of the additional participants were not included in the record, nor are there any meeting notes. According to S2, the meeting was productive and focused on how "the entire staff would work with [RW] and how [RW] could work with the staff in a collaborative environment." This is insufficient to establish an affirmative defense of "immediate and appropriate corrective action."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 21, 2017, in response to an information request from an EEO counselor, S2 submitted an email stating that the Agency took the following actions "to address [Complainant's] concerns":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;S1 addressed Complainant's concern through verbal conversations as they were presented to her.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Prior to these conversations with Complainant, she would meet with or call [RW] regarding the allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Around June 2017, the CLC management team (Acting Nurse Managers, ANE and Nurse Educator) began making more frequent rounds (off tours, weekends and holidays) to monitor resident/family and staff interactions. During these rounds, conversations were held with staff regarding any concerns including family conflicts.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;[S2] was also included in the rounding.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Staff meetings and daily huddles are in place to address any family concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;The hospital's Customer Service department was contacted to assist in staff training and family concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">7.&#x2003;A meeting was held with [RW], [S1], nursing staff representative, [S2], psychologist and customer service representative to discuss concerns from both R1's wife and nursing (tone and awareness of conversations, unit operations and how care is provided).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's finding that "under the circumstances, the foregoing actions were really all the Agency could do to address the situation" is inconsistent with the Commission's prior decisions addressing non-employee harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For instance, the record is devoid of any evidence that management made any effort to separate Complainant from her harasser to the extent possible, or to establish and implement consequences for repeated harassing conduct by patients and their family members toward staff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's proffered evidence also does not show that the action it took was "immediate." The only date listed regarding the Agency's remedial action is "around June 2017." Complainant testifies that she first reported harassment by R1's family members to S2 in October 2016, and that she continued emailing S2 about additional incidents of harassment. S1 indicates that on multiple occasions, Complainant told her that she believed R1's family members were harassing her based on her race, which, along with Complainant's testimony, indicates that S1 was likely aware of the alleged harassment months before June 2017. S2's assertion that she was only aware of the June 2017 incident of harassment, which conflicts with Complainant's account, potentially conflicts with S1 and S2's testimony about holding family conferences with RW.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the evidence does not support that the Agency's corrective actions were "appropriate." The remedial actions S2 listed more likely to describe actions to appease the "high maintenance" family member rather than protecting Complainant from continued harassment. Significantly, Complainant was never included in these efforts or even aware of them. The record is devoid of agendas, meeting notes, calendar invites, action plans, or other documentation to commemorate that these meetings took place, their duration, and frequency. The record also lacks statements from any of the attendees other than S1 and S2, the responding management officials. Further, the cited corrective actions of daily staff meetings, additional rounds, and more conversations with staff about "family concerns" were demonstrably ineffective because Complainant again reported harassment by R1's family members to management in July 2017 and experienced harassment during the August 6, 2017 incident, when R1's daughter refused to stop recording her and other staff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, and as with the previously discussed examples of agency liability for non-employee harassment, management failed to apply the Agency's own policies in response to reports of non-employee harassment. The Agency's own Anti-Harassment Policy states that a harasser may be a "non-employee," and that harassment can include, among other things, "slurs, epithets or name calling intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs that interfere with performance." Medical Center Memorandum, Office of the Director 00-51 Anti-Harassment Policy, P. 2(a), (e) (Feb. 26, 2015) ("Anti-Harassment Policy"). The Agency emphasizes: "employees need to report harassment at an early stage to prevent its escalation," and "unwelcome harassing conduct will not be tolerated." Anti-Harassment Policy, PP. 2(f), 3 (emphasis original). This selective enforcement of Agency policy supports Complainant's assertion that management fostered a culture of tolerance with respect to harassment by a patient's family members, and constitutes evidence that Management contributed to the harassment Complainant experienced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that Complainant has established that she was subjected to discriminatory racial harassment in violation of Title VII that was ineffectively addressed by Agency management, resulting in Agency liability for its failure to protect Complainant from the harassment.</p>
