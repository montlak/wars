<h3 class="h3" id="sec18-54"><span class="space">H.</span> PRESELECTION</h3>
<p class="noindent">A demonstration that the successful promotional candidate was preselected for the position is not a demonstration of pretext even where the appellant proves that the promotion position was newly created especially for the selectee. <span class="Italic">See Wallace v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01830345, 1278 (1985). The relevant issue is not one of preselection, but whether the preselection was motivated by reasons proscribed by Title VII. However, where multiple efforts are exercised to place the preselected candidate in a higher grade position and similar efforts are not made for an equally qualified Hispanic candidate, this may be sufficient evidence of a discriminatory motive in the preselection<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Army</span>, 01863004 (1987) (agency admitted that the successful candidate was preselected and that the complainant was not given the same opportunity as white candidates to review the position description prior to the interview); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Department of Army</span>, 01790021 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">"Evidence of preselection operates to discredit the employer's proffered explanation for its employment decision. <span class="Italic">Goostree v. State of Tennessee</span>, 796 F.2d 854, 861 (6th Cir. 1986). However, preselection does not violate Title VII when such preselection is based on the qualifications of the preselected party and not on some basis prohibited by Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>" <span class="Italic">Marvin v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01891677 (1989)<span class="Italic">; see also</span> <span class="Italic">Manual K. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120130636 (2015) ("To the extent that Complainant believes that the selectee was chosen because of his friendship with management, the panel members, and/or the SO, we note that pre-selection, in and of itself, does not establish pretext."); <span class="Italic">Calabrese v. Secretary of Education</span>, 01995597 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wadley v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01892606 (1989), the agency took the interesting tact of admitting that it violated merit promotions principles and engaged in preselection, but it argued that preselection was not discrimination. Though agreeing with the agency's statement of the law, the Commission found that sufficient additional evidence in the record existed to demonstrate that the preselection was a mask for discrimination. In large part, the Commission found that the evidence refuted the agency's assertion that it preselected the chosen candidate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence of a discriminatory environment, combined with manipulation of the selection process to reach a preordained result, can be sufficient to establish a finding of pretext. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01921110 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues that the agency was not credible in its reasons for the selection. Although the agency stated that its selection was based on the final scores after tabulating the points received on the candidate selection plan, appellant argues that there was actually a preselection. Appellant asserts that irregularities in the selection process indicate that the agency manipulated the process to favor the Selectees and justify the selections. For example, appellant argues that use of subjective criteria and interview questions that were not job-related was intended to bolster the qualifications of Selectee A because she had less audit and supervisory experience. Upon review of appellant's arguments, the Commission agrees with the findings of the AJ that taken as a whole, the procedural irregularities present in this selection process prevented appellant's advancement. The Commission finds that the agency was influenced by race and reprisal discrimination in its choice of methods used by the selecting officials. The Commission concludes that the selection methods were manipulated to obtain specific results, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> the top ranking of the two Selectees. While preselections are not discriminatory <span class="Italic">per se</span>, the Commission finds that the manner in which the agency considered the candidates enabled it to score the candidates with particular ratings to produce discriminatory results. The Commission notes the agency's argument that since the KASOCs, the criteria for the candidate selection plan, and the interview questions were jointly developed by the three Area Managers, it was unlikely that the other managers would have assented to inappropriate criteria to choose candidates in their areas. However, the other selecting officials would not be in any way disadvantaged in using this criteria and might cooperate in developing criteria that would provide them with great latitude in choosing particular individuals they favored, even if these selections were not based on discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the methods utilized by the agency produced discriminatory results, the Commission notes that appellant was likely one of the top candidates for the position due to his years of experience, yet he was not rated as such in any aspect of the selection criteria. The Commission finds that the agency devised a rating system that was so complex that it distorted actual abilities. The AJ noted, that as a result of the use of subjective factors and scoring, appellant received a score of zero on the Character Qualifications Check, despite his years of experience. In contrast, the Selectee, who had less technical experience, received 16 points. Appellant argues that the agency improperly ignored his supervisory and audit experience to find Selectee A more qualified. The agency argues that supervisory and audit experience were not determinative. However, it does not seem credible that a candidate with appellant's technical qualifications would be rated so low overall. The criteria was skewed so that a candidate with less practical experience <span id="Page_1586"></span>could be scored the highest. With a finding that a discriminatory environment existed against appellant, the manipulation of a selection process that failed to give appellant reasonable credit for his technical qualifications lacks credibility. Although the agency can use whatever criteria it chooses, criteria cannot be used to discriminatorily preclude selection of a candidate who is otherwise objectively more qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence that the agency manipulated the selection process by arbitrarily waiving the qualification standards for the selectee, who was initially not a candidate for the at-issue promotion, but rigidly applying the qualification standards to the complainant's application, led to a finding of race discrimination in <span class="Italic">Kenny C. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720150030 (2017).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Foster v. Dalton</span>, 71 F.3d 52 (1st Cir. 1995), the court found that evidence of preselection along with a departure from established procedures was not sufficient to establish pretext. It is, however, worth noting that in <span class="Italic">Foster</span>, the court of appeals was reviewing a decision of the district court for error. The court specifically observed that it might well have reached a different decision based on the evidence if it were writing on a "pristine page." Ultimately, although the decision does not specifically reference <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the court followed the rationale in that case by upholding the finding that the selection clearly was preordained. However, the court also upheld the finding that there was no evidence to support the notion that the preselection was based on race or sex, as opposed to the acknowledged friendship between the selecting official and the successful candidate. The court also rejected an argument that the selection was discriminatory because it was a result of the "old boy network." Although the court did not preclude a plaintiff from making such a showing under Title VII, it did find that the plaintiff would have to present evidence from multiple selections to support that claim. As the court in <span class="Italic">Foster</span>, 71 F.3d at 55-57, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second: Turning to specifics, the appellant says that preselection (which, according to the court below, dictated the adverse employment decision) occurred only after the decisionmaker learned that the management analyst post would go to an African-American woman, virtually by default, if he failed to adopt an alternative means of candidate selection. This is a plausible rendition of the facts, but not the only permissible one. Though Berry's name first surfaced after Commander Travis received an initial list, Travis could well have expected all along to see Berry in that lineup and, when his hopes were dashed, attempted to regain lost ground by altering the rules. Because both scenarios are plausible, we will not disturb the trial judge's choice between them<span class="Italic">. See Johnson</span>, 63 F.3d at 1138; <span class="Italic">Cumpiano</span>, 902 F.2d at 152; <span class="Italic">Keyes</span>, 853 F.2d at 1019-20.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third: The appellant insists that Commander Travis's abandonment of the Hospital's wonted policy of preferring in-house candidates itself gives rise to an irresistible inference of racial animus. The appellant weaves a complicated tapestry with the threads of this argument, hinting that the policy often operated in the past to exclude minority candidates from elevation, thus making the Hospital's disregard of it in a case where that policy would redound to the advantage of a minority candidate all the more cruel. In her view, this abrupt departure from past practice can only be explained on the basis of racial bias. We do not agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court treated this departure as suspicious, but concluded that Commander Travis tweaked the ordinary praxis to benefit a friend rather than to thwart a person of color. Two obvious propositions spring to mind. One is that cronyism is deplorable, especially when it is allowed to infect public sector employment decisions. The other obvious proposition is that Title VII does not have a limitless remedial reach. An employer can hire one person instead of another for any reason, fair or unfair, without transgressing Title VII, as long as the hiring decision is not spurred by race, gender, or some other protected characteristic<span class="Italic">. See Keyes</span>, 853 F.2d at 1026. As we explain <span class="Italic">infra</span>, Title VII does not outlaw cronyism--and, in this case, cronyism provides a sufficient alternative explanation for the challenged deviation from the standard hiring protocol. Thus, the district court's assessment of the proffered evidence was not clearly erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fourth: At trial, Commander Travis stalwartly maintained that he hired Berry because he was the best qualified aspirant. Judge Pettine understandably discounted this testimony<span class="Italic">. See Foster</span>, slip op. at 14-15. Although the appellant concedes that a court is not legally bound to find for a Title VII plaintiff simply because it rejects the employer's proffered reason for an employment decision, she maintains that, here, the court's disbelief of the explanation, coupled with the deviation from the standard policy of in-house preferment, compels an inference that the decision was race-driven. To shore up this contention, the appellant points to the naval officials' repeated denials of favoritism. Noting that the district court declined to credit these denials because they were self-serving, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 14, the appellant asseverates that, since preselection was the only alternative rationale that could sidetrack a finding of racial discrimination, the district court erred; the denials of preselection were, in fact, against self-interest, and the employer should be held to them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This argument is too clever by half. We do not believe it is implausible that veteran bureaucrats--and, in our view, "bureaucrat" and "naval officer" are not mutually exclusive terms--would deny preselection to avoid the stigma of having failed to follow neutral hiring procedures. Indeed, Travis's and Warch's on-the-stand denials are replete with clues from which the district judge reasonably could have deduced that the two men collogued to tilt the process in Berry's favor. In all events, actions speak louder than words. In a bench trial "what an actor says is not conclusive on a state-of-mind issue. Notwithstanding a person's disclaimers, a contrary state of mind may be inferred from what he does and from a factual mosaic tending to show that he really meant to accomplish that which he professes not to have intended." <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Sundlun</span>, 952 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In one sense, the district court's finding that an old boy network was in operation though the old boys denied it amounts to a credibility call. By and large, such calls are for the district court, not for the court of appeals<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., id.</span> (warning that the court of appeals "ought not to disturb supportable findings, based on witness credibility, made by a trial judge who has seen and heard the witnesses at first hand"). There is no reason to apply a different rule in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fifth: The appellant argues passionately that even if Commander Travis fished Berry from the applicant pool simply because he was spawned by the old boy network, such a hiring decision itself contravenes the mandate of Title VII. Though this construct, which rests on the premise that cronyism is the primary means by which employers perpetuate workplace apartheid, possesses a certain superficial appeal, it cannot withstand close perscrutation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, the construct lacks any vestige of precedential support. The very cases on which the appellant relies explicitly reject it<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Holder v. City of Raleigh</span>, 867 F.2d 823, 825-26 (4th Cir. 1989) (rebuffing plaintiff's assertion that nepotistic hiring practices, even when denied by defendant under racially charged circumstances, constitute impermissible discrimination under Title VII); <span class="Italic">Autry v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources</span>, 820 F.2d 1384, 1385 (4th Cir. 1987) (similar). Thus, her argument amounts to nothing more than a plea that we impose the construct by judicial fiat. But that is not our province. Given the state of the law, appellant's construct should be debated before the Congress, not argued before the courts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relatedly, the appellant suggests that Title VII must be read to bar cronyism because that tawdry practice assures continued white domination in the workplace. But this suggestion challenges as discriminatory a facially race-neutral (if offensive) policy, and necessarily depends for support on an examination of multiple hiring decisions. It is, therefore, better tailored to cases alleging disparate impact as opposed to disparate treatment<span class="Italic">. See Autry</span>, 820 F.2d at 1385; <span class="Italic">see generally Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 575, 579-80, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 2948-49, 2950-52, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1878) (explaining the basic dichotomy between disparate impact and disparate treatment); <span class="Italic">cf. EEOC v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066</span>, 48 F.3d 594, 606 (1st Cir.) (holding in disparate impact case that a policy of nepotism can, under certain circumstances, constitute evidence of race discrimination in employment), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 65, 133 L. Ed.2d 27 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, a disappointed applicant has made no systematic effort to prove pervasive cronyism or to show that cronyism, when practiced in a particular workplace, regularly yields a racially discriminatory result, a disparate impact claim goes by the boards. So here: at trial, appellant's counsel, responding to the district court's insightful questioning, characterized the suit as one involving disparate treatment, not disparate impact. That characterization binds the appellant in the present venue as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This brings us full circle. While the facts of this disparate treatment case can support an inference of discriminatory intent, they can equally support a finding of undiluted favoritism, unmixed with racial animus. On such a record, it is the trial court's prerogative--indeed, its duty--to select the inference that it deems appropriate. Because we cannot accept the appellant's invitation to create a presumption that the use of an old boy network in hiring constitutes<span class="Italic"> per se</span> racial discrimination, we are powerless to subvert the district court's election between conflicting inferences.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is not evidence of preselection when the selected candidate for a position is given manuals to prepare for the interview, if the manuals were supplied by the selecting official pursuant to the employee's request and the selecting official credibly testified that he would have provided the manuals to anyone who requested them. <span class="Italic">Melton v. USPS</span>, 01853186 (1987).</p>
