<p class="noindent">From a purely legal perspective, the prohibition of discrimination against individuals with disabilities in the federal government is based in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. As explained more fully below, its private sector companion, the Americans with Disabilities Act, was passed in 1990. The federal government is specifically excluded from the definition of an employer under the ADA, but many of the ADA requirements have been incorporated into the Rehabilitation Act and, therefore, do apply to the federal government.</p>
<p class="noindent">Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-233, codified at 42 USC 2000ff, et <span class="Italic">seq.</span>, protects individuals from employment discrimination on the basis of genetic information. There is some degree of overlap between the ADA and GINA to the extent that an individual with a genetic condition may also be an individual with a disability. The provisions of GINA are covered at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Rehabilitation Act, originally passed in 1973, has been amended a number of times. The Act was amended most recently, and perhaps most dramatically, in September 2008 when President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. 101-336, into law. As discussed in detail below, the ADAAA reversed several U.S. Supreme Court decisions that had significantly narrowed the definition of an individual with a disability under the ADA. The provisions of the ADAAA went into effect January 1, 2009. The ADA was also amended in October 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-569. One of the 1992 changes was to substitute use of the term "individual with disabilities" where previously the Act had referred to "handicapped persons." Every effort has been made to make the terminology used in this Guide consistent with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, as amended. Of course, some of the case law discussed in this chapter predates the 1992 amendments and still uses the "handicapped" terminology. It is not within the prerogative of the author to edit these previously issued decisions. References to handicapped persons in those cases should be understood to mean individuals with disabilities. The October 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act also adopted the nonaffirmative action standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 102-569, and made them applicable to the federal government. The result of that amendment is that while from a technical perspective agencies of the federal government are not subject to the ADA, they are subject to many of the ADA's specific provisions to the extent that those provisions have been incorporated into the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">As discussed more fully below, the provisions of the ADAAA are not likely to be interpreted as retroactive. The few federal courts to consider the issue thus far have held the ADAAA is not retroactive and that also is the position taken by the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lytes v. D.C. Water and Sewer Authority</span>, 572 F.3d 936 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The previous standards of the ADA will continue to apply to cases where the alleged discrimination occurred before January 1, 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent">Disability discrimination is a complex topic and one in which the Commission has often clashed with the courts over statutory interpretation and, occasionally, the courts have clashed among themselves. For an in-depth discussion of disability discrimination in the federal sector, the reader is referred to Natania M. Davis and Ernest C. Hadley, founding author, <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Sector Disability Discrimination Law and Practice</span><span class="small"> (</span><a href="http://deweypub.com/store/11FSDD.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations at Part 1614 governing disability discrimination were issued prior to the October 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act. The Commission has issued regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 29 CFR Part 1630. Although the Commission amended its procedural regulations at Part 1614 in November 1999, it did not amend those sections of the regulations that apply to disability discrimination. However, on May 21, 2002, the Commission issued a notice of final rulemaking to amend 29 CFR 1614.203. 67 Fed. Reg. 35732. The rulemaking adopts the Commission's guidance under the ADA at Part 1630 as being applicable in federal sector cases effective June 20, 2002. Consistent with the Commission's making the provisions of Part 1630 applicable in the federal sector, citations in this chapter are to those regulations, where applicable.</p>
<p class="noindent">On September 16, 2009, the EEOC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend its regulations at 29 CFR Part 1630 to be consistent with the ADAAA. 43 FR 48431. The Commission published a Notice of Final Rulemaking under the ADAAA on March 25, 2011. The Notice amends Part 1630 and its appendix and becomes effective on May 25, 2011.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Rehabilitation Act is unique among antidiscrimination laws. Like its counterparts that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, national origin and age, the Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of their disabling conditions. However, it requires more than nondiscrimination; the Rehabilitation Act requires affirmative action on the part of employers in the hiring, placement and advancement of qualified individuals with disabilities and also, as part of its nonaffirmative action provisions, requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bordonaro v. USPS</span>, 01800996 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. USPS</span>, 662 F.2d 292 (5th Cir. 1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Codified at 29 USC 791, <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>., the Act established an Interagency Committee on Employees who are Individuals with Disabilities. Section 791(a) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;There is established with the Federal Government and Interagency Committee on Employees who are Individuals with Disabilities (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "Committee"), comprised of such members as the President may select, including the following (or their designees whose positions are Executive Level IV or higher): the Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "Commission"), the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Either the Director of the Office of Personnel Management or the Chairman of the Commission shall serve as co-chairpersons of the Committee or the Director or Chairman shall serve as sole chairperson of the Committee, as the Director and Chairman jointly determine, from time to time, to be appropriate. The resources of the President's Committees on Employment of People with Disabilities and on Mental Retardation shall be made fully available to the Committee. It shall be the purpose and function of the Committee (1) to provide a focus for Federal and other employment of individuals with disabilities, and to review, on a periodic basis, in cooperation with the Commission, the adequacy of hiring, placement, and advancement practices with respect to individuals with disabilities, by each department, agency, and instrumentality in the executive branch of Government, and to insure that the special needs of such individuals are being met; and (2) to consult with the Commission to assist the Commission to carry out its responsibilities under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. On the basis of such review and consultation, the Committee shall periodically make to the Commission such recommendations for legislative and administrative changes as it deems necessary or desirable. The Commission shall timely transmit to the appropriate committees of Congress any such recommendations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Act requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Postal Service, to develop affirmative action plans for the hiring, placement, and advancement of persons with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 791(b). It further provides the same rights and remedies as set forth under Title VII in 42 USC 2000e-16 and 2000-e5(f)-(k). <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 794(a)(1). Enforcement is through the provisions of Title VII already in place, and in fashioning remedies for aggrieved persons, the "court may take into account the reasonableness of the cost of any necessary work place accommodation, and the availability of alternatives therefor or other appropriate relief in order to achieve an equitable and appropriate remedy." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Agencies are required to process complaints of disability discrimination under the same procedures and regulations as they process complaints of discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.103(a). Likewise, complainants must exhaust their administrative remedies as in complaints of discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. USPS</span>, 01821088 (1983); 29 CFR 1614.310.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 29 CFR 1614.203, the Commission's amended Rehabilitation Act regulation provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Model employer</span>. The Federal Government shall be a model employer of individuals with disabilities. Agencies shall give full consideration to the hiring, placement, and advancement of qualified individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ADA standards</span>. The standards used to determine whether section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 791), has been violated in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under this part shall be the standards applied under Titles I and V (sections 501 through 504 and 510) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (42 U.S.C. 12101, 12111, 12201), as such sections relate to employment. These standards are set forth in the Commission's ADA regulations at 29 CFR part 1630.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consistent with the goal of the Rehabilitation Act, on July 26, 2000, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13163, 65 Fed. Reg. 46,563, requiring each federal agency to submit a plan for increasing employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities. The Office of Personnel Management was charged with developing guidance for such plans. On July 30, 2009, President Obama issued Executive Order 13548, "Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities." The Order was designed to reverse a 10-year trend in which the overall number of individuals with disabilities employed by federal agencies has steadily declined and the number of individuals with so-called "targeted disabilities" has declined even more drastically.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990 and is codified at 42 <span id="Page_1096"></span>USC 12101, <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. The federal government is specifically exempt from the definition of an employer under the ADA. 42 USC 12111(5)(B)(i). However, in 1992, the Rehabilitation Act, at 29 USC 791(g), was amended to provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the provisions of sections 501 and 504, and 510 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as such sections relate to employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The relevant sections of the ADA are codified at 42 USC 12111, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, 12201-204, and 12210. In effect, the amendment made some provisions of the more current ADA applicable to the federal sector and, in turn, the 2008 amendments to the ADA are also applicable to the federal sector. Those provisions primarily relate to discrimination based on disability and reasonable accommodation. The applicable provisions of the ADA also include restrictions of medical examinations and inquiries and confidentiality requirements for medical information collected on employees and applicants. The Commission's amendment of Part 1614, noted above, was to make its regulations consistent with the 1992 amendment of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure of some courts and, on occasion, the Commission's failure to distinguish between descriptive language and terms of art has created some confusion about the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. For example, in cases like <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span> and <span class="Italic">Bordonaro</span>, noted above, the courts and the Commission referred to an agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation as an affirmative obligation. In a literal sense, such a description of the obligation to provide reasonable accommodation is accurate. An agency is obligated to take affirmative steps to accommodate a qualified individual with a disability. The problem arises with the fact that "affirmative action" is a term of art under the Rehabilitation Act that applies to the hiring, placement, and advancement of disabled individuals. It also is a term of art under Title VII that refers to remedies for past systemic discrimination. This has led some to view the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA as granting special privileges to individuals with disabilities not granted to individuals without disabilities. Under 791(g), the relevant standards of the ADA apply only to "nonaffirmative action employment" discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Reasonable accommodation is a nonaffirmative action employment discrimination requirement under the Rehabilitation Act and, as such, is subject to the relevant sections of the ADA. As a result, distinguishing between the loose use of descriptive language and a term of art becomes critical under the Rehabilitation Act in determining what standards apply to which cases. It also is critical to understanding the true nature of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some of the confusion was spawned by <span class="Italic">Southeastern Community College v. Davis</span>, 442 U.S. 397, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed.2d 980 (1979). In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act imposes any affirmative action obligation on an entity covered by the section. In <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 99 S. Ct. at 2370 n.11, the Court wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Government, in a brief <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> in support of respondent, cites a Report of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on the 1974 amendments to the 1973 Act and several statements by individual Members of Congress during debate on the 1978 amendments, <span class="Italic">some of which indicate a belief that &#x00A7; 504 requires affirmative action.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 44-50. But these isolated statements by individual Members of Congress or its committees, all made after the enactment of the statute under consideration, cannot substitute for a clear expression of legislative intent at the time of enactment. <span class="Italic">Quern v. Mandley</span>, 436 U.S. 725, 736 n.10, 98 S. Ct. 2069, 2075 n.10, 56 L. Ed.2d 658 (1978); <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Dept. of Water &#x0026; Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 714, 98 S. Ct. 1370, 1378, 55 L. Ed.2d 657 (1978). Nor do these comments, none of which represents the will of Congress as a whole, constitute subsequent "legislation" such as this Court might weigh in construing the meaning of an earlier enactment. <span class="Italic">Cf. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC</span>, 395 U.S. 367, 380-381, 89 S. Ct. 1794, 1801, 23 L. Ed.2d 371 (1969).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The Government also argues that various amendments to the 1973 Act contained in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1978 further reflect Congress' approval of the affirmative-action obligation created by HEW's regulations.</span> But the amendment most directly on point undercuts this position. In amending &#x00A7; 504, Congress both extended that section's prohibition of discrimination to "any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service" and authorized administrative regulations to implement only this amendment. <span class="Italic">See</span> n.2, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The fact that no other regulations were mentioned supports an inference that no others were approved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the assertion by HEW of the authority to promulgate any regulations under &#x00A7; 504 has been neither consistent nor longstanding. For the first three years after the section was enacted, HEW maintained the position that Congress had not intended any regulations to be issued. It altered its stand only after having been enjoined to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> n.4, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. This fact substantially diminishes the deference to be given to HEW's present interpretation of the statute. <span class="Italic">See General Electric Co. v. Gilbert</span>, 429 U.S. 125, 143, 97 S. Ct. 401, 411, 50 L. Ed.2d 343 (1976).</p>
<p class="noindent">(Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court's use of the term "affirmative action" in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> left some question as to whether reasonable accommodation was an affirmative action requirement of the Rehabilitation Act. In <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Choate</span>, 469 U.S. 287, 105 S. Ct. 712, 719 n.20, 83 L. Ed.2d 661 (1985), the Court resolved that confusion, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, we stated that &#x00A7; 504 does not impose an "affirmative-action obligation on all recipients of federal funds." 442 U.S., at 411, 99 S. Ct., at 2369-70. Our use of the term "affirmative action" in this context has been severely criticized for failing to appreciate the difference between affirmative action and reasonable accommodation; the former is said to be a remedial policy for the victims of past discrimination, while the latter relates to the elimination of existing obstacles against the handicapped. <span class="Italic">See</span> Note, Accommodating the Handicapped: Rehabilitating Section 504 After <span class="Italic">Southeastern</span>, 80 Colum.L. Rev. 171, 185-186 (1980); <span class="Italic">see also Dopico v. Goldschmidt</span>, 687 F.2d 644, 652 (CA2 1982) ("Use of phrase 'affirmative action' in this context is unfortunate, making it difficult to talk about any kind of affirmative efforts without importing the special legal and social connotations of that term."). Regardless of the aptness of our choice of words in <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, it is clear from the context of <span class="Italic">Davis</span> that the term "affirmative action" referred to those "changes," "adjustments," or "modifications" to existing programs that would be "substantial," 442 U.S., at 410, 411. n.10, 413, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 2369-2370, n.10, 2370, or that would constitute "fundamental alteration[s] in the nature of a program...," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, at 410, 99 S. Ct., at 2369, rather than those changes that would be reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other words, the obligation to provide reasonable accommodation does not arise from the affirmative action requirements of 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, but from its nondiscriminatory provisions. The provisions of the ADA relating to "nonaffirmative action employment discrimination," including the provisions relating to reasonable accommodation, apply to cases involving reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102-166, 102(b), codified at 42 USC 1981a(b), authorizes awards of compensatory damages in Title VII cases. Since the Rehabilitation Act relies upon the relief provisions of Title VII, compensatory damages are available in Rehabilitation Act cases involving intentional discrimination, including cases where there is a failure to make reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01923399 (1992). Section 102(a)(3), codified at 42 USC 1981a(a)(3), also created a so-called "good faith" defense in reasonable accommodation cases. Where an agency can demonstrate a good faith effort to make reasonable accommodation of an employee with a disability, it can escape liability for compensatory damages where that effort falls short of what is legally required. The agency remains obligated to provide reasonable accommodation and any other equitable relief traditionally available under Title VII in such cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the plain language of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, as well as Commission case law, seemed to support the notion that compensatory damages are available in cases involving the federal government under the Rehabilitation Act, in <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 867 F. Supp. 1050 (D.D.C. 1994), the court rejected an argument that the doctrine of sovereign immunity insulates federal agencies from liability for compensatory damages under the Rehabilitation Act. However, in <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. U.S. Department of Labor</span>, 41 F.3d 1551 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the court of appeals held that the 1991 Civil Rights Act did not waive the federal government's sovereign immunity under 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act. As a result, the district court vacated its earlier ruling in <span class="Italic">Pena</span>. The decision was summarily upheld on appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to resolve a split in the circuits. The suit involved a claim by a Merchant Marine Academy student who was dropped from the academy after developing diabetes. The suit did not directly implicate federal employees. However, in deciding the case, the Supreme Court found that, with respect to federal employees, compensatory damages are available under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 116 S. Ct. 2092 (1996). Later, in <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed.2d 196 (1999), the Supreme Court found that the EEOC had the authority to issue compensatory damages as relief against federal agencies in administrative proceedings. For a detailed discussion of "<a href="0100-2023-30-008.html#sec21-9">Compensatory Damages</a>," see Chapter 21.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission had adopted regulations specific to cases under the Rehabilitation Act at 29 CFR 1614.203. As noted above, in May 2002, the Commission amended 1614.203 and now applies the substantive guidance of Part 1630, most recently amended in March 2011, to nonaffirmative action cases under the Rehabilitation Act. These regulations do not affect the actual administrative processing of complaints. Complaints under the Rehabilitation Act are processed as any other federal sector complaint of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also has published extensive commentary and explanation of the reasonable accommodation requirements of the ADA. The following is a partial list of disability-related enforcement guidance notices issued to date:</p>
<p class="list-s"><span class="list-s">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, October 17, 2002;</p>
<p class="list-s"><span class="list-s">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic"><span id="Page_1097"></span>Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.0002, July 27, 2000;</p>
<p class="list-s"><span class="list-s">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: The Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, March 25, 1997.</p>
<p class="list-s"><span class="list-s">&#x2022;</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Effect of Representations Made in Applications for Benefits on the Determination of Whether a Person is a "Qualified Individual with a Disability" Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>. EEOC Notice No. 915.002, December 12, 1997;</p>
<p class="list-s"><span class="list-s">&#x2022;</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Workers' Compensation and the ADA</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, October 10, 1995;</p>
<p class="list-s"><span class="list-s">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 October 10, 1995;</p>
<p class="noindent">Although much of the Enforcement Guidance issued prior to the ADAAA is unaltered by the Act, caution must be exercised in using the guidance that has not been revised to be consistent with the amendments. Particularly to the extent that the guidance addressed issues related to the definitions of major life activities and substantial limitation, that guidance has been superseded by the ADAAA. The ADAAA specifically found that the Commission's description of a substantial limitation, a description based on several Supreme Court cases overruled by the ADAAA, as being a "significant restriction" of a major life activity was inconsistent with congressional intent that the ADA be interpreted broadly in favor of coverage. Uncodified Purposes, Sec. 2(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent">If there is one statement in the legislative history of the ADAAA that sums up congressional intent, it would have to be:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Too often cases have turned solely on the question of whether the plaintiff is an individual with a disability; too rarely have courts considered the merits of the discrimination claim, such as whether adverse decisions were impermissibly made by the employer on the basis of disability, reasonable accommodations were denied inappropriately, or qualification standards were unlawfully discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">H.R. Rep. 110-730, Part I at p. 8.</p>
<p class="noindent">All of the above-cited guidance is published in the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination." The EEOC has also published a number of "<span class="Italic">Questions and Answers</span>," Guidance Memoranda on various disability discrimination subjections which are available on the Commission's website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>.</p>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec14-2"><span class="space">I.</span> COVERAGE UNDER THE REHABILITATION ACT</h2>
<p class="noindent">A threshold question in any case involving the Rehabilitation Act is whether the Act covers the employee. Coverage under the Act has been the subject of most litigation prior to the 2008 ADA amendments and is the thrust of those amendments. Coverage remains an issue in disability discrimination cases but, as discussed more fully below, the ADAAA significantly expanded the scope of coverage.</p>
<p class="noindent">Title VII clearly applies to all employees who are aggrieved by agency actions because everyone is a member of a protected group on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, and national origin. Determining application of the ADEA is mechanical to the extent that it can be easily ascertained whether the affected employee is 40 years of age or older. To be covered by the most significant provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, such as the reasonable accommodation requirement or the proscription against discrimination, the employee or applicant for employment must be an individual with a disability, who is qualified. As explained more fully below, an individual with a disability who is qualified is an individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities who is otherwise qualified and can, without or without reasonable accommodation perform the essential functions of the position he or she holds or desires. 29 CFR 1630.2(m). With most of the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, employees are not <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> covered by the Act, and there is no mechanical test that will easily determine its applicability, though the amended regulations do designate medical conditions that "should be easily concluded...will...substantially limit" major life activities. 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(3)(iii). In addition, the issue of coverage under the Act is complicated by the fact that individuals can qualify for coverage under two additional criteria even if they do not presently have a disability--individuals who have a past record of a disability are covered, as are individuals who are "regarded as" having a disability. The ADAAA significantly changed the "regarded as" provision of the Act broadening coverage to individuals who have medical conditions that have an expected or actual duration of six months or more when an agency acts on the basis of that condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Tracing the development of the language used from the Rehabilitation Act to the ADA to the ADAAA gives one a good idea of the evolution of disability discrimination law in the last 47 years. Under the Rehabilitation Act, employees and applicants protected under the Act were referred to as "handicapped individuals." By the time the ADA passed in 1990, those employees and applicants had become "qualified individuals with disabilities." At first blush, the change may seem relatively minor, but it's not. The Rehabilitation Act essentially defined individuals by their handicaps or disabilities. Under the ADA, the focus shifted so that the persons protected were individuals first and foremost who happened to have a disability. The term "qualified" was added to reinforce the notion that an individual with a disability, just like any other individual, must meet the basic requirements of the job and be able to perform its essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation. The ADAAA brought about a subtler though no less important change. Congress amended 42 USC 12112(a) and (b) to read that an employer shall not discriminate against a "qualified individual on the basis of disability." Although some sections of the ADA still refer to a qualified individual with a disability and the concept that any individual must be qualified is carried forward, the focus under the ADAAA is even more on the individual with a disability simply being one aspect of that individual's characteristics. Those changes are entirely consistent with one of the premises of the original Rehabilitation Act--that it is often not the actual disability that holds back the individual, but society's perception of individuals with disabilities in general. So the focus from the outset has been on the individualized assessment of a particular individual with a particular disability in the context of a specific job. The evolution of the statutory language simply serves the limited success of past efforts.</p>
<p class="noindent">Individuals with disabilities are not a homogenous group. Different individuals have different disabilities. Even among individuals with the same disability, there is a great deal of variation as to the degree that the disability affects a particular individual. In addition to these variations, the determination of whether a particular individual is a qualified individual with a disability must take into account the specific essential functions of the job to be performed. A particular individual may be a qualified individual with a disability for purposes of one job but not another. As a result, a determination of whether a specific complainant is a qualified individual with a disability is a highly individualized inquiry.</p>
