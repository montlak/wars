<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-61"><span class="space">B.</span> CONFUSING/BURDENSOME/ONEROUS AJ ORDERS</h3>
<p class="noindent">In order for an administrative judge to sanction a party for violating his or her instructions, the judge must ensure that any instructions are clear and clearly communicated to the parties. If a reasonable person would find an order "so onerous and burdensome as to constitute a barrier to one's ability to obtain an administrative hearing" it cannot be relied upon to issue sanctions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Drucilla Y. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120182728 (2020).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Mathis v. Secretary of the Navy</span>, 0720080006 (2009), the administrative judge ordered the parties to file written closing arguments instead of oral arguments when the hearing ran late. Off the record, the judge instructed the parties to prepare their arguments without aid of the hearing transcripts. The transcripts were then inadvertently delivered to the agency instead of the judge. The agency promptly notified the judge and provided copies to the judge and the complainant. When the agency cited to the hearing transcripts in its closing arguments, the judge sanctioned the agency for violating his instructions. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission agrees with the agency that the AJ's order, described by the AJ, as to write the closing briefs "without benefit of the transcripts," is not necessarily a prohibition on using the transcripts in the closing briefs. Forbidding the use of the hearing transcripts in the closing briefs may have been what the AJ intended, but another possible interpretation is that it was not expected that the hearing transcripts would be available in time to cite in the closing briefs. When the hearing transcripts were available in time to cite in the closing briefs, it does not appear to be a violation of the AJ's instructions to cite the hearing transcripts. We agree with the agency, that in this particular case there was "confusion and uncertainty" as to what the AJ had orally directed the parties to do.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Drucilla Y. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120182728 (2020), reversed dismissal of the complainant's claims where, among other considerations, the AJ's order was confusing such that compliance was burdensome and onerous. The oriGINAl AJ's order required the complainant and agency to, within 75 days, file prehearing submissions--the particulars of which, the complainant found confusing. The complainant, appearing <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, did not timely submit her prehearing report, but did attempt to contact the AJ via his clerk and was informed by email that her case was open, to remain patient and that "there are no further updates to tell you at this time." Two years later, the AJ issued a show cause order to the complainant for failing to file her prehearing submissions. In response, the complainant provided the clerk's email and wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I have not tried to contact your office anymore until just recently when I received the notice of the Order to Show Cause. I have made numerous attempts to speak with someone in your office by phone to explain why I would be getting a notice like this when I've complied with everything that was requested of me. I also attempted to email [the Hearings Clerk] but the email came back undeliverable. I am faxing a copy of the Designation of Representative along with the confirmation of receipt, [and] a copy of the email I received from [ ][the] Hearings Unit Clerk. [ ] It is my sincere hope that upon receipt of these documents, no sanctions will be imposed upon me. Everything I have had to endure connected with this whole EEO issue has already caused overwhelming hardship for me.</p>
<p class="noindent">The oriGINAl AJ retired and the case remained open for another year. The second AJ issued an order entitled "Order Requiring Parties to Establish Compliance with Order," noting that the complainant had not filed her prehearing submissions or offered any reason why. The complainant responded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I would also like to further clarify the reason that I did not provide additional information. On page 6 for prehearing submission requirements, items 1, 2, and 3 are contained in the investigative file that includes a detailed list of my complaints, along with supporting documentation for each complaint and signed statements of witnesses that were interviewed with regard to my complaints. I was informed by EEO that a copy of my investigative file was sent out on July 11, 2014 to 3 recipients, which included myself, [Agency] Attorney, and EEO Administrative Judge. As for item 4, I am seeking the maximum amount allowable by law.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Drucilla Y</span>. moved for sanctions. In response, the complainant explained that her failure to comply with the oriGINAl order was because it was difficult to understand and that she believed the investigative file would serve as her prehearing submission:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When I first received the 14-page order, it was quite intimidating to me as far as the content and the language. I read it a number of times. I finally determined that I was supposed to send the signed designation of representative, which I did within the 14-day time frame. [ ] On March 3, 2015, I contacted AJ1's office and spoke with his clerk to check on the status of my case. The following day, on March 4, 2015, the clerk sent me an email in response to my call, explaining to me that she had spoken with AJ1 regarding my case, and that it was still open and that no decision had been made and for me to be patient. From that contact, I came away with the understanding that everything was okay on my end and there was nothing more for me to do but wait. I will be the first to admit I have not clearly understood this whole EEO process. I was under the assumption since I had submitted all my complaints with detailed supporting documentation to the EEO investigator, and a copy of my investigative file had been given to [AJ1] and Agency Counsel, that there was nothing more for me to submit to the Administrative Judge before hearing my case other than my designation of representative. It was my belief that my investigative file was my prehearing submission and that my response would be only if I had any additional documents I wanted to submit, which I did not. Again, I was not aware of any failure on my behalf to comply with [AJ1].</p>
<p class="noindent">Unmoved, the AJ dismissed the hearing request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The integrity of this administrative forum depends upon the enforcement <span id="Page_588"></span>of fair and neutral rules of procedure. Complainant's failure to comply with the prehearing requirements in violation of [AJ1's] order, failure to fully respond to AJ1's March 10, 2017 show cause order, and continual failure to serve opposing counsel have had a detrimental impact on the process and resulted in severe delay. Given the facts of this case, including Complainant's non-compliance with [AJ1's] orders, and taking into consideration the need to appropriately address Complainant's behavior, deter similar conduct in the future, and to equitably remedy the harm to the Agency and the integrity of the EEO process, the proper sanction to impose is dismissal of the hearing request, and to remand the case for a final agency decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Drucilla Y</span>. reversed the dismissal taking into consideration the "nature, extent of, and justification of noncompliance," "prejudicial effect of noncompliance on Agency and consequences resulting from delay in justice," the "repetitiveness of the noncompliance," and the "effect of complainant's noncompliance on the integrity of the EEO process." As to the last, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">J2 rightfully points out that protecting the integrity of the EEO complaints process is central to the Commission's ability to carry out its mandate to eradicate discrimination in the federal workplace, and that integrity is compromised when a party fails to respond in a timely, accurate, and proper manner to the AJ's orders. Nevertheless, the efficacy and efficiency, and ultimately, the integrity of the administrative complaint process must be balanced against the rights of the parties to be heard. To do so, we must determine whether a reasonable person in Complainant's position would have found AJ1's Acknowledgement and Scheduling Order so onerous and burdensome as to constitute a barrier to one's ability to obtain an administrative hearing. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span> <span class="Italic">Gia M. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320130002 (Aug. 12, 2016); <span class="Italic">Payne v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720080053 (Oct. 27, 2008) <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den</span>. EEOC Request No. 0520090141 (Jan. 13, 2009) (in applying the reasonableness standard, the Commission balances the right of individuals to oppose employment discrimination and the public's interest in enforcement of the EEO laws against an employer's need for a stable and productive work environment). The presence of such barriers within the EEO process would also compromise its integrity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that a reasonable person in Complainant's position would have interpreted AJ1's 2014 Acknowledgement and Scheduling Order as not requiring a party to make prehearing submissions to the extent that the documents and witness statements were already included in the investigative file. Paragraph (3) in the prehearing submissions section of the order plainly states that documents that are included in the investigative report are already part of the hearing record and are not to be offered as exhibits. (Emphasis omitted.) In paragraphs (4) and (10) of the Agency's motion for sanctions, Counsel asserts that Complainant failed to show good cause for her failure to follow AJ1's Acknowledgement and Scheduling Order because that order required Complainant to file her pre-hearing submissions regardless of what was contained in the investigative file. Such an interpretation would appear to contradict the plain language of the 2014 order on its face, and a reasonable person in Complainant's position would not read the order that way. Even Counsel appears to have been confused by the language of AJ1's 2014 order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking these five factors into consideration, we find that a reasonable person in Complainant's position would find AJ1's Acknowledgement and Scheduling Order October 30, 2014, as written, to be so onerous and burdensome as to be extremely difficult to comply with. We find that Complainant has presented a believable case that she did not understand the 2014 order and was trying to follow it as best she could, and that she reasonably believed after she talked to the Hearings Clerk in 2015 that there was nothing more she needed to do. We will therefore vacate the Agency's final decision and remand this matter for a hearing in accordance with our Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">This case turned on the requirement that "a reasonable person in Complainant's position" would have found the order confusing and the complainant's lack of sophistication with the process. But the rule that an order cannot be so confusing or burdensome as to "constitute a barrier to one's ability to obtain an administrative hearing" is equally applicable to both parties.</p>
