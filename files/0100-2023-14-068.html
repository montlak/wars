<h2 class="h2" id="sec5-68"><span class="space">IV.</span> COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of ways in which agencies and complainants approach the issue of settlement of compensatory damages. Perhaps the easiest and cleanest way is when the parties simply agree on an amount of compensatory damages. Another method is to permit the complainant to submit evidence of compensatory damages with the agency for a final decision on the damages. Still another variation on this method is for the agency and the complainant to agree on maximum and minimum levels of compensatory damages. Of course, the problem with the latter two methods of resolving damages is that neither method really settles the case with any finality--it simply changes the focus of the future litigation. A far better approach, if the parties cannot agree on an amount of damages, is to agree to submit the issue to binding arbitration. There would still be future litigation--the arbitration--but at least it would have a reasonably quick and finite end without further appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent">When agencies review damage submissions in connection with a settlement agreement, they must review those submissions under the same legal standards that the Commission applies in awarding damages. In <span class="Italic">April v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01963775 (1997), the Commission found the agency was in breach of a settlement agreement that allowed a maximum damage award of $30,000 where the complainant submitted nearly $370,000 in documented damages and the agency awarded less than $30,000. The Commission in <span class="Italic">April</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the agreement, the appellant agreed to accept a sum not to exceed $30,000 as compensatory damages, and agreed to submit evidence in support of that claim within 60 days of the signing of the settlement agreement. She complied with the terms of the agreement by submitting a timely claim in November 1994, and even though she claimed that her compensatory damages amounted to nearly $370,000, she acknowledged that she was only seeking to recover $30,000. The agency is obliged by the specific terms of the agreement to "pay proven compensatory damages not to exceed $30,000."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available under &#x00A7; 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991</span> (July 14, 1992) ("Guidance") provides extensive guidance regarding the nature of compensatory damages that are available to the appellant. Our Guidance states that compensable pecuniary losses include such items as moving expenses, job search expenses, medical expenses, psychiatric expenses, physical therapy expenses, and other quantifiable out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of discrimination. For past pecuniary losses, receipts, records, bills, canceled checks and statements of confirmation of expenses by other individuals may be submitted by an individual to support a claim for compensatory damages. Our Guidance states that future pecuniary losses include the same expenses as expenses for past pecuniary losses excepting that they are shown to be likely to continue to be incurred after settlement, conciliation, or litigation. The Guidance further states that compensatory damages are also available for nonpecuniary losses for such intangible injuries as emotional harm, pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other nonpecuniary losses that are incurred as a result of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our Guidance recognizes that nonpecuniary losses for emotional harm are more difficult to establish than the pecuniary losses. However, such harm may be established with medical evidence and/or testimonial evidence from the victim of discrimination and other individuals. Lastly, we note that the Guidance states that a respondent takes its victim as it finds her where a complainant "may be unusually emotionally sensitive and incur great emotional harm from discriminatory conduct," and therefore the agency here is not absolved from responsibility for the greater emotional harm that might be partly the product of the appellant's past psychiatric history of depression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the appellant's November 1994 submission of objective evidence in support of her claim for compensatory damages complied with our above-stated guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency disallowed $50 for the cost of forwarding appellant's mail to her mother's house in New Jersey, $600 for future medical expenses, and the entire claim of $332,199 for loss of future earnings because of the loss of reputation within the agency as well as in the veterinary medicine industry. Further, the agency allowed only $1,500 of the $30,000 amount claimed by the appellant for nonpecuniary losses for severe emotional distress, depression, humiliation, embarrassment, and strained familial relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency acknowledges that the appellant incurred $8,028.10 in allowable past pecuniary losses. The issue therefore remains whether the appellant's objective evidence in support of her $30,000 claim for non-pecuniary losses (for severe emotional distress, depression, humiliation, embarrassment and strained familial relationships) and a $332,199 claim for loss of future earnings (for loss of reputation within the agency and in the veterinary medicine industry) supports an award of compensatory damages for the balance of the $30,000 maximum allowable award (<span class="Italic">i.e</span>., $21,971.90) under the terms of the settlement. Because we find that the objective evidence submitted by the appellant for her $30,000 claim for non-pecuniary losses alone supports an award for the full balance of $21,971.90 under the agreement, we deem it unnecessary to decide how much additional damages she might have received for loss of reputation if there had been no agreed upon ceiling on the amount of compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has submitted objective evidence (her own affidavit, statements and bills from psychiatrists and a licensed social worker, and a statement from her mother) that fully supports an award of full $21,971.90. Appellant's symptoms of depression were considerably exacerbated by the agency's discriminatory actions, and she suffered additional distress, humiliation, anxiety and embarrassment during the year following her poor evaluation and constructive discharge. As a result, she made 23 visits for psychiatric treatment during a little over a one-year period. For example, the licensed social worker stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I saw Michelle [sic] April from late June 1993 until Sept 10, 1993. She was in an agitated state of depression and clearly under great stress. At the time, she was struggling to hold onto her job. The workplace added to her sense of shame and hopelessness by offering no alternative to losing her job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One of the treating psychiatrists stated that the appellant was "treated in our clinic for an episode of major depression since 10/11/93. She was initially seen on a weekly basis, from October 11, 1993 to December 22, 1993, and has since been followed monthly." Appellant's mother, with whom the appellant lived after she was constructively discharged, testified that the appellant was severely depressed while she lived with her, and that she suffered humiliation by the manner in which agency officials treated her in telephone calls and personal interviews when she was seeking reemployment with the agency. Appellant's mother stated that "the entire process left Michele humiliated, embarrassed, distressed and very anxious about her ability to support herself in the future. Her state of mind from this process also seriously affected her interactions socially and with members of her family, including me. She had great difficulty communicating with me and others, including her two sisters,..., as compared to previous to the Agency's actions against her."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the above, we reject the agency's reduction of the appellant's claim for non-pecuniary losses to a mere $1,500. Instead, we award her the full balance of $21,971.90 for nonpecuniary losses. Thus, the appellant is entitled to a total of $30,000 in proven compensatory damages as specified in the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">April</span> does not stand for the proposition that agencies must always award the top limit of damages in settlement. It does, however, stand for the proposition that the agency must objectively evaluate the evidence of damages. The Commission in <span class="Italic">April</span> also determined that the appellant was entitled to attorney fees and interest on the compensatory damages award.</p>
<p class="noindent">An issue that the Commission has not addressed, other than implicitly, is which actions form the scope of relief when the parties, through settlement, agree to an award of compensatory damages. Damages are awardable only for acts of intentional discrimination. When a complaint raising more than one claim of intentional discrimination is adjudicated, the agency is liable only for those claims on which a finding of discrimination is entered. Assume, for example, that an employee alleges he was not promoted because of his sex and that the agency retaliated against him for filing an EEO complaint by transferring him to an unfavorable job. After a hearing, the administrative judge finds the employee has failed to prove discrimination in the promotion case but has proved reprisal in the transfer case. If the agency fully implements the judge's decision, the agency is liable only for the harm caused by the transfer. Because there was no finding of discrimination in the promotion case, the agency has no liability for damages for that personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the traditional settlement, the agency does not admit that any of its actions were discriminatory. In fact, in many instances, the agency will insist on language specifically denying it engaged in any discrimination. If the agency engaged in no discrimination, what then forms the basis of any compensatory damage award?</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has never explicitly addressed this issue in any of its decisions. The implicit answer is that the scope of damages is determined by those claims made in the formal complaint. In the above example, if the parties settle rather than adjudicate the case and agree to an award of damages, the scope of damages would be those traceable to both the failure to promote and the transfer. Of course, the agency has the option of insisting that it will only pay compensatory damages for one of the actions as an element of settlement. Such a restriction does not seem to be common, however, in settlement agreements that award compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, even where the agency has agreed to pay a damage award in a <span id="Page_393"></span>case involving multiple personnel actions, no damages will be awarded for a specific personnel action unless the complainant submits evidence of a causal connection between that action and any ensuing harm. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hogeland v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01976440 (1999), the agency agreed to award compensatory damages in a complaint involving a low performance appraisal and withdrawal of leave without pay as an accommodation. The Commission's award of $25,000 in compensatory damages in that case was restricted to the effects of the withdrawal of the accommodation. No damages were awarded for the low performance appraisal because the complainant submitted no evidence linking the appraisal to the harm suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not a breach of the settlement agreement for the agency to report to the IRS the amount of compensatory damages paid to the complainant. <span class="Italic">Deal v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 01986663 (1999). In the same case, the Commission also found there was no mutual mistake of fact on whether damages that were taxable would void the agreement. For a further discussion of "<a href="0100-2023-14-103.html#sec5-103">Mutual Mistake of Fact or Law</a>," see below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, the Commission declined to enforce a settlement agreement where the agency agreed to pay compensatory damages for acts occurring before the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act after issuance of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> holding the Act was not retroactive. In <span class="Italic">Boydston v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05A01194 (2002), the Commission held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel did not require payment of damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her request for reconsideration complainant argues that regardless of the applicability of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 the agency must be held liable for compensatory damages under the doctrine of promissory estoppel because, by agreeing to the dismissal of her complaint, complainant relied to her detriment on the agency's undertaking in the settlement to pay her compensatory damages. Although there is some force to complainant's argument, the law is not on her side. First, in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel, complainant must demonstrate that her reliance on the agency representations was objectively reasonable. Restatement (Second) of Contracts 90. We do not think it was reasonable for complainant to rely on the agency's promise in 1995 to pay compensatory damages in light of the Supreme Court's decision the previous year in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 would not be given retroactive effect. That decision made clear that compensatory damages were not awardable for the actions about which complainant had complained. It was not reasonable for complainant to accept as true the agency's implied representation to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, although the Commission has applied the doctrine of promissory estoppel to require an agency's compliance with a settlement agreement, in <span class="Italic">Jacobsohn v. Department of Health and Human Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930689 (June 2, 1994), the Commission declined to require an agency to pay $50,000 in "liquidated damages" as it had promised to do in a settlement agreement. The Commission did so because damages of that nature were not awardable under the applicable statute. That is precisely the situation in the instant case.</p>
