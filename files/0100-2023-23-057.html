<p class="noindent">Even though an agency may not rely on attendance in determining that an employee cannot perform the essential functions of a position, the employee must demonstrate that the agency knew the attendance problems were caused by a disability. In <span class="Italic">Walton v. Postmaster General</span>, 01934642 (1994), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that there was no evidence that appellant could not perform the essential functions of her position of clerk with the exception of when she was experiencing an asthma attack and had to be absent from work. The AJ further stated that the agency appeared to be arguing that appellant was not a qualified disabled person because she was unable to meet an essential job function of regular attendance. The AJ cited <span class="Italic">Purvis v. USPS</span>, EEOC No. 01921624, (August 19, 1992), for the proposition that if attendance is considered an essential job function, any frequently absent (disabled) employee would be considered unqualified, and the agency would consistently be able to avoid the issue of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that in <span class="Italic">Purvis, supra</span>, the agency had documented evidence of the complainant's disabling asthma condition prior to taking the disciplinary action against the complainant. However, in the instant case the responsible agency official denies having knowledge of appellant's disabling condition. There is nothing in the record showing that the responsible agency official knew that appellant's frequent absence history was caused by her disabling condition before the issuance of the seven-day suspension. Accordingly, the Commission agrees with the agency that it did not discriminate against appellant on the basis of her physical disability when it issued her the seven-day suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">LaMagra v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01990577 (2001) (holding that whether the complainant was a qualified individual with a disability was not relevant where she failed to establish a nexus between the effects of her medication and her tardiness on the day in question). In that case, the Commission noted that the complainant had a history of tardiness before her medical condition and, at the time she was late, had never mentioned the effects of her medication.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Southerland v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930714 (1994), the Commission clarified its position regarding work attendance as an essential function of a position. The Commission found that if the complainant demonstrates a nexus between his or her disability and attendance, then the burden shifts to the agency to demonstrate that accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency. In <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, the Commission distinguished an earlier case that suggested poor attendance could prevent a complainant from demonstrating he was a qualified individual with a disability on the basis that there was no showing that the absences were related to the disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On request to reconsider in both complaints, appellant argues, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that reconsideration is appropriate because the previous decisions erred when making the findings of no discrimination. We shall therefore analyze appellant's requests pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.407(c)(2). We conclude that appellant's request for reconsideration in the first complaint is properly granted on this basis, for the previous decision in that case, <span class="Italic">Bennett A. Southerland v. Marvin T. Runyon, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923403 (March 31, 1993), concluded that, with regard to the mental disability claims in both complaints, appellant was not a "qualified person with a disability" for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, because of his unexcused absences. We further find that reconsideration is justified pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.407(c)(2) for appellant's claim of race discrimination in the first complaint, as discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second complaint, we find that reconsideration is justified with regard to the mental disability, race, or reprisal claims in <span class="Italic">Bennett A. Southerland v. Marvin T. Runyon, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924583 (March 31, 1993). For the reasons discussed, below, however, the ultimate finding of no discrimination in that decision remains unchanged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Mental disability</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">By regulation, the federal government is charged with becoming "a model employer" of individuals with disabilities. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(b). This goal was also expressed by Congress when it enacted the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Morris</span>, 752 F.2d 1271 (8th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. United States Postal Service</span>, 662 F.2d 292, 301-02 (5th Cir. 1981). Federal agencies must make reasonable accommodation for the known physical and mental limitations of a qualified disabled employee, unless the agency can demonstrate that accommodation would prove to be an "undue hardship." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c). A "person with a disability" is one who: 1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits or restricts one or more of his or her major life activities; or 2) either has a record of such impairment or is regarded as having the impairment. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a). Major life activities include functions such as, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, self care, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on a failure to accommodate a disability, appellant must show: 1) that he is a "person with a disability" for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, as defined in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a); 2) that he is a "qualified person with a disability," in that he is qualified for and can perform the essential elements of the position at issue with or without reasonable accommodation, as specified in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6); and 3) he received an adverse employment action as a result of his disability. <span class="Italic">Arneson v. Heckler</span>, 50 FEP Cases 451 (8th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Treadwell v. Alexander</span>, 707 F.2d 473 (11th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. United States Postal Service</span>, 662 F.2d 242 (5th Cir. 1981). In addition, initially, appellant must make at least a facial showing that his disability can be accommodated. <span class="Italic">Treadwell</span>, 707 F.2d at 477-78.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the termination allegation in the first complaint, the previous decision cited the decision in <span class="Italic">Moody v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900177 (July 13, 1990) for the proposition that "in order to be considered a qualified person with a disability, [an] employee must be regular in attendance; and, frequent absences is a bar to being considered a qualified person with a disability." In the <span class="Italic">Moody</span> case, however, there was no finding that there was a nexus between the purported disability, hypertension and diabetes, and appellant's frequent absences. Further, there was some suggestion in the decision that appellant's sicknesses in <span class="Italic">Moody</span>, primarily bronchitis and viral illnesses, did not warrant the amount of time that appellant took off. For these reasons, then, we find <span class="Italic">Moody</span> to be distinguishable from the facts in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, recent Commission precedent has made it clear that in a case involving excessive absences from work, a complainant may prove that he or she is a "qualified disabled person"--in spite of such absences--by first showing that there is a sufficient nexus between the absences and the purported disability. <span class="Italic">See Omar v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920207 (May 14, 1992); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880859 (May 21, 1990); <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Department of Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 03920152 (September 2, 1993); <span class="Italic">Shipp v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912739 (December 19, 1991). The agency will then have the burden of demonstrating that it would pose "an undue hardship" for the agency to tolerate or excuse an employee's absences for a time. <span class="Italic">See Omar</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920207, at 8-9; <span class="Italic">Ruiz</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880859, at 6. As we have previously stated, the agency's concern that an employee maintain regular attendance is understandable, but it creates a circular argument that would ultimately prevent any disabled employee who is frequently absent from being considered a "qualified person with a disability." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For this reason, then, a federal agency could always avoid the issue of reasonable accommodation and undue hardship in such cases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all the aforementioned reasons, then, we find that it was not appropriate for the previous decision to conclude that, as to the mental disability claim, appellant was not a "qualified person with a disability" for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, solely on the basis that he had been absent from work for the period of time in question. <span class="Italic">See Bennett A. Southerland v. Marvin T. Runyon, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924583, at 6 (March 31, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the period of time for the absences in question, we conclude that appellant was discharged for his absences in July and August 1990, as <span id="Page_1161"></span>stated in the August 10, 1990 letter of removal, as well as for the fact that he was previously warned, in a January 16, 1990 letter, for absences occurring in November and December 1989. The Commission notes that during both times at issue, the record indicates that appellant was hospitalized for an extended period due to his mental illness. Although the August 10, 1990 letter of removal specifies only the absences occurring in July 1990, an affidavit from one of the deciding officials shows that the agency considered appellant's prior absences from this time period when deciding to discharge him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, it is incumbent upon the agency to investigate, supplement the record, and decide the issue of whether there is a sufficient nexus between the absences at issue and appellant's mental disability. The agency should make the determination in light of the relevant Commission precedent, including <span class="Italic">Omar</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920207 (three-quarters of absences related to disability, pelvic inflammatory disease, sufficient for finding of nexus); <span class="Italic">Shipp</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912739 (no nexus where 57% of unscheduled leave were related to disability, a back injury). If there is a sufficient nexus shown, the agency must then investigate, supplement the record, and decide the issue of whether the requested accommodation or any other reasonable accommodation would have proven to be an "undue hardship" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c) and existing case law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Nathan v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A13251 (2002) (complainant is not a qualified individual with a disability unless she can show a connection between her disability and the absences).</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on its Enforcement Guidance, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Cottrell v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A00004 (2001), held that attendance is not an essential function of any position. Cottrell involved a complainant with attention deficit disorder (ADD) who took medication that was difficult to properly prescribe. The agency claimed it could not accommodate the complainant's tardiness and absences. However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Cottrell</span> found that attendance is not an essential job function, and that as long as the complainant can show a nexus between the disability and the absences, and can perform the essential functions of the position, she is a qualified individual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regular attendance is not a fundamental job duty of any position. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Order No. 915.002, q. 22, at 33 n.61, (Mar. 1, 1999) ("Reasonable Accommodation Guidance"). Therefore, it cannot be considered an essential function. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To consider otherwise would create a circular argument preventing any employee with frequent disability-caused absences from being considered a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">See McNeil v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960436 (July 28, 1998) (citing <span class="Italic">McCullough v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950539 (Apr. 25, 1996)). In cases involving excessive absences from work, an employee may prove that she is a qualified individual with a disability in spite of such absences by first showing a sufficient nexus between the absences and the purported disability. <span class="Italic">See McCullough v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950539 (Apr. 25, 1996) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present complaint, complainant clearly established a nexus between her disability and tardiness. Further, the agency was aware of this cause for complainant's tardiness. The record provides no evidence of any other job function that complainant could not perform, or has not been able to perform during her years as a Motor Vehicles Operator. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant was a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although job attendance may not be considered an essential function of a job when there is nexus between attendance and the complainant's disability, that does not necessarily excuse an employee from following proper reporting procedures for absences and tardiness. An agency is not required to accommodate a departure from following proper reporting procedures unless there is nexus between the disability and the failure to report. Seldom will the employee be able to establish such nexus. However, in <span class="Italic">Schauer v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01970854 (2001), the complainant did establish a nexus based on the confusion created by shifting between multiple personalities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission is not persuaded by either the agency's or complainant's criticisms of the AJ's RD. We note that the agency did not dispute that complainant was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, a review of the record reveals that complainant's impairment substantially limited, at the very least, her ability to think and concentrate. Doctors testified that complainant's impairment, MPD/DID, involves the manifestation of up to eleven different personalities or "alters" within complainant. These alters assume control over complainant at different times and when a "switch" between two alters occurs, complainant often forgets what she was doing just moments before and has no idea how she arrived at her present location. Such an impairment obviously significantly restricts complainant's ability to think and concentrate as compared to the average person in the general population. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appendix to Part 1630-Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(ii); <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915-002 (March 3, 1997) (recognizing thinking, concentrating and interacting with others as major life activities).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the AJ was correct in finding that complainant was a "qualified" individual with a disability. A "qualified individual with a disability" is one who satisfies the requirements for the position she holds or desires and can perform the essential functions of that position with or without reasonable accommodation. 29 CFR 1630.2(m). The AJ correctly noted that complainant testified, without rebuttal, that she received an evaluation of "Excellent" for the period April 1992 to June 1992, the period during which she received the AWOL charges and the letter of reprimand. In rejecting the AJ's recommended finding, the agency argued in its FAD that complainant was not qualified for her position because her attendance was unreliable and sporadic, and that she therefore failed to fulfill an essential function of the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only question raised as to whether complainant could perform the essential functions of the position in question with or without reasonable accommodation thus pertains to her absences. Commission precedent makes clear that in a case involving excessive absences from work, a complainant may prove that she is a "qualified individual with a disability"--in spite of such absences--by first showing that there is a sufficient nexus between the absences and the purported disability. <span class="Italic">See Cottrell v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00004 (February 2, 2001); <span class="Italic">McNeil v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960436 (July 28, 1998); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950539 (April 25, 1996). The burden then becomes the agency's to demonstrate that it would pose an "undue hardship" for the agency to tolerate or excuse the complainant's absences. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, complainant has alleged that her absence on April 21, 1992 was due to a dissociative episode which not only kept her from attending work, but also prevented her from notifying her supervisors that she would be absent. Complainant's doctor provided the agency with an April 22, 1992 letter confirming this within a day of the absence. Complainant has therefore established that her absence was due to her disability. While we do not find that every unscheduled absence in complainant's history should be excused because of her disability, it is clear that the April 21, 1992 absence at issue was directly caused by complainant's disability. Moreover, the record indicates that complainant's supervisor (S1) was aware, or should have been aware, that complainant's disability might occasionally prevent her from calling in when she was going to be absent. S1 testified that she knew that at times alter personalities controlled complainant's actions and that complainant was often not aware of what she did when under an alter's control.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant has established a sufficient nexus between her disability and her absence, to establish that she is a "qualified individual with a disability." Accordingly, the agency now bears the burden of demonstrating that excusing that absence would pose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals, however, that the agency failed to meet this burden. In claiming that excusing the absence would pose an undue hardship, the agency merely notes that being present is especially important for complainant's position because she is a Service Representative and the first point of contact with the public. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1630.2(p) enumerates some of the factors that should be considered in determining whether an accommodation poses an undue hardship-such things as the impact of the accommodation upon the other employees to perform their duties, the cost of the accommodation, etc. As the AJ noted, the agency provided no probative evidence on these issues. For example, the agency does not discuss whether other Service Representatives could have assumed complainant's duties on days when she was absent or whether complainant could compensate for an absence on subsequent days. We find that the agency therefore failed to demonstrate that excusing the April 21, 1992 unscheduled absence would pose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that because the June 26, 1992 reprimand was partially based on the April 21, 1992 unscheduled absence, the agency subjected complainant to disability-based discrimination when it issued this reprimand. The AJ made this determination after acknowledging that complainant failed to establish that the other AWOL charges cited in the reprimand were caused by her disability. The agency failed to establish that the reprimand would have been issued absent the April 21, 1992 AWOL charge.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a performance appraisal is based primarily on the complainant's absences and those absences are directly caused by his disability, this constitutes direct evidence of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">Strawn v. General Services Administration</span>, 01943187 (1996). The rating official admitted that, if not for the complainant's absences, he was fully capable of performing well in his position.</p>
