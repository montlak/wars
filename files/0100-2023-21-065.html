<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-58"><span class="space">A.</span> HARASSMENT OF MALE EMPLOYEES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has consistently taken the position that, though victims of sexual harassment are most often female, Title VII also protects males from sexual harassment. Although there are some lower court decisions to the contrary, most courts to consider the question also have found that males are protected from sexual harassment under Title VII. Some courts, however, have held that males are subject to a higher burden of proof in sexual harassment cases than females. Such commentary by the courts probably should not be understood as actually imposing a higher burden of proof on male complainants--the burden of proof remains the preponderance of the evidence in all Title VII cases. Rather, the commentary was directed more to the fact that the reasonable inferences that may be drawn in a traditional "male harasses female" situation are not so easily drawn when the roles are reversed. The reality is that female sexual harassment of a male may simply be harder to prove.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a male employee receives the unwelcome attentions of a female coworker and the agency does not take prompt and effective remedial action after learning of the allegations, it will be liable under Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Gierut v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933461 (1994), the Commission was presented with just such a case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to each of the above elements we find the following. Appellant belongs to a statutorily protected group by virtue of his sex. Appellant asserted that he was subjected to a hostile work environment in that the female co-worker repeatedly over a period of time indicated her desire of having a personal intimate relationship with him. Appellant claimed that the female co-worker made her intentions known by giving him cards, purchasing gifts for him and, as appellant testified, following him on his route. Appellant was the object of the co-worker's attention because of his sex. Appellant maintained that the female co-worker's conduct unreasonably interfered with his work performance or engendered an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. Accordingly, we find that appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the evidence of record, the Commission agrees with the AJ that appellant was subjected to a hostile work environment. Appellant acknowledged that he and the female co-worker shared a platonic relationship. In contrast the female co-worker maintained that she and appellant shared a personal intimate relationship. Regardless of whether or not the relationship was of an intimate nature, appellant testified that on more than one occasion he told the female co-worker that he was not interested in pursuing a relationship and her continued attention was not welcome. The AJ found appellant's testimony in this regard credible. The male co-worker whom the female employee replaced on the dock supported appellant's testimony. The male employee testified that appellant never exhibited a personal interest in the female co-worker and, in fact, registered disgust when he was told that the female employee would be helping him on the dock. In contrast, the male employee testified that on several occasions the female co-worker stated that she was attracted to appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to avoid liability for hostile environment, an agency must show that: (1) the acts or conduct complained of did not occur; (2) the acts or conduct complained of were not "unwelcome"; (3) the alleged harassment was not "sufficiently severe or pervasive" to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment; (4) immediate and appropriate corrective action was taken as soon as the employer was put on notice; and/or (5) there is no basis for imputing liability to the employer under agency principles<span class="Italic">. See Vinson, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Dolton Postmaster, superintendent and supervisor all consistently testified that they were not aware of appellant's allegation of sexual harassment until the buttocks touching incident. The superintendent and the supervisor claimed that when appellant first contacted management he claimed that he wanted another individual to work with him on the dock without expressing why. Although appellant claimed that he advised management why he was making the request, management contended that he did not. Moreover, management did not ask why he was making the request. Although management's representation is questionable, it is undisputed that management was fully apprised of appellant's allegation of sexual harassment following the buttocks touching incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's response after being apprised of appellant's allegation was not sufficient to relieve it of liability. The superintendent testified that he did nothing for at least a week because he was attempting to resolve the matter and it took that time to bring the parties together. No determination was made as to the veracity of the allegations. When appellant returned to the facility he was basically told that in light of your allegation you either get over it and work with the female co-worker or do without assistance. Appellant was told this by Dolton management on more than one occasion. This attitude seems to be indicative of the attitude exhibited by management officials in response to this complaint. We note that it is the sworn opinion of the Dolton Postmaster that providing appellant with a hostile free environment in the form of an employee to assist him with his duties is a waste of agency resources. The superintendent told the EEO Counselor in the present matter that he thought it was kind of dumb for appellant to be pursuing this matter. The superintendent also told appellant that he either accept the female co-worker's assistance or work alone because he would not chaperon his employees. Appellant's supervisor apparently possessed the same attitude as indicated in her two letters to appellant. Appellant's testimony clearly indicated that he was offended by these two letters because they were issued without him having been consulted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although appellant clearly advised the agency of his allegation of sexual harassment on January 17th, he was not provided with alternate dock assistance until two and one half months later, after he filed the instant EEO complaint, sought medical attention because of the stress brought on by the situation, and retained the services of an attorney. The AJ found that the incident of January 17, 1991, in spite of the female co-worker's assertions to the contrary, more likely than not occurred. The AJ found appellant credible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that appellant has established that he was subjected to sexual harassment and the agency failed to take the immediate or appropriate action required by law to investigate appellant's allegation in September 1990 or January 1991 and remedy the situation....</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies would do well to heed the Commission's decision in this case. It appears from the recitation of facts that the employee's supervisors regarded his allegations that he was being harassed by a female to be frivolous. The Commission, in this case, gave no indication that it would impose any higher standard of proof on males than females in evaluating sexual harassment claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Twyman v. Secretary of Defense, DLA</span>, 01933597 (1994), the Commission found that the agency was liable for <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment of a male subordinate by a female supervisor. The Commission found the supervisor had made repeated propositions of her subordinate and intimated that things would be better for him at work if he submitted to her advances.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01934718 (1994), the Commission reaffirmed, without specific comment, the notion that males are protected from sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cerullo v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05930948 (1994) (involving a male employee alleging sexual harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01950342 (1997), the Commission found that a male appellant demonstrated both <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> and hostile environment sexual harassment, as well as harassment based on gender:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, appellant belongs to a statutorily protected group. Second, we find that appellant was subjected to unwelcome sexual advances and <span id="Page_857"></span>other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, including the RO's scratching or grabbing of herself in front of appellant; the RO's unusual interest in and attention to appellant, which included calling his name continually and asking other employees personal questions about him; and the RO's comment that she bet appellant had "never had a 50 year old virgin." In its final decision, the agency contended that appellant had only referred to the crotch-grabbing incident at the hearing. A thorough review of the record reveals, however, that this is not true. Appellant testified during the investigation that the RO had scratched her private area in front of him in a manner which appeared sexually suggestive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also dismissed the "50 year old virgin" comment because it found that the only other witness was a former co-worker whose dislike of the RO was so intense that he quit in order to avoid going to prison. We note that although there were no other witnesses to this particular incident, appellant offered numerous witnesses, both during the investigation and at the hearing, who corroborated his contention that the RO had shown an unusual personal interest in him. Several witnesses testified that the RO was "after" appellant and asked personal questions about him. The agency has also contended that because the RO was unpopular with the employees in the Dietetic Service, we should not find these employees' testimony credible. We see no reason for the RO's unpopularity to be used against appellant, especially where there is no support for the RO's version of events; if anything, the RO's problems with other employees lend further support to appellant's allegations, not less. We therefore find that a preponderance of the evidence establishes that appellant was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment. We also find that but for appellant's sex, he would not have been the object of this harassment; the evidence clearly establishes that the harassment was based on the RO's romantic interest in appellant. Accordingly, we find that appellant has satisfied the three common elements for a showing of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of both <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> and hostile environment sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for appellant's <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> claim, we find that appellant's rejection of the RO's unwelcome advances was detrimental to appellant's job. Specifically, the RO began treating appellant worse than other employees after he rejected her advances. One employee testified that everything appellant did was wrong, and that the RO "stayed on" appellant more than on any other employee. Another employee testified that it appeared that the RO was trying to "get things" on appellant, including attempting to make it appear that he had stolen some missing food items. Accordingly, we find that appellant has established that he was the victim of <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that appellant has established that he was the victim of hostile environment sexual harassment because he has also established that the complained of conduct unreasonably interfered with his work performance, and created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. Several witnesses testified that the extra assignments that the RO gave appellant appeared to interfere with appellant's normal job duties. There is also evidence that the RO's conduct created an offensive working environment, whereby appellant became the butt of other employees' jokes, including being called "polka dot" and "P.D." Several witnesses also testified that appellant exhibited a decrease in morale as a result of the RO's sexual harassment. Accordingly, we find that appellant was the victim of hostile environment sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency contended that the acts/conduct complained of did not occur, it has failed to provide evidence in support of its contention. Further, it failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action as soon as it was put on notice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the RO's treatment of appellant subsequent to his rejection of her sexual advances constituted harassment based on sex or gender, not sexual harassment.... We find that appellant has established that he was subjected to a hostile work environment based on his gender. As noted above, several witnesses testified to the abuse that the RO subjected appellant to after he rejected her advances. One witness testified that the abuse was so bad that appellant indicated to him that maybe he (appellant) should have accepted the RO's sexual advances because he was "going through hell." Although the agency has indicated that the RO's treatment of appellant was similar to her treatment of the other employees, the overwhelming weight of the testimony and the evidence indicates that appellant was treated substantially worse than other employees. Accordingly, we find that appellant was discriminated against based on his gender.</p>
<p class="noindent">If there was any doubt that males are protected from sexual harassment under Title VII, the Supreme Court unambiguously resolved that doubt in <span class="Italic">Oncale, supra</span>. Citing its previous opinion in <span class="Italic">Newport News Shipbuilding &#x0026; Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC</span>, 462 U.S. 669, 103 S. Ct. 2622, 77 L. Ed.2d 89 (1983), holding that Title VII protects males as well as females, the Court in <span class="Italic">Oncale</span> restated the obvious--sexual harassment of males is prohibited by Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one decision, the Commission suggested that, because it is rare, males may not recognize offensive conduct as sexual harassment. In <span class="Italic">Lubina v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01971553 (2001), the complainant originally alleged the harassment, consisting of his female supervisor kissing and hugging him, was not sexual in nature. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Lubina</span> found that this characterization of the conduct was not significant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the hostile environment allegation, the AJ found credible testimony that complainant was sexually harassed by his supervisor. The AJ found that complainant's supervisor used her position of power to intimidate complainant and her other subordinates, and that one form of that intimidation was repeated unwanted physical contacts which, because of their intimate nature, fall into the category of sexual harassment. The AJ determined that complainant's supervisor did kiss and hug complainant on numerous occasions, and that complainant was extremely offended by his supervisor's unwelcomed hugs and kisses. In addition, the AJ found that complainant's supervisor kissed or attempted to kiss complainant on the lips three times. Two other male investigators testified that they had seen complainant's supervisor, who was also their supervisor, hug and kiss complainant. The AJ also found that complainant's supervisor had kissed these two other male investigators on the lips. The AJ determined, based upon the circumstances of the case, that complainant's supervisor's action of kissing complainant on the lips was "sexually charged."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that complainant was treated differently by his supervisor on account of his sex. The AJ determined that complainant's supervisor's treatment of male employees differed from her treatment of female employees. Specifically, if complainant's supervisor did kiss and hug female employees, as she did male employees, she did not kiss female employees on the lips; whereas, she did kiss male employees on the lips.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found the agency's argument that complainant's supervisor's conduct was not sexual in nature unpersuasive, and complainant's explanation for his initial mischaracterization of the sexual harassment issue in his letter persuasive. The Commission notes that credibility determinations of the AJ are entitled to deference due to the AJ's first-hand knowledge, through personal observation, of the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses at the hearing<span class="Italic">. Esquer v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960096 (September 6, 1996); <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900589 (July 26, 1990). In complainant's letter to the agency requesting a transfer, he referenced himself as "being subjected to numerous unsolicited physical contacts although not sexual in intent or nature (hugging, kissing)...." The AJ found that since sexual harassment has often been perpetrated by men against women, that it is credible that a man might not initially recognize or identify such conduct as sexual harassment when it involves a reversal of that conventional pattern. This is particularly significant in a case, such as this, alleging hostile work environment sexual harassment in which the unwelcome physical contact need not be aimed at forcing a sexual liaison.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the remedy, the AJ determined that complainant had adduced sufficient evidence to establish that "the sexual harassment did result in mental and emotional distress." Based on this, the AJ determined that complainant was entitled to compensatory damages, though she did not recommend a specific amount of such damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency issued its final decision adopting the AJ's finding of no discrimination, and rejecting the AJ's finding of discrimination. It is from this decision that complainant now appeals. In his statement on appeal, complainant only challenges the agency's final decision insofar as it rejects the AJ's finding of discrimination based upon sexual harassment, and he requests that we uphold the AJ's recommended decision. In this appeal, complainant does not challenge the agency's final decision adopting the AJ's recommended finding of no disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record in its entirety, including statements submitted on appeal, the EEOC hearing transcripts, the AJ's recommended decision, the FAD, and arguments and evidence not specifically addressed in this decision, the Commission finds that the AJ's recommended decision is supported by substantial evidence. Nothing proffered from the agency in its final decision differs significantly from the arguments presented at the hearing and given full consideration by the AJ. Therefore, the Commission discerns no basis upon which to overturn the AJ's finding of discrimination in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Homes v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120055036 (2007), the Commission found that a male complainant had been subjected to harassment by his female supervisor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the agency's assertions, the Commission determines that the incidents described by the complainant, taken together, were sufficiently severe to create an intimidating, hostile, and offensive environment. For example, the record indicates S1 made comments about complainant's body and how he looked, make sexual innuendos to him, pulled up her dress so complainant could see her underwear, kissed him, pulled up her skirt to her thigh area in his presence, and grabbed his buttocks. <span class="Italic">See Shinkis v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A10699 (September 25, 1992) (supervisor staring at an employee's legs for several minutes; unwelcome touching; and making comments about her figure were <span id="Page_858"></span>sufficient to constitute a hostile work environment). The record contains a number of statements by complainant's coworkers recounting their observations of S1's treatment of complainant which confirms his allegations that the harassment occurred on a continuing basis rather than in an isolated incident. Moreover, there is no evidence that complainant solicited or welcomed S1's actions. Based on the evidence of record, we find that the pattern of calling complainant into the office on a frequent basis and engaging in sexual conduct had the effect of creating a hostile environment based on sex.</p>
