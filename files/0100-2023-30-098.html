<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-95"><span class="space">A.</span> AUTHORITY TO AWARD</h3>
<p class="noindent">Shortly after passage of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the Commission held that it had the authority to make compensatory damage awards in administrative proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01923399 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Jackson I</span>). That seemed to be the end of the matter. However, in 1998, decisions began to emerge from the courts holding that, under the 1991 Civil Rights Act, only the district courts and not the EEOC had authority to award compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Due to a conflict of opinion on the issue in the circuit courts of appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court, at the request of the Solicitor General, granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to decide the issue. In <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed.2d 196 (1999), in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the EEOC does have the authority to issue compensatory damage awards against federal agencies in the administrative process.</p>
<p class="noindent">In adopting Part 1614 in 1992, the Commission chose not address the issue of compensatory damages in its regulations, electing instead to confront the issue on a case-by-case basis. See Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-12-135.html#sec3-132">Compensatory Damages</a>." Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Jackson I</span>, a case involving the dismissal of a complaint for failure to accept an offer of full relief, the Commission held that federal employees proving intentional discrimination under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act are entitled to compensatory damages under the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The Commission rejected arguments that the new civil rights legislation applied only to civil actions in U.S. district court. While not setting forth any specific standard of proof, the Commission also found that complainants are required to submit actual, objective proof of their damages and further to prove, with objective evidence, that the damages are connected to the discriminatory action at issue. Because <span class="Italic">Jackson I</span> specifically involved a claim for reimbursement of medical expenses, the Commission did not address the full scope of "compensatory damages." The Commission's analysis in <span class="Italic">Jackson I</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he agency's offer, however, fails to address the issue of compensatory damages in the form of medical expenses allegedly incurred by appellant as a result of the stress caused by the agency's alleged harassment. The Commission finds that the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, ("CRA") makes compensatory damages available to federal sector complainants in the administrative process. This conclusion is based upon a thorough examination of the statute's language and policy considerations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the complainant shows objective evidence that he or she has incurred compensatory damages, and that the damages are related to the alleged unlawful discrimination, the agency must address the issue of compensatory damages in its offer of full relief. Here, the appellant has stated that he suffered stress from the agency's alleged harassment, and that this stress resulted in his seeking additional medical care for his high blood pressure. The record shows that in the pre-complaint counseling process, the appellant requested damages for medical expenses incurred. Accordingly, prior to making its offer of full relief, the agency should have requested from the appellant objective evidence of the alleged damages incurred. In this case, such proof could have taken the form of receipts and/or bills for medical care, medication and transportation to the doctor. In addition, the agency should have requested that appellant provide objective evidence linking these damages to the alleged unlawful discrimination. Such a showing would have been sufficient to require the agency to address the issue of compensatory damages in its offer of full relief. The relief offered by the agency, however, did not address the issue of compensatory damages. The Commission finds therefore that the agency's offer does not constitute full relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a federal agency or the EEOC finds that a federal employee has been discriminated against, the agency must provide full relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.501(a); 29 CFR Part 1613, Appx. A. Under the CRA, this would include a payment of compensatory damages to an identified victim of discrimination on a make-whole basis for any losses suffered as a result of the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002, "<span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available under 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991</span>" (July 14, 1992). The Commission has recognized that the basic effectiveness of its law enforcement program, whether in the private or federal sector, is dependent upon securing prompt, comprehensive and complete relief for individuals affected by violations of the statutes it enforces. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR Part 1613, Appx. A.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102 of the CRA permits a complaining party pursuing an "action" under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 USC 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 USC 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., or the federal employment sections of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC 791, to recover compensatory damages in the case of intentional discrimination. While it may be argued that the term action, as used in the CRA refers only to a civil action in court, such an interpretation is not supported by the statutory language of the CRA as a whole and the principles of statutory interpretation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsection 102(a)(1) of the CRA provides that: "In an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-5) against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination...the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages...in addition to any other relief authorized by section 706 (g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, from the respondent." Subsection 102(a)(2) provides that: "In an action brought by a complaining party under the powers, remedies, and procedures set forth in...section 505(a)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 794a(a)(1))...against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination...under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 791) and the regulations implementing section 501, or who violated the requirements of section 501 of the Act or the regulations implementing section 501 concerning the provision of a reasonable accommodation...the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages...from the respondent."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsection 102(a)(2), cited above, expressly permits a complaining party to recover damages for violations of the Rehabilitation Act through the <span id="Page_1786"></span>federal sector regulations and procedures providing administrative relief under the Rehabilitation Act. Accordingly, the term "action" in this subsection includes both court actions and the administrative process. This language clearly provides compensatory damages in the administrative process for actions brought under the Rehabilitation Act. Although subsection 102(a)(1) does not make reference to the federal sector regulations implementing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, there is nothing in the legislative history of the CRA to indicate that Congress intended to treat the individuals protected by these two statutes differently. The Commission finds that the most plausible reason for the failure of subsection 102(a)(1) to mention the administrative process is that Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 explicitly provides for an administrative complaint process, while section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act lacks such a provision. The difference in the language of the two subsections is merely a statutory recognition by the drafters of the CRA that the administrative complaint process under the Rehabilitation Act derives from, and is patterned on, the administrative procedure authorized under section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further support for the conclusion that compensatory damages are recoverable in the administrative process comes from the definition of "complaining party" in subsection 102(d)(1)(A). That subsection defines the term "complaining party" for purposes of section 102 as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The term "complaining party" means--in the case of a person seeking to bring an action under subsection (a)(1), the (EEOC), the Attorney General, or a person who may bring an action or proceeding under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complaining party is similarly defined in section 102(d)(1)(B) for persons bringing an "action or proceeding" under the Rehabilitation Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The definition of complaining party provided by subsection 102(d)(1)(A) relates directly back to subsection 102(a)(1) and expressly includes within the group of persons bringing an "action" under subsection 102(a), any person who may bring an action or proceeding under Title VII. Complaining party, as defined, is consistent with subsection 102(a)(2). The definition of a complaining party defines the scope of subsection 102(a)(1) to provide complainants with an option to pursue their damage remedy in either an "action or proceeding."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation that courts are required to give effect to every clause and word of a statute, if possible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Menasche</span>, 348 U.S. 528 (1955); <span class="Italic">R.E. Dietz Corp. v. United States</span>, 939 F.2d 1, 5 (2d Cir. 1991). When read together, subsections 102(a)(1), 102(a)(2), and 102(d) permit a complaining party under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act to obtain compensatory damages in either an action or proceeding. The plain meaning of the term "proceeding" includes administrative proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">New York Gaslight Club v. Carey</span>, 447 U.S. 54 (1980), is instructive as to the meaning of the term "proceeding" as it is used by Congress. In that case the Court addressed for the first time issues that arise when administrative proceedings are used to enforce civil rights. The Court authorized an award of attorney's fees in federal court litigation for work performed in State administrative proceedings. The Court focused on the requirement in Title VII that complainants first pursue state administrative remedies before filing an action in federal district court. Having successfully enforced her rights at the State administrative level, the plaintiff sought recovery of attorney's fees in federal court under Title VII's fees provision. The Court decided that use of the words "action or proceeding" included in Title VII's fee provision indicated Congress' intent to authorize fee awards for work done in administrative proceedings and, therefore, the availability of attorneys' fees would not depend on whether the claimant succeeded at the administrative level or prevailed in court. Thus, Congress' use of the words "or proceeding" was more than surplusage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The holding in <span class="Italic">New York Gaslight Club</span> that the words "or proceeding" is more than surplusage supports the conclusion that the use of the same words in section 102(d)(1)(A) is an expression of Congress' intent to provide damages in the administrative process. Had Congress intended to require complainants to file civil actions to recover damages, it simply could have used language in subsections 102(a)(2) and 102(d) identical to that in subsection 102(a)(1) and not mentioned other proceedings and actions under the regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another relevant concern of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">New York Gaslight Club</span> was that if fees were not awarded for conclusive administrative proceedings, the result would be the filing of unnecessary lawsuits. The existence of an incentive to file a complaint in federal court, such as the availability of a fee or damage award, would ensure that almost all Title VII complainants would abandon the administrative process for the courts as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that in the context of an offer of full relief, the agency's offer must address compensatory damages where the complainant shows some objective evidence that he or she has incurred compensatory damages, and that the damages are related to the alleged unlawful discrimination. The agency need only consider the issue of compensatory damages for alleged discriminatory conduct occurring on or after November 21, 1991. Because the appellant in this case made a claim for damages related to the alleged discriminatory conduct of the agency, the agency should have requested from the appellant some objective proof of the alleged damages incurred, as well as objective evidence linking those damages to the adverse actions at issue, prior to making its offer of full relief. Therefore, appellant was under no obligation to accept the agency's offer, and the agency's decision to cancel the complaint for failure to accept a certified offer of full relief was improper and is VACATED. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.107(h). The complaint is hereby REMANDED to the agency for further processing from the point processing ceased in accordance with this decision and applicable Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Postal Service challenged the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Jackson I,</span> requesting reconsideration and making three arguments. First, the Postal Service argued that the Federal Employees' Compensation Act provided the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries and, because Jackson's claim for compensatory damages related to medical expenses incurred in the treatment of stress caused by the alleged discriminatory harassment, he could not recover under the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The Postal Service also argued that the decision to award compensatory damages could not be made through adjudication, but that the Commission only could do so through the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. Finally, it argued that the <span class="Italic">Jackson I</span> decision constituted an "order" under Executive Order 12067, which could not be issued without the opportunity for public comment. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930306 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Jackson II</span>), the Commission rejected all three challenges.</p>
<p class="noindent">Addressing in <span class="Italic">Jackson II</span> the argument that FECA was an exclusive remedy for work-related injuries, the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FECA was designed to ensure that federal employees injured on the job would receive the appropriate medical attention. 5 USC 8102(a). This Act waives the traditional defenses available to an employer, and for this reason, is considered a no-fault statute, the equivalent federal remedy comparable to state worker's compensation acts. An employee's claim for these worker's compensation benefits may consist of reparation for physical injury and payment for lost wages. 5 USC 8103, 8105-07, 8110. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paolozzi v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920423 (August 3, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the agency, the liability of the United States under this Act is exclusive. More specifically, the Act provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter (5 USC 8101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.) or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee...entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen's compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 USC 8116(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the relevant <span class="Italic">quid</span> <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">quo</span> associated with workers' compensation benefits. In <span class="Italic">Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. United States</span>, 460 U.S. 190, 193-94 (1983), the Court wrote, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In enacting this provision, Congress adopted the principal compromise--the '<span class="Italic">quid</span> <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">quo</span>'--commonly found in worker's compensation legislation: employees are guaranteed the right to receive immediate, fixed benefits, regardless of fault and without need for litigation, but in return they lose the right to sue the government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Lockheed Aircraft</span> went on to state that the FECA was "designed to protect the Government from suits under statutes, such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, that had been enacted to waive the Government's sovereign immunity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 193.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the agency, the federal remedial scheme embodied in the FECA is the exclusive remedy for a federal employee, like appellant, to pursue claims for medical expenses stemming from work-related injuries and illnesses. The agency maintains that the FECA preempts all other remedies in this area that may otherwise arise, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Black v. Frank</span>, 730 F. Supp. 1087 (S.D. Ala. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the FECA is not the exclusive remedy in the case before us for appellant's claim of unlawful discrimination and harassment, and the resultant mental stress and high blood pressure. By its very language, section 8116(c) demonstrates that the government's liability is exclusive for death or injury to an employee in an administrative proceeding "under a workmen's compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability <span id="Page_1787"></span>statute." In the matter before us, appellant does not seek reimbursement for an injury in an administrative proceeding under a workmen's compensation statute or federal tort liability statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, courts and the Commission have not held that worker's compensation under FECA is the exclusive remedy when the injury is caused by discrimination prohibited by Title VII. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Corroon &#x0026; Black Corp.</span>, 845 F.2d 104 (5th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Bolder</span>, 802 F.2d 660 (3d Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Frank</span>, 732 F. Supp. 1085 (D. Or. 1990); <span class="Italic">Davis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (December 29, 1990).(4) <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Black v. Frank</span>, 730 F. Supp. 1087 (D. Ala. 1990).(5) Further, in analyzing the exclusivity issue, courts have stressed that the legislative history of the FECA demonstrates that it was meant to preclude suits under alternative federal tort liability suits. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Miller v. Bolerer</span>, 802 F.2d at 663; <span class="Italic">Reep v. United States</span>, 557 F.2d 204, 207 (9th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Frank</span>, 732 F. Supp. at 1088-89.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, for these reasons, based on the explicit language of section 8116(c) as well as the scope and purpose behind the FECA, we find that Congress did not intend this worker's compensation statute to be the exclusive remedy for a federal employee bringing a complaint alleging discrimination and harassment, including a request for compensatory damages related to mental stress and high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;In the <span class="Italic">Davis</span> case, the Commission held that an employee's recovery of FECA benefits did not preclude him from pursuing a back pay remedy under Title VII, noting that the FECA only paid 75% of his regular pay. As in the court cases, the remedy in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> was an equitable one. In one case, however, a court went beyond the scope of equitable remedies in a discrimination case, holding that the FECA remedies pursuant to 5 USC 8101 do not provide an exclusive remedy in light of complainant's discrimination claim, including a request for relief related to mental distress. <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. United States</span>, 428 F. Supp. 79 (E.D. Wisc. 1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;The court in <span class="Italic">Black v. Frank</span> did not, however, make its determination in the context we face today--how the exclusivity provision of the FECA applies in light of the compensatory damages provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote, the Commission noted, however, that the compensatory damages provision does not entitle a complainant to double recovery under the Civil Rights Act and the FECA.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its next argument, the Postal Service contended that the Commission was required to use the formal rulemaking procedures under the APA by publishing notice of a proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register and eliciting comment on the proposed rule. In <span class="Italic">Jackson II</span>, the Commission soundly rejected this challenge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By this line of reasoning, however, the agency ignores the obvious character of the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> decision as an adjudicatory-type decision with an accompanying order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. v. Local 134</span>, 419 U.S. 428 (1975); <span class="Italic">American Express Co. v. United States</span>, 472 F.2d 1050 (1973). The existence of a dispute concerning specific individuals is a distinguishing characteristic of adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Florida East Coast Railway Co.</span>, 410 U.S. 224 (1973); <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Watt</span>, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">First Bancorporation v. Board of Governors</span>, 728 F.2d 434, 437-38 (10th Cir. 1984). Moreover, in practice, we recognize that action taken by the Commission, addressed to named parties engaged in a controversy, which settles the dispute and makes a final disposition, is an informal adjudication. Thus, the agency's line of arguments prefaced by the proposition that the decision in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> is an administrative "rule," as that term is expressed by 5 USC 551(4), are in error, and we consequently reject them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, a basic tenet of administrative law supports the Commission's discretion to choose between adjudication and rulemaking when interpreting statutes and regulations committed to its authority. <span class="Italic">Beazer East, Inc. v. U.S. E.P.A., Region III</span>, 963 F.2d 603 (3d. Cir. 1992). Neither the APA nor the relevant civil rights statutes direct the Commission to use either rulemaking or adjudication. The APA, instead, contains descriptions and procedures for both rulemaking and adjudication, but it does not compel one form of proceeding over the other.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The law is well settled that the Commission has the discretion to choose between proceeding by general rule or by individual litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co.</span>, 416 U.S. 267 (1974); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co.</span>, 394 U.S. 759 (1969); <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947). According to the Fifth circuit, the discretion to proceed through case-by-case adjudications, rather than the rulemaking process, is essential because flexibility encourages administrative efficiency. <span class="Italic">Avoyelles Sportsmen's League, Inc. v. Marsh</span>, 715 F.2d 897, 909 (5th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Courts of Appeal, following the line of U.S. Supreme Court cases, especially <span class="Italic">Bell Aerospace</span> and <span class="Italic">Wyman-Gordon</span>, have held that an administrative agency is not precluded from announcing new principles or principles contrary to existing law in an adjudicative proceeding. <span class="Italic">Beazer East, Inc.</span>, 963 F.2d at 609; <span class="Italic">First Bancorporation v. Board of Governors</span>, 728 F.2d at 437; <span class="Italic">Avoyelles Sportsmen's League, Inc. v. Marsh</span>, 715 F.2d at 909; <span class="Italic">Central Ark. Auction Sale, Inc. v. Bergland</span>, 570 F.2d 724 (8th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. F.C.C.</span>, 538 F.2d 359 (D.C. 1976). The courts have also stated that an administrative agency may establish a principle of general application, in either a statutory rulemaking procedure or in an individual adjudication. <span class="Italic">Mobil Oil Exploration and Producing v. FERC</span>, 881 F.2d 193 (5th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Shell Oil Co. v. FERC</span>, 707 F.2d 230 (5th Cir. 1983) (citing <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Bell Aerospace</span>, 416 U.S. 267).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the issue before us is plainly decided by the <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery</span> case, the seminal case in this area which "overshadows all other law on the subject." 2 K.C. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 7:25 (2d ed. 1979). In <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery</span>, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the SEC's retroactive clarification of uncertain law through adjudication. 332 U.S. 194 (1947). Justice Murphy, writing for four justices in the plurality, concluded that "(t)here is a very definite place for the case-by-case evolution of statutory standards" and "the choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, <span class="Italic">ad</span> <span class="Italic">hoc</span> litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 202-203. In addition, the plurality wrote that the quasi-legislative promulgation of rules, available to the SEC, but not the courts, was appropriately used for "filling in the interstices" of the Act it was interpreting, but that "any rigid requirement to that effect would make the administrative process inflexible and incapable of dealing with many of the specialized problems which arise." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 202.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, on a full-relief question, the Commission's previous decision in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> interpreted Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 as permitting a federal employee to pursue an "action" in the administrative process before the EEOC, in order to recover compensatory damages for intentional discrimination, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <span class="Italic">Richard Jackson v. Marvin T. Runyon, Jr., Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923399 (November 12, 1992). Being a case of first impression, recently raised by the enactment of the 1991 Act, the previous decision exhaustively considered Section 102 in the light of principles of legislative history and statutory interpretation. In accordance with <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery</span> and its extensive line of progeny, the previous decision properly used the adjudicative process to establish precedent and to interpret the Civil Rights Act of 1991, in accordance with Congressional authority and the other statutes and regulations committed to its authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making this determination, we reject the agency's contention that the Commission opted to interpret the Civil Rights Act of 1991 as excluding compensatory damages in this context by its April 10, 1992 publication of its final rule on processing EEO complaints filed by federal employees and applicants for federal employment. Such was not the intent of the Commission, nor is there any language in the final rule addressing the new provision on compensatory damages from the 1991 Act. If the agency involved in this matter interpreted the April 10, 1992 action as determining <span class="Italic">sub</span> <span class="Italic">silentio</span> that compensatory damages were unavailable in the administrative process, then the agency was in error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we reject the agency's claim that <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery</span> "described only three circumstances where it would be permissible for an agency to enunciate statutory standards in an adjudicatory process on a case-by-case basis." In fact, the Court spoke much more broadly in this case, and did not state that the three situations it described as supporting the need for adjudication were part of an all-inclusive list. In addition, to make the agency's claim is to ignore the line of subsequent Supreme Court and U.S. Circuit Court cases which state the rule in <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery</span> broadly and apply it in more extreme situations than the one we face today. Moreover, the APA was not in effect in 1947 when <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery</span> was decided, and, as described above, we see the APA as providing further support for the Commission's authority to rule on the issue of the applicability of compensatory damages through its previous decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the agency is not convincing when it argues that the holding in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Bell Aerospace</span>, 416 U.S. at 294-95, suggests that an adjudication might be improper in a case seeking to impose "some new liability." In making its determination, the Court in <span class="Italic">Bell Aerospace</span> reasoned that it was "not a case in which some new liability is sought to be imposed on individuals for past actions which were taken in good-faith reliance on (NLRB) pronouncements." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 295. We do not see <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> as creating new "liability," for the liability in this context is the violation of federal employment discrimination law. Liability is separate and apart from the subsequent question concerning the specific expenses for which a federal agency will be responsible once a finding of liability is made. Put another way, the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> case addressed and decided an issue of remedy, not liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, <span class="Italic">Bell Aerospace</span> reversed the Court of Appeals decision which stated that "the argument for rulemaking is especially strong when the (NLRB) is proposing to reverse a long-standing and oft-repeated policy on which industry and labor have relied." 475 F.2d at 496-97. Instead, the U.S. Supreme Court supported the NLRB's right to choose adjudication over rulemaking, even when the NLRB was "announcing new principles." <span id="Page_1788"></span>As the Court noted, the NLRB's "judgment that adjudication best serves this purpose is entitled to great weight." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 294.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Lastly, the Postal Service attempted to argue that the <span class="Italic">Jackson I</span> decision constituted a proposed order under Executive Order 12067 and, as such, could not be enacted without the opportunity for public comment. The Commission found this argument equally unpersuasive in <span class="Italic">Jackson II</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the agency's argument that the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> "constitutes an 'order' within the meaning of Executive Order 12067." Executive Order 12067, 43 Fed. Reg. 9726 (June 30, 1978), provides for the July 1, 1978 transfer to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of all the functions of the EEO Coordinating Council, as provided by Section 6 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 43 Fed. Reg. 19807. (footnote omitted). The agency would have us interpret the term "order" in Sections 1-303 and 1-305 of Executive Order 12067 as being the type of order issued by decision in the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1-303 of Executive Order 12067 provides that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission "shall issue such rules, regulations, policies, procedures, or orders as it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities under (Executive Order 12067)." Also, Section 1-303 states that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall consult with federal agencies during the development of "proposed rules, regulations, policies, procedures, or orders." The order accompanying the decision in the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> case is not a "proposed order" under Section 1-303, but is instead an adjudicatory order which does not and could not require consultation with the agency, a party to the adjudication, prior to its issuance. Quite the contrary, the language "proposed" suggests action taken by the Commission in its quasi-legislative role or its role as administrator. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, Compliance Manual, Order No. 915.001. Most important, the Commission's authority, through the Office of Federal Operations, to issue adjudicatory-type decisions with accompanying orders, stems from Congressional authority under 42 USC 2000e-16 and Executive Order No. 12106, and not from Executive Order No. 12067.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1-305 of Executive Order 12067 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Before promulgating significant rules, regulations, policies, procedures or orders involving equal employment opportunity, the Commission and affected departments and agencies shall afford the public an opportunity to comment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Again, the same principles apply to Section 1-305 as did for Section 1-303. It is also true that Section 1-305 clearly does not involve the issue of notice to federal agencies, but instead describes the rights of the public, and thus for that reason too is inapplicable to the case before us.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although <span class="Italic">Jackson II</span> certainly represented a major triumph for victims of intentional discrimination under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, it appeared the Commission might be taking a very narrow view of what constitutes compensatory damages. Its requirements of "objective" proof of not only damages, but a nexus between the harm and the discriminatory action, seemed to establish a high threshold for proof of damages. A discussion of the application of compensatory damages to discrimination cases is included in the sections below.</p>
<p class="noindent">After <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, the issue of the Commission's authority to award damages appeared to be resolved. Ironically, it was not an agency that next opposed the Commission's authority to award compensatory damages; it was an employee. In <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 1997), the employee appealed the district court's dismissal of his civil action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Specifically, the district court found that the plaintiff failed to accept a certified offer of full relief in the administrative process and, therefore, was barred from filing a civil action. In an unpublished opinion, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the district court because the offer of full relief did not contain an award of compensatory damages. The district court again dismissed the case, finding that the plaintiff never asked for compensatory damages in the administrative proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal for the second time, the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> argued that he had not requested compensatory damages in the administrative process because such damages can be awarded only in civil actions in U.S. district court. The argument was based on 42 USC 1981a(d), which allows either party to request a jury trial when a complainant seeks compensatory damages. Since a jury trial cannot be obtained in the administrative process, the plaintiff contended, the Commission had no authority to award damages. The Fifth Circuit brushed aside those arguments in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, 121 F.3d at 207-08:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although no federal circuit court has addressed the issue, we hold that administrative agencies may offer compensatory damages for emotional injury to federal employees pursuing a Title VII claim. A textual analysis of Title VII supports our view. Title 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2) provides that a party may recover compensatory damages against an employer in an "action" brought pursuant to 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-5 or 2000e-16. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2). Nowhere does Title VII define whether the term "action" refers to a district court suit, an administrative proceeding, or both. Regardless, the text of Title VII's remedial provisions demonstrates that compensatory damages are available in administrative proceedings. First, &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a) is a broad anti-discrimination provision prohibiting discrimination in federal employment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). Section 2000e-16(b) grants the EEOC wide-ranging authority to enforce the anti-discrimination provisions of subsection (a) through "appropriate remedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b). That subsection also directs the EEOC to "effectuate the policies of this section, and...issue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this section." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We think that this mandate, as described in &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b), is sufficiently broad to allow the EEOC to offer--or to certify or approve an administrative agency's offer of full relief that includes compensatory damages for emotional injuries. In addition to specifically authorizing back pay, which is a form of compensatory damages, the statute charges the EEOC to adopt measures that it deems "necessary and appropriate." When a federal employee suffers harm that may be remedied by compensatory damages, it is certainly necessary and appropriate for the EEOC to grant such relief. Given that the purpose of Title VII is to make injured claimants whole, <span class="Italic">see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 419, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 2372, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975), we do not believe that Congress would have created an administrative process capable of providing only partial relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, to hold that compensatory damages are available only in civil actions brought in federal district court would be antithetical to the exhaustion requirement. Congress created the EEOC and established administrative procedures so that aggrieved employees could "settle disputes through conference, conciliation, and persuasion" before they are permitted to file lawsuits. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.</span>, 415 U.S. 36, 44, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 1017, 39 L. Ed.2d 147 (1974). If complainants could receive compensatory damages only in district court, they would be encouraged either to "intentionally bypass the administrative process and go straight to district court or perfunctorily go through the administrative process and then seek judicial review to obtain full relief." <span class="Italic">McAdams v. Reno</span>, 858 F. Supp. 945, 951 (D. Minn. 1994) (finding that compensatory damages are available in administrative proceedings), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds</span>, 64 F.3d 1137 (8th Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our holding is also consistent with the practice of the EEOC, which specifically held that compensatory damages are available in administrative proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923399 (Nov. 12, 1992). We afford considerable weight and deference to an agency's interpretation of a statute it administers if Congress has not spoken directly to the precise question at issue. <span class="Italic">See Iredia v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv.</span>, 981 F.2d 847, 848 (5th Cir. 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 844-45, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782-83, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984)). Moreover, citing <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, the EEOC has repeatedly stated that an administrative agency may offer compensatory damages to Title VII claimants. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966242, 1997 WL 377519 (Jul. 1, 1997); <span class="Italic">Price v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945860, 1996 WL 600763 (Oct. 11, 1996); <span class="Italic">Reesey v.

United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922811, 1993 WL 762904 (Dec. 14, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Two other courts, however, came to the conclusion that the EEOC does not have authority to award compensatory damages in the administrative processing of cases. In <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 137 F.3d 992 (7th Cir. 1998), the court found that a failure to request compensatory damages before the EEOC did not constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies because damages are not available in the administrative process. Responding directly to the arguments in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, the Seventh Circuit, in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, 137 F.3d at 995-98, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ordinarily, a failure to exhaust administrative remedies on an issue means that the complainant may not press his claim in federal court. <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Madigan</span>, 503 U.S. 140, 144-45, 112 S. Ct. 1081, 1085-87, 117 L. Ed.2d 291 (1992). Exhaustion "serves the twin purposes of protecting administrative agency authority and promoting judicial efficiency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 145, 112 S. Ct. at 1086. But it could go without saying that a party is not required to seek relief from an administrative agency (before seeking it from a federal court) if the agency does not have the power to redress a claim in the way the complainant requests. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 148, 112 S. Ct. at 1088. In other words, while an administrative agency may be "competent to adjudicate the issue presented," (here, Gibson's claim of discrimination), exhaustion is not required if it "lack[s] authority to grant the type of relief requested" (in this case, money damages). <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">McNeese v. Board of Ed. for Community Unit School Dist.</span>, 187, 373 U.S. 668, 675, 83 S. Ct. 1433, 1437-38, 10 L. Ed.2d 622 (1963) (students seeking to integrate public school need not file complaint with school superintendent because the <span id="Page_1789"></span>"Superintendent himself apparently has no power to order corrective action" except to request the Attorney General to bring suit); <span class="Italic">Montana Nat'l Bk. of Billings v. Yellowstone County</span>, 276 U.S. 499, 505, 48 S. Ct. 331, 333, 72 L. Ed. 673 (1928) (taxpayer seeking refund not required to exhaust where "any such application [would have been] utterly futile since the county board of equalization was powerless to grant any appropriate relief").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Gibson says that while the EEOC can adjudicate the merits of his discrimination claim, and even provide equitable relief such as backpay and a promotion (both of which it ordered in his case), asking the EEOC to issue compensatory damages would be asking it to do what it has no authority to do. (Nothing in the statute or regulations explicitly rules out the idea, though the only payments mentioned in the regulations relate to "loss of earnings"--presumably backpay--caused by the federal agency's discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.501(a).)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the one hand it sounds logical that the EEOC can issue compensatory damages. After all, the agency was created by Congress not only to investigate complaints of discrimination, but, in the federal sector, to adjudicate them. And more than this, in the federal sector, Congress empowered the EEOC to enforce Title VII's antidiscrimination provisions by issuing "such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b). It is not unreasonable to conclude that this mandate might be broad enough to allow the EEOC to award compensation for mental anguish and emotional distress, much like the damages Gibson seeks in this case. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit cited this statutory language in concluding that Congress intended the EEOC to redress discrimination by any means necessary, including by issuing awards of compensatory damages; the court punctuated its determination by noting that the statute already allows the Commission to issue back pay, "which is a form of compensatory damages." <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Secretary, Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 F.3d 203, 207 (5th Cir. 1997). The Fifth Circuit certainly was correct to turn first to the language of Title VII to determine the scope of the EEOC's binding adjudicative powers, though we note its misstep in referring to backpay as a subset of compensatory damages. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (governing awards for compensatory damages under Title VII) plainly states that they are distinct remedies. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(2) ("Compensatory damages...shall not include backpay").</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> places some emphasis on the EEOC's conclusion that the agency can issue awards for compensatory damages; the EEOC reached that determination through its adjudicative rather than rule-making authority. The EEOC is free to choose that route to announce new principles (even a principle as significant as the one at play in this case), <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 332 U.S. 194, 202, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L. Ed. 1995 (1947), but the availability of its rule-making powers means that "it has less reason [than a court] to rely upon <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> adjudication to formulate new standards of conduct." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Instead, the "function of filling in the interstices of regulatory statutes should be performed, as much as possible, though [the] quasi-legislative promulgation of rules to be applied in the future." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Even allowing some measure of deference to the EEOC's position, we note that the decisions themselves contain no particularly persuasive reasons why the agency should be allowed to issue compensatory damages, other than the reasons already noted by <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> itself. It appears that <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> cites these agency decisions (at least six of them) in order to give them deference, not because it finds them in any way convincing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have no difficulty in affording the EEOC a measure of deference--even when interpreting its own powers under a statutory scheme--so long as the interpretation is consistent with the plain language of the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.</span>, 499 U.S. 244, 257-58, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 1235-36, 113 L. Ed.2d 274 (1991) (rejecting EEOC's interpretation that Title VII applies extraterritorially because it "lack[ed] support in the plain language of the statute"). The section of Title VII pertaining to the federal sector, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16, is silent on the issue of compensatory damages, which makes sense because they were not even available in Title VII suits until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a. Section 1981a mentions compensatory damages in several places: in announcing their availability in "an action brought by a complaining party" (&#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1)), in excluding backpay from them (&#x00A7; 1981a(b)(2)), in limiting their amount (&#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)), and, finally, in legislating that "[i]f a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages...(1) any party may demand a trial by jury" (&#x00A7; 1981a(c)). It is this last provision of the statute that is not discussed in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> or, for that matter, in any of the EEOC decisions relied upon in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot sidestep it. Our reading persuades us that it means what it says: if the complaining party (defined by &#x00A7; 1981a(d) as someone capable of suing in the first place) seeks compensatory damages, either party, including the defendant government agency, may demand a jury trial on the issue. Of course the EEOC does not provide jury trials; they are obtained in federal district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 1981a(c)(2) ("the court shall not inform the jury of the limitations [on compensatory damages] described in subsection (b)(3) of this section"). Perhaps we could say that the EEOC has the right to issue compensatory damages in the first instance, and the losing party may seek <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the damages by demanding a jury trial. Not only would that be expensively duplicative, but it also probably would violate the rule that the EEOC's final determinations are binding against the agency (and thus are nonappealable). <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.504(a). So we are left with this: if the EEOC issues compensatory damages, they necessarily are binding against the employing agency, meaning that the agency is deprived under the statute of its right to a jury trial. We agree with Gibson that the statutory scheme promulgated by Congress does not allow the EEOC to issue what would be nonappealable awards for compensatory damages; compensatory damages are awarded within the jury system established by the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We part company with <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> in reaching this conclusion for several reasons. Most important of these is the statutory language that <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> does not cite--the right of the complainant or the government agency to demand a jury trial under &#x00A7; 1981a(c) if the complaining party seeks compensatory damages. Under <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald's</span> approach (and for that matter the EEOC's), the right to a jury trial under that section is lost. If we are to give effect to each section or provision in a statute, <span class="Italic">United States v. Franz</span>, 886 F.2d 973, 978 (7th Cir. 1989), it follows that we are particularly reluctant to interpret a statute in a way that altogether strikes a provision and a significant procedural right provided by it. It is quite possible that the <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> court never discusses the jury trial issue because the parties never raised it, thereby never alerting the court that the right to a jury trial conferred by &#x00A7; 1981a compels the conclusion we make today. Indeed, had the Fifth Circuit benefited from as full a briefing on the issue as we have before us, it might well have reached a different conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the statutory language conferring a right to a jury trial, we note that the statute allows compensatory damages only <span class="Italic">"[i]n an action brought by a complaining party"</span> under section 717 (the part of Title VII allowing federal employees to sue the government for discrimination, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16). <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1) (emphasis added). Is an action a federal suit in district court, an EEOC proceeding, or both? Congress has demonstrated that it knows the difference between a civil action and an administrative proceeding--in fact, it distinguishes between the two in the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(d)(1)(A) (defining complaining party as "<span class="Italic">a person who may bring an action or proceeding under Title VII"</span>) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, throughout the statutory scheme, Congress makes it clear that "actions" are civil actions pursued in courts, not administrative agencies. Section 706 of Title VII (the part applying to the private sector) tells us that the United States district courts--not the EEOC or any other administrative agency--"have jurisdiction of actions brought under [Title VII]." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(3). The same holds true in federal sector suits like Gibson's. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 717 of Title VII, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16 ("civil actions" against the government are to be pursued exactly "as provided" in section 706). Thus, when Congress uses the term "action" in Title VII, it is speaking of civil actions filed in federal court, not complaints of discrimination lodged with the EEOC. In enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress could have chosen a more expansive term than "action" or even redefined "action" to include EEOC proceedings, but it did not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One additional factor persuades us that a government agency may not be held liable for compensatory damages without the benefit of a jury trial. By its terms, Title VII constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity because it allows the government to be sued, <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans' Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 94-95, 111 S. Ct. 453, 456-57, 112 L. Ed.2d 435 (1990); the Civil Rights Act of 1991 extends that waiver by allowing the government to be sued for compensatory damages. But unless Congress tells us otherwise, we cannot further extend that waiver by allowing the government to be liable for compensatory damages at the administrative level (and without the benefit of a jury trial). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 95, 111 S. Ct. at 457 (interpreting the very same provisions of Title VII--allowing suits against the government--and noting that "[a] waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have discussed, we think the government's statutory right to a jury trial is a clear expression by Congress that it has limited its waiver of sovereign immunity. If Congress wishes to extend the waiver of sovereign immunity so that the government may be liable for compensatory damages without the benefit of a jury trial, it is free to say so unequivocally. What the government asks us to do in this case is read an extension of the waiver into Title VII, for good reason something we should not do. The Supreme Court has instructed that "limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied." <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 156, 161, 101 S. Ct. 2698, 2701, 69 L. Ed.2d 548 (1981). In other words, a court has no business tinkering with elaborate statutory machinery like Title VII to find a waiver of sovereign immunity; the Government's consent to be sued must be interpreted, "in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign," <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, ___, 116 <span id="Page_1790"></span>S. Ct. 2092, 2096, 135 L. Ed.2d 486 (1996), and not "enlarged...beyond what the [statutory] language requires." <span class="Italic">United States v. Nordic Village Inc.</span>, 503 U.S. 30, 34, 112 S. Ct. 1011, 1014-15, 117 L. Ed.2d 181 (1992). <span class="Italic">See also United States v. Williams</span>, 514 U.S. 527, 531, 115 S. Ct. 1611, 1615-16, 131 L. Ed.2d 608 (1995) (when confronted with a purported waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity, the Court will "constru[e] ambiguities in favor of immunity"). In this case, we would be doing more than tinkering--we would be redrafting (actually, reducing) the scope of sovereign immunity under the statute by allowing an administrative agency to issue nonappealable awards for compensatory damages, thereby wresting the matter from district courts and juries. That would not be consistent with our role, or with the statute Congress wrote.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the EEOC may not order the government to pay compensatory damages, we recognize the EEOC's responsibility to issue any orders it deems "necessary and appropriate." We are not displacing any right that the EEOC historically has enjoyed. We simply conclude that Congress has determined it is inappropriate for the EEOC to order the government to pay compensatory damages, a right which it never had in the first place. <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> concludes otherwise, but the statutory provisions at play convince us not to follow the Fifth Circuit's lead. "Our duty is to independently decide our own cases, which sometimes results in disagreements with decisions of the other circuits." <span class="Italic">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co. v. Pena</span>, 44 F.3d 437, 443 (7th Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co.</span>, 516 U.S. 152, 116 S. Ct. 595, 133 L. Ed.2d 535 (1996). In this case, that means Gibson should have been allowed to pursue his claim in the district court. We already have concluded that it was not a new claim of discrimination. It was a claim for compensatory damages relating to his employer's discrimination, and it was not redressable by the EEOC. We reverse the district court and remand Gibson's claim so that it may be tried to a jury, which is what he has demanded in his complaint and what the statute allows.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Babbitt</span>, 148 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir. 1998), the court followed <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> and held that the EEOC could not award compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a result, the Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212,119 S. Ct. 1906 (1999). The case reached the Supreme Court in a somewhat unlikely posture; the Department of Veterans Affairs was arguing that the EEOC does have authority to award damages in the administrative process, and the plaintiff argued that it does not. Writing for the majority, Justice Souter in <span class="Italic">West</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 1908-12, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employment discrimination. In 1972 Congress extended Title VII so that it applies not only to employment in the private sector, but to employment in the Federal Government as well<span class="Italic">. See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 111, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16. This 1972 Title VII extension, found in &#x00A7; 717 of Title VII, has three relevant subsections.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first subsection, &#x00A7; 717(a), sets forth the basic Federal Government employment anti-discrimination standard. It says that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment [of specified Government agencies and departments] shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second subsection, &#x00A7; 717(b), provides the EEOC with the power to enforce the standard. It says (among other things) that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <span class="Italic">shall have authority to enforce the provisions of subsection (a)...through appropriate remedies</span>, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this section...." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third subsection, &#x00A7; 717(c), concerns a court's authority to enforce the standard. It says that, after an agency or the EEOC takes final action on a complaint (or fails to take action within a certain time),</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"an employee or applicant...[who is still] aggrieved may...file a civil action as provided in section [706, dealing with discrimination by private employers]..., in which civil action the head of the department, agency, or unit, as appropriate, shall be the defendant." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1991 Congress again amended Title VII. The amendment relevant here permits victims of intentional employment discrimination (whether within the private sector or the Federal Government) to recover compensatory damages<span class="Italic">. See</span> Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1). The relevant portion of that amendment, which we shall call the Compensatory Damages Amendment (CDA), says:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"In an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 [dealing with discrimination by private employers] or 717 [dealing with discrimination by the Federal Government] against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination..., the complaining party may recover compensatory damages...." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The CDA also sets forth certain conditions and exceptions. It imposes, for example, a cap on compensatory damages (of up to $300,000 for large employers, &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D)). And it adds: "If a complaining party seeks compensatory...damages under this section...any party may demand a trial by jury...." &#x00A7; 1981a(c). Once the CDA became law, the EEOC began to grant compensatory damages awards in Federal Government employment discrimination cases. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 29 CFR pt. 1613, App. A (1990) (no reference to compensatory damages in preamendment list of EEOC remedies), with, <span class="Italic">e.g., Jackson v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923399, p. 3 (Nov. 12, 1992) ("[T]he Civil Rights Act of 1991...makes compensatory damages available to federal sector complainants in the administrative process").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent, Michael Gibson, filed a complaint with the Department of Veterans Affairs charging that the Department had discriminated against him by denying him a promotion on the basis of his gender. The Department found against Gibson. The EEOC, however, subsequently found in Gibson's favor and awarded the promotion plus backpay. Three months later Gibson filed a complaint in Federal District Court, asking the court to order the Department to comply immediately with the EEOC's order and also to pay compensatory damages. Complaint &#x00B6; 17 (App. 28). The Department then voluntarily complied with the EEOC's order, but it continued to oppose Gibson's claim for compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Eventually, the District Court dismissed Gibson's compensatory damages claim. On appeal, the Department supported the District Court's dismissal with the argument that Gibson had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in respect to his compensatory damages claim; hence, he could not bring that claim in court<span class="Italic">. Gibson v. Brown</span>, 137 F.3d 992, 994 (CA7 1998). The Seventh Circuit, however, reversed the District Court's dismissal. It rejected the Department's argument because, in its view, the EEOC lacked the legal power to award compensatory damages; consequently there was no administrative remedy to exhaust<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 995-998.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the circuits have disagreed about whether the EEOC has the power to award compensatory damages, <span class="Italic">compare Fitzgerald v. Secretary, Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 F.3d 203, 207 (CA5 1997) (EEOC may award compensatory damages), with <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Babbitt</span>, 148 F.3d 1318, 1326 (CA11 1998) (EEOC cannot award compensatory damages), and 137 F.3d, at 996-998 (same), we granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in order to decide that question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language, purposes, and history of the 1972 Title VII extension and the 1991 CDA convince us that Congress has authorized the EEOC to award compensatory damages in Federal Government employment discrimination cases. Read literally, the language of the statutes is consistent with a grant of that authority. The relevant portion of the Title VII extension, namely, &#x00A7; 717(b), says that the EEOC "shall have authority" to enforce &#x00A7; 717(a) "through <span class="Italic">appropriate</span> remedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b). After enactment of the 1991 CDA, an award of compensatory damages is a "remedy" that is "appropriate."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that subsection 717(b) explicitly mentions certain equitable remedies, namely, reinstatement, hiring, and back pay, and it does not explicitly refer to compensatory damages. But the preceding word "including" makes clear that the authorization is not limited to the specified remedies there mentioned; and the 1972 Title VII extension's choice of examples is not surprising, for in 1972 (and until 1991) Title VII itself authorized only equitable remedies.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 261, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)) (private sector discrimination); Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 111, 42 USC 2000e-16 (federal sector discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 717's language, however, does not freeze the scope of the word "appropriate" as of 1972. Words in statutes can enlarge or contract their scope as other changes, in law or in the world, require their application to new instances or make old applications anachronistic. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Browder v. United States</span>, 312 U.S. 335, 339-340 (1941) (new, unforeseen "use" of passport);<span class="Italic"> see also</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Southwestern Cable Co.</span>, 392 U.S. 157, 172-173 (1968) (cable television as "communications"); <span class="Italic">Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc.</span>, 392 U.S. 390, 395-396 (1968) (old statutory language read to reflect technological change).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The meaning of the word "appropriate" permits its scope to expand to include Title VII remedies that were not appropriate before 1991, but in light of legal change are appropriate now. The word "including" makes clear that "appropriate remedies" are not limited to the examples that follow that word.<span class="Italic"> See Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 313 U.S. 177, 189 (1941). And in context the word "appropriate" most naturally refers to forms of relief that Title VII itself authorizes--at least where that relief is of a kind that agencies typically can provide. Thus, Congress' decision in the 1991 CDA to permit a "complaining party" to "recover compensatory damages" in "an action brought under section...717," by adding compensatory damages to Title VII's arsenal of remedies, could make that form of relief "appropriate" under &#x00A7; 717(b) as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An examination of the purposes of the 1972 Title VII extension shows that this permissible reading of the language is also the correct reading. Section <span id="Page_1791"></span>717's general purpose is to remedy discrimination in federal employment. It does so in part by creating a dispute resolution system that requires a complaining party to pursue administrative relief prior to court action, thereby encouraging quicker, less formal, and less expensive resolution of disputes within the Federal Government and outside of court.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c) (court action permitted only where complainant disagrees with final agency disposition or, if complainant pursued discretionary appeal to EEOC, with EEOC disposition; or if either agency or EEOC disposition is delayed); <span class="Italic">Brown v. GSA</span>, 425 U.S. 820, 833 (1976) (discussing &#x00A7; 717's "rigorous administrative exhaustion requirements");<span class="Italic"> see also</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a) (1998) (requiring complainant initially to notify agency and make effort to resolve matter informally); &#x00A7; 1614.106(d)(2) (requiring agency investigation prior to EEOC consideration).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To deny that an EEOC compensatory damages award is, statutorily speaking, "appropriate" would undermine this remedial scheme. It would force into court matters that the EEOC might otherwise have resolved. And by preventing earlier resolution of a dispute, it would increase the burdens of both time and expense that accompany efforts to resolve hundreds, if not thousands, of such disputes each year.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Federal Sector Report on EEO Complaints Processing and Appeals by Federal Agencies for Fiscal Year 1997, pp. 19, 61 (1998) (28,947 Federal Government employment discrimination claims filed in 1997; 7,112 claims appealed to EEOC); Reply Brief for Petitioner 12-13, n.9 (estimating "hundreds" of cases each year that involve claims for compensatory damages).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The history of the CDA reinforces this point. The CDA's sponsors and supporters spoke frequently of the need to create a new remedy in order, for example, to "help make victims whole." H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, pp. 64-65 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Civil Rights Act of 1991, &#x00A7; 2, 105 Stat. 1071, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981 note (congressional finding that "additional remedies under Federal law are needed to deter...intentional discrimination in the workplace");<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, &#x00A7; 3 (one purpose of Act is "to provide appropriate remedies for intentional discrimination...in the workplace"); 137 Cong. Rec. 28636-28638, 28663-28667, 28676-28680 (1991) (introduction and discussion of Danforth/Kennedy Amendment No. 1274, in relevant part permitting recovery of compensatory damages);<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 28880-28881 (statements of Sen. Warner and Sen. Kennedy) (clarifying that Danforth/Kennedy amendment covers federal employees and suggesting amendment to this effect). But the CDA's sponsors and supporters said nothing about limiting the EEOC's ability to use the new Title VII remedy or suggesting that it would be desirable to distinguish the new Title VII remedy from old Title VII remedies in that respect. This total silence is not surprising. What reason could there be for Congress, anxious to have the EEOC consider as a preliminary matter every other possible remedy, not to want the EEOC similarly to consider compensatory damages as well?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent makes three important arguments in favor of a more limited interpretation of the statutes--an interpretation that would deprive the EEOC of the power to award compensatory damages. First, respondent points out that the CDA says nothing about the EEOC, or EEOC proceedings, but rather states only that a complaining party may recover compensatory damages "in an action brought under section...717." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1). And the word "action" often refers to judicial cases, not to administrative "proceedings."<span class="Italic"> See New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey</span>, 447 U.S. 54, 60-62 (1980) (distinguishing civil "actions" from administrative "proceedings").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Had Congress thought it important so to limit the scope of the CDA, however, it could easily have cross-referenced &#x00A7; 717(c), the civil action subsection itself, rather than cross-referencing the whole of &#x00A7; 717, which includes authorization for the EEOC to enforce the section through "appropriate remedies." Regardless, the question, as we see it, is whether, by using the word "action," Congress intended to deny that compensatory damages is "<span class="Italic">appropriate</span>" administrative relief within the terms of &#x00A7; 717(b). In light of the previous discussion,<span class="Italic"> see supra</span>, at 4-7, we do not believe the simple use of the word "action" in the context of a cross-reference to the whole of &#x00A7; 717 indicates an intent to deprive the EEOC of that authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, in an effort to explain why Congress might have wanted to impose a special EEOC-related limitation in respect to compensatory damages, respondent points to the language in the CDA that says: "If a complaining party seeks compensatory...damages under this section...<span class="Italic">any party</span> may demand a trial by jury." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(c). Respondent notes that an EEOC compensatory damages award would not involve a jury. And an agency cannot proceed to court under &#x00A7; 717(c) because that subsection makes a court action available only to an aggrieved complaining party, not to the agency. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c). Thus, respondent concludes that the CDA must implicitly forbid any such EEOC award, for that award would take place without the jury trial that &#x00A7; 1981a(c) guarantees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This argument, however, draws too much from too little. One easily can read the jury trial provision in &#x00A7; 1981a(c) as simply guaranteeing either party a jury trial in respect to compensatory damages <span class="Italic">if</span> a complaining party proceeds to court under &#x00A7; 717(c). The words "under this section" in &#x00A7; 1981a(c) support that interpretation, for "this section," &#x00A7; 1981a, refers primarily to court proceedings. And there is no reason to believe Congress intended more. The history of the jury trial provision suggests that Congress saw the provision primarily as a benefit to complaining parties, not to the Government. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 137 Cong. Rec., at 29051-29052 (statement of Sen. Leahy) (for "the first time, women and the disabled could recover damages and have jury trials for claims of intentional discrimination");<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 30668 (statement of Rep. Ford) (provision will "provid[e] all victims of intentional discrimination a right to trial by jury");<span class="Italic"> see also</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., id.</span>, at 29053-29054 (statement of Sen. Wallop) (discussing "economically devastating lawsuits");<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 29041 (statement of Sen. Bumpers) (relating fears about "runaway jur[ies]"). The fact that Congress permits an employee to file a complaint in court, but forbids the agency to challenge an adverse EEOC decision in court, also suggests that Congress was not inordinately and unusually concerned with invoking special judicial safeguards to protect the Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, respondent argues that insofar as the law permits the EEOC to award compensatory damages, it waives the Government's sovereign immunity, and we must construe any such waiver narrowly.<span class="Italic"> See Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996); <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 156, 160-161 (1981). There is no dispute, however, that the CDA waives sovereign immunity in respect to an award of compensatory damages. Whether, in light of that waiver, the CDA permits the EEOC to consider the same matter at an earlier phase of the employment discrimination claim is a distinct question concerning how the waived damages remedy is to be administered. Because the relationship of this kind of administrative question to the goals and purposes of the doctrine of sovereign immunity may be unclear, ordinary sovereign immunity presumptions may not apply. In the Government's view here, for example, the EEOC's preliminary consideration, by lowering the costs of resolving disputes, does not threaten, but helps to protect, the public fisc. Regardless, if we must apply a specially strict standard in such a case, which question we need not decide, that standard is met here. We believe that the statutory language, taken together with statutory purposes, history, and the absence of any convincing reason for denying the EEOC the relevant power, produce evidence of a waiver that satisfies the stricter standard.</p>
<p class="noindent">The dissent, written by Justice Kennedy, would have relied on the doctrine of sovereign immunity to hold that the EEOC could not award compensatory damages. Justice Kennedy in <span class="Italic">West</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 1913-15, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rules governing this case are clear and well established, or at least had been before the majority's unsettling opinion today. Relief may not be awarded against the United States unless it has waived its sovereign immunity.<span class="Italic"> See Department of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc.</span>, 525 U.S. ___ (1999). The waiver must be expressed in unequivocal statutory text and cannot be implied<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at ___ (<span class="Italic">Slip op</span>., at 4); <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996). Even when the United States has waived its immunity, the waiver must be "strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign," <span class="Italic">Blue Fox, supra</span>, at ___ (<span class="Italic">Slip op</span>., at 5); accord, <span class="Italic">Lane, supra</span>, at 192, for "'this Court has long decided that limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied,'" <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 156, 161 (1981), quoting <span class="Italic">Soriano v. United States</span>, 352 U.S. 270, 276 (1957). Not only do these rules reserve authority over the public fisc to the branch of Government with which the Constitution has placed it, they also form an important part of the background of settled legal principles upon which Congress relied in enacting various statutes authorizing suits against the United States, such as the Tucker Act, 28 USC &#x00A7; 1 491; &#x00A7; 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 702; and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 USC &#x00A7; 2671 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. The rules governing waivers of sovereign immunity make clear that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) may not award or authorize compensatory damages against the United States unless it is permitted to do so by a statutory provision which waives the United States' immunity to the awards in clear and unambiguous terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 717(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b), which authorizes the EEOC to enforce federal compliance with Title VII "through appropriate remedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay," effects a waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity for some purposes. Unlike other similar statutes, however, the provision does not mention awards of compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> &#x00A7; 717(b) with 2 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1311(b)(1)(B), 1405(g) (1994 ed., Supp. III). A waiver of immunity to other types of relief does not provide the unequivocal statement required to establish a waiver of immunity to damages awards.<span class="Italic"> See United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.</span>, 503 U.S. 30, 34 (1992) ("Though [11 USC &#x00A7; 106(c)], too, waives sovereign immunity, it fails to establish unambiguously that the waiver extends to monetary claims"); <span class="Italic">Lane, supra</span>, at 192.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor does the statutory grant of authority to the EEOC to enforce Title VII through appropriate remedies include, in unequivocal terms or even by <span id="Page_1792"></span>necessary implication, the power to award or authorize compensatory damages. Even if the phrase "appropriate remedies" had been intended, as the majority maintains, to incorporate relief authorized for violations of Title VII under other statutory provisions, it is not obvious that the phrase's meaning would have been intended also to "expand" to include remedies that were not available at the time &#x00A7; 717 was adopted<span class="Italic">. Ante</span>, at 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is far from clear, moreover, that the phrase was intended to incorporate other statutory provisions at all. Unlike other subsections of &#x00A7; 717,<span class="Italic"> see</span> &#x00A7; 717(d) (incorporating various provisions relating to judicial actions), &#x00A7; 717(b) does not make an explicit reference to other statutory provisions. In addition, the specific examples given by the statute of appropriate remedies--reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without backpay--are equitable in nature.<span class="Italic"> See United States v. Burke</span>, 504 U.S. 229, 238 (1992). The interpretive canons of <span class="Italic">noscitur a sociis</span> and <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> suggest the appropriate remedies authorized by &#x00A7; 717(b) are remedies of the same nature as reinstatement, hiring, and backpay--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, equitable remedies. The phrase "appropriate remedies," furthermore, connotes the remedial discretion which is the hallmark of equity. A plausible, and perhaps even the best, interpretation of &#x00A7; 717(b), then, is that it grants administrative authority to determine which of the traditional forms of equitable relief are appropriate in any given case of discrimination. Whether or not this is the better reading, it should suffice to establish beyond dispute that the statute does not authorize awards of compensatory damages in express and unequivocal terms. As a consequence, &#x00A7; 717(b) cannot provide the required waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike &#x00A7; 717(b), 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a does authorize awards of compensatory damages against the United States. Although it is clear the statute authorizes courts to award damages, however, &#x00A7; 1981a does not so much as mention the EEOC, much less empower it to award or authorize money damages. It is settled law that a waiver of sovereign immunity in one forum does not effect a waiver in other forums. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., McElrath v. United States</span>, 102 U.S. 426, 440 (1880) ("[The Government] can declare in what court it may be sued, and prescribe the forms of pleading and the rules of practice to be observed in such suits"); <span class="Italic">Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read</span>, 322 U.S. 47, 54, n.6 (1944) ("The Federal Government's consent to suit against itself, without more, in a field of federal power does not authorize a suit in a state court"); <span class="Italic">Case v. Terrell</span>, 11 Wall. 199, 201 (1871) (The United States' consent to suit in the Court of Claims does not extend to other federal courts).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority's attempt to read 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1) to authorize administrative awards of compensatory damages is not persuasive. Section 1981a(a)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"In an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964...the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection (b) of this section, in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision authorizes an award of compensatory damages in an "action" brought under &#x00A7; 717; the word "action" is often used to distinguish judicial cases from administrative "proceedings."<span class="Italic"> See New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey</span>, 447 U.S. 54, 60-62 (1980). Unlike &#x00A7; 717(b), which authorizes administrative proceedings, &#x00A7; 717(c) authorizes "civil action[s]" in court. It is most natural, therefore, to understand the phrase "an action brought by a complaining party under section...717" as a reference to a judicial action under &#x00A7; 717(c) but not to an administrative proceeding under &#x00A7; 717(b). Compensatory awards are authorized under &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1), moreover, "in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Section 706(g) authorizes a "court" to grant equitable relief for violations of Title VII. This provision, as incorporated through &#x00A7; 717(d), applies only in "civil actions" brought under &#x00A7; 717(c); it does not apply in proceedings before the EEOC or any other agency. Section 1981a(a)(1)'s express reference to &#x00A7; 706(g) confirms that compensatory damages are available only in judicial actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other provisions of &#x00A7; 1981a also make clear that the statute authorizes compensatory damages only in judicial actions. Section 1981a(c) provides that "[i]f a complaining party seeks compensatory...damages under this section--(1) any party may demand a trial by jury; and (2) the court shall not inform the jury of the limitations [on damages awards] described in subsection (b)(3) of this section." It cannot be disputed that this provision contemplates a jury trial overseen by a court. With due respect to the majority, the provision does not guarantee a jury trial to either party "<span class="Italic">if</span> a complaining party proceeds to court under &#x00A7; 717(c)," <span class="Italic">ante</span>, at 8-9; it provides that either party may obtain a jury trial "[i]f a complaining party seeks compensatory...damages," &#x00A7; 1981a(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While falling short of embracing the argument as its own, the majority flirts with the contention that allowing agencies rather than juries to award compensatory damages lowers the costs of resolving employment disputes and protects the public fisc. It is not clear to me that juries would be less protective of the fisc than would one group of Government employees who deem themselves empowered by agency interpretation to award Government funds to fellow employees. When a Government employee seeks damages from the Government itself, there may be advantages in insisting upon the expertise of a trial court with experience in awarding damages in all types of cases, with the additional safeguards of trial in a forum of high visibility, trial by jury if either party chooses to ask for it, and appellate review. These factors are disregarded by the majority, which seems instead to suggest that the nature and convenience of administrative proceedings will by necessity provide a financial advantage to the Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In all events, speculation does not suffice to overcome the rule that waivers of sovereign immunity must be clear and express. An unequivocal waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity to administrative awards of compensatory damages cannot be found in the relevant statutory provisions. To the extent the majority relies on textual analysis, it establishes at most (if at all) that the statutes might be read to authorize such awards, not that the statutes must be so read. To the extent the majority relies on legislative history and other extratextual sources, it contradicts our precedents and sets us on a new course, for before today it was well settled that "[a] statute's legislative history cannot supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text." <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, 518 U.S., at 192; accord, <span class="Italic">Nordic Village</span>, 503 U.S., at 37 ("[T]he 'unequivocal expression' of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory text. If clarity does not exist there, it cannot be supplied by a committee report"). With respect, I dissent.</p>
<p class="noindent">The majority remanded <span class="Italic">West</span> to determine if the plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies by requesting damages at the EEOC stage of the case. On remand, the Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiff had waived his argument that he had exhausted his administrative remedies before the EEOC because he did not raise the point prior to review by the Supreme Court. The court also held that the government could not be estopped from raising the failure to exhaust administrative remedies defense. Thus, the plaintiff's victory was "Pyrrhic" and his damages claim was dismissed. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. West</span>, 201 F.3d 990 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, the <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span> case did not cause the EEOC to retreat from its earlier position that it has the authority to award damages in administrative proceedings, and it continued to award damages since <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without specific mention of <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, in <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01956390 (1998), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102(a) of the 1991 Civil Rights Act 7 authorizes an award of compensatory damages for all post-Act pecuniary losses, and for non-pecuniary losses, such as, but not limited to, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to character and reputation, and loss of health. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923399 (November 12, 1992) <span class="Italic">request for reconsid. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930306 (February 1, 1993), the Commission held that Congress afforded it the authority to award such damages in the administrative process. It based this assessment, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, on a review of the statutory provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 in relation to one another and on principles of statutory interpretation which require statutes to be interpreted as a whole. In particular, the Commission discussed the meaning of the statute's definition of the term "complaining party" and the significance of the reference to the word "action" in Section 102(a)--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the term "action" includes cases in both judicial and administrative forums. We note that in Section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.) (CRA), the term "final action" is used to refer to administrative decisions by agencies or the Commission, as distinguished from the term "civil action," used to describe the rights of employees after such final action is taken. Moreover, Section 717(b) of the CRA conveyed to the Commission the broad authority in the administrative process to enforce the nondiscrimination provisions of subsection (a) through "appropriate remedies."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Feris v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 01983167 (1998), the Commission directly confronted the Seventh Circuit's arguments in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>. In <span class="Italic">Feris</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n <span class="Italic">Gibson v.

The <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> Court relied heavily upon the language of the CRA of 1991 providing that "[I]f a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages...any party may demand a trial by jury." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a (c). The Court reasoned that since the Commission does not provide jury trials and Commission decisions are nonappealable and binding on agencies, allowing the Commission to award compensatory damages would deprive the agency of its statutory right to a jury trial<span class="Italic">.

See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c). It conditioned this waiver, however, on the exhaustion of an administrative process it set up to provide full relief through "appropriate remedies" for violations of that statute<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b) and (c). Moreover, it was Congress that oriGINAlly provided that only an employee or applicant for employment, and not a federal agency, could file a civil action after receiving a final decision from the Commission in the administrative process<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> It is against this preexisting setting that Congress enacted the compensatory damages and jury trial provisions in the CRA of 1991. Since Congress precluded agencies from challenging final decisions of the Commission, it must have been aware that in situations where the agency did not have a statutory right to challenge the Commission's adverse decision in federal court, no jury trial would be available. Our view is that it is the conditions already inherent in Title VII, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the statute's exhaustion requirements, its broad delegation of authority to the Commission to enforce its provisions through "appropriate" remedies, and the requirement that final Commission determinations are binding on agencies, that define the circumstances under which the statutory right to a jury trial can be exercised.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a practical matter, a decision to follow the <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> ruling would render the exhaustion requirement an empty exercise for claimants seeking compensatory damages and severely undermine the effectiveness of the administrative process. Since the Commission could then no longer offer claimants full relief, many would opt to bypass it at the earliest opportunity and inevitably burden the district courts with the litigation of matters that had previously been resolved at the administrative level. As noted by the Court in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, Congress set up the requirement for exhaustion of a Commission defined administrative process with the intent that it provide a true opportunity for administrative resolution of discrimination lawsuits by the Commission. If Congress had intended to change this requirement, it would have stated this intent more explicitly, rather than merely imply it from a provision authorizing trial by jury.</p>
