<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-3"><span class="space">A.</span> POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE</h3>
<p class="noindent">The role and powers of the administrative judge are set out at 29 CFR 1614.109. The administrative judge is almost always an employee of the EEOC. In cases involving alleged discrimination within the EEOC, the administrative judge will be a complaints examiner or an administrative judge from another agency or a contract attorney examiner. If necessary, the administrative judge will possess any security clearances required to conduct the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge is responsible for scheduling the time and place of the hearing, and for the conduct of the hearing. The conduct of the hearing includes resolving prehearing disputes between the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under Part 1613, the first duty of the administrative judge was to determine if the case was ready for hearing. In cases where the record was lacking substantial factual information necessary to decide the case, the administrative judge could remand the case to the agency for further investigation. In the alternative, the administrative judge could require the agency to make additional information and witnesses available for the hearing in order to provide the necessary information. In 1992, the Commission adopted the use of traditional discovery procedures to develop evidence that is not included in the investigative report. 29 CFR 1614.109(d). As discussed further below, the option of remanding a case to the agency for a supplemental investigation has been eliminated under the 1999 amendments to Part 1614. The administrative judge is currently responsible for overseeing the development of the record if there are deficiencies in the agency investigation or an investigation has not been conducted prior to the hearing request. The use of discovery and discovery techniques are discussed below in detail under the headings "<a href="0100-2023-15-102.html#sec6-100">Discovery</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-15-185.html#sec6-183">Developing the Record</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">"[O]ne of the functions of the hearing is to bring out pertinent facts." <span class="Italic">Kamalic v. Postmaster General</span>, 01892266 (1989). An appellant will not be heard to complain of the adequacy of the investigation where he is given the opportunity to call witnesses at the hearing and declines to do so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This is especially true now that the EEOC permits prehearing discovery.</p>
<p class="noindent">An EEOC administrative judge has most of the powers generally conferred upon administrative judges in agency proceedings. However, it is important to note that despite their misleading title, the EEOC's administrative judges are not administrative law judges (ALJs) and do not have the full range of powers conferred upon ALJs. The administrative judges have the authority to order the production of witnesses employed by the agency or other agencies of the federal government, to order the production of documents in the possession of either party, to regulate the order of presentation of evidence, to rule on motions, and to exclude testimony or documents from the record if they are deemed irrelevant or unduly repetitious. Administrative judges, unlike administrative law judges, do not have the authority to issue subpoenas for the production of documents from nonparties who are not agencies or employees of the federal government. Nor do they have the power to subpoena testimony of nonparty witnesses who are not employed by the federal government. These two restrictions on the powers of Commission administrative judges can be significant, particularly the inability to subpoena the testimony of witnesses not employed by the federal government. This lack of subpoena power can especially work a hardship where a witness who was formerly a federal employee is no longer employed by the government or in the case of witnesses who are private citizens.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's administrative judges have no direct authority to enforce their own orders, but they can impose sanctions against parties who do not comply with those orders. The sanctions against parties who refuse to comply with the order of an administrative judge are limited largely to those stated at 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3). The administrative judge may draw an inference adverse to the party refusing to comply. For example, the judge may conclude that documents which a party refuses to provide would reflect unfavorably on that party. The judge may consider that the information, if provided, would establish those points for which the other party seeks them. The judge may exclude other evidence offered by that party. The regulation also includes a catch-all provision that the judge may take other action "deemed appropriate." But the powers of an administrative judge clearly are circumscribed and those other actions are limited in scope and nature.</p>
<p class="noindent">In January 2003, the authority of EEOC administrative judges to issue sanctions was further circumscribed when the Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel issued a memorandum with the opinion that the EEOC did not have the authority to issue monetary sanctions against federal agencies in the form of attorney fees and costs for failure to comply with discovery orders. The memorandum is discussed in detail in the section below on "<a href="0100-2023-15-122.html#sec6-120">Discovery Sanctions</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">In MD-110 at 7-7 to 7-18, the Commission has expanded on the role of its administrative judges:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Administrative Judge's Review</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An Administrative Judge shall determine whether additional documentation is necessary and may request of the appropriate party the production of any additional documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If after reviewing the file, the Administrative Judge determines that the investigation is inadequate due to the agency's failure to complete the investigation within the time limits set forth in &#x00A7; 1614.108(e), or the agency has not cooperated in the discovery process as required by &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3), the Administrative Judge may take the following actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Subject the agency to adverse inference findings in favor of the complainant;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Consider the issues to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be favorable to the complainant;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Exclude other evidence offered by the agency;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Permit the complainant to obtain a summary disposition in his/her favor on some or all of the issues without a hearing; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Take other action deemed appropriate, including, but not limited to, requiring the agency to pay any costs incurred by the complainant in taking depositions or in conducting any other form of discovery.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has the authority to issue sanctions in the administrative hearing process because it was granted, through statute, the power to issue such rules and regulations that it deems necessary to enforce the prohibition on employment discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Waller v. Dep't. of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720030069 (May 25, 2007), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520070689 (Feb. 26, 2009). In this respect, the Commission has determined "that delegating to its Administrative Judges the authority to issue sanctions against agencies, and complainants, is necessary and is an appropriate remedy which effectuates the policies of the Commission." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, before an Administrative Judge may sanction an agency for failing to develop an impartial and appropriate factual record or for not cooperating in the discovery process, the Administrative Judge must issue an order to the agency or request the documents, records, comparative data, statistics, or affidavits. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). Such order or request shall make clear that sanctions may be imposed and the type of sanction that could be imposed for failure to comply with the order unless the agency can show good cause for that failure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Dep't. of the Treasury</span>, Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 17, 2001). In appropriate circumstances, the order or request may provide the agency with an opportunity to take such action as the Administrative Judge deems necessary to correct the deficiencies in the record within a specified reasonable period of time. Only on the failure of the agency to comply with the Administrative Judge's order or request and the notice <span id="Page_439"></span>to show cause may the Administrative Judge impose a sanction or the sanctions identified in the order or request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Developing the Record in Complaints with Inadequate Records</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.108(g) authorizes a complainant to request a hearing before an Administrative Judge where the respondent agency has not completed the investigation within the required time limit and where the complainant has not agreed in writing with the agency to extend the time for completing the investigation. This provision reflects the Commission's intent that complainants be permitted to move their cases forward in the complaint process where an agency has not complied with the regulation by completing a timely investigation. Further, it is the Commission's intent that where a hearing is properly requested and where there has been no investigation or there is an incomplete or inadequate investigation, the record in the case shall be developed under the supervision of the Administrative Judge assigned to the case. The record can be developed through the parties' use of discovery and/or through the Administrative Judge's orders for the production of documents and witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.109(a) of 29 C.F.R. provides that upon appointment, the Administrative Judge will assume full responsibility for adjudication of the complaint, including overseeing the development of the record. The Commission intends that the Administrative Judge will take complete control of the case once a hearing is requested. Administrative Judges will preside over any necessary supplementation of the record in the hearing process without resort to remands of complaints to agencies for additional investigations. If an Administrative Judge determines that there is an incomplete or inadequate investigation, s/he may, however, issue an order directing the agency to complete its investigation within a specified period of time set forth in the order or directing that the agency show cause for its failure to complete the investigation within the 180-day period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency has not completed a timely investigation or has prepared an inadequate investigation, the Administrative Judge may issue an order on his/her own initiative or upon request by either party requiring a party to produce documents, records, comparative data, statistics, or the attendance of witnesses. Such order or request shall make clear that sanctions may be imposed and the type of sanction that could be imposed for failure to comply with the order within the specified time set forth in the order without good cause shown. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Rountree v. Dep't. of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 17, 2001). Where the agency or complainant fails without good cause shown to respond fully and in a timely fashion to the Administrative Judge's order and/or the party has not otherwise cooperated in the discovery process, the Administrative Judge may impose sanctions pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). A showing that the noncomplying party acted in bad faith not required. <span class="Italic">See Kramer v. Dep't. of Justice</span>, EEO Appeal No. 07A10108 (September 11, 2003), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A40050 (Dec. 8, 2003); <span class="Italic">Cornell v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974476 (Nov. 24, 1998). Additionally, the Administrative Judge may, as a result of a discovery order issued pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3)(v), require the agency to bear the costs for the complainant to obtain depositions or any other discovery because the agency has failed to complete its investigation timely as required by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(e) or has failed to investigate the allegations adequately pursuant to Chapter 6 of this Management Directive. <span class="Italic">See also</span> Section IV.F of this Chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If either party is requested by the Administrative Judge to produce additional documents, that party shall furnish a copy of those documents to the opposing party at the time they are submitted to the Administrative Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Dismissal of Complaint by Administrative Judge</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge may dismiss complaints within his/her jurisdiction pursuant to &#x00A7; 1614.107(a) on his/her own initiative, after notice to the parties, or upon an agency's motion to dismiss a complaint. (<span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 1614.109(b) and Chapter 5, Section IV, of this Management Directive.) Before dismissing a complaint, the Administrative Judge must ensure that the claim has not been fragmented inappropriately into more than one complaint. A series of subsequent events or instances involving the same claim should not be treated as separate complaints, but should be added to and treated as part of the first claim<span class="Italic">. See</span> Chapter 5, Section III of this Management Directive for an extended discussion on fragmentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Administrative Judge's Authority</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge has full responsibility for the adjudication of the complaint, which includes, but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Issue decisions on complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Administer oaths.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Regulate the conduct of hearings.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Limit the number of witnesses so as to exclude irrelevant and repetitious evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Order discovery or the production of documents and witnesses by serving orders on both parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Administrative Judge has independent authority under &#x00A7; 1614.109(f) to request the production of information, documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;Issue protective orders not to disclose information.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">7.&#x2003;Exclude any person who is disruptive from the hearing or who is a witness so that s/he cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">8.&#x2003;Issue decisions without a hearing if there are no material facts in issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">9.&#x2003;Limit the hearing to the issues in dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">10.&#x2003;Impose appropriate sanctions on parties who fail to comply with orders or requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Administrative Judge has the authority to impose sanctions on a party if s/he fails to comply without good cause with orders or requests. In addition, the Administrative Judge may impose sanctions where a party fails to appear or be prepared for a conference (e.g., for status or settlement discussions) or hearing pursuant to an order of the Administrative Judge. Sanctions may be imposed on the agency for failure to produce an approved witness who is a federal employee. Sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with orders to compel, requests for information, documents, or admissions where the information is solely in the control of that party. Similarly, if a party fails to provide an adequate explanation for the failure to respond fully and in a timely manner to a request and the information is solely in the control of that party, the Administrative Judge may impose sanctions. Sanctions for failing to comply with the orders or requests discussed above include, but are not limited to, the authority to:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(a)&#x2003;draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(b)&#x2003;consider the issues to which the requested information pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(c)&#x2003;exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(d)&#x2003;enter a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; and,</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(e)&#x2003;take such other actions as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">11.&#x2003;Calculate compensatory damage awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Before holding a hearing, the Administrative Judge may require the complainant, after receipt of an agency motion or otherwise, to declare whether or not s/he is seeking compensatory damages as relief for the discrimination or retaliation alleged in the complaint, and to proffer or produce evidence demonstrating entitlement to compensatory damages. If a complainant fails to proffer or produce such evidence, the Administrative Judge may, in his/her discretion, deem the claim for damages to be waived.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Where the complainant has claimed compensatory damages and where the Administrative Judge determines, on the merits of the complaint, entitlement to compensatory damages because of intentional discrimination or retaliation, the Administrative Judge will calculate the amount of compensatory damages to be awarded by the respondent agency. In complaints where compensatory damages have been claimed and a hearing is held, the Administrative Judge may, in his/her discretion, develop the record on the compensatory damages claim during the hearing on the merits on the complaint or may bifurcate the proceeding and develop the record on the compensatory damage claim after a finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">12.&#x2003;Order a medical examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Administrative Judges have the authority to order, in very limited circumstances, as detailed below, that a complainant undergo a medical examination on motion of the agency. A request by the agency that a complainant undergo a medical examination must notify the complainant, the complainant's representative, and the Administrative Judge, of the proposed time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made. All such requests must be approved by the Administrative Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In making a determination of whether to order a medical examination, an Administrative Judge may be guided by the principles and cases arising under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing the physical and mental examinations of persons. The burden of proof in supporting a request for such an examination requires an affirmative showing that each condition <span id="Page_440"></span>as to which examination is sought is genuinely in controversy and that good cause exists for ordering each particular examination. Such requests must be narrowly tailored to elicit only the evidence necessary to develop the record with regard to the specific issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency requesting the examination has the burden of proving that the examination is reasonably necessary. For example, merely showing that the complainant has made a claim for compensatory damages is not sufficient to meet the agency's burden of proof. In determining whether such a request is reasonable, the Administrative Judge will consider: whether the complainant has asserted a claim for compensatory damages sufficient to place his/her mental or physical condition in controversy; and whether the request is made for good cause shown; that is, that the examination is reasonably necessary to determine the existence and extent of an asserted injury. The Commission has held that evidence from a health care professional is not a mandatory prerequisite to establishing entitlement to compensatory damages<span class="Italic">. Sinnott v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952872 (1996); <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (1996); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (1995). A complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, may suffice to sustain the complainant's burden in this regard. Therefore, independent medical examinations will not be appropriate in every case in which a claim for compensatory damages is made. <span class="Italic">See</span> "Requests for Private Information Should Be Limited" at Section IV.B.4 in this Chapter of this Management Directive for more information.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Some factors to be considered in determining whether an agency has shown that a complainant has asserted a claim for damages sufficient to place his/her mental or physical condition in controversy include: 1) the type and extent of mental or physical harm claimed; 2) whether the harm alleged is ongoing or is merely a past harm with no current effects on the complainant; 3) whether the complainant has offered expert testimony concerning the nature and/or extent of the alleged harm, or intends to offer such testimony; and 4) whether the complainant has sufficiently asserted a connection between the asserted harm and the alleged discrimination sufficient to establish a causal relationship between the harm and the alleged discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Some factors to be considered in determining whether an agency requesting a mental or physical examination has shown good cause for such examination include: 1) the nature and severity of the alleged harm, and the likelihood that the requested examination will elicit relevant evidence as to the existence and/or extent of the alleged harm; 2) whether there is already sufficient evidence in the record as to the nature and extent of the asserted harm; and 3) whether the information sought could be obtained through other less intrusive discovery techniques, such as interrogatories, depositions, or requests for the production of witnesses or documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Even where the above criteria may have been satisfied by the agency requesting the examination, the decision to order such examination at the hearing stage is solely within the discretion of the Administrative Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Upon receipt of a request from the agency for a medical examination, the complainant may file a motion for a protective order, stating objections to the request or order.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Section IV.B.3.b of this Chapter. The decision to order such examination at the hearing stage remains solely within the discretion of the Administrative Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">13.&#x2003;Calculate and award the amount of attorney's fees or costs.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Where a party is represented by an attorney, an Administrative Judge is authorized to award a complainant reasonable attorney's fees and costs (including expert witness fees) incurred in the processing of a complaint where the Administrative Judge issues a decision finding discrimination in violation of Title VII and/or the Rehabilitation Act, issues an order sanctioning the agency, or where the award of attorney's fees or costs may otherwise be appropriate and authorized. Any award of attorney's fees or costs shall be paid by the respondent agency. Where the Administrative Judge determines that a complainant is entitled to an award of attorney's fees or costs, the Administrative Judge will calculate the amount of such award in accordance with &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B) and Chapter 11 of this Management Directive.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When the Administrative Judge determines an entitlement to attorney's fees or costs, the complainant's attorney must submit a verified statement of attorney's fees (including expert witness fees) and other costs, as appropriate, to the Administrative Judge within thirty (30) days of receipt of the decision, unless otherwise directed, and must submit a copy of the statement to the agency. A statement of attorney's fees and costs must be accompanied by an affidavit executed by the attorney of record itemizing the attorney's charges for legal services. The agency may respond to a statement of attorney's fees and costs within thirty (30) days of its receipt.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The verified statement, accompanying affidavit and any agency response shall be made a part of the complaint file. The Administrative Judge will issue a decision determining the amount of attorney's fees and costs due within sixty (60) days of receipt of the statement and affidavit.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">14.&#x2003;Engage the parties or encourage the parties to engage in settlement discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Administrative Judge may engage the parties in discussion aimed at reaching a settlement agreement or may allow the parties such time as they may need to discuss settlement. The Administrative Judge further may hold a hearing in abeyance to allow the parties to engage in alternate forms of dispute resolution. (For a more detailed discussion of alternative dispute resolution, see Chapter 3 of this Management Directive.)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">15.&#x2003;Issue an order determining full relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Administrative Judges shall issue an order awarding full relief where the agency unilaterally and unconditionally promises in writing to provide the full and complete remedy as defined by the Administrative Judge. To permit him/her to determine the appropriate remedy for the complaint, the Administrative Judge may require the parties to submit statements of full relief, may receive evidence including testimony, and/or require oral argument. After issuing the order and a determination of the appropriate remedy, the Administrative Judge shall return the hearing file to the agency, which shall have forty (40) days to take final action. &#x00A7; 1614.110(a). Once the agency takes final action, the complainant will have thirty days within which to file an appeal. &#x00A7; 1614.402(a). If the agency fails to provide the full and complete remedy as promised, the complainant may seek compliance from the agency and, failing that, file an appeal with the Commission<span class="Italic">. See</span> &#x00A7; 1614.504(a); <span class="Italic">see also Miller v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980345 (July 20, 1998); <span class="Italic">Perlingiero v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941176 (Feb. 24, 1995); <span class="Italic">Poirrier v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933308 (May 5, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">16.&#x2003;Hold a hearing in abeyance</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An Administrative Judge may hold a hearing in abeyance in the event that a party is unable to proceed with the hearing for reasons such as illness, military assignment, or for other good cause shown.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Summary Judgment (Decisions Without a Hearing)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">On Motion of a Party</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A party who believes that some or all material facts are not in genuine dispute may file a motion in support of this contention with the Administrative Judge at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, or at such earlier time as required by the Administrative Judge. This is similar to summary judgment in court. The Administrative Judge may, in the acknowledgment order, specify a date for filing such a motion and provide for extending that time in certain circumstances. A copy of any such motion shall be served on the opposing party.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The opposing party will have 15 days from the receipt of the statement in which to file any opposition to the statement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After considering the request and the opposing submission, if any, the Administrative Judge may deny the request, order that discovery be permitted on the facts involved, limit the hearing to the issues remaining in dispute (if any), issue a decision without a hearing, or make such other rulings as are appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">On Administrative Judge's Determination</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the Administrative Judge determines that some or all of the material facts are not in genuine dispute, s/he may, after giving notice to the parties and providing them an opportunity to respond within 15 days of receipt of the notice, issue an order limiting the scope of the hearing or issue a decision without conducting a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Oral Argument or Testimony on Summary Judgment Motion</p>
<p class="noindent-2">At his/her discretion, the Administrative Judge may provide notice requiring the parties to appear and present oral argument or testimony on a motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Legal Standard for the Use of Summary Judgment</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Summary judgment is proper when "material facts are not in genuine dispute." &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). Only a dispute over facts that are truly <span class="Italic">material</span> to the outcome of the case should preclude summary judgment<span class="Italic">. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.</span>, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the <span id="Page_441"></span>suit under the governing law, and not irrelevant or unnecessary factual disputes, will preclude the entry of summary judgment). For example, when a complainant is unable to set forth facts necessary to establish one essential element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, a dispute over facts necessary to prove another element of the case would not be material to the outcome<span class="Italic">. Celotex v. Catrett</span>, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Moreover, a mere recitation that there is a factual dispute is insufficient. The party opposing summary judgment must identify the disputed facts in the record with specificity or demonstrate that there is a dispute by producing affidavits or records that tend to disprove the facts asserted by the moving party. In addition, the non-moving party must explain how the facts in dispute are material under the legal principles applicable to the case. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e)(2);<span class="Italic"> Anderson</span>, 477 U.S. at 322-24; <span class="Italic">Patton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930055 (July 1, 1993) (summary judgment proper where appellant made only a general pleading that his job performance was good but set forth no specific facts regarding his performance and identified no specific inadequacies in the investigation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">F.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Transmittal of the Decision and Hearing Record</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the conclusion of the hearing stage the Administrative Judge shall send to the parties copies of the record produced at the hearing stage of the process, including the transcript of the hearing, if any, as well as the decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge may, when necessary, release the transcript prior to the issuance of the decision, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, when the transcript is needed to prepare a post-hearing brief or to prepare for a hearing on relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge may issue a decision from the bench after the conclusion of the hearing, in lieu of issuing a written decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">As can be seen from the above recitation, the administrative judge has broad powers that permeate all aspects of the hearing process. Most of the powers the Commission has vested in its administrative judges are discretionary; that is, it is within the judge's discretion whether or not to exercise those powers in any given case and the Commission, on appeal, will not interfere with the exercise of those powers absent an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the past, there has been a great deal of variation in prehearing and hearing practice among the Commission's district offices and even among the judges within a district office. The Commission, through the 1999 revisions of MD-110, moved toward standardizing hearing practices. Internally, the EEOC also began efforts to achieve an even greater degree of standardization through the issuance of a <span class="Italic">Handbook for Administrative Judges</span>. That effort was brought to fruition with the publication of a <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> that became effective July 1, 2002. The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> is discussed below.</p>
