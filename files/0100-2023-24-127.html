<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-107"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">As early as 1982, the Commission had given strong indications that it viewed reassignment as an accommodation option agencies should consider. In <span class="Italic">Philbrook v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01820028 (1982), the Commission held that an agency does not carry its burden of demonstrating that a requested accommodation of reassignment to a former position would impose a hardship on the agency simply by stating that the employee was reassigned as part of an agency reorganization. The agency must make a showing that reassigning the employee with a disability to his former position would serve to defeat the purpose of the reorganization. In the alternative, the Commission noted that if reassignment were not possible, the agency should provide the employee with specialized training in his new position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board, for its part, began making its own law on the subject the following year in the case of <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 03840005 (1984). There was some disagreement on the facts as the case progressed and bounced back and forth between the Board and the Commission. The essential facts, however, were as follows. The employee had a history of leg injury prior to his employment by the agency. He was initially hired as a distribution clerk and later reassigned to the position of a letter carrier. After successfully performing the duties of letter carrier for a few years, the employee began to experience difficulty with his prior leg injury. He was unable to work for a significant period of time and took considerable sick leave. With treatment, the condition improved and the employee was cleared to resume letter carrier duties on flat, but not hilly, terrain. The agency denied the employee's request for light duty and reassignment to his past position. The agency subsequently removed the employee on the basis that he was physically unable to perform the duties of his position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The removal was appealed to the MSPB. In an initial decision, the Board's presiding official found that the agency engaged in disability discrimination when it refused to reassign him to his former position since he was able to perform the duties of that position. The full Board reversed the case on petition for review, focusing on a narrow interpretation of 29 CFR 1613.702(f) which defined a qualified person with a disability as someone who "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essentials of the position in question...." In essence, the Board found that the word "position" meant just what it said and that the agency was not required to consider whether the employee could be reassigned to other positions. As noted in a dissent by Board member Devaney, the majority decision was against the weight of authority of both the Commission and the Office of Personnel Management. He also made note of the 1980 amendment to the disability retirement statute, 5 USC 8337(a), which had expanded the qualification for disability retirement to include an inability to perform useful and efficient service in the position last held, or any vacant position for which the employee is qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">The case moved on to the Commission and its decision speaks largely for itself. In <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 03840005 (1984), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board found that reassignment was not, as a general principle, a means of reasonable accommodation. The Board reaches this conclusion by focusing upon the word "position" and finding that the singular use of this noun dictates that its meaning is limited to the last position held. The Commission holds the word "position" as well as the phrase "position in question" under our regulations encompasses a broader meaning when applied to factual situations such as this. Specifically, we hold that the "position in question" is not limited to the position occupied or held by the complainant, but also includes the position the complainant could have held as a result of reasonable accommodation. The Commission has previously held that reasonable accommodation <span class="Italic">may</span> <span class="Italic">include</span> reassignment to another position although not specifically listed in the regulation. The touchstone for determining whether a particular personnel action or device is appropriate is determined by its reasonableness. It may well be the case that reassignment is eminently more reasonable and less onerous from an agency's perspective than job restructuring or any other action that is specifically listed in 29 CFR 1613.704(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is important to consider both the legislative history and Congressional mandates of the Rehabilitation Act on Federal agencies. The legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act shows that Congress expected and fully intended that the Federal government was to be a model employer of the handicapped, taking affirmative action to hire and promote the disabled.

The Rehabilitation Act requires all government agencies of the executive branch and the Postal Service to establish comprehensive affirmative action plans for hiring, placing, and advancing handicapped individuals. By the 1978 amendments to the Act, Congress made it clear that non-discrimination against the handicapped was an "obligation" on the part of the Federal government, not a "gratuity." <span class="Italic">Shirley v. Devine</span>, 670 F.2d 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1982). In <span class="Italic">McNutt v. Hills</span>, 426 F. Supp. 990 (D.D.C. 1977), the court's finding of discrimination against a blind employee turned in large part on the agency's failure to take cognizance of his handicap and assist him in overcoming it. The agency's "failure to meet its obligation toward the physically handicapped on a department-wide level were an essential part of the discrimination that plaintiff suffered as an individual."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reassignment as a means of reasonable accommodation is consistent with the case law.... The obligation of the federal employer is not merely the employment of a handicapped person but an appropriate placement of such an employee. In other words, the federal employer has a continuing obligation to the handicapped employee after hiring him.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also rejected a secondary holding of the Board that reassigning the employee as an accommodation would violate the collective bargaining agreement in effect. The EEOC found the Rehabilitation Act, as a federal statute, superseded any collective bargaining provision and could not be a bar to reasonable accommodation. But see "<a href="0100-2023-24-078.html#sec15-59">Collective Bargaining Agreements,</a>" above.</p>
<p class="noindent">The case was referred back to the Board. Once again, the Board affirmed its previous finding with the dissent of member Devaney. (The dissent is worth reading for its enlightening and amusing comments on the overlapping jurisdiction of the Board and Commission.)</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1986, the Special Panel resolved the issue, deferring to the EEOC's interpretation of the Rehabilitation Act and its own regulations. <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 03840005 (1986). Essentially, the Special Panel in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> resolved the dispute by noting that the EEOC has primary jurisdiction over allegations of discrimination and that the Commission had not relied on an interpretation of civil service law in reaching its conclusion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the EEOC's decision does not constitute an incorrect interpretation of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive, it remains for us to determine whether there is any reasonable basis for the EEOC's decision. We find that although there is room for disagreement on the merits, a reasonable basis for the decision does exist. The EEOC interpreted its own regulations in this instance, concluding that the list of accommodations therein was not inclusive, but should be construed as including reassignment.... We have not been apprised of any law which would render such an interpretation unreasonable or preclude the possibility that reassignment is within the scope of reasonable accommodation. In fact, the EEOC advances its own reasons why such an interpretation is indeed reasonable. Whether it is the most reasonable or the only reasonable interpretation is irrelevant, since we need only find, as we have, that the EEOC's interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the Rehabilitation Act and regulations promulgated thereto.</p>
<p class="noindent">The lone dissenter to the opinion of the Special Panel was Member Herbert Ellingwood, who, at the time, served as chairman of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent">After <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, many agencies still argued that they were not required to consider reassignment as an accommodation. However, it was clear that the Commission still adhered to the view that reassignment may be required in some circumstances. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03890111 (1990), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Special Panel determined that "reassignment is within the scope of reasonable accommodation" and is "consistent with <span id="Page_1369"></span>the Rehabilitation Act and regulations promulgated by Section 501 thereto." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 486. Reassignment is authorized by Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act's affirmative action requirement and Congressional intent that the Federal government be a model employer of persons with disabilities. The Supreme Court has indicated that even under the less stringent nondiscrimination requirements of Section 504, reassignment may be required in certain circumstances. In <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline</span>, ___ U.S. ___, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 1131, n.19 (1987), the Supreme Court noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Employers have an obligation to make a reasonable accommodation for a handicapped employee. Although they are not required to find another job for an employee who is not qualified for the job he or she was doing, they cannot deny an employee alternative employment opportunities reasonably available under the employer's existing policies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even under the less stringent nondiscrimination requirements of Section 504, <span class="Italic">Arline</span> indicates that reassignment cannot be denied where "alternative employment opportunities" are "reasonably available under the employer's existing policies."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wiley v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880197 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the <span class="Italic">Lamb</span> case the Commission also held that an agency is only required to make reasonable reassignment efforts, not "consider reassignment <span class="Italic">ad</span> <span class="Italic">infinitum</span>." The agency met this obligation by showing that it had attempted to place the complainant in two different positions, and she was unable to perform in either job. The complainant was also unable to point to any permanent position for which she was qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency could not use reassignment as a reasonable accommodation unless it first determined there was no reasonable accommodation that could be made for the position for which the complainant applied<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Evans v. USPS</span>, 01810211 (1983). In that case, the agency determined that an employee with a 60% disability in his arm could not perform the duties of a letter carrier. The agency then offered him another position. The Commission noted that the determination that the complainant could not perform the duties of a letter carrier was made without any consideration of accommodation in that position. But, to exclude reassignment from consideration as an accommodation is "tantamount to excluding...what might be the easiest, least costly, and most reasonable accommodation a federal employer could provide." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hinton v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01853440 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">While an agency was required to "make every reasonable effort" to reassign a qualified individual with a disability who could not otherwise be accommodated in his position, there was no requirement that those efforts actually result in reassignment. <span class="Italic">Ortegon v. Department of Navy</span>, 05870113 (1987).</p>
