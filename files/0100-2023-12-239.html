<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-225"><span class="space">1.</span> Allegations of Harassment</h4>
<p class="noindent">The reassignment of the complainant to another section of the agency and the retirement of two of the supervisors alleged to have engaged in harassment do not moot a complaint where the allegations of harassment also extend to other agency employees. <span class="Italic">Huddleston v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01923971 (1992). Because the complainant still worked for the agency and agency employees other than the retired supervisors were involved in the alleged harassment, the Commission found "that there exists some likelihood that the alleged violations could recur."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has tended to find few cases involving hostile environment allegations rendered moot by some change in the status of the complainant. In cases that involve some form of ongoing harassment directed at a particular group, the retirement of the complainant from the agency may not render the complaint moot when there is still a question regarding a generally discriminatory work atmosphere. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cotton v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05910499 (1991), the employee complained that the agency permitted a racially charged atmosphere to exist where racially derogatory comments and epithets directed toward him were commonplace. The complainant further alleged that he was denied various promotional opportunities. Subsequent to the filing of his complaint, he retired from the agency. Although it was unclear from the existing record in <span class="Italic">Cotton</span> whether appellant would still be entitled to relief, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it is true that appellant's retirement eradicated the effects of the racial epithets and derogatory comments by removing him from the work environment, the record establishes the truth of at least some of this clearly racist and outrageous conduct on the part of agency officials. This matter should be further investigated in light of appellant's possible nonpromotion allegation. Furthermore, assuming no discrimination were to be found as to appellant's nonpromotion allegation, the Commission would retain jurisdiction to ensure that the racist environment in appellant's previous office has been by this date completely eradicated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Cass v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Contract Audit Agency</span>, 01922834 (1992). In that case, the Commission noted that the agency "has a responsibility to take affirmative steps to eliminate such conduct, including disciplining the alleged harasser and ordering the conduct to cease." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency was ordered to continue processing the complaint, even though the complainant was no longer employed by the office in which the complaint arose.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, the Commission seemed to infer that the doctrine only applied in cases where the agency has reason to suspect the harassment is ongoing. In <span class="Italic">Yokotobi v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05910087 (1991), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, since Title VII affords all employees the right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, the Commission will not allow an agency to avoid its obligation to prevent and eliminate such conduct simply because the complaining party no longer works in the allegedly offensive environment. Rather, in instances where an agency has reasons to suspect that harassment is ongoing, it has a responsibility to take affirmative steps to eliminate such conduct, including disciplining (rather than merely counseling) the alleged harasser and ordering that the conduct cease. Accordingly, we find that appellant does not "lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome" of this case and therefore her allegations are not moot. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 440 U.S. at 631 (quoting <span class="Italic">Powell v. McCormack</span>, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969)).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission did not attempt to define what constitutes "reasons to suspect" that the harassment is ongoing.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant alleges that a single incident is part of a pattern of harassment, the case does not become moot even when the agency entirely rescinds its action. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bonk v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01945736 (1995), the complainant alleged that a proposed one-day suspension was part of a pattern of harassment. Thereafter, the agency notified the complainant that it had decided not to suspend her and that the proposal to suspend would not become part of her official personnel file. The Commission reversed the agency's subsequent decision to dismiss the complaint as moot because the agency's actions did not address the allegation of a pattern of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case, the Commission held that, even though both the complainant and the supervisor alleged to have engaged in harassment had since retired from the agency, a claim for compensatory damages means the case is not rendered moot. Although in such circumstances it can be said with reasonable assurance that the harassment will not recur, the effects of the alleged discrimination have not been completely eradicated. <span class="Italic">Estefania v. Small Business Administration</span>, 01940838 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lloye v. Secretary of Transportation, FAA</span>, 01963173 (1996), the Commission found that even though the agency changed the complainant's supervisor following allegations of harassment by him, the complaint was not moot:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, it cannot be said that interim relief or events have completely eradicated the effects of the alleged violation. Here, appellant alleges that the change in supervisors and the implementation of a new training plan does not completely eradicate the effects of the alleged violations. Appellant identifies several situations in which she may be subject to the presence or control of her former supervisor, or assigned to work in the same operating quarters. She states that she is aware that she and her supervisor still work at the same facility and that the agency has not assured her that their contact has ended.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cunningham, et al. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01200732167 (2007) (complaint not rendered moot where harasser has left the agency when complainants requested compensatory damages); <span class="Italic">Lind v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01993432 (2000) (transfer of an alleged harasser does not render a complaint moot because it does not address the effects of past harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">The request for damages does not have to be specific to avoid mootness. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120142708 (2015), the Commission found that alleging harm was sufficient to avoid mootness:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has also argued that this EEO complaint has been rendered moot because Complainant left the Agency on June 28, 2014, on a disability retirement and, therefore, is no longer under the authority of the Supervisor. The regulation set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(5) provides for the dismissal of a complaint when the issues raised therein are moot. To determine, whether the issues raised in complainant's complaint are moot, the factfinder must ascertain whether: (1) it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur; and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged discrimination. <span class="Italic">See County of Los Angeles v. Davis</span>, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979); <span class="Italic">Kuo v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970343 (July 10, 1998). When such circumstances exist, no relief is available and no need for a determination of the rights of the parties is presented.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has not established that the effects of the alleged discrimination have been completely and irrevocably eradicated. We acknowledge that Complainant has not expressly sought compensatory damages as a remedy. However, we note that Complainant stated in his formal complaint that the actions by the Supervisor created "unwanted stress, elevated hypertension, and flare-ups of [his] chronic lower back pain." We find that Complainant's statement indicates a claim for compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01944372 (Feb. 7, 1995) (finding that complainant's statement regarding <span id="Page_285"></span>physical and mental anguish to be sufficient to place the agency on notice that she may be seeking compensatory damages). As such, we find that there is relief that may be available for Complainant and that dismissal of the matter pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(5) is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120103729 (2011), the Commission also found that the complaint was not moot where a team leader in Afghanistan subjected the complainant to Jewish slurs. The agency found the complainant was moot because the complainant had returned to the United States and the team leader was still in Afghanistan. However, the Commission noted that the team leader had since returned from Afghanistan and, although no longer assigned to work with the complainant, they continued to cross paths. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency responded to Complainant's appeal stating that although the Team Leader has returned to the United States, he and Complainant do not come into contact with one another just as they had not prior to their deployment to Afghanistan. In support of its assertion, the Agency provided an affidavit from the Team Leader who stated that although he works at the same facility as Complainant, the facility has a large complex of office structures and that he has not had any interactions with Complainant. The Team Leader also averred that since his return in July 2010, he had seen Complainant on one occasion but they were far from one another. He indicated that neither have work interactions nor does he envision any future work interaction with Complainant. Further, the Agency argued that Complainant did not raise compensatory damages. As such, the Agency concluded that the alleged harassment would not recur and that the effects of discrimination were eradicated. Further, the Agency indicated that Complainant still had not stated a claim of harassment. The Agency noted that when Complainant raised the issue with his management, the Agency took prompt, effective action. As such, the Agency claimed that Complainant would not be able to establish that the Agency is liable for the alleged harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the Agency has not established that the matter at hand is moot. We note that Complainant has averred that he is assigned to the same division as the Team Leader and has had constant interactions with him since his return from Afghanistan. Further, although the Team Leader provided an affidavit that he did not interact with Complainant, he did state that he saw Complainant in the workplace since his return to the United States. In addition, the type of harassment alleged by Complainant could recur and did not require any particular relationship between Complainant and the Team Leader. We also determine that the Agency had not shown that the effects of the alleged harassment had been eradicated. A review of the documents within the record including but not limited to the EEO Counselor's report and emails, clearly showed that Complainant asserted that he was subjected to pain and suffering based on his interactions with the Team Leader. We also note that Complainant stated on his formal complaint that the Agency should contact the Attorney for information regarding the relief sought by Complainant. Based on the documents and the affidavit from the Attorney, the Commission finds that Complainant did, in fact, seek compensatory damages regarding the alleged harassment. The Agency failed to make any inquiry regarding such damages. As such, we conclude that the effects of the alleged harassment had not been eradicated. Therefore, the Agency's dismissal pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(5) was not appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, a mere allegation of harassment will not prevent a complaint from being declared moot. The Commission will examine the specific allegations of harassment to determine if there are any lingering effects that continue to aggrieve the complainant. When the specific allegations relate to distinct incidents in time, the Commission has found there are no lingering effects. For example, in <span class="Italic">Clark v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05921078 (1993), the Commission rejected the appellant's arguments, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant argues in her request to reopen that her claim is not moot because she continues to challenge her removal in federal court. The Commission is not persuaded by this argument.... Because her removal has already been upheld by the MSPB, we find the possibility of appellant's eventual reinstatement to be too tenuous a basis, in this instance, upon which to find that appellant remains aggrieved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, appellant cites <span class="Italic">Akiko J. Yokotobi v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, in support of her assertion that her claim is not moot because she alleged retaliatory harassment. We find that both <span class="Italic">Yokotobi</span> and <span class="Italic">Janet M. Clark v. Department of the Army</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, that cites <span class="Italic">Yokotobi</span>, arise from allegations that are different from the instant complaint allegation. <span class="Italic">Yokotobi</span> and <span class="Italic">Clark</span> both held that in certain instances a claim of retaliatory harassment will survive even though the appellant is no longer employed by the agency. In <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, however, the particular claim stemmed from the failure of the agency to provide a performance appraisal. The Commission specifically found that appellant's complaint remained viable after her removal because of the possible negative residual effect on her future employment resulting from the agency's failure to provide an appraisal. Such negative residual effect is not present in the instant complaint in which appellant alleges that she was denied a computer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Yokotobi</span>, the complainant made 17 allegations of retaliatory harassment, some of which (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, allegations concerning performance standards and records of complaints against the appellant) could clearly have had a negative residual effect. Additionally, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Yokotobi</span> alleged constructive discharge. The Commission stated that, even absent the constructive discharge allegation, the complainant's allegations remained viable because of their possible negative residual effect. Moreover, the Commission found that in complaints alleging harassment, where the agency has reasons to suspect that the harassment is ongoing, the claim survives because of the right of other employees "to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult." In the present case, we have no similar evidence of ongoing harassment. Rather, the allegation at issue concerns an incident distinct in time and specific to the appellant, and where a remedy would inure only to the appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that the instant situation is more similar to the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Barbara A. Nagler v. Department of Education</span>, EEOC Request No. 0590098 (November 1, 1990) and <span class="Italic">Barbara A. Nagler v. Department of Education</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900766 (September 7, 1990). In these cases, the Commission found that allegations of retaliatory harassment stemming from work assignments, time and attendance records, reprimands, and certain harassing remarks did not survive after appellant resigned from her employment with the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is unclear precisely what standard, if any, the Commission uses to determine whether or not alleged harassment is likely to reoccur. But, when the complainant still works under the supervision of the alleged harasser and the agency has neither counseled nor disciplined the supervisor, the Commission has found the complaint is not moot because of the possibility that the alleged harassment will reoccur. <span class="Italic">Westhouse v. Postmaster General</span>, 05921005 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant alleges harassment by a supervisor, her claim is not necessarily rendered moot when the agency transfers her away from the supervisor. In <span class="Italic">Zapata-Rew v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01955213 (1996), the agency argued that the complaint was moot because the complainant requested a reassignment during an informal grievance, and the agency granted her request. The complainant asserted, however, that she never requested reassignment, but rather requested that her supervisor be reassigned. Since the agency presented no evidence of the informal grievance, the complaint was not moot.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant's transfer to another agency facility does not render allegations of harassment moot where the complainant further alleges that the transfer itself was involuntary and retaliation for filing an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Gephart v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01924359 (1992). Under the circumstances, there exists a reasonable likelihood the violation would reoccur. Also, the Commission found the transfer did not completely and irrevocably eradicate the effects of any alleged violations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rouse-Smith v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01955321 (1996), the Commission found that an involuntary transfer of a sexual harassment complainant to another ward was improper. However, by the time that determination was made the complainant voluntarily transferred to another ward and did not wish to return to her original ward. The Commission held that the agency erred in dismissing the complaint as moot because the complainant contended that her record still reflected the fact that she was transferred to a ward known as a repository for "troublemakers." The Commission held that the agency must expunge all reference to the transfer from the complainant's personnel file.</p>
<p class="noindent">A case is not moot when the agency grants a requested transfer, if the employee also alleges that the relief requested included retroactive seniority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fowler v. USPS</span>, 01831896 (1983). Moreover, a transfer does not fully eradicate the effects of harassment when the employee alleges she accepted the transfer to a lower-graded position to avoid further harassment. <span class="Italic">See Norlin v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01941848 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The reassignment of a coworker to a different work site does not render a complaint of harassment moot where the site is at the same work location. <span class="Italic">See Warth v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01922188 (1993). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Warth</span> alleged the harassment was continuous and the reassignment of his coworker did not eradicate the alleged hostile working environment. If a complainant alleges that his reassignment to a position aggravates an existing medical condition, a return to his previous position does not necessarily eradicate the effects of the original transfer. <span class="Italic">See Henderson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01930994 (1993).</p>
