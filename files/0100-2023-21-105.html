<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-75"><span class="space">3.</span> Reasonable Care and the Affirmative Defense</h4>
<p class="noindent">In resolving the issue of liability in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, the Supreme Court first noted that the case was not one that involved either an employer-owner directly or high-echelon supervisors. Having decided in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> that an affirmative defense was available to in hostile environment cases where the perpetrator was a supervisor or manager, the Court began to give some further definition of the rules set down in that case by applying those rules to the situation in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> and addressing the multiple opinions of the Eleventh Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, two former female lifeguards sued the city for sexual harassment. The lifeguards worked at a beach location separate from city hall and were supervised by other lifeguards who reported, through a chain-of-command, back to the recreation director in city hall. It was undisputed in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> that the female lifeguards never informed anyone of the sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court, in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 2286-94 held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals identified, and rejected, three possible grounds drawn from agency law for holding the City vicariously liable for the hostile environment created by the supervisors. It considered whether the two supervisors were acting within the scope of their employment when they engaged in the harassing conduct. The court then inquired whether they were significantly aided by the agency relationship in committing the harassment, and also considered the possibility of imputing Gordon's knowledge of the harassment to the City. Finally, the Court of Appeals ruled out liability for negligence in failing to prevent the harassment. Faragher relies principally on the latter three theories of liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A "master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment." <span class="Italic">Restatement</span> &#x00A7; 219(1). This doctrine has traditionally defined the "scope of employment" as including conduct "of the kind [a servant] is employed to perform," occurring "substantially within the authorized time and space limits," and "actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master," but as excluding an intentional use of force "unexpectable by the master."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 228(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts of Appeals have typically held, or assumed, that conduct similar to the subject of this complaint falls outside the scope of employment<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Harrison</span>, 112 F.3d, at 1444 (sexual harassment "'simply is not within the job description of any supervisor or any other worker in any reputable business'"); 111 F.3d, at 1535-1536 (case below); <span class="Italic">Andrade v. Mayfair Management, Inc.</span>, 88 F.3d 258, 261 (C.A.4 1996) ("[I]llegal sexual harassment is...beyond the scope of supervisors' employment"); <span class="Italic">Gary</span>, 59 F.3d, at 1397 (harassing supervisor acts outside the scope of his employment in creating hostile environment); <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Frank</span>, 42 F.3d 503, 508 (C.A.9 1994) ("The proper analysis for employer liability in hostile environment cases is...not whether an employee was acting within his 'scope of employment' "); <span class="Italic">Bouton v. BMW of North Am., Inc.</span>, 29 F.3d 103, 107 (C.A.3 1994) (sexual harassment is outside scope of employment); <span class="Italic">see also Ellerth v. Burlington Industries, Inc.</span>, decided with <span class="Italic">Jansen v. Packaging Corp. of America</span>, 123 F.3d 490, 561 (C.A.7 1997) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (Manion, J., concurring and dissenting) (supervisor's harassment would fall within scope of employment only in "the rare case indeed"), <span class="Italic">cert. granted</span>, No. 97-569; Lindemann &#x0026; Grossman 812 ("Hostile environment sexual harassment normally does not trigger <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> liability because sexual harassment rarely, if ever, is among the official duties of a supervisor")<span class="Italic">. But cf. Martin v. Cavalier Hotel Corp.</span>, 48 F.3d 1343, 1351-1352 (C.A.4 1995) (holding employer vicariously liable in part based on finding that the supervisor's rape of employee was within the scope of employment); <span class="Italic">Kauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc.</span>, 970 F.2d 178, 184 (C.A.6) (holding that a supervisor's harassment was within the scope of his employment, but nevertheless requiring the victim to show that the employer failed to respond adequately when it learned of the harassment), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 506 U.S. 1041, 113 S. Ct. 831, 121 L. Ed.2d 701 (1992). In so doing, the courts have emphasized that harassment consisting of unwelcome remarks and touching is motivated solely by individual desires and serves no purpose of the employer. For this reason, courts have likened hostile environment sexual harassment to the classic "frolic and detour" for which an employer has no vicarious liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These cases ostensibly stand in some tension with others arising outside <span id="Page_898"></span>Title VII, where the scope of employment has been defined broadly enough to hold employers vicariously liable for intentional torts that were in no sense inspired by any purpose to serve the employer. In <span class="Italic">Ira S. Bushey &#x0026; Sons, Inc. v. United States</span>, 398 F.2d 167 (1968), for example, the Second Circuit charged the Government with vicarious liability for the depredation of a drunken sailor returning to his ship after a night's carouse, who inexplicably opened valves that flooded a drydock, damaging both the drydock and the ship. Judge Friendly acknowledged that the sailor's conduct was not remotely motivated by a purpose to serve his employer, but relied on the "deeply rooted sentiment that a business enterprise cannot justly disclaim responsibility for accidents which may fairly be said to be characteristic of its activities," and imposed vicarious liability on the ground that the sailor's conduct "was not so 'unforeseeable' as to make it unfair to charge the Government with responsibility."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 171. Other examples of an expansive sense of scope of employment are readily found, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Leonbruno v. Champlain Silk Mills</span>, 229 N.Y. 470, 128 N.E. 711 (1920) (opinion of Cardozo, J.) (employer was liable under worker's compensation statute for eye injury sustained when employee threw an apple at another; the accident arose "in the course of employment" because such horseplay should be expected); <span class="Italic">Carr v. Wm. C. Crowell Co.</span>, 28 Cal.2d 652, 171 P.2d 5 (1946) (employer liable for actions of carpenter who attacked a co-employee with a hammer). Courts, in fact, have treated scope of employment generously enough to include sexual assaults<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Primeaux v. United States</span>, 102 F.3d 1458, 1462-1463 (C.A.8 1996) (federal police officer on limited duty sexually assaulted stranded motorist); <span class="Italic">Mary M. v. Los Angeles</span>, 54 Cal.3d 202, 216-221, 285 Cal. Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d 1341, 1349-1352 (1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (police officer raped motorist after placing her under arrest); <span class="Italic">Doe v. Samaritan Counseling Ctr.</span>, 791 P.2d 344, 348-349 (Alaska 1990) (therapist had sexual relations with patient); <span class="Italic">Turner v. State</span>, 494 So.2d 1291, 1296 (La. App. 1986) (National Guard recruiting officer committed sexual battery during sham physical examinations); <span class="Italic">Lyon v. Carey</span>, 533 F.2d 649, 655 (C.A.D.C. 1976) (furniture deliveryman raped recipient of furniture); <span class="Italic">Samuels v. Southern Baptist Hospital</span>, 594 So. 2d 571, 574 (La. App. 1992) (nursing assistant raped patient). The rationales for these decisions have varied, with some courts echoing <span class="Italic">Bushey</span> in explaining that the employee's acts were foreseeable and that the employer should in fairness bear the resulting costs of doing business, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Mary M., supra</span>, at 218, 285 Cal. Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d., at 1350, and others finding that the employee's sexual misconduct arose from or was in some way related to the employee's essential duties<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Samuels, supra</span>, at 574 (tortious conduct was "reasonably incidental" to the performance of the nursing assistant's duties in caring for a "helpless" patient in a "locked environment").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An assignment to reconcile the run of the Title VII cases with those just cited would be a taxing one. Here it is enough to recognize that their disparate results do not necessarily reflect wildly varying terms of the particular employment contracts involved, but represent differing judgments about the desirability of holding an employer liable for his subordinates' wayward behavior. In the instances in which there is a genuine question about the employer's responsibility for harmful conduct he did not in fact authorize, a holding that the conduct falls within the scope of employment ultimately expresses a conclusion not of fact but of law. As one eminent authority has observed, the "highly indefinite phrase" is "devoid of meaning in itself" and is "obviously no more than a bare formula to cover the unordered and unauthorized acts of the servant for which it is found to be expedient to charge the master with liability, as well as to exclude other acts for which it is not." W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &#x0026; D. Owen, Prosser and Keaton on the Law of Torts 502 (5th ed. 1984);<span class="Italic"> see also</span> Seavey, Speculations as to "<span class="Italic">Respondeat Superior</span>," in Studies in Agency 129, 155 (1949) ("The liability of a master to a third person for the torts of a servant has been widely extended by aid of the elastic phrase 'scope of the employment' which may be used to include all which the court wishes to put into it"). Older cases, for example, treated smoking by an employee during working hours as an act outside the scope of employment, but more recently courts have generally held smoking on the job to fall within the scope. Prosser &#x0026; Keeton, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 504, and n.23. It is not that employers formerly did not authorize smoking but have now begun to do so, or that employees previously smoked for their own purposes but now do so to serve the employer. We simply understand smoking differently now and have revised the old judgments about what ought to be done about it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proper analysis here, then, calls not for a mechanical application of indefinite and malleable factors set forth in the Restatement, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 219, 228, 229, but rather an enquiry into the reasons that would support a conclusion that harassing behavior ought to be held within the scope of a supervisor's employment, and the reasons for the opposite view. The Restatement itself points to such an approach, as in the commentary that the "ultimate question" in determining the scope of employment is "whether or not it is just that the loss resulting from the servant's acts should be considered as one of the normal risks to be borne by the business in which the servant is employed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 229, Comment a<span class="Italic">. See generally Taber v. Maine</span>, 67 F.3d 1029, 1037 (C.A.2 1995) ("As the leading Torts treatise has put it, 'the integrating principle' of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> is 'that the employer should be liable for those faults that may be fairly regarded as risks of his business, whether they are committed in furthering it or not'") (quoting 5 F. Harper, F. James &#x0026; O. Gray, <span class="Italic">Law of Torts</span> &#x00A7; 26.8, pp. 40-41 (2d ed. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, a justification for holding the offensive behavior within the scope of Terry's and Silverman's employment was well put in Judge Barkett's dissent: "[A] pervasively hostile work environment of sexual harassment is never (one would hope) authorized, but the supervisor is clearly charged with maintaining a productive, safe work environment. The supervisor directs and controls the conduct of the employees, and the manner of doing so may inure to the employer's benefit or detriment, including subjecting the employer to Title VII liability." 111 F.3d, at 1542 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part). It is by now well recognized that hostile environment sexual harassment by supervisors (and, for that matter, co-employees) is a persistent problem in the workplace<span class="Italic">. See</span> Lindemann &#x0026; Kadue 4-5 (discussing studies showing prevalence of sexual harassment); <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 123 F.3d, at 511 (Posner, C. J., concurring and dissenting) ("[E]veryone knows by now that sexual harassment is a common problem in the American workplace"). An employer can, in a general sense, reasonably anticipate the possibility of such conduct occurring in its workplace, and one might justify the assignment of the burden of the untoward behavior to the employer as one of the costs of doing business, to be charged to the enterprise rather than the victim. As noted, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 17-18, developments like this occur from time to time in the law of agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two things counsel us to draw the contrary conclusion. First, there is no reason to suppose that Congress wished courts to ignore the traditional distinction between acts falling within the scope and acts amounting to what the older law called frolics or detours from the course of employment. Such a distinction can readily be applied to the spectrum of possible harassing conduct by supervisors, as the following examples show. First, a supervisor might discriminate racially in job assignments in order to placate the prejudice pervasive in the labor force. Instances of this variety of the heckler's veto would be consciously intended to further the employer's interests by preserving peace in the workplace. Next, supervisors might reprimand male employees for workplace failings with banter, but respond to women's shortcomings in harsh or vulgar terms. A third example might be the supervisor who, as here, expresses his sexual interests in ways having no apparent object whatever of serving an interest of the employer. If a line is to be drawn between scope and frolic, it would lie between the first two examples and the third, and it thus makes sense in terms of traditional agency law to analyze the scope issue, in cases like the third example, just as most federal courts addressing that issue have done, classifying the harassment as beyond the scope of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second reason goes to an even broader unanimity of views among the holdings of District Courts and Courts of Appeals thus far. Those courts have held not only that the sort of harassment at issue here was outside the scope of supervisors' authority, but, by uniformly judging employer liability for co-worker harassment under a negligence standard, they have also implicitly treated such harassment as outside the scope of common employees' duties as well<span class="Italic">. See Blankenship v. Parke Care Centers, Inc.</span>, 123 F.3d 868, 872-873 (C.A.6 1997), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 522 U.S. __ (1998); <span class="Italic">Fleming v.

Philadelphia</span>, 895 F.2d 1469, 1486 (C.A.3 1990); <span class="Italic">cf. Morrison v. Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc.</span>, 108 F.3d 429, 438 (C.A.1 1997) (applying "knew or should have known" standard to claims of environmental harassment by a supervisor); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(d) (1997) (employer is liable for co-worker harassment if it "knows or should have known of the conduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action"); 3 L. Larson &#x0026; A. Larson, <span class="Italic">Employment Discrimination</span> &#x00A7; 46.07[4][a], p. 46-101 (2d ed. 1998) (courts "uniformly" apply EEOC rule; "[i]t is not a controversial area"). If, indeed, the cases did not rest, at least implicitly, on the notion that such harassment falls outside the scope of employment, their liability issues would have turned simply on the application of the scope of employment rule<span class="Italic">. Cf. Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers, Inc.</span>, 797 F.2d 1417, 1422 (C.A.7 1986) (noting that employer will not usually be liable under <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> for employee's racial harassment because it "would be the rare case where racial harassment...could be thought by the author of the harassment to help the employer's business").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is quite unlikely that these cases would escape efforts to render them obsolete if we were to hold that supervisors who engage in discriminatory harassment are necessarily acting within the scope of <span id="Page_899"></span>their employment. The rationale for placing harassment within the scope of supervisory authority would be the fairness of requiring the employer to bear the burden of foreseeable social behavior, and the same rationale would apply when the behavior was that of co-employees. The employer generally benefits just as obviously from the work of common employees as from the work of supervisors; they simply have different jobs to do, all aimed at the success of the enterprise. As between an innocent employer and an innocent employee, if we use scope of employment reasoning to require the employer to bear the cost of an actionably hostile workplace created by one class of employees (i.e., supervisors), it could appear just as appropriate to do the same when the environment was created by another class (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, co-workers).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The answer to this argument might well be to point out that the scope of supervisory employment may be treated separately by recognizing that supervisors have special authority enhancing their capacity to harass, and that the employer can guard against their misbehavior more easily because their numbers are by definition fewer than the numbers of regular employees. But this answer happens to implicate an entirely separate category of agency law (to be considered in the next section), which imposes vicarious liability on employers for tortious acts committed by use of particular authority conferred as an element of an employee's agency relationship with the employer. Since the virtue of categorical clarity is obvious, it is better to reject reliance on misuse of supervisory authority (without more) as irrelevant to scope-of-employment analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals also rejected vicarious liability on the part of the City insofar as it might rest on the concluding principle set forth in &#x00A7; 219(2)(d) of the <span class="Italic">Restatement</span>, that an employer "is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment unless...the servant purported to act or speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance on apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation." Faragher points to several ways in which the agency relationship aided Terry and Silverman in carrying out their harassment. She argues that in general offending supervisors can abuse their authority to keep subordinates in their presence while they make offensive statements, and that they implicitly threaten to misuse their supervisory powers to deter any resistance or complaint. Thus, she maintains that power conferred on Terry and Silverman by the City enabled them to act for so long without provoking defiance or complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The City, however, contends that &#x00A7; 219(2)(d) has no application here. It argues that the second qualification of the subsection, referring to a servant "aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation," merely "refines" the one preceding it, which holds the employer vicariously liable for its servant's abuse of apparent authority. Brief for Respondent 30-31, and n.24. But this narrow reading is untenable; it would render the second qualification of &#x00A7; 219(2)(d) almost entirely superfluous (and would seem to ask us to shut our eyes to the potential effects of supervisory authority, even when not explicitly invoked). The illustrations accompanying this subsection make clear that it covers not only cases involving the abuse of apparent authority, but also to cases in which tortious conduct is made possible or facilitated by the existence of the actual agency relationship<span class="Italic">. See Restatement</span> &#x00A7; 219 Comment e (noting employer liability where "the servant may be able to cause harm because of his position as agent, as where a telegraph operator sends false messages purporting to come from third persons" and where the manager who operates a store "for an undisclosed principal is enabled to cheat the customers because of his position"); &#x00A7; 247, Illustration 1 (noting a newspaper's liability for a libelous editorial published by an editor acting for his own purposes).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore agree with Faragher that in implementing Title VII it makes sense to hold an employer vicariously liable for some tortious conduct of a supervisor made possible by abuse of his supervisory authority, and that the aided-by-agency-relation principle embodied in &#x00A7; 219(2)(d) of the <span class="Italic">Restatement</span> provides an appropriate starting point for determining liability for the kind of harassment presented here. Several courts, indeed, have noted what Faragher has argued, that there is a sense in which a harassing supervisor is always assisted in his misconduct by the supervisory relationship<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Rodgers v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co.</span>, 12 F.3d 668, 675 (C.A.7 1993); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Metzger</span>, 152 N.J. 490, 505, 706 A. 2d 685, 692 (1998) (emphasizing that a supervisor's conduct may have a greater impact than that of colleagues at the same level); <span class="Italic">cf. Torres</span>, 116 F.3d, at 631<span class="Italic">. See also White v. Monsanto Co.</span>, 585 So.2d 1205, 1209-1210 (La. 1991) (a supervisor's harassment of a subordinate is more apt to rise to the level of intentional infliction of emotional distress than comparable harassment by a co-employee); <span class="Italic">Contreras v. Crown Zellerbach Corp.</span>, 88 Wash.2d 735, 740, 565 P.2d 1173, 1176 (1977) (same); <span class="Italic">Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc.</span>, 2 Cal.3d 493, 498-499, and n.2, 86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216, 218-219, and n.2 (1970) (same). The agency relationship affords contact with an employee subjected to a supervisor's sexual harassment, and the victim may well be reluctant to accept the risks of blowing the whistle on a superior. When a person with supervisory authority discriminates in the terms and conditions of subordinates' employment, his actions necessarily draw upon his superior position over the people who report to him, or those under them, whereas an employee generally cannot check a supervisor's abusive conduct the same way that she might deal with abuse from a co-worker. When a fellow employee harasses, the victim can walk away or tell the offender where to go, but it may be difficult to offer such responses to a supervisor, whose "power to supervise--[which may be] to hire and fire, and to set work schedules and pay rates--does not disappear...when he chooses to harass through insults and offensive gestures rather than directly with threats of firing or promises of promotion." Estrich, Sex at Work, 43 Stan. L. Rev. 813, 854 (1991). Recognition of employer liability when discriminatory misuse of supervisory authority alters the terms and conditions of a victim's employment is underscored by the fact that the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by common workers; employers have greater opportunity and incentive to screen them, train them, and monitor their performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, there are good reasons for vicarious liability for misuse of supervisory authority. That rationale must, however, satisfy one more condition. We are not entitled to recognize this theory under Title VII unless we can square it with <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>'s holding that an employer is not "automatically" liable for harassment by a supervisor who creates the requisite degree of discrimination, and there is obviously some tension between that holding and the position that a supervisor's misconduct aided by supervisory authority subjects the employer to liability vicariously; if the "aid" may be the unspoken suggestion of retaliation by misuse of supervisory authority, the risk of automatic liability is high. To counter it, we think there are two basic alternatives, one being to require proof of some affirmative invocation of that authority by the harassing supervisor, the other to recognize an affirmative defense to liability in some circumstances, even when a supervisor has created the actionable environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is certainly some authority for requiring active or affirmative, as distinct from passive or implicit, misuse of supervisory authority before liability may be imputed. That is the way some courts have viewed the familiar cases holding the employer liable for discriminatory employment action with tangible consequences, like firing and demotion<span class="Italic">. See supra</span>, at 11-12. And we have already noted some examples of liability provided by the <span class="Italic">Restatement</span> itself, which suggests that an affirmative misuse of power might be required<span class="Italic">. See supra</span>, at 23-24 (telegraph operator sends false messages, a store manager cheats customers, editor publishes libelous editorial).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But neat examples illustrating the line between the affirmative and merely implicit uses of power are not easy to come by in considering management behavior. Supervisors do not make speeches threatening sanctions whenever they make requests in the legitimate exercise of managerial authority, and yet every subordinate employee knows the sanctions exist; this is the reason that courts have consistently held that acts of supervisors have greater power to alter the environment than acts of co-employees generally, <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, at 24-25. How far from the course of ostensible supervisory behavior would a company officer have to step before his orders would not reasonably be seen as actively using authority? Judgment calls would often be close, the results would often seem disparate even if not demonstrably contradictory, and the temptation to litigate would be hard to resist. We think plaintiffs and defendants alike would be poorly served by an active-use rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The other basic alternative to automatic liability would avoid this particular temptation to litigate, but allow an employer to show as an affirmative defense to liability that the employer had exercised reasonable care to avoid harassment and to eliminate it when it might occur, and that the complaining employee had failed to act with like reasonable care to take advantage of the employer's safeguards and otherwise to prevent harm that could have been avoided. This composite defense would, we think, implement the statute sensibly, for reasons that are not hard to fathom.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Title VII seeks "to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination," <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975), its "primary objective," like that of any statute meant to influence primary conduct, is not to provide redress but to avoid harm<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 417. As long ago as 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), charged with the enforcement of Title VII, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-4, adopted regulations advising employers to "take all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as...informing employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(f) (1997), and in 1990 the Commission issued a policy statement enjoining employers to establish a complaint procedure "designed to encourage victims of harassment to come forward [without requiring] a victim to complain first to the offending supervisor." EEOC Policy Guidance on Sexual Harassment, 8 FEP Manual 405:6699 (Mar. 19, 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). It would therefore implement clear statutory policy and complement the Government's Title VII enforcement efforts to <span id="Page_900"></span>recognize the employer's affirmative obligation to prevent violations and give credit here to employers who make reasonable efforts to discharge their duty. Indeed, a theory of vicarious liability for misuse of supervisory power would be at odds with the statutory policy if it failed to provide employers with some such incentive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requirement to show that the employee has failed in a coordinate duty to avoid or mitigate harm reflects an equally obvious policy imported from the general theory of damages, that a victim has a duty "to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages" that result from violations of the statute. <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC</span>, 458 U.S. 219, 231, n.15, 102 S. Ct. 3057, 73 L. Ed.2d 721 (1982) (quoting C. McCormick, <span class="Italic">Law of Damages</span> 127 (1935) (internal quotation marks omitted). An employer may, for example, have provided a proven, effective mechanism for reporting and resolving complaints of sexual harassment, available to the employee without undue risk or expense. If the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of the employer's preventive or remedial apparatus, she should not recover damages that could have been avoided if she had done so. If the victim could have avoided harm, no liability should be found against the employer who had taken reasonable care, and if damages could reasonably have been mitigated no award against a liable employer should reward a plaintiff for what her own efforts could have avoided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to accommodate the principle of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII's equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, ante</span>, p. ___, also decided today. An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. Rule. Civ. Proc. 8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that an employer had promulgated an antiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense. And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment<span class="Italic">. See Burlington, ante</span>, at 17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these rules here, we believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed. The District Court found that the degree of hostility in the work environment rose to the actionable level and was attributable to Silverman and Terry. It is undisputed that these supervisors "were granted virtually unchecked authority" over their subordinates, "directly controll[ing] and supervis[ing] all aspects of [Faragher's] day-to-day activities." 111 F.3d, at, 1544 (Barkett, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part). It is also clear that Faragher and her colleagues were "completely isolated from the City's higher management." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. The City did not seek review of these findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the City would have an opportunity to raise an affirmative defense if there were any serious prospect of its presenting one, it appears from the record that any such avenue is closed. The District Court found that the City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like Terry and Silverman. The record also makes clear that the City's policy did not include any assurance that the harassing supervisors could be bypassed in registering complaints. App. 274. Under such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct. Unlike the employer of a small workforce, who might expect that sufficient care to prevent tortious behavior could be exercised informally, those responsible for city operations could not reasonably have thought that precautions against hostile environments in any one of many departments in far-flung locations could be effective without communicating some formal policy against harassment, with a sensible complaint procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have drawn this conclusion without overlooking two possible grounds upon which the City might argue for the opportunity to litigate further. There is, first, the Court of Appeals's indulgent gloss on the relevant evidence: "There is some evidence that the City did not effectively disseminate among Marine Safety employees its sexual harassment policy."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 1539, n.11. But, in contrast to the Court of Appeals's characterization, the District Court made an explicit finding of a "complete failure on the part of the City to disseminate said policy among Marine Safety Section employees." 864 F. Supp., at 1560. The evidence supports the District Court's finding and there is no contrary claim before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second possible ground for pursuing a defense was asserted by the City in its argument addressing the possibility of negligence liability in this case. It said that it should not be held liable for failing to promulgate an antiharassment policy, because there was no apparent duty to do so in the 1985-1990 period. The City purports to rest this argument on the position of the EEOC during the period mentioned, but it turns out that the record on this point is quite against the City's position. Although the EEOC issued regulations dealing with promulgating a statement of policy and providing a complaint mechanism in 1990, <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, at 28, ever since 1980 its regulations have called for steps to prevent violations, such as informing employees of their rights and the means to assert them<span class="Italic">. Ibid</span>. The City, after all, adopted an antiharassment policy in 1986.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The City points to nothing that might justify a conclusion by the District Court on remand that the City had exercised reasonable care. Nor is there any reason to remand for consideration of Faragher's efforts to mitigate her own damages, since the award to her was solely nominal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals also rejected the possibility that it could hold the City liable for the reason that it knew of the harassment vicariously through the knowledge of its supervisors. We have no occasion to consider whether this was error, however. We are satisfied that liability on the ground of vicarious knowledge could not be determined without further factfinding on remand, whereas the reversal necessary on the theory of supervisory harassment renders any remand for consideration of imputed knowledge entirely unjustifiable (as would be any consideration of negligence as an alternative to a theory of vicarious liability here).</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Until some lower courts and the Commission itself began to interpret the precise parameters of the affirmative defense, it was difficult to determine how, if at all, the <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> standard differed from the standard set forth at 29 CFR 1604.11(c). <span class="Italic">Yaccarino v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05735 (2001), began to give some definition to the Commission's understanding of <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries</span>. In <span class="Italic">Yaccarino</span>, the Commission found that an agency is liable for hostile environment harassment by a supervisor or manager even if the employee unreasonably failed to complain and the agency took prompt and effective corrective action once it learned of the harassment. The problem, according to the Commission, was that the agency had taken no action to prevent the harassment before it occurred and did not provide the complainant with an effective avenue to report harassment. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Yaccarino</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that, timeliness aside, the agency established an affirmative defense to the alleged hostile environment. AJ Decision at 2. When harassment by a supervisor creates an unlawful hostile environment but does not result in a tangible employment action, the employer can raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, which it must prove by the preponderance of the evidence. The defense consists of two necessary elements: (1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassment; and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, No. 915.002, at 12 (June 18, 1999) (<span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Employer Liability</span>); <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries v. Ellerth,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employer can prove that it discharged its duty of reasonable care and that the employee could have avoided all of the harm but unreasonably failed to do so, the employer will avoid all liability for unlawful harassment. For example, if an employee was subjected to a pattern of disability-based harassment and created an unlawful hostile environment, but the employee unreasonably failed to complain to management before she suffered emotional harm and the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct the harassment, then the employer will avoid all liability. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Employer Liability</span> at 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employer cannot prove that it discharged its duty of reasonable care and that the employee unreasonably failed to avoid the harm, the employer will be liable. For example, if unlawful harassment by a supervisor occurred and the employer failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent it, the employer will be liable even if the employee unreasonably failed to complain to management or even if the employer took prompt and appropriate corrective action, when it received notice<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., EEOC v. SBS Transit, Inc.</span>, No. 97-4164, 1998 WL 903833 at *1 (6th Cir. Dec. 18, 1998) (unpublished) (lower court erred when it reasoned that employer liability for sexual harassment is negated if the <span id="Page_901"></span>employer responds adequately and effectively once it has notice of the supervisor's harassment; that standard conflicts with affirmative defense which requires proof that employer "took reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior and that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer"). <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Employer Liability</span> at 12-13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it is undisputed that the agency promptly responded to the October 5, 1998, incident, with corrective action, there is no evidence to suggest that it exercised reasonable care to prevent the conduct alleged to be sexual harassment. Complainant thus states that the agency offered no evidence to demonstrate that it had any policy in effect to prevent harassment or that the agency had an effective complaint procedure provided to all employees. The <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Employer Liability</span> at 15-28 gives considerable guidance on the issue of prevention. It would also seem that the agency had to be on notice, concerning the Postmaster's behavior, in view of the "hot case" and "throbbing" or "pulsating" red light complaint in April 1998. There is no indication that training was provided by the agency to supervisors and employees to prevent harassment. Accordingly, we find that the AJ erred in finding, on summary judgment, that the agency was entitled to the affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a case involves harassment by both supervisors and coworkers, the Commission has applied the rules for supervisory liability. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mayer v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120071846 (2009), the complainant was subjected to several acts of sexual harassment by coworkers and a supervisor. The Commission rejected the agency's arguments that it should not be held liable because it was unaware of the harassment. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Mayer</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a case where harassment does not result in a tangible employment action, the employer may prove an affirmative defense comprised of two elements: (1) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, and (2) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra; Faragher, supra.</span> Further, if the harassment is pervasive, it could result in a finding that the agency had constructive knowledge of the harassment. <span class="Italic">See Padilla v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120063761 (April 8, 2008) (supervisor's harassment was so pervasive that the agency should have had constructive knowledge of the harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, while the agency denies that management officials had any knowledge of the harassment, the record establishes that management was aware of some of the harassment. For example, complainant reported the romantic letter from a co-worker to three management officials, all of whom ignored her complaint. Further, another manager witnessed S1 making oral sex motions with his hand and mouth towards complainant. Complainant asserts that the other manager just shook his head at S1 and took no action. Further, another manager stated in his affidavit that complainant mentioned the harassment to him in a casual conversation, and he considered it only hearsay. We find that management officials were aware that complainant felt that she was being sexually harassed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the harassment was pervasive, often occurred in front of co-workers, and permeated the workplace. For example, while speaking to complainant and a female co-worker, S1 put his foot between the legs of a female co-worker and moved his foot around while making sexually explicit comments. Further, S1 reached into complainant's waistband and pulled her underwear up her buttocks in front of her co-workers. S1 asked complainant if she waxed her pubic area in front of her co-workers. S1 attempted to give complainant a lap dance and asked her to touch his genitals in front of her co-workers. Additionally, S1 touched complainant's buttocks while she was talking to a co-worker. We find that these acts were pervasive. Additionally, we find the agency had constructive knowledge that the sexual harassment was taking place. The record establishes that employees were aware that S1 was sexually harassing complainant, and therefore, management knew or should have known of the harassment as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the agency contends that when it was made aware of the harassment, it acted immediately to end the harassment. When an employer becomes aware of alleged harassment, it has the duty to investigate the charges promptly and thoroughly. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01953850 (August 29, 1996). By "thoroughly" the Commission means "effectively," taking whatever action necessary to end the harassment and prevent the misconduct from recurring. <span class="Italic">See Voigt v. United States Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01931799 (Dec. 20, 1994). We find that the agency failed to take prompt and effective action after it was aware that complainant was harassed. For example, when complainant reported the letter she received from her co-worker, management officials failed to take action. Additionally, when a management official observed S1 make a gesture towards complainant that indicated oral sex, the management official merely shook his head and failed to take any action. The record establishes that the agency clearly failed to address the harassment; therefore it is liable for the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden of proof is on the agency to demonstrate that the complainant failed to use reasonable care in failing to report the harassment. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720110036 (2012).</p>
