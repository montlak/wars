<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-153"><span class="space">D.</span> CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL DOCUMENTS
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Attorney General</span>, 0720120004 (2012), the Commission's case law under the medical examination, inquiry and confidentiality provisions of the ADA dealt either with unwarranted exams and inquiries or disclosures of medical information. It was unclear whether the failure to observe the requirement of 42 USC 12112(d)(3)(B) and (4)(C) that medical documents be kept separate from personnel files was an independent violation of the ADA when there was no disclosure. In <span class="Italic">Mayo</span>, the Commission answered that question in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Mayo</span>, a correctional officer, met with the HR <span class="Italic">manager</span> to discuss reasonable accommodation and disability retirement. He gave the HR manager a report from his physician stating he should be assigned to sedentary duty. After getting the complainant's permission, the HR manager sought and obtained more information on the complainant's condition from his physician, including the diagnosis, his medical symptoms and a prognosis. The physician also lists several work restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent">After determining that the complainant could not perform the duties of correctional officer even with accommodation and that there were no vacant, funded reassignment positions available, the agency proposed to remove the complainant for medical inability to perform. More medical information was submitted and after an agency-ordered examination, the complainant was cleared for and returned to full duty and the notice of proposed removal was rescinded. However, the agency continued to maintain an adverse action file in its HR office that commingled medical and personnel information.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mayo</span> found that maintenance of the file constituted a violation of the ADA even without any disclosure of the medical information:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's assertion, Complainant was not required to prove that the Agency disclosed his confidential medical information to an unauthorized person. The plain language of the statute and regulation expressly states that medical information must be "collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(3)(B), (4)(C); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c)(1). The Agency's failure to maintain Complainant's medical information in separate medical files constitutes a violation of the Rehabilitation Act, even in the absence of an unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Porter P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120171893 (2019) ("the Assistant Manager of Transportation Operations (AM) asserted that management officials placed and maintained documentation listing Complainant's condition and prescribed medication in his driver's personnel file in the Postal Vehicle Services (PVS) unit.... She stressed that although the records were maintained in a file, the records were not shared with 'whoever asked for them.'... Nonetheless, the Agency's failure to maintain Complainant's medical information in separate medical files constitutes a violation of the Rehabilitation Act, even in the absence of unauthorized disclosure."); <span class="Italic">Denese L. v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120130297 (2016) (maintaining the complainant's medical records along with emails on the complainant's work history, her performance plan, and awards and training certificates in a folder in the supervisor's office that was locked in a file cabinet violated the Rehabilitation Act, even though the medical information was not disclosed to third parties).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is important, however, to remember that allegations of disability discrimination render an employee's medical records subject to disclosure and review by those with a need to know. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Norris C. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120151964 (2017), a complainant under those circumstances puts his or her medical records at issue as part of the claim. <span class="Italic">Norris C</span>. involved agency counsel who, while the complainant's claim was pending before the Commission, requested and received medical information about the complainant's alleged disabilities from the agency's medical division. The complainant claimed that the agency's action was a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act. Agency counsel maintained that the complainant made his medical records an issue as part of his disability claim, and that she had a need to know in order to properly defend the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Norris C</span>. agreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the Agency did not violate the Rehabilitation Act because the Agency's Attorney acted within her duty to fully investigate and respond to Complainant's prior claims of disability discrimination. The Attorney noted in his prior EEO complaint, Complainant claimed the Agency knew of his disability and already had all the information he provided in response to the Agency's motion for summary judgment. The Attorney explained that she requested that the Medical Office review the 26-pages of documentation submitted by Complainant in response to the Agency's motion as part of her efforts to develop a full record for the adjudicatory proceedings to determine whether the Medical Office had already received that information and/or knowledge of Complainant's claimed disability. The record contains a copy of the Flight Surgeon's declaration for Complainant's prior EEO complaint in which she stated that with the exception of one document, she had not seen any of the 26 pages submitted by Complainant. Complainant does not claim that the Attorney shared the 26 pages of documentation with anyone outside the Agency's Medical Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that the Legal Division obtained a copy of his medical file from the Agency's Medical Division, we find this does not constitute a violation of the confidentiality provisions of the Rehabilitation Act. Complainant made his medical records an issue as part of his claims against the Agency that he was disabled and denied a reasonable accommodation. We find the Attorney had a legitimate "need to know" Complainant's medical information by virtue of her legal expertise in responding to Complainant's claims of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102597 (June 21, 2012). Thus, we find that Complainant failed to establish that the Agency improperly disclosed Complainant's medical information.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a somewhat bizarre case, the Commission not surprisingly found that the agency violated the confidentiality provisions of the ADA when a supervisor stored personnel records including medical information on the complainant in his closet at home. In <span class="Italic">Grey v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120121846 (2012), the supervisor's estranged wife found the files and notified a union representative. The supervisor maintained that he had the records initially in order to provide the complainant with work within her medical restrictions and then kept the files to respond to her EEO complaint. The agency dismissed the claim as a collateral attack under the Privacy Act. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Grey</span>, however, had little difficulty in finding a violation of the ADA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, although the Postmaster's initial reasons for reviewing Complainant's personnel file (i.e. providing work within her restrictions, responding to her OWCP and EOO claims) were legitimate, he failed to treat the documents as a confidential medical record. The Postmaster left Complainant's work station (Spring Hill) in approximately 2006, more than five years before his estranged wife found the documents in a closet. We acknowledge that the Postmaster asserted that his wife was not authorized to take the files. However, a fair reading of the record abundantly reflects that the documents were not securely stored. For example, the record reflects that the documents were not put in a location inaccessible to other family members, such as being locked in a file cabinet, but rather were simply stored in a closet in a home that Complainant shared with his wife, mother and teenage daughter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission did not issue a decision on the merits of the claim, it did find that the complainant had stated a claim for relief in alleging a violation of the confidentiality provisions of the ADA when he alleged that his supervisor posted a schedule with the initials "L/D" for light duty next to his name. <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120122099 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140480 (2015), the Commission found that the agency violated the confidentiality provisions of the ADA when a supervisor told a coworker that the complainant had suffered a mental breakdown after she threated to kill herself.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Velva B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720160006 (2017), the agency argued that standard OWCP forms collected by the agency on all injured-on-duty employees, who were either on limited duty or rehabilitation status, were not medical records and therefore not subject to the rules on confidentiality. The records were used in an effort to ensure that those employees were performing mission critical work. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Velva B.</span> dismissed the agency's argument that the forms did not constitute medical records and found that the agency failed entirely to include instructions on maintaining and protecting the confidential medical records:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission regards documentation of the individual's diagnosis or symptoms as confidential medical information. <span class="Italic">Tyson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992086 (Aug. 23, 2002), <span class="Italic">citing</span> ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Pre-Employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> n.26 (Oct. 10, 1995). In its response to the first set of interrogatories dated August 22, 2011, the Agency stated, incredibly, that records generated by Health and Resources Management that contain medical restrictions, such as the Form CA-17, are not medical records. Record at 4841. A review of the Form CA-17 itself indicates otherwise. On question 5 of the form, the employee is asked to describe how the injury occurred and the parts of the body affected. Question 8 asks the physician whether the history of the injury given by the employee corresponds to the description in question 5. Question 9 asks for a description of clinical findings. Question 10, as we noted earlier, asks for a diagnosis due to the injury; and Question 11 asks about other disabling conditions. Record at 12939-12946. Form CA-17's thus contain information about symptoms and diagnoses, and therefore constitute medical records.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When asked in his deposition whether there were any guidelines about safeguarding the information in the medical records with Health and Resources Management, the HHR Manager replied that he did not recall. He also testified that the national medical director and national medical administrator were the two people responsible for safeguarding medical records. The National Medical Administrator testified that medical files <span id="Page_1254"></span>were maintained in a double-locked facility and that files were in locked in rooms that were accessible only by occupational health personnel. He admitted, however, that NRP medical records were maintained by Injury Compensation. As the WCO Director himself acknowledged and as we reported above, those NRP files (the workbooks) contained extensive medical documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain language of Section 102(d)(3)(B) and the identically worded regulation in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c) unambiguously specify that medical information must be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files. <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Dept. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720120004 (Oct. 24, 2012). In <span class="Italic">Mayo</span>, we found that the Agency violated the confidentiality provision of the Rehabilitation Act when it placed the complainant's medical information, including information pertaining to his diagnosis, in an "adverse action" file maintained in its Office of Human Resource Management. We found it irrelevant that these adverse action files were restricted personnel files; they did not meet the statutory definition of separate medical files. Likewise, it did not matter that the Agency disclosed nothing in the complainant's files to any unauthorized third party. We held that the Agency's failure to maintain the complainant's medical information in separate medical files constituted a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the confidentiality clause of the Rehabilitation Act, even in the absence of unauthorized disclosure. In this case, it does not matter if no unauthorized persons accessed the NRP files, whether maintained in the Health and Resource Management office or in the NRP workbooks. The mere presence of medical information outside of areas separately designated for the purpose of maintaining confidential medical files is enough to trigger a violation of the confidentiality provision of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There were unauthorized disclosures, however: those that may have been mandated by NRP procedure and those that occurred due to lack of oversight, owing to the NRP's failure to include explicit instructions on maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of medical information. As to the first group of disclosures, Step 6 of Phase 1 required the collaboration of district medical staff, district injury compensation specialists, operations supervisors, and labor relations representatives in updating the NRP workbook corresponding to each IOD employee. Record, pp. 12944-12950. Leaving aside the medical staff, who would have to evaluate the information as a matter of course, the only individuals who might have been eligible to access confidential medical information are the injury compensation specialists, who, if the circumstances are appropriate, would fall under the workers' compensation office exception. In this situation, however, they do not because, as we have already found, the NRP was discriminatory and therefore the results of the examinations of those records were not used in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as required by Section 102(d)(3)(C) thereof. The other two groups, the operations specialists and the labor relations specialists, do not fall within any of the five excepted categories. A technician who worked on preparing NRP workbooks confirmed that medical documentation that indicated that an IOD employee had permanent restrictions was included in those files. Record at 13743. When asked whether there were any other employees who were involved in creating them, she responded that two postmasters would come in from the field and help with them. Record at 12742.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of equally great concern are the rampant reports of confidential medical files being left on supervisors' desks, on copy machines, in the trash, and otherwise not properly secured. The Commission has found confidentiality breaches in a wide variety of circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. Social Security Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120110008 (Jan. 11, 2013) (leaving copy of complainant's report of asthma attack on copier raises genuine issue of material fact whether violation occurred); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073097 (Jan. 11, 2011) (release of medical records to state court in response to a subpoena in a civil action); <span class="Italic">Philbert v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720090041 (May 5, 2010) (supervisor twice accessed complainant's medical records without complainant's knowledge or authorization); <span class="Italic">Grazier v. Dept. of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102711 (Sept. 30, 2010) (disclosure of complainant's medical records to union steward where complainant had not asked for union representation and objected to union steward's presence at conference); <span class="Italic">Scott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120103590 (Sept. 19, 2012) and <span class="Italic">Young v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112626 (Oct. 3, 2011) (disclosure of complainant's confidential medical information to others present at investigative interview); and <span class="Italic">Tyson v. U.S. Postal Service, supra</span>, (manager mailed letters to 32 postmasters at other facilities that disclosed medical diagnosis and symptoms, notwithstanding that breach was part of manager's effort to find vacant position for complainant). In each of these situations, with the exception of the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> case, medical records that were otherwise maintained in secure areas were disclosed due to a mistaken belief that it was appropriate to do so. In other words, the records were under control, but were released due to errors of judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What we have here, by contrast, are reports from all over the country of medical files containing Form CA-17's and other confidential medical information being left in open, freely accessible areas. Witnesses from Florida, Illinois, Washington State, California, and Maryland all reported that they had seen their confidential medical information lying around in publicly accessible areas and unlocked rooms, such as supervisors' desks, copy machines, and the workroom floor, and that this was going on "all the time." Record at 15479, 15688-15689, 15748-15749, 15825, 16232-16233, 16387-16390. A witness from Illinois reported that supervisors in his facility would have employees in modified positions making copies of other employees' medical records, and that he found a copy of his Form CA-17 that was made by another employee in a trash can. Record at 15472, 15479. Witnesses from Washington State and California testified that their supervisors had not only their files with Form CA-17's in it but those of other people as well strewn all over their desks. Record at 16000, 16501. The California witness also averred that her supervisor would put the files in the top drawer of his desk, where people looking for a rubber band or a paper clip could go into that drawer and easily access those files. Record at16501-16502. Another witness from California stated that she had observed Form CA17s left sitting out on fax machines for days, and that such occurrences were happening all the time. Record at 15872-15873. A witness from Baltimore reported that her medical records had actually disappeared, and that after she had painstakingly reproduced them, they had "miraculously" reappeared. She also reported that she did not think anyone continued to lock up the folders. Record at 16107-16108, 16122-16127. Contrary to the Agency, we find that these were not isolated occurrences, but rather were commonplace across many districts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that while operating under the auspices of the NRP, the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other Agency officials who supported and assisted in implementing that program violated Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates by reference Sections 102(d)(3)(B) and (d)(3)(C), and Section 102(d)(4)(C) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by failing to maintain the confidentiality of the medical records of IOD employees who were assessed under the NRP. We conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists on this issue that would warrant a hearing. To be eligible for relief at the remedies stage of this proceeding, class members must show that they suffered compensable harm as a result of having the confidentiality of their medical information compromised. The Class Agent is eligible for immediate relief because she has established that the confidentiality of her medical records was compromised as a result of Phase 1 of the NRP.</p>
