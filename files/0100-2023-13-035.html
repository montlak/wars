<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-31"><span class="space">6.</span> Final Agency Decisions</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the agency issues a final decision, the Commission has exhibited a great deal of inconsistency in dealing with inadequate investigations. The general trend, as discussed below, is to remand the case to the agency for a supplemental investigation. However, the Commission also has sanctioned agencies for inadequate investigations and, in some cases, held in favor of the complainant based on the evidence of record even though it was incomplete.</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure to request a hearing does not negate the agency's obligation to conduct a full investigation of a complaint. In <span class="Italic">Bryan v. Agency for International Development</span>, 01956031 (1997), the agency failed to include the qualifications of other applicants for a promotion in the investigation record. On appeal, the agency argued that if the complainant wanted such information, she could have requested a hearing and sought the information through discovery instead of seeking a final decision on the record. The Commission found the agency's obligation to conduct a complete investigation was not contingent upon a request for a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">When no hearing is requested, there is no administrative judge assigned to the case to oversee any necessary development of the record. Therefore, on appeal, the Commission may remand the case to the agency for a supplemental investigation if the existing record does not provide an adequate basis for making a decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gasten v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21271 (2003) (finding the agency conducted an inadequate investigation where the investigator included only medical documents that the complainant submitted with her request for accommodation, but did not include any medical documents previously submitted to the agency; case was remanded to the agency for a supplemental investigation). The Commission also has the option to impose sanctions on the agency, pursuant to 20 CFR 1614.108(c)(3). The Commission has been inconsistent and not fully articulated a distinction between those cases where it remands for further investigation and those in which it imposes sanctions, though the overall trend has been for the Commission to be more aggressive in imposing sanctions against agencies that fail to fulfill investigatory obligations. <span class="Italic">See</span> Ch. 8, Section on "<a href="0100-2023-17-061.html#sec8-62">Default Judgment</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hamrick v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02775 (2002), the Commission explained the agency's obligation to conduct an adequate investigation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the investigative file contains insufficient information upon which to determine whether or not the complained-of agency action was the result of an unlawful discriminatory motive. The requirement that an agency investigate complaints of discrimination is codified at 29 CFR 1614.108. This regulation requires the agency to develop an impartial and appropriate factual record upon which to make findings on the claim or claims raised in the complaint<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> 1614.108(a). "An appropriate factual record is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The investigator is required to conduct a thorough investigation--identifying and obtaining all relevant evidence from all sources regardless of how it may affect the outcome. EEOC Management Directive 110, p. 6-8 (Nov. 9, 1999). While this requirement does not compel the investigator to engage in irrelevant and superfluous inquiry, it does require that the investigator exhaust those sources of information likely to support the positions of complainant and the agency<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot conclude that the agency investigation into the present case met this requisite level of development. As discussed above, the agency failed to interview the named, alleged participants in the discrimination. There was no testimony collected, other than that of complainant, explaining the circumstances surrounding his claim, even though the investigator was aware of the agency officials alleged to be involved in the case and had requested information from those officials. Nor did the investigator acquire a copy of the documents at issue--the agency's own letter in response to the Congressperson's inquiry and the inquiry itself. In the section of the investigative report titled "Comparative Analysis," the only information provided by the investigator was that complainant had not indicated whether there were any similarly-situated employees who had been treated differently. This statement ignores the investigator's obligation to independently seek out comparative evidence in every case alleging disparate treatment, and to not merely rely upon what comparative evidence a complainant may or may not provide<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Management Directive 110, p. 6-10 (Nov. 9, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, when a complainant is unable to provide comparative information and the investigator similarly cannot obtain such information, the investigator is still required to determine whether there is other evidence which may establish that unlawful discrimination has occurred. EEOC Management Directive 110, p. 6-6 n.2 (Nov. 9, 1999). This does not excuse complainant for failing without good cause to provide documents or other evidence which support his case when he was, as here, requested to do so<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1614.108(c)(3) (describing actions investigator may recommend decisionmaker, or Commission on appeal, take against party failing without good cause to comply with investigative request). However, an investigator may not simply rely upon complainant to independently provide all the evidence necessary to prove his case<span class="Italic">. Cf.</span> EEOC Management Directive 110, p. 6-6 (Nov. 9, 1999) (defining role of the EEO Investigator as collector and discoverer of factual information concerning the claim(s) in the complaint). For the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that the agency failed to perform a complete investigation of complainant's claim upon which a reasonable factfinder could draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred. Therefore, the agency's adjudication of this complaint was premature.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Robey v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A41333_r.txt">01A41333</a> (2004), the Commission remanded the case for further investigation where the selecting official stated that "from a business sense" the selectee was the "right choice." The Commission found the investigator failed to ask the selecting official why the selectee was the right choice and, therefore, the record was not sufficiently developed to allow a reasonable factfinder to draw a conclusion as to whether discrimination had occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064579 (2008), the Commission imposed an adverse inference against the agency that precluded it from establishing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that although MO-1 articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason in her affidavit, she failed to submit the documentary evidence to support her statement. The record shows that MO-1 refused to provide to the EEO investigator copies of the appraisals and ratings for the other employees she rated in the same period. MO-1 provides in her affidavit a summary of the other ratings, namely that one employee received an "8," one a "7" and one a "6." Her testimony does not match up which rating goes with which comparator co-worker. The record contains an e-mail exchange between MO-1 and the EEO investigator in which he asks her several times for copies of the ratings, and she states that she "sought the advice of counsel" and later states that an agency attorney "will be contacting you directly on this issue." There is no indication that the attorney ever contacted the EEO investigator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also lacks evidence to show what the department's functional score as a whole was for the rating period, which is relevant, as the Pay For Performance system in place, according to MO-1's affidavit, required that the evaluations of individual department members were consistent with and did not exceed that score. According to MO-1, the department score was also an "8," which, if true, would have rendered complainant's evaluation of "8" the highest she could receive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 29 C.F.R.&#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(1) "The complainant, the agency, and any employee of a Federal agency shall produce such documentary and testimonial evidence as the investigator deems necessary." It is standard practice, when conducting an investigation on a complaint of discrimination alleging an unfair performance evaluation, to collect evidence which would allow the fact finder to compare the ratings made by the supervisor, namely copies of the performance ratings themselves. Where, as here, the complainant has made an allegation that the rating official is attempting to cover up what ratings were given, testimony in an affidavit would be insufficient to prove what ratings were actually awarded. Additionally, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3), states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"When the complainant, or the agency against which a complaint is filed, or its employees fail without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witness(es), the investigator may note in the investigative record that the decision maker should, or the Commission on appeal may, in appropriate circumstances: (i) Draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the requested witness, would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information..."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this instance, we find it appropriate to sanction the agency for the refusal of MO-1 to comply with the requests of the EEO investigator to provide copies of the performance evaluations of the other employees she rated in the same time period. We draw the adverse inference that MO-1's refusal to provide the evaluations would have shown just what complainant has alleged, that MO-1 had rated one or more of her Caucasian co-workers higher than her. We further note that the record does not even indicate which co-worker might have received which rating, therefore making it possible that the under 40 male co-worker may have been rated higher than she was. As this adverse inference would also render the agency's articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory reason false, we therefore, conclude that the agency has not met its burden of production in response to complainant's showing of her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> cases of race, color, sex, age, and reprisal. Further, the lack of evidence to show that complainant's rating was consistent with the department's functional score as a whole, as required under the Pay For Performance system according to MO-1's affidavit, also points up the deficiency of the agency's showing, as the Commission cannot even rely <span id="Page_315"></span>on that evidence to support the agency's legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. We consequently find that complainant is entitled to a finding of discrimination on the bases of race, color, sex, age, and reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to effect an appropriate remedy, the agency shall provide copies of the performance evaluations for Fiscal Year 2005 for complainant's three co-workers who were also rated by MO-1. It shall also provide evidence of the Government Relations department functional score as a whole to show what the maximum score for complainant could have been.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its November 1999 revisions to Part 1614 and in MD-110, the Commission has given agencies broad discretion as to how to conduct investigations. In certain cases, for example, there is no need for an investigator to conduct face-to-face interviews and prepare affidavits from each witness interviewed. The submission of written interrogatories or questions can be a perfectly adequate way of conducting an investigation. But even where written interrogatories are appropriate, they cannot be "canned" interrogatories. They must be individually tailored to the specific complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Goday v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24157 (2004), the Commission found the use of a standardized investigative letter resulted in serious deficiencies in the investigative report:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find major deficiencies in the investigation. Initially, our review discloses that the agency utilized a standardized investigative letter which did not contain questions sufficiently relevant or individualized to gather the requisite information to demonstrate whether complainant's diabetes impairment rose to the level of a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, a question about whether complainant had his impairment at the time he was hired at the agency seems wholly irrelevant to the inquiry at hand. Also, we observe that asking complainant in a general manner "whether" he submitted medical documentation is not the same as asking him to actually provide medical documentation to support his allegation of disability status or to indicate where such documentation could be located.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most significantly, the questions asked to ascertain the severity of complainant's limitations were wholly unfocused and legally insufficient to accomplish that end. The investigator asked complainant to describe how his condition "substantially limits [him] in performing one or more of [his] major life activities (i.e. walking, standing, talking, hearing, etc.)." However, this listing of major life activities failed to include some of those most likely to be applicable to complainant's diabetes impairment, such as eating, and caring for self. Nor was complainant asked how his diabetes impairment affected him in any of his daily activities. The second question directed him to "[E]xplain how the above specific limitation relates to the issue of this complaint." However, there is no requirement in applicable precedent or law that the complainant's limitations bear any relationship to the accepted issue in the complaint. Moreover, none of the questions posed by the agency's investigator asked whether complainant took medication, or insulin to control his diabetes impairment or inquired about any side effects complainant might have experienced from such mitigating measures. Finally, the investigator never asked complainant to produce medical documentation to support his claim that his diabetes impairment rendered him disabled or placed him on notice that such documentation would be necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the record indicates that an agency official may have told complainant he was not being sent for training because he was "always sick." The agency should further investigate the basis, if any, for making this remark and ascertain whether any denial of training based on complainant's alleged disability actually occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is difficult to define the precise parameters of an adequate investigation. Perhaps it is akin to Justice Potter Stewart's definition of obscenity--"I know when I see it." This is particularly true when it comes to interviewing witnesses identified by the complainant as possibly having relevant information on a claim. In <span class="Italic">Markey v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A55564 (2006), the Commission found the investigation to be wholly inadequate based on the investigator's failure to interview virtually any witness who could have supported the complainant's allegations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, the Commission finds that the record is insufficient to allow a determination on the merits of complainant's complaint. Our regulations and EEOC Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110) (November 9, 1999), requires agencies to develop a complete and factual record.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(b); EEO-MD-110, Chapter 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the agency's determination that complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of national origin discrimination, we note that in complainant' s formal complaint, complainant stated that "the discrimination in this office is systematic against black and foreign born citizens." In addition, complainant stated that "[m]anagement in this office encourages only white, US born females to be employed and to be promoted..." The Commission notes that complainant may be able to establish an inference of national origin discrimination by showing that there was animus at her work facility towards foreign born employees. In her formal complaint, complainant identified several foreign born employees who she stated were subjected to various discriminatory actions <span class="Italic">(i.e</span>., being denied a position, constructive discharge, delaying an individual's grade increase) based on their national origins. However, the record reflects that the EEO Investigator failed to interview or obtain affidavits from these individuals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, in her formal complaint, complainant identifies several employees (complainant refers to these individuals as "clique members") that she asserts are "white, US born females" who receive unfair advancement. Specifically, complainant states that "[m]anagement gave unfair advancement, inside advice regarding specific positions, delegated higher grade or promotable positions to clique members." The record further reflects that the EEO Investigator interviewed only one of the individuals identified by complainant as a "clique member." In addition, the one "clique member" that was interviewed was not asked about the alleged discriminatory environment toward foreign born employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, as set forth above, complainant asserts that El was not terminated during her probationary period by SI after committing numerous violations throughout her probationary period. The record reflects that El was not interviewed as part of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the basis of reprisal, the agency stated in its final decision that "[c]omplainant maintains that she spoke out about discriminatory treatment of other employees within the office. However, [SI] testified that the [c]omplainant never complained of discrimination to him during her employment with the agency." The Commission notes that the record is devoid of evidence that the EEO Investigator attempted to obtain specific information from complainant regarding the date, the manner, and to whom she allegedly opposed discriminatory practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the agency's determination that complainant failed to establish that the agency' s reasons for complainant's termination were pretext for discrimination and/or retaliation, the Commission notes that complainant requested various individuals be interviewed as part of the investigation. Specifically, complainant on appeal provides a copy of an undated letter which she asserts that she provided to the EEO Counselor. Therein, complainant stated that "I provide you with a list of the engineers to be interviewed regarding my ethics and performance. I worked with them regularly and my performance effected them directly and...on a daily basis." The record reflects that none of these individuals identified by complainant were interviewed as part of the investigation. In addition, the record contains a copy of a letter from complainant to the EEO Investigator, dated April 8, 2005. Therein, complainant listed various other agency employees which she asserted could "vouch" for her performance. The record reflects that these individuals were also not interviewed as part of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the record contains a copy of an e-mail from complainant to the EEO Investigator dated April 26, 2005. Therein, complainant stated that "[i] n your e-mail sent on February 24, 2005, you mentioned 'receiving various documents from the [agency] that I will have an opportunity to rebut'! In reality, I received only half a page statement attached to your e-mail sent to me on March 16, 2005, that had been made by [my first and second level supervisors] and that document wasn't referencing [anything] specific regarding the circumstances of my termination...I defended my position and charges blindly in lack of information provided to you by the agency."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on these circumstances, we find that complainant was not given sufficient opportunity to establish that the agency's reasons for her termination were pretext for discrimination and/or retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result <span class="Italic">Nylund v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120057501 (2007), where the investigator failed to interview a witness who the complainant claimed had heard the selecting official make comments suggestive of age discrimination, and the investigator also failed to inquire about the specific reasons the selectee was given additional points during the interview process. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Nylund</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his affidavit in the record, complainant asserted that he was more qualified than SK, that he had 23 years experience in maintenance as a supervisor, trainer, craft employee, and shop steward, that he met the job posting requirements, and that his non-selection was due to his age and because he was near retirement eligibility. In addition, he explained in his affidavit, in his response to Question 7 (p. 1), that after receipt of the letter from the PM, he called an employee in Butte (BB), and BB stated that, in mid-February 2004, he had a conversation with the PM, who told him "I'm not sure I want to put someone in the Maintenance Manager position who has only a couple years to go." The record contains no further mention of BB's statement, nor did the Investigator contact BB or question the PM about BB. The agency's FAD did not refer to BB's statement, except to note, at page 6, that complainant "offers nothing more than rank speculations and conclusory allegations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The vacancy announcement identified eight job requirements, and applicants were expected to describe their experience and qualifications for each one, i.e., their knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs). The PM provided a statement indicating that, because there were only two <span id="Page_316"></span>candidates, no review or selection panel was mandated by agency regulations; thus, the PM had total control of the selection process, without participation, oversight, or review by any other agency managers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On his own and not provided for in the Vacancy Announcement (VA), the PM added three additional requirements to the selection process, equal to a maximum of 18 points, which the PM assessed in a face-to-face interview. The PM's three interview requirements were (a) knowledge of and/or experience in other functional areas maintenance has impact on, e.g., delivery, mail processing; (b) personal development and flexibility; and (c) employee interaction, e.g., leave usage, discipline, safety. No other management officials participated with the PM in the interviews, and he scored the candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other than his statement and evaluation sheets for each candidate showing the number of points awarded, the PM did not provide any documents, notes, the questions that were asked, or further explanation regarding his evaluation process. In his letter to complainant, he stated that: "the qualifications of each candidate were carefully evaluated...this represents my judgment of who, in light of experience, training, growth potential, and employee interaction, was best qualified for the position and best meets the needs for the Butte Post Office." Here, as well as in his affidavit, <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the PM referenced "growth potential" as an important criteria, which raises the question of whether the PM was concerned that complainant was older and near retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(b) provides that in accordance with instructions contained in Commission Management Directives, the agency shall develop an impartial and appropriate factual record upon which to make findings on the claims raised by the written complaint. An appropriate factual record is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the matter before us, we find that the agency did not meet its burden. In the first instance, the agency's investigator and others familiar with the investigation report failed to pursue the evidence presented by BB's statement appended to complainant's affidavit. We also find that the PM's explanations of the selection process and evaluations of the candidates should have been investigated with a great deal more scrutiny, and all relevant documents obtained. The PM offered no explanation for the marked difference between the scores for SK and complainant, nor did he make mention of the "0" score for the second interview requirement that complainant received. As noted above, the record lacks documentation to support the PM's evaluation, i.e., it does not contain the interview questions, whether both candidates were asked the same questions, or his notes on the candidates' answers; nor did the PM explain why he conducted the interviews by himself, and, under what authority he added requirements to the VA and how he justified his scoring of the interviews. To the extent that the PM relied on his evaluations of the KSAs and the interviews, the agency's investigation should have provided details about the process he utilized with specificity. Therefore, we will remand this matter to the agency for a supplemental investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is improper for an agency official to give an instruction to another employee not to respond to investigation questions because the complainant has filed an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Widjaja v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120071289 (2007) ("We remind the agency that any employee of a federal agency shall produce documentary and testimonial evidence as the investigator deems is necessary.").</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Commission remands a case for supplemental investigation, generally it gives the agency 150 days to complete the investigation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jordy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01971312 (1998). However, in exceptional cases, it has given shorter time limits for completion of the supplemental investigation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lowe v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 04970005 (1998) (the agency was given 60 days to complete an investigation on a nine year old case).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Allmon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01974821 (2000), the Commission remanded a case for supplemental investigation where the agency had conducted an inadequate investigation. The agency was given 60 days to complete the investigation and an additional 30 days to compile the report of investigation and issue the required notices. Of particular note in <span class="Italic">Allmon</span> was the fact that the Commission ordered the agency to issue the complainant a notice of the right to a hearing, even though the complainant had initially requested a final agency decision on the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Koudry v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0520100196 (2010), the Commission found in favor of the complainant where the investigation was inadequate in that it did not sufficiently document the reasons for complainant's nonselection. In denying the agency's request for reconsideration, the Commission rejected the argument that the agency was disadvantaged in the case by the complainant's failure to request a hearing. Noting that the investigation did not include any rating sheets, testimonial evidence on the rating process or contemporaneous notes, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Koudry</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request for reconsideration, the agency maintains that the Commission should remand this matter so that it can supplement the record with further evidence supporting its actions. The agency further maintains that the record contains more evidence in support of the agency's decision not to select complainant than the documents referenced by the Commission in our previous decision, including the applications of the selectee and complainant and the best qualified list. Additionally, the agency contends that it is "troubling" that the Commission presumed that it discriminated against complainant when it gave him a "fully successful" rating because "the supervisor's affidavit does not forcefully oppose all of the complainant's allegations." The agency further argues that the constraints of conducting an investigation without a hearing before an AJ should mitigate the Commission's view of the record in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we note that the agency does not challenge our conclusion that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal and disability discrimination. The agency maintains that its decision to not select complainant for the position of Supervisory Management and Program Analyst is supported by the inclusion in the record of the best qualified list and the complainant's and selectee's applications. However, we note that while the agency's burden of production is not onerous, it must nevertheless provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for a non-selection so that complainant is provided with an opportunity to prove that the agency's explanation was a pretext for discriminatory animus. <span class="Italic">See Carolyn V. Boston v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120042074 (May 26, 2004) (Commission held that the agency failed to meet its burden of production by merely stating in two short affidavits that the selectee was "not the best qualified for the position"); <span class="Italic">see also EEOC v. Target Corp</span>, 460 F.3d 946, 959 (7th Cir. 2006) (employer should have articulated what qualities applicant failed to meet in order to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason such that the applicant knows what evidence to present in order to establish pretext). The job applications and best qualified list do not provide a specific, individualized explanation why the agency did not select complainant or why it chose the selectee for the position, providing us with no insight on how complainant's qualifications were evaluated in comparison to the selectee's qualifications for the position. Likewise, the agency only explained the general mechanics of the performance evaluation process but failed to provide an individualized explanation for complainant's specific rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency attributes its failure to sufficiently explain its actions on the lack of a hearing before an AJ, but the agency is charged with the obligation to develop an adequate investigative record whether or not the matter will be heard before an AJ. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108. Thus, the agency failed to set forth with sufficient clarity a legitimate reason for its actions, which deprived complainant of a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that the agency's explanations are a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990): <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997). The agency has therefore failed to overcome complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal and disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Prevo v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972832 (March 10, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the agency's assertion that we must now remand this matter to give the agency the opportunity to supplement the record, the Commission has often found discrimination outright when agencies failed to sufficiently explain its actions. <span class="Italic">See Brenda Yee v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120061381 (July 11, 2008); <span class="Italic">Ken Leung v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120063435 (June 8, 2007); <span class="Italic">Robert E. Johnson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120072888 (December 18, 2008); <span class="Italic">Emma Blathers v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No, 0120073432 (December 10, 2009). Consequently, we conclude that our previous decision properly found that complainant was subjected to reprisal and disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency fails to conduct a supplemental investigation in compliance with a Commission order, it is appropriate for the Commission to impose sanctions and draw adverse inferences from the agency's failure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dent v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986493 (2000); see also Chapter 8, section on "<a href="0100-2023-17-062.html#sec8-63">Sanctions Against Agencies</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the agency's obligation to conduct an appropriate and impartial investigation, it is sometimes difficult to understand the Commission's approach to remanding the case to the agency for a supplemental investigation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Daughert v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120091991 (2009), the agency issued a final decision finding no discrimination under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act where it terminated a casual clerk rather than assign her to light duty. On appeal, the Commission found that "no reason presented with sufficient clarity was articulated in the final agency decision, nor may one be discerned from the record." The Commission had already determined that the complainant had presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. Since under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis, <span class="Italic">see</span> <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 10</a>, the failure to rebut the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason results in a finding of discrimination for the complainant, a finding in favor of the complainant in <span id="Page_317"></span><span class="Italic">Daughert</span> would seem to be the appropriate outcome, but the Commission remanded the case for a supplemental investigation. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Finch v. Secretary of Agriculture,</span> 0120080535 (2010), remanding the complaint for a supplemental investigation where there was inadequate evidence of the agency's reasons for the complainant's nonselection.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520070124 (2011), the Commission issued a finding of discrimination in favor of the complainant where the agency's investigation did not include sufficient evidence of the agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory motive for his nonselection. In granting the complainant's request for reconsideration, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, relying in part on Koudry reversed its initial decision upholding the decision of the administrative judge to grant summary judgment in favor of the agency, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of this matter, we note that Complainant is an African-American male who applied for a Transportation Security Screening Manager position, the Agency deemed him qualified for the position, and six Caucasian males were selected for the position. No females were selected for the position. Thus, we find that Complainant clearly established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination, but failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Burden of Production</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination, the Agency now has the burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for not selecting Complainant. In his investigative affidavit, the selecting official stated that he made selections based upon the recommendations of the selection panel, and that Complainant was not selected because he was not deemed "best qualified" by the selection panel. When asked by the investigator to compare the strengths and weaknesses of Complainant's qualifications with those of the selectees, the selecting official only stated that the seven selectees were referred to him with scores of 21, 21, 19, 19, 19, 19, and 19 out of a possible 23 points, but Complainant's score was 11. The selecting official stated that Complainant was deemed not eligible for selection because the panel did not refer him as a best-qualified candidate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her affidavit, the Human Resources Specialist stated that she reviewed each application to determine whether each candidate met the basic qualifications for the position, but she was merely a "non-voting technical advisor" to the panel. Supplemental Investigation, Tab 12. The Human Resources Specialist further explained that the selection panel rated each application, discussed the ratings, and arrived at a "consensus score" for each KSA. She stated that scores were tallied, and the selection panel referred all of the "best qualified" candidates with scores of at least 15 points to the selecting official, who chose the top seven candidates with the highest scores.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The selecting official's and the Human Resources Specialist's affidavits are the only sworn statements from Agency officials in the record, yet they do not provide us with any substantive reason for Complainant's non-selection. Although the selecting official asserts that the selection panel's applicant scores are the reason why Complainant was not selected for the position, the Agency failed to explain why Complainant received a score of 11 versus other applicants' higher scores. Moreover, the Human Resources Specialist's statement is only a generalized account of the mechanics of the selection process, and she did not play a determinative role in the selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency's applicant table and KSA application ratings reveal the scores that the panelists gave to applicants in five rating factors, but they do not reveal the reasoning and justification for the scores. In fact, there are no affidavit statements from the selection panelists, who had first-hand knowledge of the deliberative scoring process and the specific reasons for Complainant's score. The Agency's failure to explain why Complainant received a score of 11 is especially noteworthy in light of Complainant's impressive qualifications, particularly his experience as a Supervisory Transportation Security Screener; completion of the Basic Screener Training and Supervisory Screener Training Programs; experience as a Lane and Checkpoint Supervisor; training of approximately 50 employees; Bachelor of Science degree in Human Sciences; candidacy for a Master's degree in Human Sciences/Institutional Management and Associate of Arts degree in Computer Information Sciences; and supervision of one of the selectees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that while an agency's burden of production is not onerous, the agency must nevertheless provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for a non-selection so that the complainant is provided with an opportunity to prove that the agency's explanation was a pretext for discriminatory animus.<span class="Italic"> See Boston v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120042074 (May 26, 2004) (agency failed to meet its burden of production by stating in two short affidavits only that complainant was "not the best qualified for the position"); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01995055 (Dec. 21, 2001) (agency's conclusory statement that complainant was not best-qualified candidate failed to meet burden to articulate legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for non-selection and thwarted fact-finder's ability to comparatively analyze candidates); <span class="Italic">see also EEOC v. Target Corp.,</span> 460 F.3d 946, 959 (7th Cir. 2006) (employer should have articulated qualities applicant failed to meet in order to articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason so applicant would know what evidence to present to establish pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the evidence presented by the Agency is not sufficient to provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation as to why Complainant was not selected for the position for which he was deemed qualified. The Agency explained the general mechanics of the selection process but failed to provide an individualized explanation for Complainant's specific score. <span class="Italic">See Koudry v. Dep't of Educ.,</span> Request No. 0520100196 (Apr. 13, 2010) (discrimination found where agency merely explained the mechanics of selection process, provided list of candidates deemed best qualified, and summarized applications of selectee and complainant, but failed to provide statements from selecting officials explaining how complainant's qualifications were evaluated compared to selectee's qualifications). The evidence reveals that the scores were simply the selection panelists' subjective assessments of each candidate's qualifications in five elements. The record contains the bare numerical scores the panelists gave Complainant and the selectees in five factors, but there is no testimonial or documentary evidence that explains why the panelists scored Complainant and the selectees the way they did. Further, the scoring sheets are unsigned and undated, making it unclear whether these documents were prepared contemporaneously with the selection action, or were assembled after the fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have held that an agency fails to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason when it fails to provide specific information to explain why agency officials assigned their respective ratings or scores to a complainant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Myles v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120092511 (Feb. 10, 2011) (agency failed to meet burden of production when it merely said that complainant was not selected because Review Panel ranked him lower in scoring because this was not a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for Complainant's non-selection); <span class="Italic">Clemente v. Dep't of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720080012 (Sept. 24, 2008) (agency failed to meet burden of production when it provided description of selection process, generally stated that selectees were more qualified than complainant, and provided no record clarification of specific qualities that made selectees better qualified than complainant.); <span class="Italic">Glomski v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955157 (July 17, 1997) (agency failed to meet its burden of production because it did not provide an explanation of the review committee's assignment of scores to complainant and the selectee).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, courts have held that in hiring or promotion decisions based on scores, employers must meet the burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for their decision by producing evidence of the reasons for their evaluations. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Texas Rangers,</span> 492 F.3d 605, 611 (5th Cir. 2007), the employer explained that it did not hire the plaintiff because a rating board gave the plaintiff interview scores that resulted in her ranking 29th out of 40 candidates, whereas all the selectees were given scores that ranked them in the top 11. The Court in <span class="Italic">Alvarado</span> held that because the employer failed to point to any evidence in the summary judgment record that clarified why the plaintiff received the relatively low interview score, the employer failed to proffer a reason for the plaintiff's non-selection that, if believed, would allow a jury to conclude that the non-selection was not the result of unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">Alvarado,</span> 492 F.3d at 617. The Court in <span class="Italic">Alvarado</span> further explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Without some indication of the factual basis or specific reasons for Alvarado's interview score, the score says nothing about whether her non-selection for the Rangers was the product of intentional sex discrimination. Instead, the score is at least as consistent with discriminatory intent as it is with nondiscriminatory intent because Alvarado may have well received the relatively low interview score on account of her sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Our conclusion that the Agency failed to satisfy its burden of production does not mean that scores cannot be used during the selection process. Subjective assessments of candidates may serve as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring a candidate.<span class="Italic"> Browning v. Sw. Research Inst.,</span> 288 Fed. Appx. 170, 176-77 (5th Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Joseph v. City of Dallas,</span> 277 Fed. Appx. 436, 440-41 (5th Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Alvarado,</span> 492 F.3d at 616. However, "because subjective reasons can be a pretext for discrimination, such 'reason[s] will satisfy the employer's burden of production...only if the employer articulates a clear and reasonably specific basis for its subjective assessment.'" <span class="Italic">Browning,</span> 288 Fed. Appx. at 177 (quoting <span class="Italic">Alvarado,</span> 492 F.3d at 616). Therefore, when scores are the result of subjective evaluations, the Agency must provide some explanation for giving Complainant and the selectees particular scores.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Joseph,</span> the Fifth Circuit found that the employer met its burden of production by showing that the plaintiff received poor scores in the selection process because "he provided poor answers <span id="Page_318"></span>to the hypothetical police scenarios and seemed unable to logically process information." <span class="Italic">Joseph,</span> 277 Fed Appx. at 441. Likewise, the Fourth Circuit recently held that an employer met its burden of production when it explained that the plaintiff received lower scores during the selection process because she had less technical expertise than the other candidates. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore,</span> No. 09-1446, 2011 WL 1739994 (4th Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the Agency here has not met its burden of production because it failed to offer any evidence that explains the reasoning behind its bare scores. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Lowndes County School District,</span> 2010 WL 91245 (N.D. Miss. 2010) (defendant failed to meet its burden of production when it merely stated that it did not hire plaintiff because he scored lower in his interview than candidate who was hired and provided tally sheet reflecting scoring of candidates on a scale of one to five, but failed to explain reasons for scores). Therefore, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to overcome Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination, and Complainant prevails without having to prove pretext. <span class="Italic">Chhe v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev.,</span> EEOC Request No. 0720090008 (Aug. 6, 2010) (the consequence of an agency's failure to meet its burden of production under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is that the complainant, having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, prevails without having to make any demonstration of pretext), <span class="Italic">request for recon. den.,</span> EEOC Request No. 0520100584 (Jan. 27, 2011). As such, we find we clearly erred in our previous decision in affirming the Agency's final order.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Bland v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120113424 (2011), the Commission again remanded the case for supplementation of the record even though it did not contain the application materials of the selectee or the other candidates, the position vacancy announcement, information on the selection procedures or the certificate of eligible applicants. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Toland v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 0120112769 (2012) (remanding for further investigation even though record contained no information from agency officials involved in the selection process).</p>
