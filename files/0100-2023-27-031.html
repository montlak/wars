<h4 class="h4" id="sec18-31"><span class="space">4.</span> Superior Qualifications--<span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Ash v. Tyson Foods</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has long held that it is possible that a disparity in the qualifications of the respective candidates can be so great that, standing alone, it is sufficient evidence of pretext. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01883540 (1989). An oft-cited case for this proposition was <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Bailor</span>, 641 F.2d 1037 (10th Cir. 1981), where the court held that under a comparative qualification standard, the plaintiff would have to show that his or her qualifications were so objectively superior "as to literally jump off the page and slap you in the face."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc.</span>, 546 U.S. 454, 126 S. Ct. 1195 (2006), the Supreme Court struck down the <span class="Italic">Bauer</span> standard as overly vague and unhelpful. In a <span class="Italic">per curiam</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Ash</span>, the Court held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The judgment of the Court of Appeals, and the trial court rulings it affirmed, may be correct in the final analysis. In the course of its opinion, however, the Court of Appeals erred in two respects, requiring that its judgment now be vacated and the case remanded for further consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, there was evidence that Tyson's plant manager, who made the disputed hiring decisions, had referred on some occasions to each of the petitioners as "boy." Petitioners argued this was evidence of discriminatory animus. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that "while the use of 'boy' when modified by a racial classification like 'black' or 'white' is evidence of discriminatory intent, the use of 'boy' alone is not evidence of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 533 (citation omitted). Although it is true the disputed word will not always be evidence of racial animus, it does not follow that the term, standing alone, is always benign. The speaker's meaning may depend on various factors including context, inflection, tone of voice, local custom, and historical usage. Insofar as the Court of Appeals held that modifiers or qualifications are necessary in all instances to render the disputed term probative of bias, the court's decision is erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Court of Appeals erred in articulating the standard for determining whether the asserted nondiscriminatory reasons for Tyson's hiring decisions were pretextual. Petitioners had introduced evidence that their qualifications were superior to those of the two successful applicants. (Part of the employer's defense was that the plant with the openings had performance problems and petitioners already worked there in a supervisory capacity.) The Court of Appeals, in finding petitioners' evidence insufficient, cited one of its earlier precedents and stated: "Pretext can be established through comparing qualifications only when 'the disparity in qualifications is so apparent as virtually to jump off the page and slap you in the face.'" <span class="Italic">Ibid. (quoting Cooper v. Southern Co.,</span> 390 F.3d 695, 732 (CA11 2004)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this Court's decisions, qualifications evidence may suffice, at least in some circumstances, to show pretext. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,</span> 491 U.S. 164, 187-188, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1989) (indicating a plaintiff "might seek to demonstrate that respondent's claim to have promoted a better qualified applicant was pretextual by showing that she was in fact better qualified than the person chosen for the position"), superseded on other grounds by 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981(b); <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 259, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981) ("The fact that a court may think that the employer misjudged the qualifications of the applicants does not in itself expose him to Title VII liability, although this may be probative of whether the employer's reasons are pretexts for discrimination"); <span class="Italic">cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</span> 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) ("[A] plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The visual image of words jumping off the page to slap you (presumably a court) in the face is unhelpful and imprecise as an elaboration of the standard for inferring pretext from superior qualifications. Federal courts, including the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in a decision it <span id="Page_1570"></span>cited here, have articulated various other standards, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Cooper, supra,</span> at 732 (noting that "disparities in qualifications must be of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">Raad</span> <span class="Italic">v. Fairbanks North Star Borough School Dist.,</span> 323 F.3d 1185, 1194 (CA9 2003) (holding that qualifications evidence standing alone may establish pretext where the plaintiff's qualifications are "'clearly superior'" to those of the selected job applicant); <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hospital Center,</span> 332 U.S. App. D.C. 256, 156 F.3d 1284, 1294 (CADC 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (concluding the factfinder may infer pretext if "a reasonable employer would have found the plaintiff to be significantly better qualified for the job"), and in this case the Court of Appeals qualified its statement by suggesting that superior qualifications may be probative of pretext when combined with other evidence,<span class="Italic"> see</span> 129 Fed. Appx., at 533. This is not the occasion to define more precisely what standard should govern pretext claims based on superior qualifications. Today's decision, furthermore, should not be read to hold that petitioners' evidence necessarily showed pretext. The District Court concluded otherwise. It suffices to say here that some formulation other than the test the Court of Appeals articulated in this case would better ensure that trial courts reach consistent results.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals should determine in the first instance whether the two aspects of its decision here determined to have been mistaken were essential to its holding. On these premises, <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, the Eleventh Circuit reformulated the test and articulated it as the "disparities in qualifications must be of such weight that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question." The Supreme Court subsequently rejected a second petition for <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>. <span class="Italic">Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc</span>., 127 S. Ct. 1154 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Longworth v. Attorney General</span>, 0120060461 (2007), the Commission adopted the Eleventh Circuit remand test finding that Supreme Court had implicitly adopted it in rejecting <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Ash</span>. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Longworth</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant filed the present appeal with the Commission on October 26, 2005. Complainant argues, among other things, that: (1) the AJ's decision to deny his motion to compel discovery unfairly denied him relevant evidence necessary to the case; (2) the AJ relied upon the absence of the aforesaid evidence in her decision; and (3) record evidence demonstrates that the agency's reason is not credible even absent the withheld evidence. Complainant also submitted a brief entitled "Complainant's Notice of New and Significant Supreme Court Authority" (Ash brief), in which he discusses the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Ash et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc.,</span> 546 U.S. 454, 126 S. Ct. 1195 (2006) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). Therein, the Court found unhelpful the comparative qualifications standard articulated as "an employee's qualifications must be so observably superior so 'as to literally jump off the page and slap you in the face.'" <span class="Italic">Ash,</span> at 1198. Complainant asserts that the aforesaid standard utilized by the AJ can no longer be applied, giving his arguments on appeal more force and effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the agency asserts that, while the AJ initially determined the requested evidence, namely Selectee's work product, was irrelevant, she modified her ruling and the agency produced the Selectee's work product known by the AA. The agency further asserts that complainant failed to show that his qualifications were observably superior to the Selectee's. In the agency's reply to complainant's <span class="Italic">Ash</span> brief, the agency contends that the Court did not overturn the standard, but rather the articulation of it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In complainant's <span class="Italic">Ash</span> brief, he noted that the Supreme Court recently found the comparative qualifications standard unhelpful. <span class="Italic">Ash,</span> at 1198. Inasmuch as the AJ applied said standard in the present case, he asserts that it can no longer be applied. In <span class="Italic">Ash,</span> the Supreme Court, in relevant part, found fault with the 11th Circuit's reliance on the comparative qualifications standard where pretext is shown only when the disparity in qualifications is so apparent as to virtually "jump off the page and slap you in the face." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Court stated, "The visual image of words jumping off the page to slap you (presumably a court) in the face is <span class="Italic">unhelpful and imprecise</span> as an elaboration of the standard for inferring pretext from superior qualifications." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). The Court remanded the case with instructions to determine whether the finding was essential to the holding and to determine if the standard written more appropriately would change the ultimate finding. On remand, the 11th Circuit then applied the rule that "disparities in qualifications must be of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question." <span class="Italic">Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc.,</span> 190 Fed. Appx. 924, 88 Empl. Prac. Dec. &#x00B6; 42,608 (11th Cir. 26) (<span class="Italic">Ash II</span>). Shortly after the 11th Circuit's 2006 holding, the Supreme Court denied <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc,</span> 127 S. Ct. 1154 (Jan. 22, 2007). Since the Court denied <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> of <span class="Italic">Ash II</span>, we will apply the comparative qualifications standard as, "disparities in qualifications must be of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have said standard to the present case, we find that complainant has failed to make such a showing. As the AJ noted, while complainant possessed expertise as to classification and pay, the Selectee possessed expertise as to awards. In addition, both complainant and the Selectee had worked for the agency for many years performing relevant personnel work, rendering both qualified for the subject.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Longworth</span>, the Commission did find that the complainant's qualifications were objectively superior to the selectee's, but also found other evidence in the lack of credibility of the agency's reasons for choosing the successful candidate.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">May v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120090571 (2010), the Commission found that the qualifications of the complainant, standing alone, were plainly superior to those the selectee where the complainant had far more overall experience, including more supervisory experience:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, however, the Commission is persuaded that but for her age, Complainant would have been selected for the position in question. We base our finding on a consideration of the totality of the record. At the outset, we note that an employee may be able to establish pretext with a showing that her qualifications were plainly superior to those of the selectee. <span class="Italic">Wasser v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940058 (November 2, 1995); <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Bailar</span>, 647 F.2d 1037, 1048 (10th Cir. 1981). Here, we find that Complainant's qualifications are plainly superior to those of the Selectee. Complainant had many more years of service to the Agency than the Selectee, and more supervisory experience as well. Specifically, the Selectee had only two years of actual experience supervising two full time employees and one part time employee. The record shows that Complainant, in comparison, had supervised 11 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees over a period of 14 1/2 years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the vast differences in their respective qualifications, we are simply not persuaded by the SO's assertion that his decision to choose the Selectee, and not Complainant, was based on their interview performances. We note in this regard that the SO mischaracterized Complainant's response to the first interview question. SO claimed that Complainant was asked to describe the words "responsibility, trustworthy, and judgment," and that she gave an incomplete response. The record indicates, however, that Complainant was actually asked to describe the words "accountability, authority, and responsibility." Apparently, the Selectee was provided the correct question because the SO stated that she gave a description for all three words. If, as the SO contends, the interview played such a pivotal role in the selection process, we find it reasonable to conclude that the SO would have at some point discovered the error and adjusted his scored accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note the SO's assertion that he changed the questions presented in the interview and the written test after he reviewed the applicants' responses to the KSAs. We find this practice to be troubling for two reasons. First, we believe that it lends support to Complainant's contention that the SO "fine tuned" his questions to give the Selectee an advantage on both the interview and the test. ROI, Ex. 10, at 2. Second, we find that it calls into question SO's credibility because he stated that he felt the KSA's were "sometimes inaccurate," yet he used them to tailor his interview and test questions. We are left with the conclusion that SO deliberately structured the process so that Complainant's superior qualifications were given little effect. We note in this regard that past performance was only given five percent on SO's ranking system.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720100003 (2011), where the experience relied on by the agency in "highly recommending" the selectee was not part of the vacancy announcement, the complainant had more experience and 10 years of outstanding performance appraisals. The Commission agreed with the administrative judge that the complainant's qualifications were "plainly superior," particularly in light of the fact that the agency was unable to explain the basis for the discrepancy between the recommendation for the selectee and that for the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120093647 (2011), the Commission illustrated a comparison of credentials establishing that the complainant had plainly superior qualifications:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now examine the comparative qualifications of the selectee and Complainant. The qualifications for the position of Area Director consisted of:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;the ability to lead and manage an organizational unit to change and implement policies;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;knowledge of rural community and economic development principles, procedures, and public policy issues to coordinate and implement assistant to rural communities;</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_1571"></span>3.&#x2003;knowledge of financing and development principles, strategies, and concepts to assist rural communities;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;ability to communicate and deal effectively with diverse groups and individuals;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;ability to supervise, motivate, and train employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the first qualification standard regarding leadership and management, the selectee wrote that he had been a private sector bank loan officer who had attended loan committee meetings in which he had to "sell" committee members on larger loan requests. As the FAD noted, the selectee did not explain how he led or managed a change or implementation in policy. In contrast, Complainant described his experiences as a supervisor and military commander, supervising over 120 employees, and that he had increased loan making activity in his office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the second qualification standard regarding knowledge of financing and development to assist rural communities, the selectee wrote that he had an opportunity to "market and sell a variety of banking products and services" and that he had "experience underwriting all types of loans." We agree with the FAD that the general nature of the selectee's answer failed to show that he possessed specific knowledge of development issues relevant to rural communities. In contrast, Complainant wrote that as a Rural Development Specialist, he discussed his heavy involvement with local agencies, banks, commercial and educational institutions. He described helping to arrange financing to municipalities on public water and sewers and assisting development organizations to create jobs in communities. Complainant demonstrated relevant knowledge of rural community and economic development issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, for the third qualification standard of knowledge of financing and development principles to assist rural communities, the selectee was vague in his answer, stating that he had experience in all types of lending and reviewed and approved various types of loan requests, including agriculture loans. Selectee did not describe what types of agriculture loans he had approved. In contrast, Complainant described his knowledge of processing specific types of rural development loans and grants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In terms of ability to communicate and deal effectively with diverse groups and individuals, the selectee wrote that he met with potential customers to market and sell new accounts, and that the size of those meetings would range from between "one to five decision makers." He also stated that he attended trade shows and expos to promote his bank's products and services. In contrast, Complainant wrote that as a Rural Development Specialist, he made presentations to approximately "75 to 150 people" at meetings to discuss changes and updates to his Agency's programs. He participated in public meetings of approximately "50 to 100" citizens, and talked with various rural organizations and groups. We find that Complainant's communication experiences with speaking and presenting in meetings with the public ranging from 50 to 150 people is plainly superior to the selectee's limited experiences in marketing new bank products to groups of "one to five decision makers."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, for the fifth qualification standard on supervising, motivating, and training employees, the selectee wrote that he supervised full time employees, scheduled vacation and personal days, held quarterly staff meetings, performed branch audits, and resolved employee conflicts. The selectee provided no specific examples to show how he excelled at these managerial tasks. Complainant gave examples in which he motivated and trained underperforming staff to increase their loan making activity by 75%. Complainant also highlighted his military experience supervising over 120 soldiers, and that his unit received an award for "Best Battery in the Battalion."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant established pretext by showing that his qualifications were "plainly superior" to those of the selectee. The selectee's answers were general and showed little practical relevant experience or knowledge of the rural development mission of the Agency's office for which he wanted to lead. In terms of experience in communicating with a diverse group of people, the selectee showed little experience in venturing beyond speaking with a select, small group of potential customers, employees, and other individuals in the banking world. In contrast, Complainant gave detailed answers on his relevant experiences and knowledge of working and communicating with a large and diverse number of rural community development groups and organizations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld the finding of an administrative judge that the complainant's qualifications were plainly superior in <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120090533 (2011), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found sufficient evidence of pretext with regard to Complainant's non-selection. Specifically, the AJ found Complainant's qualifications to be "observably superior" to those of the Selectee. The AJ noted that Complainant had more than six and a half years of experience as a supervisor with the Agency. The AJ noted the Selectee had one year of supervisory experience, the same amount of total experience he had with the Agency. The AJ noted that while the Selectee had worked for the Agency approximately one year at the time of the selection, Complainant had worked there for more than 16 years. Additionally, the AJ noted that the Selectee was a GS-9 at the time of the selection, while Complainant was a GS-11. Furthermore, the AJ did not find credible management's testimony about Complainant's alleged poor supervisory skills. The AJ noted that Supervisor X, who testified about Complainant's alleged poor supervisory skills, admitted that nothing was mentioned on Complainant's performance evaluations concerning the alleged problems with Complainant's supervisory skills; that Complainant was never disciplined and no one filed a grievance concerning her supervisory skills; and Supervisor X stated that she did not know if Complainant was ever counseled regarding her alleged shortcomings as a supervisor.</p>
