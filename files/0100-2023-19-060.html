<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-53"><span class="space">3.</span> Proof of Intent Under <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Hicks</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01941786 (1994), the Commission held that the "critical factor" in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> is the requirement that the factfinder must be persuaded the action was motivated by discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At this point, appellant bears the burden of establishing that the agency's articulated reasons are a pretext for discrimination. Appellant can do this by showing that a discriminatory reason motivated the agency<span class="Italic">. St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993). In <span class="Italic">St. Mary's</span>, the Court held that a fact finder is not required, as a matter of law, to find discrimination whenever it finds that the employer's explanation for its actions is not credible. The Court further made clear that a fact finder may find discrimination in such circumstances. The critical factor is that a fact finder must be persuaded by the complainant that it was discrimination that motivated the employer to act as it did<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2749. It is not sufficient, the Court stated, "to disbelieve the employer; the fact finder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 2754 (emphasis in oriGINAl).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency's explanation constitutes a pretext for discrimination. When this case first came before the Commission, we remanded it for additional information concerning, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, appellant's productivity in 1990. Not only did the agency fail to provide information concerning her productivity, it never explained the relationship between appellant's productivity and her request to case mail one-handed, as well as the specific agency official(s) responsible for oriGINAlly denying appellant's request. Moreover, appellant's unrebutted testimony during the hearing before the AJ was that from July 1991, when the agency permitted her to case mail using one hand, no one from the agency thereafter expressed any concern that her level of production was inadequate. In view of the temporal proximity between the February 2, 1990 resolution of appellant's November 1989 EEO discrimination complaint and her request to case mail one-handed and her unrebutted testimony concerning her ability to perform the job one-handed, the Commission is persuaded that it was retaliation that motivated the agency to act as it did.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A04063 (2001), the Commission summarized the complainant's burden of establishing pretext as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant may do this in one of two ways, either directly, by showing that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the agency, or indirectly, by showing that the agency's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. . .Essentially the fact finder must be persuaded by the complainant that the agency's articulated reason was false and that its real reason was discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has not interpreted <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> to require any evidence whatsoever of discriminatory motive. Where the showing of pretext is strong enough, pretext, standing alone, is sufficient to warrant a finding of discrimination. Such was the case in <span class="Italic">Claunch v. Postmaster General</span>, 01934899 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the record contains no evidence of discriminatory animus, the record also amply demonstrates that the agency's proffered explanation is not believable. Even the most cursory comparison of appellant's and Selectee's qualifications reveals that appellant has vastly greater agency experience, particularly in the field in which the vacancy is located. The Commission further notes that appellant provided references for the two requirements in which he appeared to have little or no agency experience, but that the responsible agency officials failed to expend any effort to verify these qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where there are two equally desirable candidates competing for the same position, the selecting official may exercise his prerogative in choosing between the candidates, and a trier of fact should not substitute his judgment for the legitimate exercise of managerial discretion<span class="Italic">. Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01893757 (April 20, 1990); <span class="Italic">see Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 259; <span class="Italic">see also Bauer v. Bailar</span>, 647 F.2d 1037, 1048 (10th Cir. 1981) (nonselected employee's qualifications not so plainly superior as to require a finding of pretext). However, in this case the Commission finds that appellant's qualifications were, in fact, so plainly superior to Selectee's that the only reasonable explanation which presents itself for his nonselection is his sex.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the complainant must present some evidence of pretext. The complainant's mere assertion that the agency's legitimate reason is pretext, unsupported by evidence, is insufficient. <span class="Italic">See Wroge v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994692 (2002); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Guinan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01997167 (2002) (complainant's allegations that the agency "lied" were insufficient to establish pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent">Though no clear guidance has emerged on when a showing of pretext, standing alone, will be sufficient to support a finding of discrimination, the Commission has consistently found that the holding in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> permits such a result. For example, in <span class="Italic">Daly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933546 (1994), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency asserted that casting doubt on the SO's explanation is insufficient evidence to demonstrate intentional discrimination, a recent Supreme Court decision suggests otherwise<span class="Italic">. See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749 (1993) (when an employer's articulated reason is shown to be untrue, a finding of liability for intentional discrimination is permissible, even though it is not compelled as a matter of law). In this regard, we recently found discrimination in a case premised merely on the determination that the agency's reasons were not worthy of credence<span class="Italic">. See Abdo v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920685 (June 29, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01976628 (1999), the Commission issued a finding of discrimination and reprisal even where it agreed with the administrative judge that, at least part of the problem between the complainant and his supervisor, was a personality conflict. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> found</p>
<p class="noindent-1">that both racial animus and reprisal were significant motivating factors in D's actions in each of these incidents. While we agree with the AJ that these incidents are a reflection of D's management style and personality conflict with appellant, they are only partially so, with both affidavit and hearing testimony showing that D in many instances treated the white managers, principally CW, more favorably than appellant. We conclude that D's actions suggest both discriminatory animus and reprisal sufficient to make a finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to allegation 1, given that the AJ found that D's testimony was not credible, and that he was intimately involved in the CW's promotion process, taking advantage of the opportunity when appellant would be out of the office for an extended period of time, and that the matter subsequently was placed under an Investigator General inquiry, we conclude that the agency's articulated reasons were at least partially untrue and a pretext for discrimination and reprisal. Specifically, we find that although the personnel office might have made a simple error, due to inexperience in classifying and grading positions for a reorganization, D recognized and took full advantage of the error to promote CW. D <span id="Page_732"></span>made no attempt to have appellant's position regraded to a GS-15, nor did he ask that the remaining vacant Division Director position be advertised for competitive promotion, given that appellant would have been the obvious selectee. Further evidence of D's animus in this respect was his previous failure to fill the two vacant Director positions, allowing them to remain vacant for three years, knowing that the selection had to be competitive, which would result in appellant's appointment given his superior credentials and direct experience in this and similar division director positions on an "acting" basis. Therefore, we concur in the AJ's credibility determinations, but find that D's reasons were a pretext for discrimination and reprisal<span class="Italic">. See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248 (1981) and <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to allegations 2 and 5, although the AJ found that D treated everyone consistent with his management style, we nevertheless find that racial animus and reprisal is demonstrated because D did not subject the White managers to the same conduct. Specifically, we find that the evidence shows that D passed over only appellant, the only Black, and the only Black to file and "prevail" on an EEO complaint, on the "acting director" rotation list. D also gave appellant a comparatively more negative midyear performance evaluation, and yet was unable to substantiate any of his criticisms of appellant's work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is appellant's contention that D, a Black male, perceived that his career would be enhanced by assisting white male managers under his supervision in their career advancement, and that it would also be to his benefit not to further appellant's career, a Black manager who files and "prevails" on EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, based on the totality of these circumstances, we differ with the AJ and the agency, and conclude that the appellant has shown illegal racial motivation and reprisal by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no requirement that racial animus or reprisal be shown with direct evidence<span class="Italic">. See McDonald, supra</span>., and <span class="Italic">Hochstadt, supra</span>. Accordingly, the agency's decision finding no discrimination is REVERSED, and the agency is directed to comply with the terms of the following ORDER.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.</span> 530 U.S. 133, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed.2d 105 (2000), the Supreme Court reached essentially the same conclusion as it did in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> in an age discrimination case. The Commission has often relied upon <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> in holding that pretext, standing alone, can support a finding of discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Adams v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10061 (2003), the Commission observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the AJ's finding that the agency's explanation for its actions was not worthy of belief is supported by substantial evidence, including complainant's testimony based on personal knowledge and admissions by responsible agency officials. That finding in turn is adequate to support the AJ's determination that the agency's true motivation was discriminatory animus. As the Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products Inc.</span>, 530 U.S. 133 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive. ("[P]roving the employer's reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination"). In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose. Such an inference is consistent with the general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material fact as "affirmative evidence of guilt."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, a plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A04452 (2003). In <span class="Italic">Kristy D. v. Secretary of the Interior</span>, 0720160003 (2016), the Commission relied heavily on the <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> case to affirm an administrative judge's finding of sex and age discrimination in the absence of another reasonable explanation for the at issue agency action. In that case, the complainant, who had worked in the same office for most of her career, received a directed reassignment to a less desirable job. Before the judge, the complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that a substantially younger male replaced her in her former position. The agency appealed that finding and the judge's ultimate finding of discrimination. Relying on <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kristy D.</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, a complainant may show that she is a member of a protected class, that she was subjected to adverse treatment, and that she was treated differently than otherwise similarly situated employees outside of the protected class. <span class="Italic">See Potter v. Goodwill Industries of Cleveland</span>, 518 F.2d 864 (6th Cir. 1975). The AJ found that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Complainant, as a female over the age of 40, is a member of two protected classes. The AJ found that Complainant's directed reassignment to a less favorable position constituted adverse treatment. Finally, the AJ found that Complainant showed that others outside of her protected group were treated more favorably when someone from outside of her protected groups (male; substantially younger than Complainant) was selected to replace her in her former position as Deputy Regional Director--Trust Services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency on appeal first argues that the AJ erred in finding that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Specifically the Agency argues that Complainant failed to show she was subjected to adverse treatment and failed to show she was treated differently than otherwise similarly situated employees outside of her protected classes. We note, however, an adverse action merely requires a tangible change in the duties or working conditions constituting a material employment disadvantage. <span class="Italic">See DeNovellis v. Shalala</span>, 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that divesting an employee of assignments and responsibilities establishes an adverse employment action); <span class="Italic">See also Zobel v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050035 (November 28, 2006) (involuntary reassignment constituted adverse action where complainant strongly preferred working in her prior position and expressed this repeatedly, was comfortable in her position, and had a good working relationship with management there). In the present instance the record shows that, despite telling her supervisor she did not want to be transferred, Complainant was involuntarily reassigned from a position in an area where she had worked virtually her entire career and had "my expertise and all my knowledge," to one where she had very little experience. With regard to the third prong of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, we note that Complainant was the only person involuntarily reassigned to a less desirable position, which is sufficient to show others outside of her protected groups were treated more favorably. We therefore discern no basis to disturb the AJ's finding that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ next found that the Agency articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action by explaining that Complainant was reassigned to the Indian Services program because her leadership was crucial to the success of that program. Once the Agency articulates a reason for its action, the burden shifts back to Complainant to establish that the Agency's articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination, or otherwise show that discrimination occurred. <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at 143; <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr</span>., 509 U.S. at 519. The AJ noted that despite the fact that Complainant was a highly valued employee, the reassignment notice threatened her with termination if she refused. While the Agency argued that despite the wording of the notice it had no intention of terminating Complainant's employment, the AJ found that "the Agency's assertion to the contrary is not credible." The AJ further noted that, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, "it is permissible for a trier of fact in an employment discrimination case to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer's explanation." The AJ concluded that "it is implausible that the Agency could respect Complainant's leadership skills as greatly as asserted, and yet would risk losing her services by threatening her with termination if she did not accepted [sic] a position it knew she did not want." Because the AJ found the Agency's position unworthy of belief, the AJ found that Complainant's reassignment was discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency argues that the AJ's finding "impermissibly relieves Complainant of her burden of demonstrating pretext." We note, however, that it is not the AJ's finding that relieves Complainant of any such burden, but the Supreme Court of the United States, which issued the language in <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> upon which the AJ relied. We further note that the Agency has not argued that the facts of <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> make that case inapplicable to the instant claim. The Agency next argues that the AJ's finding "renders all directed reassignments suspect (though expressly permitted by regulation) and in cases where the employee is a member of a protected class--<span class="Italic">per se</span> discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. p. 9 (Parentheses in oriGINAl). We disagree. We note that, contrary to the Agency's claim, the AJ's finding merely renders suspect those reassignments where a complainant can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and for which the Agency's explanation is implausible, in accordance with <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following a review of the record we discern no basis to disturb the AJ's finding that Complainant was subjected to discrimination based on sex and age when she was involuntarily reassigned to the position of Deputy Regional Director--Indian Services. The findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, and the AJ correctly applied the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws.</p>
<p class="noindent">In most cases a finding that the agency's proffered explanation is not pretextual will end the inquiry into the ultimate determination of discrimination. However, it is possible for the Commission to reject a complainant's contention of pretext, but issue a finding of discrimination based on the other evidence of record. In <span class="Italic">Chika v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01934179 (1994), the complainant contended that he was not selected for a position during operation Desert Storm because of his national origin (Iraqi):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_733"></span>In this case, the Commission does not find sufficient evidence to establish that the agency's proffered explanation is unworthy of belief. The record supports the determination of the SO and ROs that, as measured against the criteria applied to all applicants, Selectee is better qualified than appellant for the position at issue. Appellant is not plainly more qualified than Selectee, so as to compel a finding of discrimination. Where there are two equally desirable candidates competing for the same position, the selecting official may exercise his prerogative in choosing between the candidates, and a trier of fact should not substitute his judgment for the legitimate exercise of managerial discretion<span class="Italic">. Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01893757 (April 20, 1990); <span class="Italic">see Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 259; <span class="Italic">see also Bauer v. Bailar</span>, 647 F.2d 1037, 1048 (10th Cir. 1981) (nonselected employee's qualifications not so plainly superior as to require a finding of pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission finds that there is evidence which tends to support a finding that the agency officials were more likely motivated by discriminatory animus. Although with respect to promotions to managerial level, professional, and specialized positions, the use of subjective criteria is generally acceptable, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Casillas v. U.S. Navy</span>, 735 F. 2d 338, 345 (9th Cir. 1984) (subjective criteria not discriminatory<span class="Italic"> per se</span>), certain aspects of the selection procedure at issue appear suspect. For example, applicants were not asked identical questions during their interviews. Selectee was noted to be best at thinking "on his feet," but it is not known whether he was asked questions as demanding as those asked of appellant. Further, the criterion of "presentability," while probably acceptable as defined by RO-1, lends itself to abuse; an applicant who is otherwise perfectly well-qualified may be excluded on the basis that he or she is not the sort of person clients will expect, i.e., is the "wrong" gender, race, or nationality. Moreover, although the SO and the ROs denied that appellant's national origin or politics played any role in the selection process, it simply defies common knowledge of human nature to accept that the agency officials gave no thought to appellant's national origin, even if broadly defined as "Middle Eastern," while the United States was at war in the Persian Gulf. The Commission is therefore persuaded that the selection at issue did take into account appellant's national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission also found the respective qualifications of the candidates constituted clear and convincing evidence that the complainant would not have been selected, even in the absence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found discrimination under <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> where the appellant showed she was more qualified than the selectee. <span class="Italic">See Barraclough v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950112 (1996). In addition to "disbelieving" the selectee was more qualified than the complainant, the Commission also noted that "the SO's inconsistent versions of the selection process and his inability to provide any basis or support for his KSA ratings, particularly his negative assessment of appellant's qualifications, support a finding of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> By contrast, even when the complainant demonstrates that the agency's reasons are pretextual, a finding of discrimination will not be entered where the evidence indicates there is a reason other than discrimination for the personnel action. For example, in <span class="Italic">Washington v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 02A21844 (2003), the Commission found that the agency had not engaged in prohibited discrimination after rejecting the reasons proffered by the selecting official for choosing the successful candidate. Other evidence of record demonstrated that the selecting official and the selectee were personal friends and everyone in the office assumed the selectee would get the position because of the friendship. In these circumstances, the Commission found that while the agency's reasons were pretextual, they were not a pretext for discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant's burden, under <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, can be satisfied by credibility findings. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lynda v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951011 (1996), the Commission upheld a finding of intentional discrimination based on the fact that the complainant presented several witnesses who credibly rebutted the agency's proffered reason for a lowered performance rating. Specifically, several witnesses credibly rebutted the testimony of the alleged discriminating official that the complainant did not have good human relations skills.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence used to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination also can be used to support a finding of pretext and an ultimate finding of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Saenz v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05950927 (1998). In that case, testimony that the supervisor treated women more harshly than men was sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination in the absence of a comparison employee, and also supported a finding of discrimination under an analysis of pretext. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lockhart v. Postmaster General</span>, 01964211 (1998) (union official testified that only black employees complained about supervisor).</p>
<p class="noindent">One demonstration of how <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> applies to the complainant's burden to demonstrate discriminatory intent is <span class="Italic">Bojanowski v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A20319 (2003). In that case, the Commission found it was a pretext for discrimination based on sex where the complainant was not selected for a position after she previously resigned a similar position to have a baby. The Commission found that the selecting official's comments that "'he did [not] tell complainant to quit and if she wants a job, she'll take it at the bottom rate,'" combined with other evidence in the case showed the reasons for her nonselection were a pretext for sex discrimination. Based on that same evidence of record, however, the Commission found the complainant had not established the reasons for her nonselection were a pretext for race discrimination. The complainant, for purposes of both claims, established the agency's proffered reasons were pretextual. But the finding of pretext did not entitle her to a finding of race discrimination because the other evidence in the case pointed to sex discrimination just as other evidence in the <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> case demonstrated that the supervisor's bias was personal and not based on race.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a disciplinary case, it is not necessarily persuasive evidence of pretext and discriminatory intent that the Merit Systems Protection Board overturned the discipline because the agency failed to prove its charges. For example, in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 03A20027 (2002), the Commission rejected the complainant's argument that the failure to sustain the charges demonstrated her removal was discriminatory. The Commission found the proper focus was on whether the agency had a good faith belief that the charges should be sustained when it took the removal action and that the Board's finding on the charges was not indicative of the absence of a good faith belief.</p>
