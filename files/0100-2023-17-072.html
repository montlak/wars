<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-73"><span class="space">b.</span> Failure to Comply With an Order</h5>
<p class="noindent">A finding of bad faith is not required for an administrative judge to impose a sanction of default judgment against an agency. In <span class="Italic">Bak v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20039 (2003), the Commission found that multiple failures to comply with orders of the administrative judge justified the sanction of default judgment without a showing of bad faith:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the agency's arguments regarding sanctions, the Commission's regulations afford broad authority for the conduct of hearings by administrative Judges.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.109 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>; <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 13, 2001). When a complainant or agency fails to comply with an AJ's order, an AJ may take action against the non-complying party pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(f)(3), up to and including issuing a decision in favor of the opposing party.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(f)(3)(iv). The Commission has previously upheld the issuance of a default judgment as a sanction for the agency's failure to comply with orders issued by an Administrative Judge<span class="Italic">. See Janda v. United States Postal Service</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A10018 (March 4, 2002) (upholding AJ's issuance of decision in complainant's favor as a sanction for agency's failure to respond to complainant's discovery requests in accordance with AJ's order compelling responses and failure to response to AJ's order to show cause); <span class="Italic">Magruder v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01984820 (March 17, 1999) (upholding AJ's issuance of decision in complainant's favor as a sanction for agency representative's failure to appear timely at the hearing), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05990640 (March 9, 2001); <span class="Italic">Pachecho v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970691 (November 25, 1998) (upholding AJ's issuance of a decision in complainant's favor as sanction for agency's failure to provide complainant with relevant evidence, failure to respond to pertinent objections, failure to file timely motions and failure to comply with discovery orders); and <span class="Italic">Telles v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01980931 (November 25, 1998) (upholding AJ's issuance of a decision in complainant's favor as sanction for agency's refusal to reserve a room for the hearing and failure to appear without good cause).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the agency failed to comply with the AJ's order to provide a second supplemental investigation. Thereafter, the agency failed to respond to the AJ's Notice to Show Cause why sanctions should not be imposed. In its untimely Motion for Reconsideration brought before the AJ and on appeal, the agency argued that it failed to comply with the AJ's order because of confusion surrounding complainant's use of multiple complaint processes, and because it was not usual for an AJ to order the agency to conduct a second supplemental investigation when it had already been ordered to conduct a first supplemental investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we agree with the AJ's imposition of sanctions against the agency. The supplemental investigations were only required because the agency's initial investigation was wholly inadequate. Although the agency complied with the AJ's initial order for a first supplemental investigation, it failed to respond to the AJ's second notice for a supplemental investigation, and failed to respond to the AJ's notice why sanctions should not be imposed. While the agency may not have acted in bad faith, no such showing is required. Further, the explanation proffered by the agency does not rise to the level of good cause shown<span class="Italic">. See DaCosta v. Department of Education,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Candance C. v. General Services Administration</span>, 0720160013 (2016), the Commission upheld an administrative judge's grant of default judgment against the agency where the agency repeatedly, over the course of months, disregarded the judge's orders and failed to respond or oppose the complainant's motion for sanctions. Notably, the Commission not only discussed the agency's procedural noncompliance, but also analyzed the strength of the merits of the complainant's case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_608"></span>The factors pertinent to "tailoring" a sanction, or determining whether a sanction is, in fact, warranted, include: (1) the extent and nature of the non-compliance, including the justification presented by the non-complying party; (2) the prejudicial effect of the non-compliance on the opposing party; (3) the consequences resulting from the delay in justice, if any; and (4) the effect on the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dep't of Defense, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Voysest v. Social Security Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A35340 (Jan. 18, 2005); <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the default judgment in Complainant's favor was not an abuse of discretion for the reasons which follow. Default judgment is an appropriate sanction for the infraction, the failure to comply with AJ1's orders for months. In other appeals of default judgments issued by AJs for failure to comply with the requirements of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process, the Commission has affirmed the default judgments, in the interest of protecting the integrity of the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> [ ], <span class="Italic">Complainant, v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090009 (June 5, 2015); <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Reading v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40125 (Oct. 12, 2006); <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070039 (Oct. 2, 2007), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520080115 (Dec. 26, 2007); <span class="Italic">Elston v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50019 (Oct. 18, 2005), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 05A60283 (Jan. 5, 2006); <span class="Italic">Rhinesmith v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10103 (Jan. 28, 2003), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. den</span>., EEOC Request No. 05A30509 (May 13, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination with respect to claims 1, 2, and 3. For example, with respect to her nonselection for the Leasing Specialist position, the record establishes that Complainant was not selected because she performed poorly on her interview, and Complainant alleges that she performed poorly in the interview because she was denied a reasonable accommodation for her disability, which causes short-term memory issues, when she was not allowed to bring her notecards with statutory section numbers to the interview to refresh her memory. Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion for AJ2 to draw an adverse inference that the information in the complaint file would have reflected unfavorably on the Agency and enter a default judgment in favor of Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency contends that it has shown good cause for failing to comply with the AJs' orders. However, the Agency failed to proffer an explanation for its inaction and did not concede its negligence until appeal. The Agency should have raised the alleged mail room issue between February 2015, when the mail room issue was resolved, and May 2015, when AJ2 issued the default judgment, rather than after the fact on appea1. Accordingly, based on the information AJ2 had when she issued her decision, we find that she did not abuse her discretion in sanctioning the Agency by entering a decision fully in Complainant's favor. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(f)(3)(v); <span class="Italic">Rhinesmith v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. We find that the sanction of a default judgment was appropriately tailored by AJ2 to impress upon the Agency the need to comply with AJ Orders, as well as the relevant timeframes of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld a default judgment where the administrative judge rejected the agency's excuse that a "series of unfortunate events" precluded it from complying with certain orders in <span class="Italic">Dionne W. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720150040 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ explained that the Agency did not attend an August 26, 2014 status/settlement conference, and that she issued an Order to Show Cause for why default judgment should not be granted in favor of Complainant on August 28, 2014. The show-cause order specified that the Agency should indicate why the case should not be decided in favor of Complainant, given her summary judgment motion. Complainant's summary judgment motion included arguments regarding the Agency's discovery failures. The AJ also explained that the Agency did not respond to Complainant's discovery requests in accordance with a November 13, 2013 acknowledgement and order. Rather, the Agency argued for a completely new investigation, but the AJ disagreed that discovery would not serve to address inadequacies in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency attempted to explain what it characterized as a "series of unfortunate events" involving its designated representative leaving the Agency, and the failure of its new representative to receive correspondence from the AJ. The AJ pointed out that correspondence regarding the status conference was not returned as "undeliverable," the Agency did not enter an appearance for a new Agency representative, the Agency did not inform the AJ of an addressee to whom orders should more appropriately be sent, and that the Agency's EEO office received the correspondence. The AJ concluded that the Agency's reply to the order to show cause confirming these facts did not constitute a good cause showing of why a sanction of default judgment should not be imposed. The Agency argues that the AJ did not serve the scheduling order to its "designated HECAPS representative," but this would have been the former Agency representative who had already withdrawn from the case due to leaving the Agency, and the new Agency representative did not enter an appearance in the case until months later on September 3, 2014.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ did not abuse her discretion in issuing the sanction, as it serves to remedy Complainant for the Agency's failure to comply with orders, and to deter the Agency from engaging in similar conduct in the future. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Germain v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10048 (December 23, 2002) (upholding AJ's issuance of decision in complainant's favor as a sanction for the agency's failure to show good cause for its failure to comply with AJ's orders); <span class="Italic">Janda v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10018 (March 4, 2002) (upholding AJ's issuance of decision in complainant's favor as a sanction for agency's failure to respond to complainant's discovery requests and failure to respond to AJ's order to show cause).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the AJ's decision to issue a sanction of default judgment in favor of Complainant was not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent">And, it got worse for the agency in <span class="Italic">Dionne W</span>. because the Commission upheld a substantial compensatory damages award of $185,000, noting that the default judgment rendered irrelevant any challenges to the complainant's credibility.</p>
<p class="noindent">Default judgment was upheld as a sanction in <span class="Italic">Elston v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50019.txt">07A50019</a> (2005), where much of the agency's defense centered on problems in the mailroom and contentions that it had not received some of the judge's orders. By contrast, the Commission reversed default judgment in <span class="Italic">Gryder v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720070078 (2009), even though the agency had not corrected any of the problems that led to default judgment in <span class="Italic">Elston</span>. In <span class="Italic">Gryder,</span> the Commission again rejected arguments made by the agency in <span class="Italic">Elston</span> about mail distribution problems and agency counsel being unaware of judge's orders and a prehearing conference. However, the Commission also found that the sanction of default judgment was too harsh where the administrative judge had never issued a ruling on the agency's motion to stay discovery and proceedings pending the outcome of a case brought by the same complainant in U.S. district court because it potentially raised the same claims that were being pursued administratively. In vacating the default judgment and remanding the case to the judge, the Commission found that if it was determined that the administrative complaint did not raise the same claims pending in the court case, then the appropriate sanction was to bar the agency from using affidavits and exhibits in the report of investigation in support of any summary judgment motion and to further bar the agency from using any of those affidavits in lieu of live witness testimony at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's steadfast refusal to comply with an administrative judge's order to produce documents that the agency asserted were attorney-client privileged resulted in a default judgment that the Commission upheld in <span class="Italic">Mira Z. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720150035 (2018). In that case, the agency's response to the complainant's discovery request included a privilege log. The administrative judge ordered the agency to produce all documents on the privilege log that preceded the complainant's request for a hearing. The administrative judge further noted that agency counsel was impermissibly involved in the shaping of witness testimony and evidence gathering during the informal counseling and investigative stages. The agency moved for reconsideration, which the administrative judge denied and ordered that the agency produce the at-issue documents within 15 days. The agency continued to assert privilege, and the administrative judge sanctioned the agency with a default judgment. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mira Z</span>. upheld the sanction for failure to comply with the administrative judge's order:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ issued an Order to Show Cause that required the Agency to explain why it should not be sanctioned for failing to produce the documents it claimed were protected by the attorney-client privilege. The AJ's Order stated that if, without good cause, the Agency failed to provide the requested documents within 15 days of receipt of his Order, the AJ would impose sanctions, including the sanction of a decision in favor of Complainant. The Agency responded to the Order to Show Cause, but steadfastly refused to provide the documents to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that the withheld documents are protected by the attorney-client privilege. However, as noted by the AJ, the nature of the withheld documents is only vaguely revealed by the privilege log. The privilege log entries contain a brief notation of the record type (email, standalone, or attachment), the date sent, the sender, the recipients, privilege status (privileged/withheld), and privileged reason (confidential attorney client communications or attorney work product). We conclude that the Agency's privilege log is nothing more than a cryptic list of titles of documents and senders/recipients that does not reveal the validity of the Agency's assertion of the attorney-client privilege. As such, we cannot find that the Agency has demonstrated that it properly asserted the attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that the AJ deprived it of the opportunity to submit the complete documents to him for <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review. However, the Agency could have submitted the complete documents to the AJ at any time, including in its response to Complainant's discovery request; in its response to Complainant's Motion for Sanctions; at the status hearing; or on its own initiative. Instead, the Agency relied upon a nebulous log to justify its failure to comply the AJ's order. It is the Agency's burden to <span id="Page_609"></span>justify its assertion of the privilege, and therefore, it should have taken the initiative to submit documentation sufficient to ascertain whether it properly asserted the privilege. <span class="Italic">United States v. Lopez</span>, 777 F.2d 543 (10th Cir. 1985). For example, the Agency could have submitted entire documents to the AJ for <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review, or produced a much more detailed log. Consequently, we find that the Agency has not provided good cause for its assertion of the attorney-client privilege in this case, and that the AJ did not abuse his discretion when he sanctioned the Agency for failing to comply with his order to provide the requested discovery documents to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ determined that default judgment in favor of Complainant was the appropriate remedy. The Agency's failure to comply with the AJ's order without good cause is a serious matter that threatens the integrity of the EEO process and impairs the ability of the Commission to remedy violations of EEO law. Likewise, withholding potentially relevant evidence from the record deprives complainants of the opportunity for a full and fair adjudication of their claims. The seriousness of failing to abide by an AJ's order is underscored by the fact that EEO regulations provide that when a party fails to comply with an AJ's order, an AJ may act against the non-complying party, up to and including issuing a decision in favor of the opposing party. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3)(iv). The Commission has previously upheld the issuance of a default judgment as a sanction for agencies' failure to comply with orders issued by an AJ. <span class="Italic">See Germain v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10048 (Dec. 23, 2002) (upholding the AJ's issuance of a decision in complainant's favor as a sanction for the agency's failure to show good cause for its failure to comply with the AJ's orders to produce the complaint file and to show cause); <span class="Italic">Janda v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10018 (Mar. 4, 2002) (upholding the AJ's issuance of a decision in complainant's favor as a sanction for the agency's failure to respond to complainant's discovery requests in accordance with the AJ's order compelling responses and failure to respond to the AJ's order to show cause). Here, we find that the AJ did not abuse his discretion when he issued default judgment in favor of Complainant. <span class="Italic">See Bente v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A40023 (Apr. 28, 2006) (upholding sanctions against agency that asserted attorney-client privilege and attorney work product as reasons for failing to comply with AJ's discovery order).</p>
