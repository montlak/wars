</header>
<p class="noindent">Unlike the theory of intentional discrimination, the theory of disparate or adverse impact discrimination does not require any showing of the employer's motive. Rather, the focus is entirely on the effect of the employer's policies and practices. Perhaps because in an adverse impact case the employer is not culpable in the same sense as in cases of intentional discrimination, for years the theory has been a legal, as well as a political, battlefield. The battle has encompassed not only the question of the employer's liability for adverse impact discrimination, but the appropriate remedies. The battle intensified in 1989 when the Supreme Court issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 490 U.S. 642, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 104 L. Ed.2d 733 (1989). While not directly reversing its previous holding in <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971), the <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> case made it significantly more difficult for plaintiffs pressing an adverse impact theory of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> was short-lived, however. With the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166 (Nov. 21, 1991), Congress specifically reinstated the burdens of proof for adverse impact discrimination that were previously set forth in <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 42 USC 2000e-2(k).</p>
<p class="noindent">This chapter describes the evolution of the adverse impact theory from <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> to <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span> and then explains further the effect of the 1991 Civil Rights Act on the theory.</p>
<p class="noindent">The notion behind the adverse impact theory is that employment criteria, although facially neutral can have the effect of disproportionately disadvantaging a certain protected class or classes. The theory is most often advanced in class actions. But, it can also be applied to individual cases of discrimination, just as the theory of intentional discrimination can be applied to a class action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not only is the notion behind adverse impact cases different than in cases involving intentional discrimination, but the burdens of proof are different also. Upon a showing that a neutral employment criterion has an adverse impact, the burden that shifts to the employer is one of demonstrating that the criterion is justified by a business necessity. The complainant or complainants then have the opportunity to demonstrate there is an alternative practice that will achieve the same end without a disparate impact that the employer refuses to implement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complicating both the legal and political debate surrounding the adverse impact theory is the issue of affirmative action. Affirmative action can be part of the remedial response to adverse impact discrimination. Affirmative action is based on the presumption that certain protected groups that have suffered discrimination in the past continue to suffer the lingering effects of that discrimination. Affirmative action further presumes that merely banning discrimination in the present and future is not an adequate remedy for past discrimination. Many are now calling these presumptions into question. Some believe that affirmative action as a remedy of the past is no longer required to level the playing field. Others believe that from a legal perspective, affirmative action was always fundamentally flawed. Still others believe that affirmative action remains a viable concept.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the end, the affirmative action debate is one that the legal community is ill-equipped to resolve. Resolution of the debate, if indeed one is forthcoming, is far more a matter of sociology, economics and national policy. The author makes no attempt to weigh in on any side of the debate. The purpose of this chapter is solely to give the reader, to the best of the author's ability, a correct description of the current law and how it has developed and, where possible, to give some indication of how the law might continue to develop. Affirmative action is discussed in this chapter because it is one remedial response to adverse impact discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">It should be noted that the Supreme Court had questioned whether adverse impact was a viable theory in cases of age discrimination and several courts had held that the theory did not apply to those cases. The Commission had repeatedly rejected the notion that adverse impact theory cannot be pursued in cases involving age discrimination. However, in <span class="Italic">Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory</span>, 128 S. Ct. 2395 (2008), the Supreme Court held that a claim of disparate impact discrimination could be brought under the ADEA.</p>

<h2 class="h2" id="sec11-2"><span class="space">I.</span> THE <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">GRIGGS</span></span> CASE</h2>
<p class="noindent">As in the case of intentional discrimination, the Supreme Court originally decided upon the fundamental analysis to be applied to cases involving the application of facially neutral employment criteria which have the effect of impacting disproportionately on a certain protected class or classes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971). The Commission subsequently adopted the guidance of <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> in dealing with cases of adverse impact.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>, the employer adopted a policy requiring a high school diploma, or in the alternative, a passing score on a standardized general intelligence test, as a prerequisite for hiring and transferring into some of its departments. Three facts were undisputed when the case reached the Supreme Court: (1) the high school diploma or intelligence test had not been shown to be related to successful job performance; (2) the requirements had the effect of disqualifying a disproportionately high number of blacks; and (3) the jobs in question historically were occupied by white employees. The lower courts also found that, prior to the effective date of Title VII, the company openly discriminated against blacks and that it implemented its new hiring and transfer policy on the day Title VII became effective. Both the district court and the court of appeals found the policy did not violate Title VII because the employer was not motivated by discrimination but, in fact, was trying to assist blacks by paying a portion of their high school training.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court rejected the motivational analysis when dealing with ostensibly neutral criteria that admittedly had the effect of significantly disadvantaging minority employees. The Court focused its attention on two provisions of Title VII, 703. Section a of 42 USC 2000e-2 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, 42 USC 2000e-2(h) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer. . .to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test provided that such test, its administration or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>, the Supreme Court held that the employees had the initial burden of demonstrating that the employer's facially neutral test disqualified a disproportionate number of the protected class. At that point, the burden of proof then shifted to the employer to demonstrate that there was a compelling business necessity for the test. Unlike intentional discrimination cases, the burden that shifted to the employer was not just the burden of production of evidence, but the burden of persuasion. To meet this burden, the employer had to demonstrate that there was an actual correlation between test scores and job performance. The decision of the Court in <span class="Italic">Griggs</span>, written by Chief Justice Burger, was unanimous, with the exception that Justice Brennan took no part in consideration of the case. Chief Justice Burger, 401 U.S. at 429-36, started out by discussing the purpose of Title VII:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The objective of Congress in enactment of Title VII is plain from the language of the statute. It was to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees. Under the Act, practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to "freeze" the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> of prior discriminatory employment practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress did not intend by Title VII, however, to guarantee a job to every person regardless of qualifications. In short, the Act does not command that any person be hired simply because he was formerly the subject of discrimination, or because he is a member of a minority group. Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed. What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress has now provided that tests or criteria for employment or promotion may not provide equality of opportunity only in the sense of the fabled offer of milk to the stork and the fox. On the contrary, Congress has now required that the posture and condition of the job seeker be taken into account. It has--to resort again to the fable--provided that the vessel in which the milk is proffered be one all seekers can use. The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The touchstone is business necessity. If an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the record before us, neither the high school completion requirement nor the general intelligence test is shown to bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it is used. Both were adopted, as the Court of Appeals noted, without meaningful <span id="Page_778"></span>study of their relationship to job-performance ability. Rather, a vice president of the company testified, the requirements were instituted on the Company's judgment that they generally would improve the overall quality of the work force.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Company contends that its general intelligence tests are specifically permitted by &#x00A7; 703(h) of the Act. That section authorizes the use of "any professionally developed ability test" that is not "designed, intended or used to discriminate because of race. . . ."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, having enforcement responsibility, has issued guidelines interpreting &#x00A7; 703(h) to permit only the use of job-related tests. The administrative interpretation of the Act by the enforcing agency is entitled to great deference. (citation omitted) Since the Act and its legislative history support the Commission's construction, this affords good reason to treat the guidelines as expressing the will of Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 703(h) was not contained in the House version of the Civil Rights Act but was added in the Senate during extended debate. For a period, debate revolved around claims that the bill as proposed would prohibit all testing and force employers to hire unqualified persons simply because they were part of a group formerly subject to job discrimination. Proponents of Title VII sought throughout the debate to assure the critics that the Act would have no effect on job-related tests. Senators Case of New Jersey and Clark of Pennsylvania, comanagers of the bill on the Senate floor, issued a memorandum explaining that the proposed Title VII "expressly protects the employer's right to insist that any prospective applicant, Negro or white, must meet the applicable job qualifications. Indeed, the very purpose of title VII is to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis of race or color." 110 Cong. Rec. 7247. Despite these assurances, Senator Tower of Texas introduced an amendment authorizing "professionally developed ability tests." Proponents of Title VII opposed the amendment because, as written, it would permit an employer to give any test, "whether it was a good test or not, so long as it was professionally designed. Discrimination could actually exist under the guise of compliance with the statute." 110 Cong. Rec. 13504 (remarks of Sen. Case).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The amendment was defeated and two days later Senator Tower offered a substitute amendment which was adopted verbatim and is now the testing provision of &#x00A7; 703(h). Speaking for the supporters of Title VII, Senator Humphrey, who had vigorously opposed the first amendment, endorsed the substitute amendment, stating: "Senators on both sides of the aisle who were deeply interested in title VII have examined the text of this amendment and have found it to be in accord with the intent and purpose of that title." 110 Cong. Rec. 13724. The amendment was then adopted. From the sum of the legislative history relevant in this case, the conclusion is inescapable that the EEOC's construction of &#x00A7; 703(h) to require that employment tests be job related comports with congressional intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the Act precludes the use of testing or measuring procedures; obviously they are useful. What Congress has forbidden is giving these devices and mechanisms controlling force unless they are demonstrably a reasonable measure of job performance. Congress has not commanded that the less qualified be preferred over the better qualified simply because of minority origins. Far from disparaging job qualifications as such, Congress has made such qualifications the controlling factor, so that race, religion, nationality, and sex become irrelevant. What Congress has commanded is that any tests used must measure the person for the job and not the person in the abstract. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court struck down the educational criteria in <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971), because the employer conducted no studies of the relationship between the tests and job performance prior to its implementation. The evidence further showed that white employees hired prior to the implementation of the practice, and who did not possess high school diplomas or pass the test, had been able to perform satisfactorily and to advance.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the wake of the <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> decision, it was clear that in implementing across-the-board employment practices, an employer not only had to advance the notion that the practices were job-related but would be required to make some showing to that effect. Unlike cases involving intentional discrimination, the employer was required to do more than simply advance a business necessity reason; the employer would be required to prove a business necessity reason.</p>
