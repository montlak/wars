<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-8"><span class="space">2.</span> Spin-Off and Dissatisfaction With Process Complaints</h4>
<p class="noindent">The 1999 amendments to Part 1614 revised the manner for processing "spin-off" complaints. Spin-off complaints allege dissatisfaction with the processing of an underlying complaint. Over the years, the Commission significantly revised its approach to spin-off complaints. Currently, any allegations regarding the improper processing of complaints must be raised during the processing of the underlying complaint. New complaints over process matters will be dismissed under 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(8), as discussed later in this chapter, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-12-007.html#sec3-8">Spin-Off and Dissatisfaction With Process Complaints</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110 at 5-28 to 5-30 describes the manner in which spin-off complaints should be processed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;If a complainant is dissatisfied with the processing of his/her pending complaint, whether or not it alleges prohibited discrimination as a basis for dissatisfaction, s/he should be referred to the agency official responsible for the quality of complaints processing. Agency officials should earnestly attempt to resolve dissatisfaction with the complaints process as early and expeditiously as possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The agency official responsible for the quality of complaints processing must add a record of the complainant's concerns and any actions the agency took to resolve the concerns, to the complaint file maintained on the underlying complaint. If no action was taken, the file must contain an explanation of the agency's reason(s) for not taking any action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;A complainant must always raise his/her concerns first with the agency, in the above manner. However, in cases where the complainant's concerns have not been resolved informally with the agency, the complainant may present those concerns to the EEOC at either of the following stages of processing:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Where the complainant has requested a hearing, to the EEOC Administrative Judge when the complaint is under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Judge; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Where the complainant has not requested a hearing, to the EEOC Office of Federal Operations (OFO) on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant must raise any dissatisfaction with the processing of his/her complaint before the Administrative Judge issues a decision on that complaint, the agency takes final action on the complaint, or either the Administrative Judge or the agency dismiss the complaint. The complainant has the burden of showing improper processing. No concerns regarding improper processing raised after a decision will be accepted by the agency, the Administrative Judge, or OFO.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the Administrative Judge or OFO finds that an agency has <span id="Page_147"></span>improperly processed the oriGINAl complaint and that such improper processing has had a material effect on the processing of the oriGINAl complaint, the Administrative Judge or OFO may impose sanctions on the agency as s/he/it deems appropriate. For example, where the complainant asserts that the agency's investigation of the complaint was improper, the Administrative Judge may determine whether the complainant has properly characterized the investigation <span class="Italic">and</span> whether the agency's failure properly to investigate the complaint had a material effect on the processing of the complaint. If the Administrative Judge finds that the processing of the complainant's complaint was materially affected by the agency's actions, the Administrative Judge shall issue an appropriate order addressing the deficiencies in the investigation. If the Administrative Judge finds that although the agency's actions were inconsistent with its requirements under the 29 CFR Part 1614 regulations, but had no material effect on the processing of the complaint, the Administrative Judge, in the exercise of his/her discretion, may suggest that the complainant submit a letter to the following EEOC office for consideration regarding the agency's conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Office of Federal Operations</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Federal Sector Programs</p>
<p class="noindent-2">31 M Street, NE</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Washington, DC 20507</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Electronic submission may be made using email transmission of documents to federalsectoreeo@eeoc.gov or by using the Commission's electronic document submission portal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the complainant contends that an agency improperly denied him/her official time and the Administrative Judge or OFO finds in the complainant's favor, the Administrative Judge or OFO may order the agency to restore such personal leave as the complainant may have used in lieu of official time.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission provided the rationale for processing spin-off allegations as part of the underlying complaint in its notice of final rulemaking, at 64 Fed. Reg. 37,646-647 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As was explained in the NPRM, EEOC's regulations at 29 CFR Part 1613, which were superseded by 29 CFR Part 1614 in 1992, expressly permitted complainants to file separate complaints alleging dissatisfaction with agencies' processing of their oriGINAl complaints. 29 CFR 1613.262 (1991). The procedure resulted in the filing of multiple spin-off complaints. The Commission recognized the need to limit these complaints, and did not include the Part 1613 provision in Part 1614. Guidance was provided in Management Directive 110. Spin-off complaints continued to be filed, however, despite there being no provision in either the regulations or the management directive permitting the filing of a separate complaint on this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission continues to believe that any alleged unfairness or discrimination in the processing of a complaint can--and must--be raised during the processing of the underlying complaint and there is ample authority to deal with such allegations in that process. The spin-off allegations are so closely related to the underlying complaint that a separate complaint would result in redundancy, duplication of time and waste of resources. Such allegations need to be addressed within the over-all context of the initial complaint while that complaint is still pending. The Commission has decided to add the provision requiring dismissal of spin-off complaints to ensure that a balance is maintained between fair and nondiscriminatory agency processing of complaints and the need to eliminate the multiple filing of burdensome complaints about the manner in which an oriGINAl complaint was processed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conjunction with this regulatory change, the Commission will issue detailed companion guidance in Management Directive 110 addressing the procedures to be followed to resolve allegations of dissatisfaction with the complaints process quickly and effectively. Individuals who are dissatisfied with the processing of a complaint will be advised to bring this dissatisfaction to the attention of the official responsible for the complaint, whether it be an investigator, the agency EEO manager, an EEOC administrative judge, or the Commission's Office of Federal Operations on appeal. The allegation of dissatisfaction, and any appropriate evidence, will then be considered during the processing of the existing complaint by the individuals responsible for that step of the process, who will be required to take appropriate action. If any official throughout the process becomes aware of a systemic problem of discriminatory complaint processing, that official may refer the matter to the Complaints Adjudication Division of the Office of Federal Operations at EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proper handling of spin-off allegations is important because such allegations involve the overall quality of the complaints process and implicate the resources devoted to those allegations. The procedures in the Management Directive will ensure that any evidence of discriminatory or improper handling will be considered as part of the claim before the agency or Commission without unnecessarily adding complaints to the system. When an individual presents a counselor, an agency official, or the Commission with a spin-off allegation, the complainant shall be advised where and how to have the allegation of dissatisfaction made part of the existing complaint record. The Commission believes that agency and Commission resources should not be used to process the allegation as a separate complaint because many of these allegations involve evidentiary matters or disagreements with agency decisions made in the processing of the underlying complaint. Counselors, investigators and agency officials are required to note these allegations of dissatisfaction in the complaint record so that reviewing entities can ensure that the allegation was properly addressed. As a result, individuals who file separate complaints will have such complaints dismissed by the agency or by the Commission. The Commission has decided to delegate appellate decision-making authority for appeals from dismissals of spin-off complaints to the Office of Federal Operations to ensure expeditious handling of any such appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that MD-110 provides that even allegations of discrimination in the processing of the complaint are to be handled in the manner described above. The concern of the Commission was clearly to avoid multiple frivolous complaints about processing. This is certainly a legitimate concern, but it could have been dealt with through aggressive dismissal of nonmeritorious spin-off complaints. The problem inherent in the Commission's new "solution" is that it thwarts the right to a hearing for a complainant with a legitimate claim of discrimination in the processing of his or her complaint. As noted in MD-110 above, the administrative judge only has the authority to sanction the agency if the alleged discrimination in processing has a "material effect" on the processing of the complaint. Even if there was discrimination in the complaint processing, the administrative judge cannot provide a remedy for the discrimination if there was no "material effect" on the processing of the underlying complaint. This ignores the fact that a complainant may suffer harm from discrimination in the processing of a complaint even if the processing <span id="Page_148"></span>of the complaint was not materially affected by the discrimination. Moreover, the new guidance for processing spin-off complaints has the ironic effect of insulating agency EEO officials from complaints of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">As an example, in <span class="Italic">Reloj v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01982921 (1999), the Commission found that the complainant had been aggrieved by the processing of her EEO complaint when she alleged:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;[Appellant] wrote to the EEO Officer with an EEO complaint in August 1996.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Met with [an EEO Counselor] on September 9, 1996, and when complainant returned with documentation she had requested on the 19th of September, she declared she could not proceed with this informal stage unless complainant allowed her to use complainant's name. She finally agreed to give complainant 2 hours to decide yes or no in regard to the use of her name. In less than two hours she was contacted and given permission to use complainant's name. At this time she stated it was too late, she had already talked to them and she was terminating the informal stage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Complainant contacted [an agency EEO Program Manager] in October 1996, to file an EEO complaint about the handling of her EEO complaint started in August 1996. She did not respond by appointing a counselor as the complainant requested, but rather proceeded to justify the behavior of [the EEO Counselor].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;Instead of going forward with this complaint against one of her EEO Counselor, she directed [appellant] to write to [an agency EEO Officer], which [appellant] did.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;Complainant wrote [the EEO Officer] on December 12, 1996, and asked for an impartial counselor from outside the VA Hospital in Reno, Nevada. His handling of this request was inappropriate, as was [the EEO Program Manager], and eventually [appellant] was sent a list which contained [the name of an EEO Counselor].</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency found this failed to state a claim. However the Commission in <span class="Italic">Reloj</span> found that</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a fair reading of appellant's complaint reflects that appellant alleged that her contacts with various agency EEO officials during the processing of a prior complaint had a chilling effect upon her willingness to participate in the EEO complaint process<span class="Italic">. See Pruette v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01951567 (March 10, 1998). Under the circumstances of this case, we therefore determine that appellant has alleged a harm or loss with regard to a term, condition or privilege of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not clear whether the Commission's new policy on spin-off complaints would result in a different outcome in <span class="Italic">Reloj</span>. It is clear, however, that it should not result in a different outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, questions remained concerning how the Commission would handle a situation where an employee alleged she had been denied EEO counseling. For example, in <span class="Italic">Rester v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01971324 (1999), the complainant alleged that all EEO counselors reported to her supervisor and that not only was she denied adequate counseling, but the counseling provided represented a conflict of interest. Again, in a decision issued prior to the 1999 regulation amendments, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Rester</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In devising a remedy for the agency's failure to provide the appellant with proper EEO counseling as required by Commission Regulations, the Commission is mindful of the need to avoid penalizing the appellant by adding any additional delay to the processing of her complaint. Accordingly, the Commission orders the agency on remand to investigate the additional complaint allegations identified in this decision, treating only those allegations raised in previously filed complaints as background information for this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so ordering, the Commission is mindful of the fact that the allegations identified by the Commission and allegation 4 allegedly occurred more than 45 days prior to the appellant's May 9, 1996 EEO counselor contact for this complaint. However, the Commission takes administrative notice of the appellant's previous representations about her difficulty in obtaining counseling which she made to the Commission in EEOC Appeal No. 01960162. The Commission also finds, based on a December 23, 1996 memorandum in the record, that the agency understood the Commission's Order in EEOC NO. 01960162 to require the agency to establish which counselors the appellant attempted to contact in 1993 and whether they were able to provide counseling. According to the December 23, 1996 memorandum, the agency chose to disregard the Commission's order and, instead, directed the appellant to seek counseling within 45 calendar days. The Commission draws an adverse inference from the agency's failure to comply with the Commission's order in EEOC Appeal No. 01960162, that such an investigation would have demonstrated that the appellant had sought counseling but none was provided. Indeed, that is what happened in the instant case where counseling was provided by Counselor G only on the allegation remanded to the agency by the Commission. In addition, because the agency chose to disregard the Commission's prior Order requiring it to investigate the appellant's efforts to timely obtain counseling regarding her 1992-1993 performance appraisal, it appears that it would be equally fruitless for the Commission to issue an order in this case requiring the agency to investigate the appellant's efforts to timely obtain counseling on allegation 4 and the allegations identified by the Commission in this decision. Therefore, given the circumstances described herein, it is the decision of the Commission to order the agency to investigate allegation 4 and the allegations identified by the Commission in this decision as timely raised.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ness v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981368 (2000), the Commission ordered that the agency headquarters investigate the processing of EEO complaints at a district office based on the instant complaint, as well as other complaints lodged with the EEOC's district office. The Commission also ordered that an investigation of the actual complaint in <span class="Italic">Ness</span> be conducted by another office:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While there is insufficient evidence that the Gateway District EEO Office unlawfully interfered with complainant's EEO claim, <span class="Italic">see Pruette v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01951567 (March 10, 1998), the Commission notes that based on the record of the agency's non-processing or mis-processing of complainant's EEO claim, it is unclear whether the above represents a systemic problem within the agency's Gateway District EEO office. The Commission takes judicial notice that a number of other complaints which have been processed through our hearings unit in the St. Louis District Office corroborate complainant's allegation of a dysfunctional EEO process in the Gateway District. We also take judicial notice of Congressional inquiries concerning labor management relations and other problems related to the treatment of individuals with disabilities at complainant's facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We remind the agency of its obligation to process EEO complaints of discrimination in a manner consistent with the EEOC Regulations. In this respect, we note that 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(2) provides that agency's shall "[p]rovide for the prompt, fair, and impartial processing of complaints in accordance with this part and the instructions contained in the Commission's Management Directives." Moreover, the Commission has held that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency has a continuing duty to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity in its policies and practices. This duty extends to every aspect of agency personnel policy and practice in the employment, advancement, and treatment of employees. Agencies shall, among other things, insure that managers and supervisors perform in such a manner as to effectuate continuing affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See George v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980451 (October 8, 1998) <span class="Italic">quoting Crespo v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 0592084 2 (September 17,1993). Here, the record demonstrates the EEO office in the Gateway District did not effectuate vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal opportunity, and, contrary to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(2), failed to provide for prompt, fair and impartial processing of complainant's complaint.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11] While the Commission's Regulations provide that an agency not subject to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) which has a negotiated grievance procedure may hold an EEO complaint in abeyance during the processing of a grievance covering the same matter as the complaint,<span class="Italic"> see</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.301(d), there is no evidence in the record that the agency's inaction was in any way connected to its processing of complainant's grievance. To the contrary, the agency's inaction commenced prior to the time complainant filed his grievance, and continued beyond the time his grievance was ultimately decided in his favor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In analogous cases involving conflicts of interest, the Commission has ordered another agency EEO office to assume processing of an EEO complaint<span class="Italic">. See Davis v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920097 (March 12, 1992). Although there is no evidence of any conflict here, the record clearly establishes that the EEO office in the Gateway District failed to promptly, fairly, and impartially process complainant's EEO complaint. Such failure to comply with 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(2) necessitates a similar remedy. Accordingly, on remand, the Commission instructs the agency to assign all subsequent EEO processing of complainant's complaint set forth herein to the agency's headquarters EEO office in Washington, D.C. Further, the agency headquarters EEO office shall conduct an on-site investigation concerning the actions or inactions of the EEO office in the Gateway District which have given rise to the course of events set forth herein, and issue a report to the agency's Director of EEO and its Postmaster General, as well as to the Commission's Compliance Officer, explaining what preventative and curative actions it determines are required, and that it has taken, in order to address the deficiencies in the Gateway District EEO office evident in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency shall assign an EEO investigator from its headquarters facility within fifteen (15) days from its receipt of this decision. Thereafter, the headquarters EEO investigator shall conduct concurrent, expedited investigations into complainant's claim of hostile environment disability <span id="Page_149"></span>discrimination (issue (9) herein), and complainant's compensatory damages claim. The concurrent investigations shall be completed within forty-five (45) days of the date the headquarters EEO investigator is assigned to the case. Thereafter, the agency's headquarters EEO office shall provide complainant a copy of the completed investigation and provide a notice to complainant of his right to request a hearing or a final agency decision on his hostile environment claim and his claim for compensatory damages due him pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.108(f), this decision and accompanying ORDER. If the agency fails to complete its investigation within sixty (60) days of its receipt of this decision, then complainant may request a hearing on his hostile environment claim and compensatory damages by submitting a request for hearing with the appropriate Commission office, with a copy to the agency, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.108(g). Ultimately, either the agency or an Administrative Judge from the Commission shall first rule on the merits of complainant's hostile environment claim, and then make a determination as to what compensatory damages, if any, are due complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">More recently, in <span class="Italic">Wayne C. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120171303 (2017), the Commission further identified the following alleged agency actions as spin-off complaints:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 10, 2017, Complainant filed a formal complaint alleging that the Agency subjected him to discrimination on the basis of reprisal when (1) on November 15, 2016, and ongoing, CH, Chief Employee Relations/Labor Relations, made untruthful statements and interfered with the EEOC hearing process involving his previously filed complaints; and (2) on November 15, 2016, and ongoing, LW, OGC Attorney, failed to respond to his Motion to Compel and conspired against him during said EEOC hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Wayne C</span>. reiterated the process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that Complainant is alleging in the current complaint that his previous EEO complaints were improperly processed by both Agency EEO officials and EEOC Administrative Judges, we agree with the Agency that they should be viewed as spin-off complaints subject to dismissal under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(8). Complainant should raise any claims regarding the processing of a complaint while that complaint is being processed, not in a new complaint. According to EEOC' s Management Directive (MD-110) at 9-16, such claims should be processed as part of the oriGINAl complaint. If a final Agency decision is issued on a complaint where a complainant has an issue with its processing, he or she may also raise his concerns in an appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC does monitor agency responses to spin-off complaints. For example, in <span class="Italic">Collier v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110379 (2011), the agency failed to address an allegation that the EEO counselor had improperly dismissed the complaint. The Commission ordered the agency to address the allegation and inform the complainant of what, if any, action it had taken, or to explain why it did not take action.</p>
