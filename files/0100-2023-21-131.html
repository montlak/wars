<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-122"><span class="space">2.</span> Hostile Work Environment</h4>
<p class="noindent">In order to prevail on a claim of hostile work environment based on religion, the employee must demonstrate that he or she was subjected to verbal or physical conduct, the conduct was based on religion, the conduct was unwelcome, the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile, offensive or abusive work environment, and that there is a basis of imputing liability to the agency. The rules of liability are the same as for sexual harassment cases discussed above. If the harassment is by a supervisor or manager, the agency has an affirmative defense on the issue of liability if it can demonstrate that <span id="Page_926"></span>it took prompt and effective corrective action as soon as it knew or should have known of the harassing conduct, and the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of corrective or preventive opportunities or otherwise failed to avoid harm. If the harassment is by a coworker, the agency will be liable unless it can show that it took prompt and effective corrective action as soon as it knew or should have known of the harassing conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addressing the element of demonstrating that the conduct is based on religion, the Commission, in its Compliance Manual at Section 12-III, A, 2, a, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII's prohibition against religious discrimination includes prohibiting a hostile work environment because of religion. An unlawful hostile environment based on religion can take the form of physical or verbal harassment, which would include the unwelcome imposition of beliefs or practices contrary to the employee's religion or lack thereof. A hostile work environment is created "[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." To establish a case of religious hostile work environment harassment, an employee must show: (1) that the harassment was based on his religion; (2) that the harassment was unwelcome; (3) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment by creating an objectively and subjectively hostile or abusive work environment; and (4) that there is a basis for employer liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support a religious harassment claim, the adverse treatment must be based on the employee's religion. While verbally harassing conduct clearly is based on religion if it has religious content, harassment can also be based on religion even if religion is not explicitly mentioned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 16--Harassing Conduct Based on Religion--Religion Mentioned</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Mohammed is an Indian-born Muslim employed at a car dealership. Because he takes scheduled prayer breaks during the workday and observes Muslim dietary restrictions, his coworkers are aware of his religious beliefs. Upset by the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, his coworkers and managers began making mocking comments about his religious dietary restrictions and need to pray during the workday. They repeatedly referred to him as "Taliban" or "Arab" and asked him "why don't you just go back where you came from since you believe what you believe?" When Mohammed questioned why it was mandatory for all employees to attend a United Way meeting, his supervisor said: "This is America. That's the way things work over here. This is not the Islamic country where you come from." After this confrontation, the supervisor issued Mohammed a written warning stating that he "was acting like a Muslim extremist" and that the supervisor could not work with him because of his "militant stance." This harassment is based on religion and national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 17--Harassing Conduct Based on Religion--Religion Not Mentioned</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Shoshanna is a Seventh-day Adventist whose work schedule was adjusted to accommodate her Sabbath observance, which begins at sundown each Friday. When Nicholas, the new head of Shoshanna's department, was informed that he must accommodate her, he told a colleague that "anybody who cannot work regular hours should work elsewhere." Nicholas then moved the regular Monday morning staff meetings to late Friday afternoon, repeatedly scheduled staff and client meetings on Friday afternoons, and often marked Shoshanna AWOL when she was not scheduled to work. In addition, Nicholas treated her differently than her colleagues by, for example, denying her training opportunities and loudly berating her with little or no provocation. Although Nicholas did not mention Shoshanna's religion, the evidence shows that his conduct was because of Shoshanna's need for religious accommodation, and therefore was based on religion.</p>
<p class="noindent">The conduct must also be unwelcome:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Conduct is "unwelcome" when "it is uninvited and offensive or unwanted from the standpoint of the employee." It is not necessary in every case for the harassed employee to explicitly voice objection to the conduct (e.g., to confront the alleged harasser contemporaneously) for the conduct to be deemed unwelcome. In addition, since 1993 when the Supreme Court decided <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., and added "subjective hostility" to the hostile work environment analysis, some courts have found that the analysis of "unwelcomeness" and "subjective hostility" overlap. For example, where an employee is visibly upset by repeated mocking use of derogatory terms or comments about his religious beliefs or observance by a colleague, it may be evident that the conduct is unwelcome and also subjectively hostile. This would stand in contrast to a situation where the same two employees were engaged in a consensual conversation that involves a spirited debate of religious views, but neither employee indicates to the other, or to the employer, that he or she is upset by it. For a discussion on reporting to the employer, <span class="Italic">see infra</span> &#x00A7; 12-III B.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The distinction between welcome and unwelcome conduct is especially important in the religious context in situations involving proselytizing to employees who have not invited such conduct. Where a religious employee attempts to persuade another employee of the correctness of his or her belief, the conduct may or may not be welcome. When an employee expressly objects to particular religious expression, unwelcomeness is evident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 18--Unwelcome Conduct</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Beth's colleague, Bill, repeatedly talked to her at work about her prospects for salvation. For several months, she did not object and discussed the matter with him. When he persisted even after she told him that he had "crossed the line" and should stop having non-work-related conversations with her, the conduct was clearly unwelcome.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., at b.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, as with other forms of harassment, the conduct must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. Not all religious-based conduct rises to that level:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harassment is actionable if, as a whole, the conduct is "sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abusive working environment.'" As the Supreme Court explained with respect to Title VII in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. at 21:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive--is beyond Title VII's purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim's employment, and there is no Title VII violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, harassing conduct based on the employee's religion is actionable when it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively and subjectively hostile work environment. A hostile work environment claim may encompass any hostile conduct that affects the complainant's work environment, including employer conduct that may be independently actionable. Whether a reasonable person would perceive the conduct as abusive turns on common sense and context, looking at the totality of the circumstances. All of the alleged incidents must be "considered cumulatively in order to obtain a realistic view of the work environment." Relevant factors "may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or merely an offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." But "no single factor is required."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 19--Reasonable Person Perceives Conduct to Be Hostile</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The president of Printing Corp. regularly mocked and berated an employee who asked for Sundays off to attend Mass. Although he granted the time off, the president teased the employee for refusing to look at a Playboy magazine, called him a "religious freak," and used vulgar sexual language when speaking to or about the employee. He mocked him for "following the Pope around" and made sexual comments about the Virgin Mary. A reasonable person could perceive this to be a religiously hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To "alter the conditions of employment," conduct need not cause economic or psychological harm. It also need not impair work performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or impede their advancement. The presence of one or more of these factors would buttress the claim, but is not required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, Title VII is not a "'general civility code,'" and does not render all insensitive or offensive comments, petty slights, and annoyances illegal. Isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not rise to the level of illegality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 20--Insensitive Comments Not Enough to Constitute Hostile Environment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Marvin is an Orthodox Jew who was hired as a radio show host. When he started work, a coworker, Stacy, pointed to his yarmulke and asked, "Will your headset fit over that?" On a few occasions, Stacy made other remarks about the yarmulke, such as: "Nice hat. Is that a beanie?" and "Do they come in different colors?" Although the coworker's comments about his yarmulke were insensitive, they were not, standing alone, sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment for Marvin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 21--Isolated Comments Not Enough to Constitute Hostile Environment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Bob, a supervisor, occasionally allowed spontaneous and voluntary prayers by employees during office meetings. During one meeting, he referenced Bible passages related to "slothfulness" and "work ethics." Amy complained that Bob's comments and the few instances of allowing voluntary prayers during office meetings created a hostile environment. The comments did not create an actionable harassment claim. They were not severe, and because they occurred infrequently, they were not sufficiently pervasive to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_927"></span>Severity and pervasiveness need not both be present, and they operate inversely. The more severe the harassment, the less frequently the incidents need to recur. At the same time, incidents that may not, individually, be severe may become unlawful if they occur frequently or in proximity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a single incident will seldom create an unlawfully hostile environment, it may do so if it is unusually severe, such as where it involves a physical threat.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 22--One Instance of Physically Threatening Conduct Sufficiently Severe</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ihsaan is a Muslim. Shortly after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Ihsaan came to work and found the words "I'm tired of you Muslims. You're all terrorists! We will avenge the victims!! Your life is next!" scrawled in red marker on his office door. Because of the timing of the statement and the direct physical threat, this incident, alone, is sufficiently severe to create an objectively hostile and/or abusive work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 23--Isolated Practices Not Enough to Constitute Hostile Environment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Tran owns a restaurant serving Asian-fusion cuisine. The restaurant is decorated with Vietnamese art depicting scenes from traditional religious stories. Tran keeps a shrine of Buddha in the corner by the cash register and likes to play traditional Vietnamese music and chants. Linda has worked as a waitress in the restaurant for a few months and complains that she feels harassed by the religious symbols and music. As long as Tran does not discriminate on the basis of religion in his hiring or supervision of employees, the religious expression would likely not amount to practices that are severe or pervasive enough to constitute a hostile work environment based on religion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 24--Persistent Offensive Remarks Constitute Hostile Environment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Betty is a Mormon. During a disagreement regarding a joint project, a coworker, Julian, tells Betty that she doesn't know what she is talking about and that she should "go back to Salt Lake City." When Betty subsequently proposes a different approach to the project, Julian tells her that her suggestions are as "flaky" as he would expect from "her kind." When Betty tries to resolve the conflict, Julian tells her that if she is uncomfortable working with him, she can either ask to be transferred, or she can "just pray about it." Over the next six months, Julian regularly makes similar negative references to Betty's religion. His persistent offensive remarks create a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Religious expression that is directed at an employee can become severe or pervasive, whether or not the content is intended to be insulting or abusive. Thus, for example, persistently reiterating atheist views to a religious employee who has asked that it stop can create a hostile environment, just as persistently proselytizing to an atheist employee or an employee with different religious beliefs who has asked that it stop can create a hostile work environment. The extent to which the expression is directed at the employee bringing the Title VII claim can be relevant to determining whether or when a reasonable employee would have perceived it to be hostile. That said, even conduct that is not directed at an employee can transform a work environment into a hostile or abusive one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A coworker having a difference of opinion with an employee's religious views does not establish a hostile work environment when there is no other evidence of harassment. This would include when a coworker disagrees with the religious views that an employee expresses outside of the workplace, for example on social media, when there is no evidence it is linked to the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 25--No Hostile Environment from Comments That Are Not Abusive and Not Directed at Complaining Employee</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While eating lunch in the company cafeteria, Clarence often overhears conversations between his coworkers Dharma and Khema. Dharma, a Buddhist, is discussing meditation techniques with Khema, who is interested in Buddhism. Clarence strongly believes that meditation is an occult practice that offends him, and he complains to their supervisor that Dharma and Khema are creating a hostile environment for him. Such conversations taking place in the cafeteria do not constitute severe or pervasive religious harassment of Clarence, particularly given that they do not insult other religions and they were not directed at him.</p>
<p class="noindent">In finding that a Deputy U.S. Marshal was subjected to a hostile environment based on race and religion, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia applied the same analysis used to evaluate cases of sexual harassment hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Turner v. Barr</span>, 811 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1993), the plaintiff, a white Jewish male, contended that he was subjected to a hostile environment. Just as with cases involving sexual harassment, the court found that the plaintiff was not required to show that all of the incidents had overtly racial or religious overtones. As the court in <span class="Italic">Turner</span> noted, 811 F. Supp. at 2-5:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII prohibits employers from creating or condoning a hostile work environment based upon incidents of harassment or unequal treatment. <span class="Italic">See Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986). A single incident, without more, does not give rise to a cause of action; a Plaintiff must show "a pattern or practice of harassment" in order to fall under the protection of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 641 F.2d 934, 943 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1981). However, the harassment need not take the form of incidents with clearly racial or religious overtones; "any harassment or other unequal treatment of an employee" caused by the race or religion of the employee may create a violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 1985). An employer will be liable for discriminatory conditions under two circumstances: (1) if the harasser is the employer or one of its agents, or supervisory personnel, <span class="Italic">Bundy</span>, 641 F.2d at 943; <span class="Italic">Sparks v. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc.</span>, 830 F.2d 1554 (11th Cir. 1987), or (2) the employer knew or should have known of harassment caused by co-workers, but failed to take corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Juarez v. Ameritech Mobile Communications, Inc.</span>, 957 F.2d 317 (7th Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither of the parties disagrees with these principles of law. Rather, the Defendant claims that the facts found by this Court in its November 25, 1992, Opinion, do not satisfy these legal standards. Upon review, however, the Court must conclude that the factual findings clearly indicate that the Defendant knew or should have known, both directly and indirectly, about the harassment to which the Plaintiff was subjected. Consequently, the Defendant is liable for the hostile work environment which it created and condoned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Court's Memorandum Opinion of November 25, 1992, set forth the Court's findings of fact in this case. The Court found a number of incidents had occurred which indicated that the Plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment. The Defendant's current motion claims that these incidents cannot be attributed to the Defendant as employer because the Defendant and its supervisors were unaware of the incidents. However, the evidence indicates that the Plaintiff's supervisors were aware of most of the incidents and participated in at least one of the incidents. Although the incidents are set out in full in the November 25, 1992, Opinion, the Court will briefly restate them here to show how they indicate the existence of a hostile work environment. The Court notes, as it did in its November 25, 1992, Opinion, that it found the Plaintiff to be a very credible witness whose memory and demeanor impressed the Court as being complete and sincere and who presented more than a preponderance of the evidence to sustain his burden of proof as to each of the elements of his claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;The Plaintiff was required to suffer reference to the Holocaust by one of the supervisory Deputies. The Deputy related a joke about the Holocaust. The Deputy stated that the cost of Germany's reconstruction after World War II was high because of its high gas bill during the War. The Defendant concedes that this joke may be taken by the Court as an indication that the Plaintiff suffered discrimination on account of his religion. Further, because the joke was made by a supervisor, the Defendant can be held responsible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Defendant claims, however, that from this single incident, no inference may be drawn of a hostile work environment. If this incident were isolated, the Defendant would be correct. However, the Court may take this incident, along with the others attributable to the Defendant, as evidence of a hostile work environment because it was not a single, isolated event. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. Duncan-Huggins, Ltd.</span>, 727 F.2d 1225, 1236 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (deciding how much weight to give a particular incident is a question for the fact-finder).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;The Plaintiff was denied the opportunity to work overtime in an amount comparable to many of the Deputies in his office who were not white or Jewish. The assignment of overtime is a supervisory function, and the Defendant does not dispute that knowledge of disparities in overtime hours can be attributed to supervisory personnel in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;In the oriGINAl squad room, the white Deputies had desks at the back of the office, and the African-American Deputies referred to the section as Georgetown. When the Plaintiff was sitting at another desk, he was instructed by one of the African-American Deputies to "get back to Georgetown."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Defendant concedes that it is likely that "supervisory personnel were aware that the white Deputies sat together." Defendant's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Alter and Amend Judgment, at 6 n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Defendant claims that it is not responsible for the segregation because the Plaintiff did not inform his supervisors about the problem. However, the Plaintiff need not inform his supervisors of situations which they "knew or should have known." It is true that employers may not be held responsible when they "could not have known of the possible problem." <span class="Italic">Davis v. Monsanto Chem. Co.</span>, 858 F.2d 345, 350 (8th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 490 U.S. 1110, 109 S. Ct. 3166, 104 L. Ed.2d 1028 (1989). However, an employer may not blindly ignore situations for which it can be "charged with actual or constructive knowledge." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this case, the fact that the white Deputies were huddled together at the back of the <span id="Page_928"></span>room could not escape the notice of a reasonably vigilant employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;The Plaintiff was also subject to personal abuse in the office. A poster was put up anonymously with the Plaintiff's photograph superimposed next to a set of keys and the word "Turnkey." The nickname caught on and the Plaintiff was constantly referred to by that name. He even received memos addressed in handwriting by this name. The Defendant concedes that members of the management staff were aware of the posting of the nickname.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Defendant claims that, because the nickname does not explicitly refer to the Plaintiff's religion or race, it cannot serve as evidence of a hostile work environment. Nevertheless, the poster clearly indicates the abuse to which the Plaintiff was subject. Moreover, evidence of harassment need not have explicitly racial or religious overtones. The Plaintiff need only show that the harassment would not have occurred but for the Plaintiff's race or religion. <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 1985). In this case, the Plaintiff has carried his burden and has shown that the supervisory staff was aware that this harassment was occurring.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5)&#x2003;The Plaintiff came forward with other evidence that he was subjected to harassment because of his religion and race. When the Plaintiff was assigned to collect for a charity drive, he was subjected to comments about the appropriate nature of the assignment, because Jews were supposedly skilled in dealing with money. On another occasion, when the Plaintiff was assisting in the execution of a writ at a jeweler's store, the Plaintiff was told that he should have been running the store. The clear and indisputable thrust of the comment was that being a jeweler was something for Jews. Furthermore, in the course of conversations, white Deputies were referred to as "white asses," and "white boys." Also, the Plaintiff was told by an African-American Deputy that the Plaintiff should get his "white ass out of the office" because "this is a black office, for blacks, supervised by blacks."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Defendant has pointed out, these incidents have not been linked to particular supervisory personnel. However, the Court is free, as the finder of fact, to make the reasonable inference that the number and severity of these events is such as to bolster the Court's conclusion that a hostile work environment did exist and it is more probable than not that the supervisory staff was aware that the Plaintiff was a victim of harassment and abuse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(6)&#x2003;The ultimate incident giving rise to this action was the discipline or seven day suspension of the Plaintiff for the escape of a now-deceased prisoner, Kenneth Ashby, on January 16, 1990. As indicated, an investigation conducted some eight months later and after the prisoner had died was the alleged basis for which the Plaintiff was suspended from duty for seven days. While the Court does not rule on the accuracy of the finding that the Plaintiff was responsible for the prisoner's escape, the Court does find that the procedure for the investigation was deficient in many regards. First, in spite of the serious nature of the incident, the Plaintiff was not interviewed until about ten months after the incident. Furthermore, he was given no opportunity to review what had happened before being interviewed. Also, the final report was full of typographical errors and demonstrates a lack of regard for detail and precision. The Investigator testified that he did not view the courtroom from which the prisoner was said to have made his escape. He also stated that he did not investigate a number of other relevant matters as well. The Defendant does not dispute that the decision to discipline the Plaintiff was based solely on this report.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another individual (an African American) received a "letter of instruction" after the investigation. The letter is not a disciplinary action and nothing appears in this individual's record. The Defendant's explanation as to why this individual was only "cautioned" about his alleged role in the escape of Kenneth Ashby was unconvincing, in light of the other incidents of harassment to which the Plaintiff was subjected. Thus, the Court reasonably concluded that the Plaintiff was "singled out" for discipline, at least implicitly, as a result of the repressive working atmosphere, based on his race and religion. The Plaintiff has shown, based upon the previous episodes of harassment, that a hostile work environment caused the investigation and subsequent punishment to be handled differently than they would have been, if the person under investigation had not been the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The incidents listed above clearly demonstrate that the conduct of the Plaintiff's supervisors and fellow employees was "sufficiently pervasive to amount to harassment and create[d] a hostile or offensive work environment...." <span class="Italic">Broderick v. Ruder</span>, 685 F. Supp. 1269, 1277 (D.D.C. 1988). The "totality of the circumstances" indicates that the Plaintiff was subject to harassment on the basis of his race and religion and that the harassment occurred with the knowledge of the Defendant and the supervisory staff. Both the frequency of the events and their severity justify a finding of a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">Vance v. Southern Bell Tel. and Tel. Co.</span>, 863 F.2d 1503, 1511 (11th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the court's analysis does not really deviate in any significant way from the analysis of a sexual harassment hostile environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with cases involving race and national origin, discussed below, religious harassment that is historically charged will not need to be particularly pervasive in order to be considered unlawful. For example, in <span class="Italic">Keller v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A03997 (2000), a case involving a Jewish complainant, the Commission found that the allegation that swastikas were left in the complainant's cubicle and on his name tag in a common area one day was sufficient to state a claim of hostile environment harassment. The Commission noted that the claim "involves a symbol of hatred that is so egregious that it should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case, the Commission found that the complainant stated a claim of hostile environment harassment based on religion when he alleged that a manager displayed a "lighted star" above the Operations Manager's desk. In <span class="Italic">Siegel v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120072033 (2007), the Commission noted that the desk was the focal point for office operations and that the complainant alleged that management stated that the star "represented guiding followers to Jesus." The situation should be contrasted with the Commission's case law and White House Guidelines on display of religious items in personal work space. See discussion in Chapter 13 in subsection on "<a href="0100-2023-22-133.html#sec13-132">Expression in Workplace</a>." Where a supervisor allegedly left Bibles and religious fliers on desks and sent an email with Bible references and a statement suggesting those who didn't agree would be "weeded out," this was sufficient to state a claim of hostile environment harassment. <span class="Italic">Bowlin v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120072957 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Mason v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120082890 (2008), the Commission found that a single instance where the complainant alleged that a comment written on the workroom floor--"Dachau work will set you free and the rich richer"--was sufficient severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment. Just as it has with certain racial epithets, the Commission found that the reference to a concentration camp was a "highly offensive" slur or comment that rose to the level of setting forth a hostile environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Though also a one-time incident, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lashawna C. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0720160020 (2017), found a supervisor's referral to himself as a "Hebrew slave" to a subordinate of Jewish faith was particularly egregious and had little trouble concluding that the comment was equally unwelcome:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Again, context was considered in <span class="Italic">Lashawna C. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0720160020 (2017), where the Commission found that the use of the term "Hebrew slave" by a supervisor to his subordinate, who was of the Jewish faith, was "inherently unwelcome":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we first find that Complainant is a member of a statutorily protected class because she is a member of the Jewish faith. Regarding prong 2, it is undisputed that on February 24, 2011, Complainant and S1 exchanged emails about Complainant's work hours and schedule. During the exchange, Complainant stated that government employees generally work shorter hours than private sector employees, and she was "working like a civilian." In response, S1 stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Wow...then I must be a damn fool...cause I've been working like a Hebrew slave the last 9 years and don't have enough time to take off...at least somebody got it right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we note that the word "Hebrew" is often used to refer to Semitic persons who identify as descendants of Abraham, the biblical patriarch of Judaism. Collins English Dictionary Complete and Unabridged 2012 Digital Edition, available online at <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hebrew">http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hebrew</a>. Moreover, when used to generally refer to contemporary Jewish persons, it is sometimes considered archaic or offensive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Coupled with the word "slave," the term "Hebrew slave" is particularly negative and offensive when used so flippantly. As such, we find that the use of the term "Hebrew slave" is inherently unwelcome when uttered in this particular context, especially when communicating with a Jewish person. There is no evidence that Complainant welcomed such a comment. Therefore, we find that S1's comment was unwelcome. With regard to prong 3, it is apparent that the term "Hebrew slave" pertains specifically to Jewish persons, and as such, is inherently based on religion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding prong 4, we note that in evaluating whether the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment, the harasser's conduct should be evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at 6 (Mar. 8, 1994). In this case, Complainant testified that she is a member of a religious group that has experienced brutal persecution and bigotry, from Russian pogroms to the murder of millions by the Nazi regime. Complainant further stated that some of her family members were placed in death camps and executed during the Holocaust; she is named after a relative who was executed; and her father fled Europe and spent a great amount of time trying to recover his family possessions after the Holocaust.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S I testified that during the relevant time period, he was aware that Complainant is Jewish because she requested leave for religious purposes, but be used the term "Hebrew slave" in his email to her because this was a "common term that's used to reflect individuals who work with little means to produce great things." He further testified that he understood that the tens related to the trials Jewish people endured while in bondage in Egypt, as recounted in the Bible. The Agency maintains that <span id="Page_929"></span>S1's comment was not severe enough to constitute harassment because he applied the term to himself, instead of to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of this matter, we note that the Commission has found that under certain circumstances a single or limited number of epithets or slurs may constitute harassment under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Brooks v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996) (in some circumstances, the single use of a racial epithet or slur that "dredge[s] up the entire history of racial discrimination in this country" may be enough to constitute a hostile work environment). In this case, S1 made the comment in an email to Complainant, and S1 knew that Complainant is Jewish. Although S1 only made such a comment once, the comment packed a painful, potent punch. Specifically, S1's comment made light of the long and painful history of Jewish persecution and genocide. Moreover, the comment was especially personal for S1 because it dredged up memories of how her family was targeted for systematically murder, incarceration, and deportation during the Holocaust. Complainant testified that S1's comments made her "incredibly sad," which we find to be a reasonable response to S1's actions. The fact that S1 may have intended his comment to be a joke or a cliche does not soften the offense any more here than it would if he had uttered an equally offensive racial slur. We determine that a reasonable person in Complainant's circumstances would find that S1's comment was severe enough to create a hostile work environment based on her religion. Thus, we find that the AJ properly found that Complainant was subjected to religious harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Sturman v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120072361 (2007), found that the complainant had failed to demonstrate a hostile environment based on religion where he complained about a Christmas display, as well as the display of Christian literature. In <span class="Italic">Sturman</span>, the Commission found that the Christmas display was largely secular in nature, and was not in an area that the complainant frequented:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that complainant has shown that he meets the first prong of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of harassment, in that he is a member of a statutorily protected class. He is claiming harassment based on religion, and notes that he is Jewish. Complainant also meets the second prong of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in that he is alleging that the atmosphere to which he was subjected, the decorations for the Christmas holiday and the placement of religious pamphlets around the Administrative Office, was unwelcome. It matters not at this stage of the analysis that he had not made management aware of his discomfort with the decorations and pamphlets. Complainant claims that these displays of the religious pamphlets were offensive to him, as they promoted Christianity exclusively. He also claims that he was offended by the Christmas holiday decorations as the Jewish holiday of Chanukah also fell on December 25 in 2005 and there were no displays of Chanukah decorations accompanying the tree, lights, garland, etc. The third prong is satisfied in that the decorations are commonly associated with a Christian holiday, and the pamphlets were promoting the Christian faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's case fails on the final criteria of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, whether the atmosphere had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the work environment and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. In other words, was it severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. We find that it was not. With respect to the Christmas decorations, based on the pictures submitted by complainant, we note that the decorations were predominantly secular in nature--a Christmas tree, wreath, icicle lights, garland and Santa Claus. The tree seems to have had a number of ornaments which featured an angel, but the overall display was not religious. There was not a nativity scene, nor was there any other decoration which was religious in nature. Although Christmas trees are commonly associated with the Christian holiday of Christmas, we note that it has become a prevalent practice for many people and businesses to decorate evergreen trees, and feature lights and garland, as an expression of "the winter holiday spirit" in a very secular sense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the religious pamphlets, we find that their mere presence is not enough to establish a severe or pervasive hostile work environment based on complainant's religion. We note that complainant did not primarily work in the Administrative Office at the facility as he performed his duties in the Air Traffic Control Tower. He occasionally had cause to visit the Administrative Office when he was going to the union office "in the administrative area" where he would perform his duties as the treasurer for the local union. However, he did not spend the, majority of his work time in the Administrative Office and so was not exposed to the Christian materials or Christmas decorations for the entire duration of his work day.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the aftermath of September 11th, the Department of Homeland Security offered a course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center entitled, "Arab Names/Arab Culture." In <span class="Italic">Rana v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0720060056.txt">07200600561</a> (2007), the Commission had little trouble determining that the course created a hostile environment for a Muslin attendee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her decision, the AJ found, among other things, that during a course known as "Arab Names/Arab Culture," the instructor distributed a handout to the class entitled "Core Beliefs of Islam: The Mindset of Violence." The conclusion of the handout stated that, "The fundamentalist Muslims, these are the ones who perpetrate terrorism. They have long beards and head coverings. Their goal is to practice Islam as Muhammad did. Though we call them radicals, they are practicing true Islam." The AJ further found that the instructor (I1) made many remarks about Muslims throughout the presentation and confirmed at the hearing that he told the class, "The goal of a Muslim is to convert you and kill you" and that "The Koran does not mention a God of love." Additionally, the AJ considered that I1 told the students that he (I1) personally "hold[s] American Muslims in a little higher esteem [than Muslims abroad]." The AJ noted that complainant was not the only student who felt I1's comments were inappropriate and had the purpose of degrading and demonizing followers of Islam. The evidence showed that the agency had received complaints regarding this course from prior students. Indeed, complainant's classmates complained as well. On February 23, 2005, eleven out of the fifteen members of the class submitted a letter to the Director of the training program (D1), requesting that he eliminate I1's class altogether, calling it "repulsive." The letter from the class to D1 stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Our reasons for making this request is that we found the content, most of it, to be filled with stereotyping, unsubstantiated allegations, unrelated information and personal bias. [I1] continuously emphasized that all people of the Muslim faith would exhibit this particular behavior and share the one common goal of either converting everyone to their religion or eliminating them, in essence, they all had terrorist characteristics.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ further found that as a result of complainant asking I1 about his comments during class and confronting I1 about the allegedly factually inaccurate and damaging stereotypical course material, I2, who had observed the class and was involved in the development of the course content, drafted an official memorandum to I2's supervisor, on agency letterhead, suggesting that complainant be investigated for possible ties to terrorist organizations. The AJ found that nothing in the record showed that this memorandum had been rescinded or was in fact destroyed. Indeed, agency witnesses could not say for certain whether this memorandum was distributed to anyone other than I2's supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ's decision is supported by substantial record evidence. We find that substantial evidence supports complainant's assertion that his religion was Muslim. Specifically, we find that complainant attended a mandatory course during which the instructor made numerous statements and comments offensive to complainant based on his religion (Muslim) and national origin (Pakistan) and that a reasonable person would have been so offended. We further find that although complainant informed I1 that some of his comments were inaccurate and that other comments were inappropriate and offensive based on the purpose of the course, I1 persisted in his presentation of course material that was later found by the agency's own internal investigation, to be "so poorly conceived that it often reinforced some of the worst stereotypes of Arab and Muslim culture and values."</p>
<p class="noindent">As with other forms of harassment, the conduct need not be in the complainant's presence for it to create a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Goldstein v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120092772 (2009), the complainant, a law enforcement officer, alleged that he heard one coworker say to another, "Heads up, Goldstein is in the building." He further alleged that he learned that another coworker had referred to him as "a stupid Jew" or a "motherfucking Jew" and was not disciplined. Finally, he alleged that management told him he did not have a case and failed to properly investigate his claims. The Commission found that the agency erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim. In finding that the complainant had alleged sufficiently severe or pervasive conduct to support a hostile environment claim, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Goldstein</span>, also took into account the complainant's position as a law enforcement officer:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we note that complainant states that he feels that RMO is biased against him for failing to fully investigate the matter as a hostile work environment matter. On appeal. complainant explains that "Federal Law Enforcement officers depend on each other to back and protect one another in dangerous, even life threatening situations." Appellate Brief, p. 2. Complainant says that the comments and the indifference of some colleagues and management to the comments make it difficult for him to trust his life to his colleagues and thus create a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See id</span>, p. 3-4. Given the above. we find that the allegations presented, as a whole, state a claim of hostile work environment based on religion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although communications relating to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender community may be insulting or upsetting to an employee, they are not sufficiently severe to be considered harassment. <span class="Italic">See Humberto P. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120170528 (2017) (involving allegations of religious discrimination when an announcement concerning an LGBT pride <span id="Page_930"></span>program was made over the loudspeaker and when the complainant received a "dismissive and hostile" response from the agency Director to his letter that raised concerns about "celebrating and promoting the sexuality of certain individuals in our workplace").</p>
<p class="noindent">Religious harassment by a coworker while off-duty, like all other bases, must negatively affect the complainant's work environment to be actionable. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Sang B. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120152717 (2017), where the complainant alleged that, while off-duty at a pub, a coworker (E1) "began an unruly and aggressive interaction, wherein he pointed to Complainant, said his name and stated '[t]hat's a Jew name, right? Want a beer?'" The complainant reported having told the coworker that he was out of line to which the coworker said that it was "no big fucking deal" and that his son was dating a "Jew-girl." Later in the night, the coworker threatened to beat the complainant "to a bloody pulp." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Sang B</span>. concluded that the interaction was not severe or pervasive, considering the following testimonial evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Testimonial evidence from other witnesses to the incident presents a mixed picture. While all the witnesses agreed that E1 was clearly intoxicated, one witness, E2, a Special Agent, Deputy Division Chief, testified that both Complainant and E1 were intoxicated. Moreover, E2 indicated that he first joined Complainant by the Pool around 1:30 that afternoon and that Complainant had been drinking most of the day. He further indicated that Complainant and E2 had been purchasing alcoholic beverages for each other and that both were making jokes and comments prior to the outburst that resulted in the instant hostile environment claim. While several witnesses agreed that E1 told Complainant that he could "kick his ass," E2 saw it more as "a parting shot" "made in anger," as opposed to a threat. Also, several witnesses stated that E1 splashed beer on them as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">But what seemed to win the day for the agency in <span class="Italic">Sang B</span>. was that there was no evidence that the interaction affected the complainant's work environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, the Commission finds that the incidents alleged do not constitute discriminatory harassment that violates Title VII. Complainant simply did not establish that he was subjected to conduct that was sufficiently severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. In so finding, the Commission notes that EEO laws are not a civility code. Rather, they forbid "only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim's employment." <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Serv., Inc</span>., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An abusive or hostile working environment exists "when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim's employment." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., supra</span>. Here, the evidence failed to demonstrate that the working environment was permeated with "discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult." There was sufficient evidence in the record to show that this was an after-work incident. While we in no way condone the behavior of E1, there is no evidence that his behavior was such that it altered the terms or conditions of Complainant's employment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Sang B</span>. also highlights the importance of requesting a hearing when there is conflicting evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that there is conflicting testimony as to the full nature of the dispute between Complainant and E1, and the extent to which Complainant may have been intoxicated and contributed to the altercation with E1. Had Complainant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge, the Administrative Judge could have made credibility determinations based on witness testimony. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> EEO MD-110, at Ch. 7. As Complainant did not request a hearing, we do not have the benefit of an Administrative Judge's credibility determinations after a hearing; therefore, we can only evaluate the facts based on the weight of the evidence presented to us. Accordingly, we find that Complainant has not established his claim of harassment on the basis of religion.</p>
