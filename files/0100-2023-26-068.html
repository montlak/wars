<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-67"><span class="space">m.</span> Questions or Comments Made Pertaining to EEO Complaints</h5>
<p class="noindent">Supervisors, managers, and other agency officials should tread lightly when remarking on the EEO process or existing or potential EEO complaints. "Comments that, on their face, discourage an employee from participating in the EEO process violate the letter and spirit of the EEOC regulations and evidence a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the law." <span class="Italic">Larraine D. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2021001090 (2022); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Charlie K. v. EEOC</span>, 0120142315 (2017); <span class="Italic">Binseel v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05970584 (1998) (comment made that filing an EEO suit was "wrong way to go about getting a promotion" constituted reprisal); <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072908 (2009) (<span class="Italic">per se</span> violation where supervisor mentioned EEO complaints had been filed and said, "What goes around, comes around"); <span class="Italic">Woolf v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120083727 (2009) (<span class="Italic">per se</span> violation found when a labor management specialist told complainant, "as a friend," that her EEO claim would polarize the office).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even comments that are not "on their face" or at all meant to dissuade an employee from participating in the EEO process can be found retaliatory. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Larraine D. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2021001090 (2022), found that a supervisor's protestations that his comments were not meant to be retaliatory did not change the effect that they had:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Regarding claim (f), Complainant asserts that during a meeting with S2, he inquired as to whether she would file an EEO Complaint. When she first reported her harassment allegations, S2 offered to move her to a new team and allegedly told her it would be difficult to prove discrimination against S1. Complainant further alleges that S2 stated that his offer to move her to a new team would be unavailable if she filed an EEO complaint. Complainant stated she felt pressured and harassed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">S2 acknowledged that during the meeting, he asked if Complainant planned to file a formal complaint. He noted that after their initial meeting when she reported the alleged harassment, she requested 24 hours to let management know her decision regarding a transfer but never informed them of her decision. S2 stated he also encouraged Complainant to talk things out with S1, but she declined. He offered her a transfer again, but she declined. S2 stated that Complainant stated she wanted S1 to be punished for what he had done and that she was seeking compensation for her suffering. S2 stated that since it was clear she planned to file a complaint, he told her that she would continue working for S1 and everyone should remain professional. S2 stated, "I don't recall saying the transfer is off the table although that would have been the effect since I could no longer transfer her once she filed a formal complaint."</p>
<p class="noindent">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that S2's inquiries into Complainant's intentions regarding her harassment claims were reasonably likely to deter Complainant from engaging in the EEO process. The discussions Complainant had with S2 were not in the nature of official settlement discussions. We conclude that S2's statements about the transfers, even if well intentioned and not meant to pressure Complainant (we make no finding about the intent), coupled with his inquiry as to whether Complainant would file a formal complaint are sufficient to reasonably likely deter a person from engaging in the EEO process, Thus, Complainant has established reprisal by a preponderance of the evidence as to claim (f).</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Torrez v. Social Security Administration</span>, 05950947 (1998), the Commission found that the potential chilling effect of statements made by the agency's EEO director during a speech were sufficient to support a claim. As the Commission in <span class="Italic">Torrez</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following is an outline of the material facts. On November 2, 1994, appellant filed a formal EEO complaint, alleging that the agency <span id="Page_1516"></span>discriminated against him on the bases of sex (male), national origin (Hispanic), age (49), and reprisal (prior EEO activity) when on April 23, 1994, the agency's Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (the Director) addressed a conference of the Denver Hispanic Affairs Advisory Committee (the Committee) and made comments such as: a person who files a complaint against the agency is "kissing [his/her] career goodbye"; filing a complaint is very expensive because the agency will "fight like hell"; winning had nothing to do with the merits of the complaint; and a complainant better hire a lawyer because s/he is taking on the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Among the fifty-one (51) people in attendance were several individuals, including appellant, who either had EEO complaints pending or had recently received decisions from the agency. Appellant perceived the comments to be a threat of reprisal against employees who sought to use the EEO process. Although several other individuals filed complaints regarding this matter, the Commission's records indicate that the complaints were processed separately by the agency. After the agency issued separate final decisions: one complainant decided not to file an appeal; three filed appeals, but, after entering into settlement agreements with the agency, withdrew their appeals; and one chose to file a civil action against the agency. Therefore, with regard to this matter, appellant's is the only complaint that is still subject to our review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant's RTR meets the criterion of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.407(c)(2). It is therefore the decision of the Commission to grant the request. The previous decision found that the complaint did not state a claim because the Director's statements were mere remarks unaccompanied by a concrete action and thus appellant was not aggrieved. Contrary to the previous decision, the Commission finds that appellant is, in effect, alleging that the Director's comments at the conference constituted an interference with the EEO process. Although the Director did not deny making some of the statements attributed to him, he contended that his remarks were taken out of context.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(g) provides, in pertinent part, that an EEO counselor shall not attempt in any way to restrain an aggrieved person from filing a complaint. Additionally, we note that in <span class="Italic">Crespo v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920842 (September 17, 1993), the Commission held that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency has a continuing duty to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity in its policies and practices. This duty extends to every aspect of agency personnel policy and practice in the employment, advancement, and treatment of employees. Agencies shall, among other things, insure that managers and supervisors perform in such a manner as to effectuate continuing affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that the alleged comments of the Director, rather than encouraging the realization of equal employment opportunity in the workforce, could have a potentially chilling effect on the ultimate tool that employees have to enforce equal employment opportunity--the filing of an EEO complaint. Thus, the Commission finds that appellant's complaint states a claim of interference in the EEO process. In light of the foregoing, the Commission shall remand the matter to the agency for investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Leora R. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120180736 (2019) (supervisor reminding a new probationary employee of her employment status and telling her to stop raising claims of race discrimination was likely to deter EEO activity); <span class="Italic">Octavio C. v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120150460 (2017) (supervisor's comments to the complainant that the EEO process was probably not "the most enjoyable path for anyone involved" and that the complainant "pulled the trigger too soon" by filing an EEO complaint were reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in the EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere comment from one supervisor to another that the complainant had filed an EEO complaint was found reasonably likely to deter an employee from exercising his or her rights under the EEO statutes in <span class="Italic">Jazmine F. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120162132 (2018). In that case, the complainant's supervisor advised the complainant's temporary detail supervisor that the complainant had filed an EEO complaint. The agency contended that the comment was made merely in an effort to reach a settlement by finding the complainant a permanent assignment. The Commission found that contention pretextual in <span class="Italic">Jazmine F</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the Director inquired first about Complainant's performance, and subsequently inquired about whether there was a permanent assignment available for her. When S2 advised that there were not any available vacant positions, the Director then informed her that she was seeking the reassignment as a potential EEO settlement offer. Given that the Director was told that there was no vacant position available for Complainant, we find no justification for disclosing Complainant's prior EEO activity to S2. In other words, we find that no further conversation on this matter was necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have held that the actions of a supervisor are discriminatory based on reprisal where the supervisor acts to intimidate an employee and interfere with his or her EEO activity in any manner. <span class="Italic">See Binseel v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970584 (Oct. 8, 1998); <span class="Italic">Yubuki v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920778 (June 4, 1993); <span class="Italic">see also Lindsey v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05980410 (Nov. 4, 1999). The statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based upon a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter a complainant or others from engaging in protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Shell Oil Co</span>., 519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997). On these facts, we find that the Director's decision to mention Complainant's prior EEO complaint to S2 was retaliatory because it would have deterred a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity. Nothing in the record supports the Director's position that it was necessary to mention Complainant's prior EEO complaint to S2 when inquiring about a vacant position. As noted above, the conversation between the Director and S2 occurred only because Complainant engaged in protected EEO activity, and we find that this conversation by design would have the effect of intimidating and/or interfering with Complainant's EEO activity. We further find that the Director's decision to advise S2 that Complainant was actively involved in settling an EEO complaint would be reasonably likely to deter an employee from exercising their rights under the EEO statutes, and therefore was clearly in violation of the anti-retaliation provisions of our regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even a non-verbal cue coupled with a vague comment rose to the level of reprisal in <span class="Italic">Mirtha H. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 2020005237 (2022). Reversing the AJ's summary judgment order in favor of the agency, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the undisputed evidence in the record shows that Complainant's supervisor told two of Complainant's coworkers that their telework schedule was being reduced, from three days to two days, because "somebody filed something" and gestured with his head towards Complainant's cubicle. Both of Complainant's coworkers explained that they knew the supervisor was referring to Complainant because Complainant's cubicle was the only one occupied in the direction the supervisor gestured toward. Another of Complainant's coworkers confirmed that she became aware of Complainant's prior EEO complaints because she heard about the supervisor's comment from one of her coworkers. Moreover, we note that the Agency does not dispute that the supervisor made the comment, and even issued the supervisor a letter of warning because of the remark.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency asserts, initially, that the supervisor's comment did not refer to Complainant specifically nor specify that an EEO complaint was filed. The Agency also contends that the matter is closed because it already issued a letter of warning to the supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency argues that because Complainant acknowledges that her relationship with her coworkers was not negatively affected by the comment, she cannot establish that she was subjected to a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's arguments are without merit. First, the implications of the supervisor's statement that "somebody filed something," while gesturing to Complainant's cubicle, are clear. The coworkers to whom the comment was made clearly understood that the supervisor was referring to Complainant and determined that he was likely referring to an EEO complaint. We find that the supervisor's comment could dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See Michael L. v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 202003199 (May 19, 2021). Moreover, the Agency's assertion that Complainant's relationship with her coworkers does not appear to have been harmed, may relate to the issue of damages but has no relevance to the issue of whether the comment constitutes retaliatory harassment. Similarly, the Agency's issuance of a letter of warning to the supervisor is also irrelevant as the letter was the result of a separate internal misconduct investigation for a violation of internal Agency policy and has no bearing on the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. International Boundary and Water Comm</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520130669 (Feb. 11, 2014) (rejecting the agency's argument that it should not be held liable for reprisal because the supervisor who made the retaliatory comment was counseled for his inappropriate behavior). We further note that the evidence in the record indicates that, prior to the misconduct investigation, Complainant's second-line supervisor, the Assistant Director, was told of the supervisor's comment but took no action. Because the undisputed evidence indicates that Complainant's supervisor made a comment that could dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity, we conclude that the Agency subjected Complainant to unlawful retaliation as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01A60100 (2006), the Commission upheld the determination of an administrative judge that a single incident where a supervisor told the complainant that her complaints would be dismissed and that, if she wanted to get ahead, filing complaints would only make it worse for her was an isolated incident and did not have a chilling effect.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1517"></span><span class="Italic">Williams</span> appears to be an aberration, however. In <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A61619 (2006), the Commission found that the complainant stated a claim of reprisal by alleging that a supervisor, during a stand-up talk, stated, "some of you have stuck up for each other who have filed, and that's good, but what you guys have done here goes both ways, and I want you to know, that what comes around, goes around." The Commission found that the comments were reasonably likely to deter someone from filing a complaint. Arguably, the difference between <span class="Italic">Williams</span> and <span class="Italic">Vincent</span> is that the alleged statements in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> were made to one individual, while the alleged statements in <span class="Italic">Vincent</span> were made to a group of individuals. However, it is a distinction that would seem to go to the severity of any violation, rather than whether a violation has been alleged. That <span class="Italic">Williams</span> was incorrectly decided also finds support in <span class="Italic">Switzer v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120062080 (2007), where the Commission upheld a finding of reprisal based on a remark by the complainant's supervisor that his EEO complaints were "unfounded." There is no indication in <span class="Italic">Switzer</span> that the remark was made to a group of people as opposed to the individual complainant. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120150181 (2015) (threatening complainant with a "living hell" if he did not sign retirement papers constituted sufficient harm even where complainant did not sign retirement papers); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120053328 (2007) (supervisor mentioned complaints in three staff meetings).</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on <span class="Italic">Torrez</span>, in <span class="Italic">Emmons v. Secretary of Education</span>, 01985056 (1999), the Commission held that a supervisor's statement, that he would fire anyone who filed an EEO complaint against him, sufficiently raised the prospects of a chilling effect to aggrieve the complainant. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Nurriddin v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 01A23148 (2004) (finding no adverse treatment where the complainant's supervisor made one derogatory comment about EEO complaints, but immediately apologized for the comment).</p>
<p class="noindent">What qualifies as reprisal is so broad, that even well-meaning advice may state a claim of reprisal. In <span class="Italic">Wolff v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120083727 (2009), the Commission found that the complainant had demonstrated sufficient harm when a supervisor, "speaking to complainant as a friend and, although, he did not want to influence her decision as to whether she should file an EEO complaint, if she did so, it would polarize the office, affect or split the union by its members choosing side's, and affect complainant's future." However, in the same case, the Commission found that statements made by an agency official during settlement negotiations could not form the basis of a retaliation complaint because "any statements or proposals are to be treated as confidential and privileged to facilitate a candid interchange to settle disputes informally." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120052287 (2008) (finding that a supervisor's email stating "[c]omplaints, like protests, keep us from focusing on positive goals," and a request to be notified when the complainant withdrew her complaints contained language that could be viewed "as a potential veiled threat aimed at complainant.")</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Adalberto S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120152179 (2016), the Commission found the following comments made by a supervisor to a subordinate reasonably likely to deter the complainant or others from engaging in protected activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But, I don't care [who is] fucking who...you and [a named co-worker (C1)], can do whatever you want to outside of here. I don't care.... But I don't need that shit here! [You are] a good worker, I just don't want to see you get in trouble. And that woman is nothing but trouble. Do you know they fired her three times and each time she came back. Well, they want to get it right this time. Are you familiar with the term collateral damage? Well, if she goes down, you're going down with her. I'm telling you we're watching her and we're watching you too. A good friend of mine...got hit with a sexual harassment charge by that woman. That's the reason I won't ride in an elevator with her today. I tell you she's like a spider. I don't want to see you get sucked into her web. Think of her as Ebola and stay away from her.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Beckham v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120112323 (2013), the Commission found retaliation where the supervisor made statements to the complainant that because she had filed a complaint the supervisor would have to more fully document what was said in meetings and that she might also have trust concerns with the complainant and that the supervisor was "sad" the complainant had filed a complaint and she would have to be more careful about what she said.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence of retaliatory bias was found in comments made by a supervisor that he didn't appreciate the complainant filing an "EEO suit every time [the complainant] felt unhappy." <span class="Italic">Mitchell H. v. Secretary of VA</span>, 0120141025 (2016). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Mitchell H</span>., continued:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find S3's remarks that Complainant's EEO activity was "threatening," "hostile," and "not conducive to a collaborative work environment" are reasonably likely to deter EEO activity. A violation of Title VII will be found if an employer retaliates against a worker for engaging in protected activity through threats, harassment in or out of the workplace, or any other adverse treatment that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity by that individual or other employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual on Retaliation</span>, No. 915.003, at 8-14 through 8-16 (May 20, 1998) (hereinafter <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual on Retaliation</span>). In this case, the supervisor's conduct could have had a potentially chilling effect on the ultimate tool that employees have to enforce equal employment opportunity the filing of an EEO complaint. As such, we find such evidence indicative of a retaliatory bias, as well as a violation of the anti-reprisal provision of Title VII in and of itself. Pursuant to Commission policy, claimed retaliatory actions which can be challenged are not restricted to those which affect a term or condition of employment. Rather, a Complainant is protected from any discrimination that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Compliance Manual on Retaliation</span>, at 8-15.</p>
<p class="noindent">Questions about an employee's EEO activity, particularly if repeated, can rise to the level of aggrieving the employee for purposes of a reprisal complaint. For example, in <span class="Italic">Boswell v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120091674 (2010), the Commission entered a finding of discrimination where, on two occasions, a supervisor made comments, such as, "I know you filed an EEO. You better be careful what you wish for. You don't always get what you want." and "Boy, how many EEO's do you have going? Do you know?"</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim was reversed in <span class="Italic">Beasley v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 012007237 (2007), where the complainant alleged that during a break in a training class his supervisor said, "you are not supposed to be on break, you are to be in class all day because if you are not in class, it is like you have not worked in 24 hours" and that after returning from a meeting his supervisor yelled out in front of several coworkers "you made it back from your EEO appointment." The Commission found that the actions were reasonably likely to deter EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Boff v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072104 (2007) (manager ordered employee to his office to discuss EEO complaint); <span class="Italic">Pruett v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120052581 (2007) (supervisor telling employees that should back him up or they would be stuck with another supervisor). Where an agency manager made comments to coworkers about the complainant's refusal to mediate his EEO complaint, this also constituted retaliation. <span class="Italic">Malekpour v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720100016 (2011), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 0520120340 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a postmaster threatened to terminate the complainant if he hired a lawyer or pursued an EEO complaint, this constituted actionable retaliation even where the subsequent nonrenewal of the complainant's temporary employment contract was found to be for legitimate reasons. In <span class="Italic">Wittren v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073308 (2007), the administrative judge found retaliation for the threat to remove. However, he also found that the complainant's ultimate removal was because of budgetary reductions that allowed only one temporary worker to remain employed. The agency presented evidence that the coworker was technically superior to the complainant and also that it renewed the coworker's contract in two implements of six months, instead of a more standard term of one year.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission found retaliation where the complainant's supervisor refused a coworker's (subordinate to the supervisor) request for official time to talk to the complainant's representative in <span class="italic">Barry G. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020003268 (2021). The coworker was named as a witness in the complainant's EEO complaint. The supervisor emailed the coworker, directing her not to speak with the representative for at least one week. Pointing to policy, the agency supervisor explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 stated that the representative had not formally advised the Agency of his representation and Complainant was to refrain from speaking with him until he did so. <span class="italic">Id.</span> S1 stated that he was advised to send the email because the attorney had not formally advised the Agency of his representation and did not do so until one week later. S1 asserted that Agency policy dictates that Agency employees shall not provide "factual official information" without the appropriate authority. However, S1's testimony is inconsistent with Agency policy, which explicitly states that it does not apply to release of official information or testimony by Agency employees in "administrative proceedings conducted by, or on behalf of" the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding pretext in <span class="italic">Barry G</span>., the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pretext can be demonstrated by showing such weaknesses, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the Agency's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence. <span class="italic">See Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120060802 (Nov. 20, 2007) (finding that the agency's explanations were confusing, contradictory, and lacking credibility, which were then successfully rebutted by the complainant), <span class="italic">request for recon. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080211 (May 30, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the record is filled with inconsistencies and lacks supporting evidence regarding S1's email instructing Complainant not to speak with his coworker's attorney. Our review of the record finds that S1 conceded that he engaged in the conduct alleged by Complainant in claim (A)(1). However, as noted, the policy that S1 indicated he relied upon does not support S1's reliance or justify the email. While S1 testified that he adhered to Agency policy when issuing the email, the record indicates that the policy S1 relied upon expressly exempts application of the instruction to administrative proceedings, including those conducted by or on behalf of the EEOC. Further, S1 failed to identify who advised him to send the email and the record lends no support to his assertion. We find that Complainant <span id="Page_1518"></span>has established that the Agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason was unworthy of credence, and therefore was pretext for discrimination. As such, Complainant has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was subjected to reprisal discrimination. Therefore, the Agency is liable for retaliation regarding S1's email. <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 33, 440, 442, 444, 446. Accordingly, we will order the Agency to provide EEO training to S1 and to post a notice of this finding.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gaither v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120083986 (2009), the Commission found an allegation that the complainant's supervisors mentioned a previous EEO settlement while telling him that an "Indian could walk in and take [his] job" because he lacked a "safety net" under the Indian Preference Law stated a claim for relief. The Commission found that the complainant alleged the comments were made to intimidate and embarrass him, particularly where the previous settlement agreement had no relation to the subject under discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all comments by a supervisor that somehow relate to protected activity, however, rise to the level of aggrieving the employee. Context is important as the Commission demonstrated in <span class="Italic">Blocher v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120111937 (2013). In that case, the complainant sought reasonable accommodation on the advice of a first-line supervisor who also supported the request. After the agency denied the request, the complainant submitted a second request and the supervisor told the complainant that he did not understand why she had done so. In finding there was no retaliation in <span class="Italic">Blocher</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has carefully considered claim 3 and determines that the matter raised therein does not rise to the level of <span class="Italic">per se</span> reprisal. The Commission acknowledges that S1 stated that he had informed Complainant that he did not understand why Complainant sought a telework reasonable accommodation when a denial of a telework had just been denied. The statement of S1 may have not been a very judicious observation. However, we do not discern it constituting an admonishment by S1, when viewed by the Commission in the context of S1's prior actions on this matter, which are reflective of empathy for Complainant's situation. We note, for example, that S1 had taken the initiative of suggesting to Complainant that she pursue the option of a telework request; and that S1 had indeed assisted Complainant in the preparation of the requisite forms, as discussed above. Given these circumstances, we determine that there was no discrimination in regard to the matter identified in the subject claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement that the statements be directed at anyone in particular. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120132212 (2013), the Commission found retaliation where a district superintendent speaking at a conference said, "EEO's are crap. Here's what happens. They won't win because there's nothing to support it. They'll drop it because they don't have evidence and don't want to spend money for a lawyer. Senior citizens are afraid to retire, economically afraid. EEO people are crazy people. Don't be afraid of EEO's. They'll go away." Even comments directed toward other employees can have a chilling effect. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Terrell C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120152271 (2015) (supervisor referred to complainant's coworker as "a money grubbing EEO employee").</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency sent an email to 45 employees that could be perceived as threatening if they were to provide testimony in an EEO case, the Commission found that the administrative judge properly certified the resulting complaint as a class complaint. In <span class="Italic">Powell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0720040015 (2007), an employee filed a civil action in U.S. district court alleging discrimination. Thereafter, an agency attorney sent an email to 45 employees identified as potential witnesses in the case reminding them of a Navy regulation that requires employees to seek advance approval before providing testimony in litigation involving the agency. The email further notified the employees that they could be subject to discipline for failing to obtain advance approval. In approving certification of the class, the Commission rejected agency arguments that its alleged interference with EEO testimony was not actionable noting that it had held "repeatedly that a violation will be found if an employer retaliates against a worker for engaging in protected activity through threats, harassment in or out of the workplace, or any other adverse treatment that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity by that individual or other employees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120073832 (2009), the Commission found that comments posted on a website frequented by transportation screeners made the agency liable for retaliation. In that case, the complainant alleged he was denied reasonable accommodation, subjected to a hostile work environment, subjected to retaliation for filing an EEO complaint, had medical information improperly disclosed, and terminated for discriminatory reasons. While the complainant did not prevail on any of his other claims, the Commission found that the agency had engaged in retaliation when three supervisors posted negative comments on a website about the complainant and his EEO activity and that comments, which also contained information about a neck injury the complainant received, violated the Rehabilitation Act. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, set aside that the finding of the administrative judge that the comments were merely "work related banter":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statutory retaliation clauses prohibit any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter complainant or others from engaging in protected activity. EEOC Compliance Manual on Retaliation, No. 915.003 (May 20, 1998). Petty slights and trivial annoyances are not actionable, as they are not likely to deter protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> More significant retaliatory treatment, however, can be challenged regardless of the level of harm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A violation will be found if an employer retaliates against a worker for engaging in protected activity through threats, harassment in or out of the workplace, or any other adverse treatment that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity by that individual or other employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the AJ's finding that the management official's comments on the chat forum were merely "work related banter." First, we find that complainant did not "welcome" the conduct or invite the comments when he generally mentioned that he has filed civil rights complaints against the agency. Further, the managers' discussion of specific facts of complainant's confidential EEO complaint was completely inappropriate. Further, the management officials revealed their retaliatory animus when they repeatedly called complainant names that referred to his EEO complaint, taunted him with the facts of his EEO complaint, and said that he was filing a frivolous complaint because of his incompetence. The fact that other Transportation Screeners frequented the site and were able to read the comments further compounded the situation. We find that the comments by the management officials are reasonably likely to deter complainant from continuing the pursuit of his current EEO complaint, and are reasonably likely to deter other agency employees from filing an EEO complaint in the future. Therefore, we find that the agency is liable for retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Americans with Disabilities Act regulations provide for the confidentiality of medical records, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Information obtained...regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall...be treated as a confidential medical record, except that: (i) supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restriction on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodation.</p>

By its terms, the requirement applies to confidential medical information from any employee and is not limited to individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See Hampton, supra; see also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans With Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span> (March 25, 1997) at question 15; EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Disability Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (July 27, 2000); ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> (October 10, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the agency discloses medical information pertaining to a complainant in a manner that did not conform to this regulation, then its act of dissemination would constitute a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. We note that there is no requirement of a showing of harm beyond the disclosure. <span class="Italic">Hampton, supra.</span> Here, we find that the management officials disclosed complainant's confidential medical information when they discussed on the public chat forum that complainant had a neck injury, that he was allegedly doing stretches for that neck injury, and that he had been given a reasonable accommodation. As a result, the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Padda v. Attorney General</span>, 0120120979 (2012), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint alleging that the agency engaged in retaliation when he learned of a newspaper article on an internal U.S. Attorney's Office investigation that mentioned him by name.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even EEO counselor's have been found to have made comments that having a chilling effect. An EEO counselor's instructions to employees to try to work things out with her supervisor were found to have a chilling effect in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01970412 (2000). In <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, the complainant was initially prevented by an EEO counselor from filing a complaint, as was a coworker whose testimony corroborated the complainant's. The EEO counselor stated that she knew the supervisor involved and that the complainant and coworker should work things out with him. In response, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Parker</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission additionally notes that complainant raised concerns involving EEO matters. In her complaint, complainant alleged that she was followed by RMO-3 into the EEO office and he threatened her if she filed a complaint. In addition, complainant alleges that the EEO officer initially refused to allow her to file a complaint and told complainant to "straighten out the matter herself" as set forth above. The agency inexplicably did not address these allegations in its final agency decision nor in response to complainant's appeal. Generally, a remark or comment unaccompanied by concrete action is not a direct and personal deprivation sufficient to render an individual aggrieved and, therefore, such an allegation would fail to state a claim pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1)<span class="Italic">. See Simon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. <span id="Page_1519"></span>05900866 (October 3, 1990). In the case at hand, the act of following complainant into the EEO office and the refusal to initially allow her to file a complaint would have a potentially chilling effect on the ultimate tool that employees have to enforce equal employment opportunity, the filing of an EEO complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Commission is concerned by the agency's alleged actions and failure to address them therein. As such, the Commission is directing the agency to provide additional training on the importance of the EEO process to management officials as well as to those in the EEO office to ensure that such incidents, if true, will not occur again.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120070289 (2007), the Commission found that a comment by an EEO counselor that the complainant had already filed too many complaints and could not file another one was sufficient to aggrieve the employee. The Commission rejected an agency argument that the complaint failed to state a claim and was moot because the complainant did receive precomplaint counseling and had filed a formal complaint. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Guinn v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120092190 (2009) (EEO counselor told 74 year old complainant that if he did not drop complaint if could hurt his chances of getting the position if it reopened).</p>
