<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-30"><span class="space">B.</span> FORM OF ACCOMMODATION REQUESTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">In its most general sense, a request for accommodation is any action on the part of the employee that links a medical condition to a possible need for an adjustment in the workplace. There is no particular form that a request for accommodation must take. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021002760 (2022) ("nothing in the Rehabilitation Act specifies that specific paperwork must be completed or that an accommodation request must be made in a particular format."). In addition, a request can be either explicit or implicit. If an agency has reason to believe there a causal connection between an employee's medical condition and a conduct or performance problem in the workplace, the Commission is likely to find that the prerequisites for a request for accommodation exist and the agency's obligation to seek detailed knowledge of the disability and its effects has been triggered.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA</span>, the Commission provided some examples that shed considerable light on what constitutes a request for accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an individual decides to request accommodation, the individual or his/her representative must let the employer know that s/he needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. To request accommodation, an individual may use "plain English" and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase "reasonable accommodation."</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example A</span>:&#x2003;An employee tells her supervisor, "I'm having trouble getting to work at my scheduled starting time because of medical treatments I'm undergoing." This is a request for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example B</span>:&#x2003;An employee tells his supervisor, "I need six weeks off to get treatment for a back problem." This is a request for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example C</span>:&#x2003;A new employee, who uses a wheelchair, informs the employer that her wheelchair cannot fit under the desk in her office. This is a request for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example D</span>:&#x2003;An employee tells his supervisor that he would like a new chair because his present one is uncomfortable. Although this is a request for a change at work, his statement is insufficient to put the employer on notice that he is requesting reasonable accommodation. He does not link his need for the new chair with a medical condition.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Spikes v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01976786 (2000) (a request for leave caused by a disability is a request for accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee is not required to use the words "reasonable accommodation" as long as what is communicated to the agency is a need for a workplace modification that is linked to a medical condition. The Commission explains in its <span class="Italic">Policy Guidance on Executive Order 13164: Establishing Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation</span>, at II.A:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A request for accommodation is a statement that an individual needs an adjustment or a change at work or in the application process for a reason related to a medical condition. Agencies may not require, for example, that individuals mention the Rehabilitation Act or use the phrase "reasonable accommodation." The agency's procedures should make this point clear.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE</span>--Michelle tells her supervisor, "I'm having trouble getting to work at my scheduled starting time because of the anti-depressants I take." This is a request for reasonable accommodation. Whether or not Michelle is ultimately entitled to an accommodation, the agency must start to consider the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE</span>--An applicant who is vision-impaired asks for assistance with the agency's application materials. This is a request for reasonable accommodation and triggers the agency's obligation to engage in its reasonable accommodation process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Further, where the disability is obvious, such as where the employee requires a wheelchair for mobility, the employee need not "officially" request accommodation or make a "formal" or "actual" request. It was enough, in <span class="Italic">Jody L. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120151351 (2018), that the employee asked his new supervisor for a modification to his usual telework schedule that had been in place for years:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an individual decides to request accommodation, the individual or his/her representative must let the employer know that s/he needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. To request accommodation, an individual may use 'plain English' and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase "reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">See</span> Accommodation Guidance, Question 1. Complainant did not need to "officially" request an accommodation, it was enough that he asked for a modification to his usual schedule due to the hazardous conditions and the risk to his health.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency may require the employee to complete a specific accommodation request form. However, that form can be used for recordkeeping purposes only and the initiation of the reasonable accommodation process is not contingent upon the employee completing and filing such a form with the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similarly, an agency's written procedures may designate certain officials as recipients of reasonable accommodation requests, but may not require that requests be submitted to a certain individual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's obligation to consider an individual's request begins when the individual makes that request to any of the following: his/her supervisor; a supervisor or manager in his/her immediate chain of command; the EEO office; any other office designated by the agency to oversee the reasonable accommodation process; or, in connection with the application process, any agency employee with whom the applicant has contact. Agencies may also designate others, in addition to those identified above, to whom requests may be made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency procedures should advise the employees who are designated to receive reasonable accommodation requests to then notify, if necessary, any other agency personnel who will be involved in the decisionmaking.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure of a complainant to use the proper agency form does not relieve an agency of its obligation to explore accommodation, nor does it justify a delay in initiating the reasonable accommodation inquiry. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Mees v. Postmaster General</span>, 01971964 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency relies on managerial affidavits stating that no request for permanent light duty had been received from complainant as of the time he initiated counseling, and that even when complainant subsequently submitted a "temporary light duty request form" with the word "temporary" crossed out and the word "permanent" written in its place, this failed to comply with the agency's formal request procedure for permanent light duty. (5) Nonetheless, based on the agency's own affidavits contained in the ROI, it is undisputed that by the time the agency investigated complainant's formal complaint, complainant had completed the agency's formal request process for permanent light duty, his request had been denied, and the agency processed the complaint accordingly. Therefore, the formal denial of complainant's request for permanent light duty, occurring subsequent to initiation of EEO Counselor contact, is encompassed within the complaint<span class="Italic">. Cf. Charles v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910190 (February 25, 1991) (where a complaint is filed with respect to a proposed action and the <span id="Page_1307"></span>agency later proceeds with the action, then the action and the proposed action merge).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;Requests for accommodation need not be in writing, nor in a particular format, in order to trigger the employer's obligation to commence the interactive process of clarifying and assessing the request<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Schmidt v. Safeway Inc.</span>, 864 F. Supp. 991, 997 (D. Or. 1994) ("statute does not require the plaintiff to speak any magic words.... The employee need not mention the ADA or even the term 'accommodation'"); <span class="Italic">see also Hendricks-Robinson v. Excel Corp.</span>, 154 F.3d 685, 694 (7th Cir. 1998) ("[a] request as straightforward as asking for continued employment is a sufficient request for accommodation").</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, if there is a link between a known medical condition and the need for some modification of the workplace or work schedule, it will be considered a request for accommodation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Growitz v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 01A15047 (2002), the Commission found that the complainant had requested reasonable accommodation where she requested a change in schedule to attend a weekly doctor's appointment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Elease S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140731 (2017) ("We find that Complainant's request may be construed as a request for reasonable accommodation because she identified her exact medical restrictions and the accommodations she would need, such as refraining from lifting items over 15 pounds."). Consistent with the rule that no particular language is required for a request for accommodation, in <span class="Italic">Gary v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A23962 (2003), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complainant had not sought accommodation because his doctor made the suggested accommodations as a "request" instead of a necessity. The Commission <span class="Italic">Gary</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the agency did not have a duty to accommodate complainant based upon her physician's February 1999 letter because "the restrictions were phrased as requests and not necessities." We note that when an individual decides to request accommodation, the individual or her representative must let the employer know that she needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. To request accommodation, an individual may use "plain English" and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase "reasonable accommodation.<span class="Italic">" See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002, Question 1 (rev. Oct. 17, 2002). Here, complainant's physician apprized the agency in February 1999 that complainant had the medical condition of Lupus which caused rashes when exposed to the sun and also caused a multitude of other symptoms, including inflammations of the vessels and inflammation of the joints. The physician further informed the agency that despite the patient's use of long sleeves and a large hat, she continued to have rashes due to sun exposure secondary to her lupus. The letter further informed the agency that complainant needed a light duty assignment which would not expose her to sunlight. The AJ's conclusion that the agency did not have a duty to accommodate complainant's alleged disability because "the restrictions were phrases as requests and not necessities" appears to discredit the physician's note merely because of its rather polite tone, but the letter clearly is informing the agency that complainant had a medical condition that required some adjustment to her working conditions. Accordingly, we conclude that the physician's February 1999 letter constitutes a request for an accommodation<span class="Italic">. See McNeil v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 05960436 (July 28, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission will impute knowledge to the agency in the proper circumstances, it is part of the complainant's burden in making a claim of failure to accommodate to show that the relevant agency officials had knowledge of his or her disability. When the complainant is not forthcoming about his medical condition, the agency may not have such knowledge, as the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span>, 01995547 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to complainant's claim of disability discrimination, the Commission finds that complainant has a physical impairment which substantially limited one or more major life activities and that he was, therefore, an individual with a disability under the regulations<span class="Italic">. See Bragdon v. Abbott,</span> 524 U.S. 624, 118 S. Ct. 2196 (1998) (HIV infection, even during so-called asymptomatic phase, is a physical impairment that substantially limits the major life activity of reproduction); <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEO No. 03990024 (May 20, 1999). Complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of his position was not in dispute, and the Commission therefore finds that he was a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that upon request from the agency, due in part to the concern over his numerous short-term absences, complainant provided a letter from his physician which stated that complainant was "involved in a drug study testing a new medical therapy which is vital to his health," and laid out a schedule for necessary work absences for treatment. This letter was given to complainant's supervisor in June 1994, and again to the supervisor's replacement in June 1995. Upon the arrival of a third successive supervisor, complainant was again asked to provide documentation regarding his medical condition, including a diagnosis and prognosis. Complainant declined to provide those specifics, but he did furnish the new supervisor with a second letter from his physician, in September 1995, which stated that complainant "needs to be followed on a regular basis for his chronic medical illness." (Investigative File, Exhibit 18). The record further reflects that complainant did not disclose the nature of his disability to the agency until he filed his formal EEO complaint, after the agency made the decision not to extend his appointment. During the hearing, management officials testified that they were not aware of the nature of complainant's illness at any time during his employment, and the AJ found this testimony to be credible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to prevail in his claim of discrimination, complainant must show that the relevant agency officials were aware that he was an individual with a disability<span class="Italic">. Ray v. Department of Energy,</span> EEOC No. 01983058 (June 29, 2001); <span class="Italic">Lester v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC No. 01944102 (January 16, 1996); <span class="Italic">Spering v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC No. 01930551 (May 19, 1993). It is the position of the Commission that actual knowledge of a disability is required to trigger any agency liability<span class="Italic">. Poff v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> EEOC No. 01956117 (November 21, 1996); <span class="Italic">Gant v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910096 (July 9, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the substantial evidence of record supports the AJ's finding that complainant did not disclose to the agency that he was an individual with a disability at any time during his employment. The Commission has consistently found that a known disability is one of which the relevant agency officials had actual knowledge of, or notice of, a disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01930671 (October 26, 1993); <span class="Italic">Stallworth v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900416 (August 2, 1990) (awareness that complainant was having emotional problems did not constitute actual knowledge of a disability); <span class="Italic">Ritter v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03890089 (December 8, 1989). When the disability and/or the need for accommodation is not obvious, as in the instant case, the employer may ask the individual for reasonable documentation about his/her disability and functional limitations. The employer is entitled to know that the individual has a covered disability for which s/he needs a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Question 6. (March, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Commission finds nothing on appeal to depart from the finder of fact's conclusion that complainant failed to adequately impart actual knowledge of his disability to the agency, and therefore the agency was not under obligation to provide him with reasonable accommodation. As the agency was not required to provide complainant with reasonable accommodation, its reliance on complainant's poor attendance record as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not extending his appointment does not violate the <span class="Italic">Rehabilitation Act. Ross v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC No. 01982708 (August 2, 2001); <span class="Italic">see</span> also <span class="Italic">Beck v. University of Wisconsin Board of Regents,</span> 75 F.3d 1130 (7th Cir. 1996). As such, we find no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a34982.txt">01A34982</a> (2004), the Commission found that the complainant had not made a request for reasonable accommodation when she provided the agency with a note from her psychiatrist stating that due to her depression she should be allowed to use leave as needed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Quinn</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the record reveals that in 2000, complainant was diagnosed with major depression. We further find that there is no evidence in the record that complainant requested reasonable accommodation for her depression and/or any other unknown disability. Specifically, we note in her affidavit, complainant stated that in May and June 2000, she provided letters from her psychiatrist to an agency official. Complainant stated that in his letters, her psychiatrist stated that due to her depression, she should be allowed to use leave as needed. However, the letters from complainant's psychiatrist were merely for the purpose of allowing complainant to use leave on an as needed basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the record contains the S1' s statement that complainant "never mentioned anything to me that appeared to be a disability that might have accounted for her attendance problems." The SI acknowledged that for some reason, complainant appeared to believe that she had so informed the SI. However, the SI stated that he and complainant had discussed her attendance on several occasions; that the SI stressed the need for her to submit better medical documentation; and that complainant persisted in claiming that she was attempting to get documentation, yet never produced anything.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also contains the statement of a Program Manager, who serves in that capacity while the S1 is on detail. The Program Manager stated that in 2000, he acted on S1' s behalf on numerous occasions. The Program Manager stated that complainant never told him that she had a disability, or that she needed an "adjustment" because of a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the record contains an affidavit from complainant's second-line <span id="Page_1308"></span>Supervisor (S2). Therein, the S2 stated that between March 1998 and March 2000, he met with complainant on at least twenty occasions to discuss her poor attendance and work performance. The S2 further stated that during one of the meetings, he informed complainant that he suspected she needed help with some undisclosed condition; and that without an explanation that could help the agency address her attendance and work performance, the agency would seek her removal. Furthermore, the S2 stated that complainant informed him that it was none of his "G-D" business.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Clark v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A52900 (2006), the Commission found that the complainant made a "constructive" request for reasonable accommodation where he informed his supervisor about his bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorder and stated that his absences were due to those disorders. Based on the facts of the case, the Commission found that the complainant had constructively requested accommodation. However, in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Postmaster General</span>, 01200541351 (2006), the Commission found that a note from the complainant's physician was not sufficient to put the agency on notice of an accommodation where the note referenced several physical problems and indicated that the complainant may have limits on her fine motor coordination and short--term memory. Although the note was considered sufficient for the purposes of considering a light duty assignment that the complainant specifically requested, it was not sufficient to put the agency on notice that she sought to be excused, as an accommodation, from scheme training that involved memorizing zones and streets. The Commission found that the language of the note "was too vague and equivocal to trigger the agency's duties under the Rehabilitation Act." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There is no request for accommodation when the complainant denies he has a disability even when the agency has reason to believe of its existence. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bell v. Agency for International Development</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a40930.txt">01A40930</a> (2005), the Commission found that because the complainant denied his alcoholism, he could not be considered to have made a request for accommodation even though agency officials suspected he had a drinking problem. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bell</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends in his affidavit that he specifically discussed his disability and its effects on his time and attendance with management. Complainant's first-level supervisor concedes as much. He states that for much of the time that complainant had time and attendance problems, he did not admit that his alcoholism was the cause. Report of Investigation (ROI), at F3. He states, however, that in January 1998 complainant told him that the cause of his time and attendance problems was his alcoholism.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Additionally, the Office Director states that complainant acknowledged his drinking problem "late in the process." ROI, at F4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has published extensive guidance on reasonable accommodation. It is well settled Commission policy that a request for reasonable accommodation does not have to be in writing, does not have to use the magic words "reasonable accommodation," and can come from someone other than the individual who needs it. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Questions 1-3, (rev. Oct. 17, 2002). However, when requesting accommodation, an individual or his/her representative must let the agency know that the individual needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at Question 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we concur with the AJ that complainant did not make a request for accommodation. The record establishes that management had known for some time that complainant had a drinking problem although complainant did not admit to it until early 1998. The record further establishes that when confronted with finally being disciplined for his time and attendance problems, complainant stated that his drinking was the cause of his problems. However, the record also clearly establishes that complainant never requested an adjustment or a change at work because of his drinking, and complainant does not contend that he did. He simply conceded that his drinking problem, as opposed to the traffic excuses he had been using, was the cause of his time and attendance problems. As a result, we decline to find that complainant requested accommodation either before or after his conduct problems occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> The Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities, Question 31, (March 25, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his affidavit in support of this complaint, complainant avers that the agency had some obligation to "help" him. Commission guidance provides that an agency should initiate the reasonable accommodation process without being asked if the agency: (1) knows that the employee has a disability; (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing work place problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Question 40, (rev. Oct. 17, 2002). There is no evidence to support a finding that the agency knew, or had reason to know, that complainant's drinking problem prevented him from requesting accommodation, nor is there any evidence to suggest that the drinking problem did, in fact, prevent him from seeking assistance.</p>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Social Security Administration</span>, 012005195 (2008), the Commission found that a request for a hardship transfer that was accompanied by a statement from her physician that she suffered from congestive heart disease and should live with her family was a request for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">See Chapter 14 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-23-074.html#sec14-72">Knowledge of Disability</a>," and later in this chapter under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-24-045.html#sec15-33">Failure to Request.</a>"</p>
