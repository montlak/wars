<h4 class="h4" id="sec20-37"><span class="space">5.</span> Constructive Adverse Actions</h4>
<p class="noindent">One area that has caused much confusion in the area of mixed cases is that of so-called "constructive adverse actions." A constructive adverse action occurs when an employee chooses to subject himself or herself to an employment action that would otherwise be within MSPB jurisdiction but, as a practical matter, the choice is involuntary. The most common constructive adverse action is a constructive removal or discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Jurisdiction of The MSPB is beyond the province of this book and for a detailed treatment of the subject the reader is referred to Peter Broida's, <span class="Italic">A Guide to Merit System Protection Board Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/22MSPB.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2023). The matter is treated here to the extent that it involves EEO law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many mixed cases are relatively straightforward and pose no real problem. For example, as discussed above, if an agency removes an employee for misconduct and the employee alleges the removal is discriminatory, the action as well as the allegation of discrimination is clearly within MSPB jurisdiction. So, the employee can proceed directly to the Board for a hearing on both issues, or the employee can pursue an EEO complaint through investigation and a final agency decision and then proceed to the Board for a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Particularly problematic, though, have been those cases in which the employee raises claims that are, at least arguably, within the Jurisdiction of The MSPB and related claims that are not within the Board's jurisdiction. These cases are distinguishable from those discussed immediately above where at least one of the contested actions is clearly within MSPB jurisdiction. A classic scenario involves so-called constructive discharge or removal. For example, the employee claims that he or she is a qualified individual with a disability and that the agency has failed to provide reasonable accommodation. The employee further claims that the failure to accommodate has led to a constructive removal when, in the absence of accommodation, he or she can no longer work without accommodation and resigns or applies for and receives disability retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here's the problem: the Board has jurisdiction over allegations of discrimination only if it has jurisdiction over the challenged action. It has no independent jurisdiction over discrimination claims. When an employee files an appeal with the Board alleging a constructive discharge, the Boards treats the case as raising a jurisdictional issue. In other words, the Board only takes jurisdiction over the case if the employee proves that his or her removal was involuntary. Of course, at that point, the employee, by proving his or her actions were involuntary, has prevailed on the constructive removal claim. When the employee claims that discrimination is what made the removal involuntary, he or she is caught in the proverbial Catch 22. The Board won't take jurisdiction over a discrimination claim unless it has jurisdiction over the action. In order for the Board to have jurisdiction, the employee has to prove the removal was involuntary but can't rely on evidence of discrimination to do so because the Board has no jurisdiction over the discrimination claim unless the removal was involuntary.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an EEO claim raises an action within MSPB jurisdiction, the EEOC has no jurisdiction to hold a hearing on that claim. So, what often happens in a case of an alleged constructive removal is that the EEOC administrative judge dismisses the constructive discharge claim, while retaining jurisdiction over the failure to accommodate claim, and sends the employee to the MSPB with the constructive removal. The Board inevitably finds that the removal was not involuntary and dismisses the case for lack of jurisdiction. Now, the claim of constructive removal comes back to the EEOC to be heard on the merits as a nonmixed case since the Board has determined that it has no jurisdiction over the employee's claim. Of course, bouncing back and forth between forums and exhausting appeals on jurisdictional issues can take years.</p>
<p class="noindent">To alleviate the problem somewhat, the EEOC has carved out an exception to referring a mixed case to the Board. If the mixed and nonmixed claims are related, as is the case when an employee alleges a failure to accommodate leads to a constructive discharge, the EEOC can elect to retain jurisdiction over the entire case if it is otherwise "firmly enmeshed" in the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> Section immediately above and Chapter 17, Section on "Constructive Discharges." The decision on whether to retain jurisdiction is discretionary and many EEOC administrative judges will simply dismiss the mixed claim and send the employee to the MSPB for a jurisdictional determination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consider the following from <span class="Italic">Bernardi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922970 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Bernardi</span>, the complainant filed an EEO complaint alleging she was denied training and sick leave and was ultimately forced to resign because of a hostile working environment. The complainant alleged she resigned because of a pervasive environment of sexual harassment. After investigation, the agency issued a final decision with a finding of no discrimination. The complainant filed an appeal from the decision with the MSPB. The MSPB held a hearing limited to the issue of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether the complainant could establish that her resignation was involuntary. The Board issued an initial decision finding it <span id="Page_1679"></span>lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. The complainant filed a petition for review with the full Board, which upheld the initial decision. Finally, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Bernardi</span> filed a petition for review with the EEOC. The EEOC remanded <span class="Italic">Bernardi</span> to one of its administrative judges to hold a further hearing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC and MSPB regulations provide the framework for processing "mixed cases." These regulations are entwined because of the unique relationship the EEOC and MSPB have with regard to the processing of mixed cases. The Commission's role in the mixed case process is to determine whether the Board correctly decided the issue of discrimination, as opposed to the merit systems issue. Typically, the Board will issue a decision on both the personnel action involved in the appeal and the discrimination alleged therein. However, when the personnel action is one of constructive discharge, it is apparent that the Board takes a different tack.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these cases, as noted by the MSPB AJ, an appellant is entitled to have his/her allegations of discrimination considered only if he/she raises a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntary resignation. Thus, an appellant must present evidence establishing that his/her resignation was involuntary before he/she is entitled to a hearing on his/her claim of discrimination. The Commission is mindful that this process creates anomalous results which were not contemplated by the regulations of the Board or the Commission. This case typifies the harm that can befall an appellant caught in the mixed case process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Board ruled in favor of the agency on the jurisdictional issue, and thus determined that appellant's resignation was voluntary. In cases such as these, the Commission has held that in view of the Board's position, the case is no longer a "mixed case" as defined by EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.402, and the matter is one which must be addressed by the EEO process, not the "mixed case" process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Susan Schmitt v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902126 (July 9, 1990). Moreover, we recently held in the case of <span class="Italic">Leslie Rousseau v. Department of Education</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01920140 (January 21, 1992), that where the MSPB finds that it lacks jurisdiction, and in accordance with the decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the Board does not provide an appellant with appeal rights to the Commission, the agency is directed to process the allegations of discrimination as a "nonmixed" case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that a hearing was held in this case before a MSPB AJ. The Commission has reviewed a transcript of this hearing, and finds that some evidence of sexual harassment was presented. Nonetheless, we find that the evidence on this issue does not form a sufficient evidentiary basis for a ruling on appellant's constructive discharge claim. The MSPB AJ in this case limited the presentation of evidence from November 2, 1988 to May 9, 1989. While she provided a legitimate reason for this limitation, the Commission finds that it is clear that the record, most notably appellant's EEO affidavit, contains valuable background information which must be considered as well. Moreover, the Commission finds that appellant's allegation of sexual harassment was mischaracterized by the agency and the MSPB AJ. In this regard, we note that the agency emphasized periodically throughout the processing of this case that appellant did not cite a particular instance of sexual harassment which was directed against her. EEOC Policy Guidance on Employer Liability under Title VII for Sexual Favoritism, No. N-915-048, (January 12, 1990) makes clear that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If favoritism based upon the granting of sexual favors is widespread in a workplace, both male and female colleagues who do not welcome this conduct can establish a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII regardless of whether any objectionable conduct is directed at them and regardless of whether those who were granted favorable treatment willingly bestowed the sexual favors. In these circumstances, a message is implicitly conveyed that the managers view women as "sexual playthings," thereby creating an atmosphere that is demeaning to women. Both men and women who find this offensive can establish a violation if the conduct is "sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of (their) employment and create an abusive working environment.'" <span class="Italic">Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. at 67, (quoting <span class="Italic">Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 904, 29 EPD 32,993 (11th Cir. 1982)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, it is not dispositive that appellant did not cite any instance of discrimination which was directed at her personally. Rather, appellant's claim of sexual harassment is that given the atmosphere of favoritism and sexual conduct, which she found offensive, she was forced to resign. The MSPB hearing held in this case also did not address appellant's claims of disparate treatment based on sex and retaliation for prior EEO activity. The Commission does not wish to add to the delay of justice already created in this case. Nonetheless, we would be remiss in our obligation to preserve the EEO process if a decision was issued on the record which is now before us. We find instead, that a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge (EEOC AJ) is in order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the EEOC AJ should hold a hearing on the issues of sexual harassment/favoritism, sex discrimination and reprisal as they relate to appellant's claim of a constructive discharge. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.218(c)(2) empowers the EEOC AJ to "...conduct the hearing so as to bring out pertinent facts, including the production of pertinent documents. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, but the Administrative Judge shall exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence." Thus, even if the agency or the MSPB AJ rejected certain allegations on the basis of timeliness, an EEOC AJ hearing the accepted allegations must separately determine whether evidence as to the other allegations constitutes relevant background evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans</span>, 431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977). The EEOC AJ should determine whether evidence and documents from the time period prior to November 2, 1988 are relevant to appellant's case, and issue a decision on the discrimination issues as well as appellant's constructive discharge claim. Subsequent to the EEOC AJ's decision, the agency should issue a final decision including rights to appeal the decision to the Commission, not the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Blount v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720070010 (2009), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. denied</span>, 0520100148 (2010), a constructive discharge case, the complainant claimed that after suffering a stroke the agency failed to accommodate him by allowing him to work at home during his recovery. During the investigation, the complainant expanded his claim to include an allegation that the agency's failure to accommodate him caused him to apply for and receive disability retirement. The Commission's administrative judge determined that the constructive discharge claim was "inextricably intertwined" with the discrimination claim and "firmly enmeshed" in the EEO process and retained jurisdiction over both claims. The judge found in favor of the complainant and the agency appealed arguing that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over the constructive discharge claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, on appeal in <span class="Italic">Blount</span>, the Commission took a different approach to one of the classic mixed case constructive discharge scenarios that, if applied generally, could significantly alleviate the jurisdictional problem in constructive adverse action cases. Though the precise language used by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Blount</span> is a bit confusing in that it initially states that the administrative judge "correctly determined that the constructive discharge claim is inextricably intertwined in the EEO process" and, therefore, was properly before the EEOC, it ultimately advanced an entirely different rationale on the Commission's jurisdiction over the claim, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the AJ characterized complainant's claim as one of constructive discharge, as stated above, we find that this claim is more properly classified as a denial of reasonable accommodation resulting in the inability to work. As such, the proper remedy following a finding that the complainant was not reasonably accommodated is to order the agency to provide a reasonable accommodation to complainant and reinstate him to the position in question, or to a substantially equivalent position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Blount</span> case represents an interesting approach to the mixed case jurisdictional problem. Essentially, the Commission "unmixed" the case by finding that the retirement was not a separate action, but a direct consequence of the failure to accommodate. Because there was no longer a claim that was even arguably within the jurisdiction of the Board, the case fell entirely within the jurisdiction of the EEOC. In addition to reinstatement and back pay, the Commission upheld a $200,000 compensatory damage award by the judge but struck down a 21-year front pay award due to its reinstatement order.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has not consistently followed <span class="Italic">Blount</span>. However, the rationale used in the case could easily be applied to a number of situations to "unmix" cases. For example, another recurring scenario is when a complainant alleges that a hostile environment has reached the point where he or she can no longer go to work. If the inability to report to work flows from the alleged hostile environment, then it presents no independent claim of constructive discharge and, therefore, presents no mixed case issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">The approach in <span class="Italic">Blount</span> can be contrasted with <span class="Italic">West v. Smithsonian Institute</span>, 01A22912 (2002), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 05A21284 (2002), where the Commission found that a failure to provide reasonable accommodation claim was subsumed in a constructive discharge claim that was pending before the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without any specific mention of <span class="Italic">Blount</span>, the Commission did use a similar approach, though again with conflicting language about constructive discharges, in <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120103125 (2010). In that case, the Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant's hearing impairment when it provided a transmitter and receiver from him to use in meetings but agency management failed to cooperate in use of the device. The Commission found that management's attitude was also conveyed to coworkers who, in turn, failed to properly use the device so that the complainant could communicate during meetings. Finally, during a meeting with two managers and a union representative to discuss the complainant's work-related injury, the managers refused to properly use the device so that the complainant could understand what was being said. The managers also refused the complainant's request to put their questions in writing so that he could respond. The complainant took medical leave after the meeting and ultimately applied for and received disability retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Wagner</span>, first noted that "[a]lthough the Agency characterized complainant's claim as one of constructive discharge, as <span id="Page_1680"></span>stated above, we find that this claim is more properly classified as a denial of reasonable accommodation resulting in the inability to work." However, the Commission then went on to find:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Complainant also asserted that the harassment and denial of reasonable accommodation resulted in his disability retirement or constructive discharge. The central question in a constructive discharge case is whether the employer, through its unlawful discriminatory behavior made the employee's working conditions so difficult that any reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to resign. The Commission has established three elements which a complainant must prove to substantiate a claim of constructive discharge: (1) a reasonable person in the complainant's position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and, (3) the complainant's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Walch v. Dep't of Justice,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940688 (April 13, 1995); <span class="Italic">Christoph v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05880575 (April 6, 1990). After careful consideration, viewing all of the circumstances presented here, we find that the same discriminatory hostile work environment created by management and the co-workers and the denial of reasonable accommodation was sufficiently severe as to result in objectively intolerable working conditions, and that Complainant reasonably felt compelled to resign because of these conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent">As part of the remedy, the Commission ordered the complainant's reinstatement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission used a similar approach in <span class="Italic">Bartron v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720100054 (2011), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 0520110399 (2011), where the agency denied the complainant reasonable accommodation by failing to consider her for reassignment to a lower-graded auditor position when a neuropathological condition precluded her from working as an auditor at the GS-13 level. Again, in <span class="Italic">Bartron</span>, the Commission treated the case not as a constructive discharge but as a case where a failure to accommodate led directly to the complainant's inability to work. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Barton</span>, specifically relying on <span class="Italic">Blount</span> reviewed the findings of the administrative judge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that reinstatement was an appropriate remedy because the Agency's action in denying reasonable accommodation resulted in Complainant's inability to continue working. In reaching this conclusion, she relied on two Commission decisions: <span class="Italic">Blount v. Dep't of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (Oct. 21, 2009) and <span class="Italic">Quinn v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951472 (May 19, 1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In <span class="Italic">Blount,</span> the issue, as in the instant case, involved the denial of a reasonable accommodation resulting in the Complainant's inability to work. <span class="Italic">See Blount,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 at 5-6. Specifically, in<span class="Italic"> Blount,</span> the denial of a reasonable accommodation, as in the instant matter, culminated in the Complainant taking a disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 3. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Quinn,</span> which also involved the denial of a reasonable accommodation, the Commission held that the Agency's failure to accommodate the Complainant "gave him no choice but to retire." <span class="Italic">Quinn,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951472 at 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notably, as in the instant matter, neither <span class="Italic">Blount</span> nor <span class="Italic">Quinn</span> explicitly addressed the issue of whether the Complainants had been constructively discharged. Nevertheless, the Commission awarded these Complainants reinstatement, among other relief. In<span class="Italic"> Quinn,</span> the Commission explained that in cases where a Complainant has retired, reinstatement is typically not a remedy absent a showing that the Complainant was constructively discharged.<span class="Italic"> Quinn,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951472 at 5 <span class="Italic">(citing Harrell v. Dep't of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940652 (May 24, 1995)). That notwithstanding, the Commission stated, "[a]lthough [Complainant] has not made [ ] a showing [of constructive discharge], we find that the facts of this case warrant that the Agency offer him the option of reinstatement. Specifically, to the extent that the Agency did not permit [Complainant] to return to work in 1993, and because he had no other source of income, we find that the Agency gave him no choice but to retire." <span class="Italic">Quinn,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951472 at 5. Therefore, the Commission held that Complainant would be afforded the option of reinstatement.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Blount,</span> the Commission held that, "[a]lthough the [administrative judge] characterized Complainant's claim as one of constructive discharge...we find that this claim is more properly classified as a denial of reasonable accommodation resulting in the inability to work. As such, the proper remedy following a finding that Complainant was not reasonably accommodated is to order the Agency to provide a reasonable accommodation to Complainant and to reinstate him to the position in question, or to a substantially equivalent position." <span class="Italic">See Blount,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 at 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ concluded that although the instant matter did not explicitly involve a constructive discharge claim, Complainant's disability retirement flowed directly from the denial of a reasonable accommodation, as it did in <span class="Italic">Blount</span> and<span class="Italic"> Quinn.</span> In addition and to further the goal of providing make whole relief, the AJ ordered the Agency to offer Complainant reinstatement to a GS-9 auditor position at the Agency, or to a substantially equivalent position, in her current location; or to offer Complainant reinstatement to a GS-9 auditor position at the Agency, or to a substantially equivalent position, in Washington, D.C., and pay her for her moving expenses back to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed the judge's analysis with little additional comment noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find the Agency's summary argument that the AJ erroneously relied on the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Blount, Quinn</span> and <span class="Italic">Mack</span> totally without merit. To the contrary, the AJ issued an exceptionally thorough, researched and thoughtful decision. Her findings of fact are well supported by substantial evidence; her conclusions of law are consistent with Commission policy and precedent; and we discern no basis to disturb her decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission applied a similar analysis in <span class="Italic">Kreger v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120080621 (2011), where the agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation resulted in the complainant being sent home and placed in an AWOL status. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Kreger,</span> in ordering a remedy found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the denial of her request for a reasonable accommodation, Complainant was sent home, subjected to requests for investigative interviews, and placed in an AWOL status for December 8 through December 13, 2006 (issues 2 through 4). She also requested Annual Leave (in Lieu of Sick Leave) from December 19, 2006 through January 3, 2007 (issue 5). By letter dated December 22, 2006, MO-2 informed Complainant that she would be put in an AWOL status unless she reported to work. Complainant alleged that this created a hostile work environment based on her sex and disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather than finding these actions to constitute harassment, we find that these Agency actions occurred as a consequence of the Agency's denial of Complainant's request to be reasonably accommodated on December 8, 2006. Complainant is entitled to be remedied for any harm or loss she suffered as a result of the denial of accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120142568 (2015), the Commission dismissed the constructive discharge claim as invoking MSPB jurisdiction while retaining jurisdiction over her failure to accommodate claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630. In order to establish that Complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must show that: (1) she is an individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); (2) she is a qualified individual pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); and (3) the Agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002). Under the Commission's regulations, an Agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless the Agency can show that accommodation would case an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(o) and (p).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Complainant requested a hearing in this case before an EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ). However, by Order dated February 20, 2014, the AJ assigned to the case dismissed Complainant's hearing request because she determined that the entire complaint was a mixed case appealable to the MSPB. We determine, however, that the AJ erred in including Complainant's denial of reasonable accommodation claim in the dismissal. While the failure to accommodate is one of the reasons Complainant provides for her constructive discharge, this is also an independent failure to reasonably accommodate claim alleging a violation of the Rehabilitation Act that will not be adjudicated by the MSPB. Therefore, we will vacate the Agency's final decision with regard to the failure to accommodate claim and remand the matter back for a hearing on this issue alone.</p>
<p class="noindent">But then, again, in <span class="Italic">Augustine S. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720110018 (2015), the Commission, relying on <span class="Italic">Blount</span>, found that an employee who, on agency advice, filed a constructive discharge claim with the MSPB and later withdrew her appeal, had not elected a forum because the MSPB never had jurisdiction over the matter. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Augustine S</span>., explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we address the jurisdictional questions raised by the Agency. The record reveals that, on January 18, 2008, Complainant contacted an EEO Counselor and on February 20, 2008, filed his formal EEO complaint. The Agency conducted an investigation, but then Complainant, pursuant to the Agency's instructions, filed an appeal with the MSPB. Once learning of the jurisdictional requirements of the MSPB, Complainant withdrew his MSPB appeal and requested that the EEO process continue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency argues that Complainant made a binding election to pursue the matter with the MSPB which operated to terminate processing of his failure to accommodate allegations, we disagree. Here, <span id="Page_1681"></span>the record reveals Complainant initially elected to pursue through the EEO process matters that were within the Commission's jurisdiction. Although Complainant later filed an appeal with the MSPB, and subsequently withdrew the only claim which could have been appealed to the MSPB, his failure to accommodate claim was properly heard before the EEOC AJ. <span class="Italic">See Blount v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010, (October 21, 2009), <span class="Italic">req. for recon. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520100148 (Apr. 16, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Blount</span>, the complainant suffered a stroke, and requested to work at home (as others had) as an accommodation. The AJ in that case found that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process, and ultimately denied the request, which culminated in the complainant taking disability retirement. The EEOC AJ retained jurisdiction over the whole claim, including the constructive discharge claim, because it was "inextricably intertwined" with the denial of accommodation, and a remand to the MSPB would cause undue delay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Commission agreed that the constructive discharge claim was intertwined with the reasonable accommodation claim; however, it also found the claim was more appropriately characterized as a denial of accommodation which resulted in an inability to work. In other words, the complainant's inability to work was not a separate action; but rather, a direct consequence of the agency's failure to accommodate. <span class="Italic">See Blount</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010. As relief, the AJ awarded the complainant back pay, reinstatement with an accommodation, and $200,000 in compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant in the instant action, like the complainant in <span class="Italic">Blount</span>, alleged a repeated denial of accommodation over an extended period of time which culminated in disability retirement due to his inability to work. The consequence, therefore, of the Agency's failure to accommodate was Complainant's inability to work. Accordingly, the AJ's finding of jurisdiction was appropriate.</p>
