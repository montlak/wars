<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-122"><span class="space">16.</span> Collective Bargaining Agreements</h4>
<p class="noindent">For some period of time, the Commission's position on the impact of collective bargaining agreements on an agency's accommodation obligations remained unclear. In <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission found that a collective bargaining agreement could not contravene the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act since a federal statute supersedes a collective bargaining agreement. However, the ADA has changed that proposition somewhat. In the Commission's view, the ADA requires that an employer negotiate a variance of the agreement with the union in good faith, unless the variance would constitute an undue hardship on other workers. The Commission has vacillated on whether the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement that establish seniority bidding rights bar the reassignment of an employee to a position covered by such a provision as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 122 S. Ct. 1516 (2002), the Supreme Court brought some clarity to the subject in a case that did not involve a collective bargaining agreement, but an employer-established seniority system. In <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, the Court held that, in most circumstances, an employer is not required to set aside the rules of an established seniority system in order to reassign an employee as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. However, the Court left open the prospect that such rules could be set aside if the employee shows there are "special circumstances" that make an exception reasonable. The most likely special circumstance, according to the Court, is a situation where the employee can show that the employer already makes numerous exceptions to its seniority rules, such that one more exception would not undermine the system. Because the Commission subsequently applied <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> to cases involving collective bargaining provisions on seniority, it is worth reviewing the Court's opinion in that case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, the plaintiff injured his back while working in a cargo handler position. He exercised his right to bid on a less strenuous mailroom position and held that position for a few years. He then learned that two employees with more seniority planned to bid on his position. He asked U.S. Airways to permanently assign him to the mailroom position as a reasonable accommodation. Ultimately, the company denied his request and he was terminated after he lost his job in the bidding process. Barnett argued that the ADA required the employer to always set aside seniority rules in favor of accommodation. Predictably, U.S. Airways argued that seniority rules should never be compromised by the ADA requirement of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1387"></span>Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In answering the question presented, we must consider the following statutory provisions. First, the ADA says that an employer may not "discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. 12112(a). Second, the ADA says that a "qualified" individual includes "an individual with a disability who, <span class="Italic">with</span> or without <span class="Italic">reasonable accommodation</span>, can perform the essential functions of" the relevant "employment position." 12111(8) (emphasis added). Third, the ADA says that "discrimination" includes an employer's "<span class="Italic">not making reasonable accommodations</span> to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified employee, <span class="Italic">unless</span> [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an <span class="Italic">undue hardship</span> on the operation of [its] business." 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). Fourth, the ADA says that the term "'reasonable accommodation' may include...reassignment to a vacant position." 12111(9)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties interpret this statutory language as applied to seniority systems in radically different ways. In US Airways' view, the fact that an accommodation would violate the rules of a seniority system always shows that the accommodation is not a "reasonable" one. In Barnett's polar opposite view, a seniority system violation never shows that an accommodation sought is not a "reasonable" one. Barnett concedes that a violation of seniority rules might help to show that the accommodation will work "undue" employer "hardship," but that is a matter for an employer to demonstrate case by case. We shall initially consider the parties' main legal arguments in support of these conflicting positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">US Airways' claim that a seniority system virtually always trumps a conflicting accommodation demand rests primarily upon its view of how the Act treats workplace "preferences." Insofar as a requested accommodation violates a disability-neutral workplace rule, such as a seniority rule, it grants the employee with a disability treatment that other workers could not receive. Yet the Act, US Airways says, seeks only "equal" treatment for those with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(9). It does not, it contends, require an employer to grant preferential treatment. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 66 (1990); S. Rep. No. 101-116, pp. 26-27 (1989) (employer has no "obligation to prefer <span class="Italic">applicants</span> with disabilities over other <span class="Italic">applicants</span>" (emphasis added)). Hence it does not require the employer to grant a request that, in violating a disability-neutral rule, would provide a preference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While linguistically logical, this argument fails to recognize what the Act specifies, namely, that preferences will sometimes prove necessary to achieve the Act's basic equal opportunity goal. The Act requires preferences in the form of "reasonable accommodations" that are needed for those with disabilities to obtain the <span class="Italic">same</span> workplace opportunities that those without disabilities automatically enjoy. By definition any special "accommodation" requires the employer to treat an employee with a disability differently, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, preferentially. And the fact that the difference in treatment violates an employer's disability-neutral rule cannot by itself place the accommodation beyond the Act's potential reach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Were that not so, the "reasonable accommodation" provision could not accomplish its intended objective. Neutral office assignment rules would automatically prevent the accommodation of an employee whose disability-imposed limitations require him to work on the ground floor. Neutral "break-from-work" rules would automatically prevent the accommodation of an individual who needs additional breaks from work, perhaps to permit medical visits. Neutral furniture budget rules would automatically prevent the accommodation of an individual who needs a different kind of chair or desk. Many employers will have neutral rules governing the kinds of actions most needed to reasonably accommodate a worker with a disability.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 42 U.S.C. 12111(9)(b) (setting forth examples such as "job restructuring," "part-time or modified work schedules," "acquisition or modification of equipment or devices," "and other similar accommodations"). Yet Congress, while providing such examples, said nothing suggesting that the presence of such neutral rules would create an automatic exemption. Nor have the lower courts made any such suggestion. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia-Ayala v.</span> <span class="Italic">Lederle Parenterals, Inc.</span>, 212 F.3d 638, 648 (CA1 2000) (requiring leave beyond that allowed under the company's own leave policy); <span class="Italic">Hendricks-Robinson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Excel Corp.</span>, 154 F.3d 685, 699 (CA7 1998) (requiring exception to employer's neutral "physical fitness" job requirement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the nature of the "reasonable accommodation" requirement, the statutory examples, and the Act's silence about the exempting effect of neutral rules together convince us that the Act does not create any such automatic exemption. The simple fact that an accommodation would provide a "preference"--in the sense that it would permit the worker with a disability to violate a rule that others must obey--cannot, <span class="Italic">in and of itself</span>, automatically show that the accommodation is not "reasonable." As a result, we reject the position taken by US Airways and JUSTICE SCALIA to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">US Airways also points to the ADA provisions stating that a "'reasonable accommodation' may include...reassignment to a <span class="Italic">vacant</span> position." 12111(9)(B) (emphasis added). And it claims that the fact that an established seniority system would assign that position to another worker automatically and always means that the position is not a "vacant" one. Nothing in the Act, however, suggests that Congress intended the word "vacant" to have a specialized meaning. And in ordinary English, a seniority system can give employees seniority rights allowing them to bid for a "vacant" position. The position in this case was held, at the time of suit, by Barnett, not by some other worker; and that position, under the US Airways seniority system, became an "open" one. Brief for Petitioner 5. Moreover, US Airways has said that it "reserves the right to change any and all" portions of the seniority system at will. Lodging of Respondent 2 (US Air Personnel Policy Guide for Agents). Consequently, we cannot agree with US Airways about the position's vacancy; nor do we agree that the Act would automatically deny Barnett's accommodation request for that reason.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">B</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Barnett argues that the statutory words "reasonable accommodation" mean only "effective accommodation," authorizing a court to consider the requested accommodation's ability to meet an individual's disability-related needs, and nothing more. On this view, a seniority rule violation, having nothing to do with the accommodation's effectiveness, has nothing to do with its "reasonableness." It might, at most, help to prove an "undue hardship on the operation of the business." But, he adds, that is a matter that the statute requires the employer to demonstrate, case by case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of this interpretation Barnett points to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations stating that "reasonable accommodation means...[m]odifications or adjustments...that <span class="Italic">enable</span> a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of [a] position." 29 CFR 1630(o)(ii) (2001) (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See also</span> H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 66; S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 35 (discussing reasonable accommodations in terms of "effectiveness," while discussing costs in terms of "undue hardship"). Barnett adds that any other view would make the words "reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship" virtual mirror images--creating redundancy in the statute. And he says that any such other view would create a practical burden of proof dilemma.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The practical burden of proof dilemma arises, Barnett argues, because the statute imposes the burden of demonstrating an "undue hardship" upon the employer, while the burden of proving "reasonable accommodation" remains with the plaintiff, here the employee. This allocation seems sensible in that an employer can more frequently and easily prove the presence of business hardship than an employee can prove its absence. But suppose that an employee must counter a claim of "seniority rule violation" in order to prove that an "accommodation" request is "reasonable." Would that not force the employee to prove what is in effect an absence, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, an absence of hardship, despite the statute's insistence that the employer "demonstrate" hardship's presence?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These arguments do not persuade us that Barnett's legal interpretation of "reasonable" is correct. For one thing, in ordinary English the word "reasonable" does not mean "effective." It is the word "accommodation," not the word "reasonable," that conveys the need for effectiveness. An <span class="Italic">ineffective</span> "modification" or "adjustment" will not <span class="Italic">accommodate</span> a disabled individual's limitations. Nor does an ordinary English meaning of the term "reasonable accommodation" make of it a simple, redundant mirror image of the term "undue hardship." The statute refers to an "undue hardship on the operation of the business." 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(5)(A). Yet a demand for an effective accommodation could prove unreasonable because of its impact, not on business operations, but on fellow employees--say because it will lead to dismissals, relocations, or modification of employee benefits to which an employer, looking at the matter from the perspective of the business itself, may be relatively indifferent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither does the statute's primary purpose require Barnett's special reading. The statute seeks to diminish or to eliminate the stereotypical thought processes, the thoughtless actions, and the hostile reactions that far too often bar those with disabilities from participating fully in the Nation's life, including the workplace. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 12101(a) and (b). These objectives demand unprejudiced thought and reasonable responsive reaction on the part of employers and fellow workers alike. They will sometimes require affirmative conduct to promote entry of disabled people into the workforce.<span class="Italic"> See supra</span>, at 6. They do not, however, demand action beyond the realm of the reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither has Congress indicated in the statute, or elsewhere, that the word "reasonable" means no more than "effective." The EEOC regulations do say that reasonable accommodations "enable" a person with a disability to perform the essential functions of a task. But that phrasing simply emphasizes the statutory provision's basic objective. The regulations do not say that "enable" and "reasonable" mean the same thing. And as discussed below, no circuit court has so read them. <span class="Italic">But see</span> 228 F.3d, at 1122-1123 (Gould, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1388"></span>Finally, an ordinary language interpretation of the word "reasonable" does not create the "burden of proof" dilemma to which Barnett points. Many of the lower courts, while rejecting both US Airways' and Barnett's more absolute views, have reconciled the phrases "reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship" in a practical way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">They have held that a plaintiff/employee (to defeat a defendant/employer's motion for summary judgment) need only show that an "accommodation" seems reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Reed v.</span> <span class="Italic">LePage Bakeries, Inc.</span>, 244 F.3d 254, 259 (CA1 2001) (plaintiff meets burden on reasonableness by showing that, "at least on the face of things," the accommodation will be feasible for the employer); <span class="Italic">Borkowski v.</span> <span class="Italic">Valley Central School Dist.</span>, 63 F.3d 131, 138 (CA2 1995) (plaintiff satisfies "burden of production" by showing "plausible accommodation"); <span class="Italic">Barth v.</span> <span class="Italic">Gelb</span>, 2 F.3d 1180, 1187 (CADC 1993) (interpreting parallel language in Rehabilitation Act, stating that plaintiff need only show he seeks a "method of accommodation that is reasonable in the run of cases" (emphasis in oriGINAl)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the plaintiff has made this showing, the defendant/employer then must show special (typically case-specific) circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances.<span class="Italic"> See Reed</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 258-259 ("undue hardship inquiry focuses on the hardships imposed...in the context of the particular [employer's] operations") (quoting <span class="Italic">Barth</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1187); <span class="Italic">Borkowski</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 138 (after plaintiff makes initial showing, burden falls on employer to show that particular accommodation "would cause it to suffer an undue hardship"); <span class="Italic">Barth</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1187 ("undue hardship inquiry focuses on the hardships imposed...in the context of the particular agency's operations").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not every court has used the same language, but their results are functionally similar. In our opinion, that practical view of the statute, applied consistently with ordinary summary judgment principles, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56, avoids Barnett's burden of proof dilemma, while reconciling the two statutory phrases ("reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship").</p>
<p class="noindent-c">III</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question in the present case focuses on the relationship between seniority systems and the plaintiff's need to show that an "accommodation" seems reasonable on its face, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, ordinarily or in the run of cases. We must assume that the plaintiff, an employee, is an "individual with a disability." He has requested assignment to a mailroom position as a "reasonable accommodation." We also assume that normally such a request would be reasonable within the meaning of the statute, were it not for one circumstance, namely, that the assignment would violate the rules of a seniority system. <span class="Italic">See</span> 12111(9) ("reasonable accommodation" may include "reassignment to a vacant position"). Does that circumstance mean that the proposed accommodation is not a "reasonable" one?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the answer to this question ordinarily is "yes." The statute does not require proof on a case-by-case basis that a seniority system should prevail. That is because it would not be reasonable in the run of cases that the assignment in question trump the rules of a seniority system. To the contrary, it will ordinarily be unreasonable for the assignment to prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several factors support our conclusion that a proposed accommodation will not be reasonable in the run of cases. Analogous case law supports this conclusion, for it has recognized the importance of seniority to employee-management relations. This Court has held that, in the context of a Title VII religious discrimination case, an employer need not adapt to an employee's special worship schedule as a "reasonable accommodation" where doing so would conflict with the seniority rights of other employees<span class="Italic">. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 79-80 (1977). The lower courts have unanimously found that collectively bargained seniority trumps the need for reasonable accommodation in the context of the linguistically similar Rehabilitation Act.<span class="Italic"> See Eckles v.</span> <span class="Italic">Consolidated Rail Corp.</span>, 94 F.3d 1041, 1047-1048 (CA7 1996) (collecting cases); <span class="Italic">Shea v.</span> <span class="Italic">Tisch</span>, 870 F.2d 786, 790 (CA1 1989); <span class="Italic">Carter v.</span> <span class="Italic">Tisch</span>, 822 F.2d 465, 469 (CA4 1987); <span class="Italic">Jasany v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service</span>, 755 F.2d 1244, 1251-1252 (CA6 1985). And several Circuits, though differing in their reasoning, have reached a similar conclusion in the context of seniority and the ADA.<span class="Italic"> See Smith v.</span> <span class="Italic">Midland Brake, Inc.</span>, 180 F.3d 1154, 1175 (CA10 1999); <span class="Italic">Feliciano v.</span> <span class="Italic">Rhode Island</span>, 160 F.3d 780, 787 (CA1 1998); <span class="Italic">Eckles</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1047-1048. All these cases discuss <span class="Italic">collectively bargained</span> seniority systems, not systems (like the present system) which are unilaterally imposed by management. But the relevant seniority system advantages, and related difficulties that result from violations of seniority rules, are not limited to collectively bargained systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For one thing, the typical seniority system provides important employee benefits by creating, and fulfilling, employee expectations of fair, uniform treatment. These benefits include "job security and an opportunity for steady and predictable advancement based on objective standards." Brief for Petitioner 32 (citing <span class="Italic">Fallon &#x0026; Weiler, Firefighters v. Stotts: Conflicting Models of Racial Justice</span>, 1984 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 57-58). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 1 B. Lindemann &#x0026; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 72 (3d ed. 1996) ("One of the most important aspects of competitive seniority is its use in determining who will be laid off during a reduction in force"). They include "an element of due process," limiting "unfairness in personnel decisions." Gersuny, Origins of Seniority Provisions in Collective Bargaining, 33 Lab. L. J. 518, 519 (1982). And they consequently encourage employees to invest in the employing company, accepting "less than their value to the firm early in their careers" in return for greater benefits in later years. J. Baron &#x0026; D. Kreps, Strategic Human Resources: Frameworks for General Managers 288 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most important for present purposes, to require the typical employer to show more than the existence of a seniority system might well undermine the employees' expectations of consistent, uniform treatment--expectations upon which the seniority system's benefits depend. That is because such a rule would substitute a complex case-specific "accommodation" decision made by management for the more uniform, impersonal operation of seniority rules. Such management decisionmaking, with its inevitable discretionary elements, would involve a matter of the greatest importance to employees, namely, layoffs; it would take place outside, as well as inside, the confines of a court case; and it might well take place fairly often. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(1), (estimating that some 43 million Americans suffer from physical or mental disabilities). We can find nothing in the statute that suggests Congress intended to undermine seniority systems in this way. And we consequently conclude that the employer's showing of violation of the rules of a seniority system is by itself ordinarily sufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">B</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiff (here the employee) nonetheless remains free to show that special circumstances warrant a finding that, despite the presence of a seniority system (which the ADA may not trump in the run of cases), the requested "accommodation" is "reasonable" on the particular facts. That is because special circumstances might alter the important expectations described above. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Borkowski</span>, 63 F.3d, at 137 ("[A]n accommodation that imposed burdens that would be unreasonable for most members of an industry might nevertheless be required of an individual defendant in light of that employer's particular circumstances").<span class="Italic"> See also</span> <span class="Italic">Woodman v.</span> <span class="Italic">Runyon</span>, 132 F.3d 1330, 1343-1344 (CA10 1997). The plaintiff might show, for example, that the employer, having retained the right to change the seniority system unilaterally, exercises that right fairly frequently, reducing employee expectations that the system will be followed--to the point where one more departure, needed to accommodate an individual with a disability, will not likely make a difference. The plaintiff might show that the system already contains exceptions such that, in the circumstances, one further exception is unlikely to matter. We do not mean these examples to exhaust the kinds of showings that a plaintiff might make. But we do mean to say that the plaintiff must bear the burden of showing special circumstances that make an exception from the seniority system reasonable in the particular case. And to do so, the plaintiff must explain why, in the particular case, an exception to the employer's seniority policy can constitute a "reasonable accommodation" even though in the ordinary case it cannot.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">IV</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its question presented, US Airways asked us whether the ADA requires an employer to assign a disabled employee to a particular position even though another employee is entitled to that position under the employer's "established seniority system." We answer that <span class="Italic">ordinarily</span> the ADA does not require that assignment. Hence, a showing that the assignment would violate the rules of a seniority system warrants summary judgment for the employer--unless there is more. The plaintiff must present evidence of that "more," namely, special circumstances surrounding the particular case that demonstrate the assignment is nonetheless reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the lower courts took a different view of the matter, and because neither party has had an opportunity to seek summary judgment in accordance with the principles we set forth here, we vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Caldwell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984658 (2002), the Commission found it had no occasion to determine if <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> impacted on the agency's obligation to reassign the complainant since she had failed to establish that it was likely there were any vacant positions to which she could be reassigned.</p>
<p class="noindent">Later, in <span class="Italic">Burnett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981618 (2002), the Commission found a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that permitted reassignment of disabled employees presented the very kind of special circumstances noted in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>. In <span class="Italic">Burnett</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis focuses on whether complainant demonstrated that reassignment, though available, was a reasonable accommodation in light of the seniority rights of other employees. In <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Airways v. Barnett</span> (___U.S.___, 122 S. Ct. 1516 (2002)), the Supreme Court considered how the ADA resolved a conflict between the interests of a disabled employee <span id="Page_1389"></span>in a particular assignment and the interests of other workers with seniority rights in the same assignment. The Supreme Court held that normally, in the run of cases, the employers' seniority system will prevail over the disabled employee's right to reassignment unless "special circumstances" are shown to exist. Special circumstances might exist, the court explained, where an employee shows that the system already contains exceptions such that further exceptions are unlikely to make a difference<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1525.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the record, we find that complainant has demonstrated that reassignment was a reasonable accommodation and that the parties specifically bargained for and agreed to an exception to the posting requirement. After reviewing the evidence in its entirety, we conclude there is no real conflict as the agency argues, because the CBA provides for accommodations even where someone with a disability has less seniority. Additionally, the evidence demonstrates the existence of special circumstances of the kind contemplated by <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>. The record clearly indicates that the agency had in place a detailed procedure for placing employees with impairments and disabilities, both temporary and permanent, into light/limited duty positions. Although the agency argues that the CBA barred it from reassigning employees with disabilities, the evidence establishes that the agency fully embraced the concept of reassignment at the national and local levels as an exception to the duty to post positions. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the CBA explicitly provided for "reassignment [of employees] to temporary and permanent light duty or other assignments." (Article 13, Assignment of Ill or Injured Regular Workforce Employees, Section 1A). This provision also encompassed the reassignment of an employee within the same installation even if such assignment reduced the number of hours of work for the supplemental work force. (Art. 13, Sec. 4). Further, the CBA provided that after all efforts are exhausted in the employee's present craft, "consideration will be given to reassignment to another craft or occupational group." (Art. 13, Sec. 4(a)). Therefore, the CBA provided for reassignment of employees in circumstances similar to those of complainant and was not a bar, as the AJ concluded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The testimony of agency witnesses established that the agency considered light duty assignments to be an exception to its bid procedures. Complainant's supervisor (S1) in the Transportation/Network unit illustrates the agency's actual practice in implementing Article 13. S1 testified that if complainant had submitted a request for light duty, the possibility existed that complainant could have been assigned to a new clerk position posted to cover Drop-Shipment duties. If the position was not filled through a light duty request, she stated, the job would have been posted and awarded through the bid process. The agency's labor relations specialist corroborated S1's account when she testified that she considered Article 13 to state an exception to the posting requirement when a job is used to accommodate an employee's physical or mental condition. In addition, the Union's National Agreement provides for "permanent reassignment" of any ill or injured full-time regular or part-time flexible employee having a minimum of five years of agency service, setting forth basic criteria for submitting a request. (Article 13 B.1.). The Memorandum of Understanding between the local Union and management at the Newark facility, also set forth general provisions for identification of light duty positions for purposes of reassignment in various units. This, in turn, was communicated to managers and supervisors by memorandum dated February 3, 1992, outlining procedures for considering employees' light duty requests. The procedures contemplated that allocated slots for light duty be available on both a temporary or permanent basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we conclude that the agency's process for granting permanent light duty requests operated outside of the bid process and, therefore, reassignment was a reasonable accommodation. We conclude that the agency's system for reassigning employees with disabilities was, in both form and substance, an exception to the agency's requirement that positions be posted for bid. As it was specifically negotiated, the Union and the agency made specific provisions for reassignment of individuals with impairments as part of its Collective Bargaining Agreement. Accordingly, the particular facts of this case indicate that the parties provided exceptions to its bidding process when placing an individual such as complainant and that these were considered to be special circumstances<span class="Italic">. Barnett</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find no contractual bar to reassigning complainant, we examine the agency's efforts in this regard and conclude that opportunities existed for the agency to reassign her but that the agency did not pursue them. As the AJ concluded, the evidence established that there were vacant positions available to which complainant could have been reassigned. According to the testimony of the Manager, Processing and Distribution (S2) there were two general office positions available in April 1994 and potentially others that were available for the purpose of reassigning complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argued that complainant failed to bid for available positions which would have accommodated her condition and that she was at fault for being too selective in her pursuit of another position. As the Commission has stated, when reassignment is the most appropriate accommodation to an employee's disability, the agency must identify whether any vacancies exist and notify the employee of the results<span class="Italic">. Guidance</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In addition, complainant has an evidentiary burden and must establish that more likely than not, vacancies existed to which she could have been reassigned. This does not mean, as the agency suggests, that complainant's failure to bid for certain positions constituted a failure to identify vacant positions. We conclude the agency was aware that there were vacant funded positions available but unreasonably assumed that complainant would be exposed to allergens in any of these positions. We further find that complainant made reasonable efforts to identify vacant positions for which she was qualified and in which her exposure to allergens was minimized.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that reassignment was reasonable in this case, we must determine whether the agency proved undue hardship by some other means than the alleged conflict with the CBA<span class="Italic">. Barnett</span> at 1521. The agency did not produce any additional evidence of undue hardship other than the existence of provisions of the CBA already discussed and an assertion that the same allergens would have been present in any of the positions complainant identified. The record was clear that complainant worked in two different positions outside of the letter sorting area without a recurrence of her allergic reactions. We find therefore, that the agency has not met its burden of demonstrating that the requested reassignment posed an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsequent to the initial holding in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, the Commission held that an agency may not rely on the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement in failing to consider reassignment as an accommodation option. In <span class="Italic">Hardesty v. USPS</span>, 01842833 (1986), the agency refused to consider reassigning an employee with multiple sclerosis to a clerk position because the employee did not have five years of service. The agency contended that the national collective bargaining agreement restricted such reassignments to employees with five years service. Although the Commission found that the provision did not apply to the situation presented, it also noted that a collective bargaining agreement "does not give the agency license or permission to discriminate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">But the Commission later reversed itself and held that when an agency establishes that a nondiscriminatory, collective bargaining agreement prevents it from reassigning an employee with a disability to another position, it has met its burden of establishing an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Wiley v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880197 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Carter v. Tisch</span>, 822 F.2d 464 (4th Cir. 1987)); <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 44 F.E.P. Cases 1305 (M.D. Pa. 1987). To reassign the employee to a unit that requires seniority bidding would violate the rights of other, more senior employees. "Absent a showing that the collective bargaining agreement had a discriminatory effect or intent," the agency is not required to violate the agreement to accommodate an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a section of Part 1614 now abolished, the Commission resolved the conflict by stating that the Postal Service was not required to violate the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to achieve reassignment as an accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(g). However, in its <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination," at p. 841, n.114, the Commission noted that its regulation did not comport with the requirements of the ADA. The Commission now holds that an agency is not required to violate the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement that allows priority in reassignments on the basis of seniority without a showing on the part of the complainant that "special circumstances" exist. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113437 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>, the Commission rejected the approach of some courts to conflicts between collective bargaining agreement seniority rights and reasonable accommodation, noting in its <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination," at p. 842, n.115:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Certain circuits have held that it is an undue hardship to provide a reasonable accommodation when doing so will violate the seniority provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See Eckles v. Consolidated Rail Corp.</span>, 94 F.3d 1041, 1048, 5 AD Cas. (BNA) 1367, 1372 (7th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Kralik v. Durbin</span>, 130 F.3d 76, 83, 7 AD Cas. (BNA) 1040, 1045-46 (3d Cir. 1997). These decisions create a virtual <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that the ADA does not mandate as a reasonable accommodation an action that infringes on the seniority rights of another employee in a collective bargaining agreement. In the EEOC's view, such a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule nullifies Congress' intent that undue hardship always be determined on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> House Judiciary Report, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 6, at 42. Indeed, Congress believed employers could consider the terms of a collective bargaining agreement as one factor, but not the determining factor, in assessing undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> Senate Report, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 6, at 32; House Education and Labor Report, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 6, at 63. Finally, both <span class="Italic">Eckles</span> and <span class="Italic">Kralik</span> rely heavily upon pre-ADA Rehabilitation Act case law, despite the fact that Congress amended that statute by incorporating the ADA's employment discrimination provisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 791(g), 793(d), 794(d) (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission will not accept, without scrutiny, an agency assertion that accommodation would violate a collective bargaining agreement. Particularly <span id="Page_1390"></span>when the agency relies upon its interpretation of a provision that is open to more than one interpretation, it must present evidence to clarify the meaning of the provision. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Focht v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931717 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to light duty, the agency has cited Article 13 of its collective bargaining agreement, which states that "regular rural [carrier] routes shall not be considered for any light duty assignment." This does not establish, however, that appellant was ineligible for any light duty assignment. It could in the alternative mean, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, that a light duty employee could not be assigned to an existing Rural Carrier position. There is no evidence or testimony in the record to clarify the meaning of this provision. There is also no record evidence showing what, if any, light duty work was available at appellant's facility that he could have performed and whether any other employees required or were performing such light duty assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is also a complete dearth of information in the investigative report regarding the possibility of reassignment to another regular position at the facility, including any relevant provision(s) of the collective bargaining agreement and any other employee(s) with bidding or other rights to the position(s). Without any evidence as to other positions that appellant could have safely performed and to which he could have been reassigned, we cannot make a well-founded determination as to whether he was a qualified person with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because, in this case, the agency did not do an adequate investigation encompassing limited duty or reassignment, we cannot determine whether one of these forms of accommodation through limited duty or reassignment would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the agency's program.</p>
<p class="noindent">The provision was simply unclear as to whether it applied to the reassignment of rural carriers to light duty positions or to the use of rural carrier assignments as light duty positions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944389 (1996), the Commission found the complainant, who suffered from a chronic sleep disorder, should have been reasonably accommodated by reassignment to a position on the day shift. The Commission rejected an agency argument that the reassignment would violate the collective bargaining agreement. In part, the Commission relied upon the fact that the union supported the complainant's grievance in concluding that the reassignment would not have violated the bargaining agreement. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that appellant was unable to perform the essential functions of his night shift machine distribution clerk (MPLSM) position. We find, however, for the same reasons as the AJ, that appellant was a qualified person with a disability because he could perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of a vacant position if reassigned, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a day shift manual distribution clerk position. We further note that appellant showed, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was qualified for such a position in that he worked as a manual distribution clerk for more than three years prior to becoming a machine distribution clerk, was repeatedly detailed to manual distribution clerk duties boxing mail during the day shift, and was ultimately reassigned to this position by the agency in March 1993. The plant manager's testimony that appellant performed "make work" when detailed and reassigned to this position is not supported by the record. On cross-examination, he conceded that he was unaware of the duties appellant performed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, it was incumbent on the agency to offer to reassign appellant to a funded, vacant position, if available. We agree with the finding of the AJ, for the reasons set forth by the AJ, that such a position was available to appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the agency's argument that a day shift manual distribution clerk position was not available to appellant under the CBA. The agency argues that under the CBA, this position must be secured through the bid procedure where the bidder with the highest seniority is awarded the position. However, appellant has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the CBA did not preclude a reassignment pursuant to the provisions in Article 13. This is supported by the language of Article 13 of the CBA, and the fact that the union supported appellant's grievance position that such a reassignment was permissible under Article 13 of the CBA. The agency did not submit any persuasive testimonial or documentary evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we agree with the finding of the AJ that appellant was discriminated against on the basis of his disability when he was not reassigned. The question arises, however, as to when this discrimination began. Appellant argues that the agency commenced discriminating against him in November 1990, not October 1991 as found by the AJ. We find the discrimination commenced on or about February 2, 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant submitted a letter to the agency from his physician dated November 15, 1990 which stated appellant had a seizure disorder with multiple episodes over the past month, and recommended he be assigned to the day shift for two months to "effectuate better control and maintain a state of alertness." The record does not show exactly when appellant submitted the letter to the agency. Pursuant to this request, the agency assigned appellant to the day shift boxing mail from December 1, 1990 to February 1, 1991. We find there was no discrimination until this detail ended. First, appellant only requested a temporary detail, not a reassignment. Second, the agency complied with the request within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, during and after this detail, appellant submitted letters from the same physician that stated appellant remained under treatment for a chronic sleep disorder and it was imperative he remain on the day tour to maintain a consistent sleep pattern. A reading of the oriGINAl letter reveals these subsequent letters were referring to appellant's seizure disorder. While appellant may or may not have used postal forms designed to ask for a "temporary" detail, the latter two letters from his physician indicate appellant was actually in search of a reassignment, since they stated appellant's condition was chronic. Accordingly, we find that the agency's obligation to attempt to reassign appellant arose prior to the end of the first detail. Further, we find, for the reasons stated by the AJ that a reassignment was available to appellant. Hence, we hold that the agency discriminatorily failed to reasonably accommodate appellant when his first detail ended. This discrimination arising out of a failure to reasonably accommodate a disability continued until appellant was provided a permanent reassignment on or about March 20, 1993, with the exception of the two periods he was temporarily reasonably accommodated in March and April 1991, and September and October 1991.</p>
