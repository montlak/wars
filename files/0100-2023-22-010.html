<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-11"><span class="space">E.</span> CRIMINAL ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Using a criminal conviction record as an employment selection criterion "has a disproportionate impact on blacks; courts have therefore held that this practice is discriminatory except where an employer determines that an applicant's criminal conduct demonstrates he is unsuited for the position sought." <span class="Italic">Thurman v. USPS</span>, 01871428 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Green v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co.</span>, 523 F.2d 1290 (8th Cir. 1975)). The same policy applies to criminal arrests. <span class="Italic">See Beaton v. Attorney General</span>, 01996580 (2002); <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01983135 (2001). Courts consistently have found that blacks have a higher arrest and conviction rate than whites and have ruled that use of conviction records to disqualify employment applicants must be justified as a business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency must assess whether the conviction affects the applicant's ability to perform in the position, including consideration of "(1) the nature, number and circumstances of the offense for which the individual was convicted; (2) the length of time intervening between the conviction of the offense(s) and the employment decision; and (3) the individual's employment history." <span class="Italic">Thurman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. "An agency must show that the conviction is job-related and that some factor or factors were sufficiently negative to support the rejection." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Thurman</span>, the Commission noted that the complainant's convictions were for minor offenses, that the offenses occurred some nine or 10 years previous to his application and that the complainant was a U.S. Army veteran with a degree in business management and a long and stable employment history. Unfortunately, the Commission also found the complainant falsified his employment application and, thus, would have been disqualified from employment even absent the discriminatory criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2012, the Commission issued EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>, No. 915.002 (2012), acknowledging that excluding candidates with criminal records from employment opportunities "may still operate to disproportionately and unjustifiably exclude people of a particular race or national origin." The Commission's guidance on the subject as it relates disparate treatment reads:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disparate Treatment Discrimination and Criminal Records</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A covered employer is liable for violating Title VII when the plaintiff demonstrates that it treated him differently because of his race, national origin, or another protected basis. For example, there is Title VII disparate treatment liability where the evidence shows that a covered employer rejected an African American applicant based on his criminal record but hired a similarly situated White applicant with a comparable criminal record.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example&#x2003;1</span>: <span class="Italic">Disparate Treatment Based on Race</span>. John, who is White, and Robert, who is African American, are both recent graduates of State University. They have similar educational backgrounds, skills, and work experience. They each pled guilty to charges of possessing and distributing marijuana as high school students, and neither of them had any subsequent contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After college, they both apply for employment with Office Jobs, Inc., which, after short intake interviews, obtains their consent to conduct a background check. Based on the outcome of the background check, which reveals their drug convictions, an Office Jobs, Inc., representative decides not to refer Robert for a follow-up interview. The representative remarked to a co-worker that Office Jobs, Inc., cannot afford to refer "these drug dealer types" to client companies. However, the same representative refers John for an interview, asserting that John's youth at the time of the conviction and his subsequent lack of contact with the criminal justice system make the conviction unimportant. Office Jobs, Inc., has treated John and Robert differently based on race, in violation of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII prohibits "not only decisions driven by racial [or ethnic] animosity, but also decisions infected by stereotyped thinking...." Thus, an employer's decision to reject a job applicant based on racial or ethnic stereotypes about criminality--rather than qualifications and suitability for the position--is unlawful disparate treatment that violates Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example&#x2003;2</span>: <span class="Italic">Disparate Treatment Based on National Origin</span>. Tad, who is White, and Nelson, who is Latino, are both recent high school graduates with grade point averages above 4.0 and college plans. While Nelson has successfully worked full-time for a landscaping company during the summers, Tad only held occasional lawn-mowing and camp-counselor jobs. In an interview for a research job with Meaningful and Paid Internships, Inc. (MPII), Tad discloses that he pled guilty to a felony at age 16 for accessing his school's computer system over the course of several months without authorization and changing his classmates' grades. Nelson, in an interview with MPII, emphasizes his successful prior work experience, from which he has good references, but also discloses that, at age 16, he pled guilty to breaking and entering into his high school as part of a class prank that caused little damage to school property. Neither Tad nor Nelson had subsequent contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The hiring manager at MPII invites Tad for a second interview, despite his record of criminal conduct. However, the same hiring manager sends Nelson a rejection notice, saying to a colleague that Nelson is only qualified to do manual labor and, moreover, that he has a criminal record. In light of the evidence showing that Nelson's and Tad's educational backgrounds are similar, that Nelson's work experience is more extensive, and that Tad's criminal conduct is more indicative of untrustworthiness, MPII has failed to state a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for rejecting Nelson. If Nelson filed a Title VII charge alleging disparate treatment based on national origin and the EEOC's investigation confirmed these facts, the EEOC would find reasonable cause to believe that discrimination occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are several kinds of evidence that may be used to establish that race, national origin, or other protected characteristics motivated an employer's use of criminal records in a selection decision, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic">Biased statements</span>. Comments by the employer or decisionmaker that are derogatory with respect to the charging party's protected group, or that express group-related stereotypes about criminality, might be evidence that such biases affected the evaluation of the applicant's or employee's criminal record.</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic">Inconsistencies in the hiring process</span>. Evidence that the employer requested criminal history information more often for individuals with certain racial or ethnic backgrounds, or gave Whites but not racial minorities the opportunity to explain their criminal history, would support a showing of disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic">Similarly situated comparators (individuals who are similar to the charging party in relevant respects, except for membership <span id="Page_972"></span>in the protected group)</span>. Comparators may include people in similar positions, former employees, and people chosen for a position over the charging party. The fact that a charging party was treated differently than individuals who are not in the charging party's protected group by, for example, being subjected to more or different criminal background checks or to different standards for evaluating criminal history, would be evidence of disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic">Employment testing</span>. Matched-pair testing may reveal that candidates are being treated differently because of a protected status.</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> <span class="Italic">Statistical evidence</span>. Statistical analysis derived from an examination of the employer's applicant data, workforce data, and/or third party criminal background history data may help to determine if the employer counts criminal history information more heavily against members of a protected group.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brantley v. USPS</span>, 01871797 (1988), the Commission found that the use of a prior conviction record to deny the complainant reinstatement as a letter carrier was discriminatory where the agency failed to conduct an individual assessment of the above factors. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Brantley</span> was convicted on drug charges, served three years of a five-year sentence and applied for reinstatement immediately following his release from prison:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he record does not provide data or documents which indicate that the agency conducted an individualized assessment of appellant's employability, pursuant to established case law, Commission policy, or for that matter the agency's own provisions as described in the employee relations manual. Instead the agency summarily concluded that appellant's reemployment would not serve the best interests of the agency, without affording him appropriate consideration. Under these circumstances, the Commission finds that the agency arbitrarily denied appellant reinstatement based upon his prior conviction. In this regard, no evaluation was done on appellant regarding the specific factors of his record, and how those factors affected his ability to perform a letter carrier job. Thus, the agency did not make an informed decision as to whether appellant's conviction was job related....</p>
<p class="noindent">It is clear that the Commission requires a highly individualized assessment that is based on specific facts, rather than speculation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The focus of the agency's inquiry must be the actual conduct involved and not the mere fact of arrest. <span class="Italic">Beaton, supra</span>. For a full discussion of <span class="Italic">Beaton</span>, see Chapter 11 under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-20-008.html#sec11-8">Criminal Arrests</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Alex W. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141016 (2016), the Commission upheld a finding of no discrimination where the agency did not select the complainant for a casual clerk/mail handler position due to the his "two felony convictions against property and the government that were applicable to the position for which he applied because he would have access to and handle the public's mail" and because of his "open probation status." Crediting the agency's policy on the matter as consistent with EEOC guidance, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Alex W</span>., wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency personnel indicated that they referenced the Agency Handbook section 514.37 entitled, "Evaluating Employability of Applicants with Criminal Convictions," and complied with the procedures as outlined in that section of the Agency Handbook. Section 514.37 of the Handbook states in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is the Postal Service policy to evaluate the employability of each applicant with a criminal conviction record individually. The fact that an applicant has a criminal conviction record is not sufficient to disqualify that applicant from postal employment. Instead, an applicant should be rejected on the basis of a history of criminal conviction only after a specific finding that the history is directly related to the applicant's present capacity to perform as a Postal Service employee. To the extent available, such factors as the following must be considered during such an evaluation: (a) applicant's age at the time of each offense; (b) nature and underlying circumstances of the offense; (c) length of time elapsed since the applicant's offense; (d) evidence of efforts toward rehabilitation, including job training or educational programs the applicant may have participated in during incarceration; (e) information supplied by penal authorities, parole and probation officers, social workers, or social agencies regarding the applicant's progress toward rehabilitation or employability; (f) applicant's employment record, including participation in a job training program; (g) dispensations that may have been granted by the authorities to evidence the applicant's rehabilitation such as certificates of relief from disabilities, certificates of good conduct, and certificates restoring civil rights; and (h) nature and location of the position sought by the applicant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the Agency considered several of these factors in making its decision on whether or not to hire Complainant. The Agency clearly considered the nature of the offense; the length of time that had elapsed between his application for employment and the commission of the offense; and any evidence toward rehabilitation. Specifically, the Agency expressed concern with the fact that Complainant was still in "open probation status" at the time he applied for the Casual Clerk/Mail Handler position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that a review of the Agency's application of its policy with respect to applicants with criminal conviction records as articulated in the AJ's decision, and adopted by the Agency's final order are consistent with the principles set forth by the Commission in its guidance document <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>, No. 915.002 (April 25, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, no claim is stated when the complainant fails to identify a policy or practice of excluding applicants for employment on the basis of arrest or conviction records. <span class="Italic">Matthews v. Postmaster General</span>, 01920662 (1992). In that case, although the selecting official considered the complainant's conviction record in making the selection, it was clear that the complainant was not excluded from consideration. Moreover, the record established that other selectees had conviction records.</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of criminal arrest records can potentially support a claim of both disparate treatment and disparate impact discrimination. In reversing a grant of summary judgment in <span class="Italic">Taryn S. v. Selective Service System</span>, 0120113421 (2015), and remanding the case for further discovery and a hearing, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Disparate Treatment</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that she was subjected to disparate treatment when she was not selected for the Contact Representative position. A claim of disparate treatment is examined under the three-part analysis first enunciated in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). For Complainant to prevail, she must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by presenting facts that, if unexplained, reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination. i.e., that a prohibited consideration was a factor in the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802; <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in a non-selection case, Complainant a complainant must show that: (1) she was a member of the protected class; (2) she applied for and was qualified for the position; (3) she was not selected for the position despite her qualifications; and (4) a similarly situated employee outside of her protected class was selected for the position. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802-803. The burden then shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). Once the Agency has met its burden, the Complainant bears the ultimate responsibility to persuade the fact finder by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency acted on the basis of a prohibited reason. <span class="Italic">See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination. Complainant is African-American, she was qualified for the position, and she was not selected for the position despite her qualifications. Additionally, the Selectee was a similarly-situated employee because she also had a misdemeanor battery conviction, she was outside of Complainant's protected class because she is White, and she was selected for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency articulated a reason for its actions. Specifically, the Agency stated that Complainant's offer was rescinded when the Agency learned of the contents of the police report and the circumstances surrounding Complainant's arrest, which allegedly was the result of a domestic dispute. The selecting officials and the Agency's Human Resources Officer felt that Complainant, who was a former police officer, should have had better self-control than to threaten someone and lose her temper as described in the police report. Additionally, the selecting officials noted that, according to the arrest records. Complainant allegedly lied to the police during the investigation. One of the selecting officials stated, "I don't want people in my office that might threaten someone or lose their temper."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the final step in the analysis, the inquiry moves to a consideration of whether Complainant carried her burden to demonstrate pretext. In order to prevail on her claim of discrimination, Complainant must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's articulated reason was a pretext for discrimination. Complainant can do this by showing that the Agency's explanation is unworthy of credence and that its actions were influenced by legally impermissible criteria, i.e., <span class="Italic">animus</span> toward her because of her race.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record shows that the Agency hired a White employee who was convicted of misdemeanor battery, the same offense of which Complainant was convicted. Commission Guidance states that an employer may be liable under Title VII where evidence shows that an employer rejected an African-American applicant based on her criminal <span id="Page_973"></span>record but hired a similarly-situated White applicant with a comparable criminal record. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>, No. 915.002, Section IV (Apr. 25, 2012) (Arrest and Conviction Guidance). Here, the record reveals that Complainant and the selectee had comparable convictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency based its reasons for rescinding Complainant's job offer on her arrest record and corresponding police report. As noted in the Commission's Arrest and Conviction Guidance, the fact that someone was subjected to an arrest does not establish that criminal conduct has occurred; arrests are not proof of criminal conduct, as many arrests do not result in criminal charges or the charges are dismissed. Arrest and Conviction Guidance, Sec. V(B)(2). We note that the contents of arrest records alone may not be sufficient to support an employment action, such as a non-selection, because the contents of the arrest record may be unreliable, as they have not been verified for their truthfulness and accuracy by a court. In cases such as the one before us now, where a Complainant disputes the contents of a police report that was relied upon in a selection decision, there may exist genuine issues of material fact that require a hearing before an EEOC AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ considered only the contents of Complainant's arrest report. We find that the AJ erred when she considered the contents of Complainant's arrest report instead of Complainant's court-issued conviction report. We further find that the AJ erred in rejecting Complainant's argument that the dismissed charges should not be considered. We find that dismissed charges that did not result in a conviction should not, of necessity, be dispositive in an employment action, such as determining whether an individual is qualified to perform the functions of a position, because criminal charges that have not resulted in a conviction are not reliable evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find that the record before us on appeal only contains a short, two-sentence summary of the Selectee's arrest and conviction that was provided by the Agency. Report of Investigation (ROI) at Exhibit F-19. The record before us on appeal does not contain any verifiable documentation regarding the Selectee's conviction, such as a conviction report from the court that explains the charges, what the Selectee was convicted of, and what sentence was imposed on the Selectee. Additionally, the record before us on appeal does not contain any verifiable documentation from a court regarding Complainant's conviction, such as her conviction report, official documentation regarding the charges that were dismissed by the court, and official court documentation regarding the sentence imposed on Complainant. Instead, the record contains only information about Complainant's arrest received from the Madison Police Department. As a result, the record is not sufficiently developed for a fact-finder to compare the Complainant's and the Selectee's convictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, it is not clear how the Agency received Complainant's arrest report from the Madison Police Department, and whether it is the Agency's policy or practice to obtain the arrest record and police reports of all applicants for employment. Similarly, it is not clear from the record if there were inconsistencies in the hiring process. For example, it is not clear from the record if the Agency also obtained the police report for the Selectee, or whether it based the information for the Selectee's conviction solely on the Selectee's explanation of the events. It is also not clear from the record if the Agency gave Complainant the opportunity to explain her version of the events contained in the arrest report and, if it did, the weight that the Agency gave to Complainant's explanation. As a result, there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that the Agency did not articulate how Complainant's conviction related to the duties of the Contact Representative position, and how Complainant's conviction rendered Complainant unqualified for the duties of the position. The record reveals that a selecting official stated, "I don't want people in my office that might threaten someone or lose their temper." It appears from the record that the selecting official inferred that, because of this one act, contained in an unverifiable police report, Complainant must have a bad temper and threaten people. We note that there is no evidence in the record that correlates Complainant's conviction to her qualifications to perform the specific duties of the Contact Representative position. As a result, this is a genuine issue of material fact in dispute. Accordingly, additional discovery and a hearing are necessary to complete the record in this case in order to resolve genuine issues of material fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Disparate Impact</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that the Agency is liable for disparate impact discrimination because the Agency had a neutral policy or practice for background checks that had a disparate impact on African-Americans. An Agency is liable for Title VII disparate impact where the evidence shows that the Agency's criminal record screening policy or practice disproportionately screens out a Title VII protected group and the Agency does not demonstrate that the policy or practice is job-related for the positions in question and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Arrest and Conviction Guidance, at Sec. V.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a claim of disparate impact, Complainant must show that an Agency practice or policy, while neutral on its face, disproportionately impacted members of the protected class. This is demonstrated through the presentation of statistical evidence that establishes a statistical disparity that is linked to the challenged practice or policy. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 994 (1988) (a complainant must present "statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion"). Specifically, Complainant must: (1) identify the specific practice or practices challenged; (2) show statistical disparities; and (3) show that the disparity is linked to the challenged practice or policy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Obas v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A04389 (May 16, 2002). The burden is on the Complainant to show that "the facially neutral standard in question affects those individuals [within the protected group] in a significantly discriminatory pattern." <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 329 (1977); <span class="Italic">see also Gaines v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03990119 (Aug. 31, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a complainant establishes disparate impact, the burden shifts to the respondent agency to demonstrate that the employment action, such as the use of information obtained in a criminal background check, is job-related for the position and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co</span>., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971). To establish that a criminal conduct exclusion that has a disparate impact is job-related and consistent with business necessity under Title VII, the employer--here the Agency--needs to show that the policy operates to effectively link specific criminal conduct, and its dangers, with the risks inherent in the duties of a particular position. Arrest and Conviction Guidance at Sec. V(B)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency may meet the "job-related and consistent with business necessity standard" if the Agency validates the criminal conduct screen for the position in question per the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (Uniform Guidelines) standards. Arrest and Conviction Guidance at Sec. V(B)(4); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1607. If the Agency does not use the Uniform Guidelines for validation, the Agency must analyze three factors that are relevant to assessing whether an exclusion is job-related for the position in question and consistent with job necessity: 1) the nature and gravity of the offense or conduct, 2) the time that has passed since the offense or conduct and/or completion of the sentence, and 3) the nature of the job held or sought. <span class="Italic">Green v. Missouri Pacific Railroad</span>, 523 F.2d 1290, 1293 (8th Cir. 1975); Arrest and Conviction Guidance at Section V(B). If all three factors arc met, the Agency should then provide an opportunity for an individualized assessment for people excluded by the screen to determine whether the policy as applied is job related and consistent with business necessity. Arrest and Conviction Guidance at Section V(B)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the record is not sufficiently developed for us to determine whether there was a disparate impact on African-Americans by the Agency's background check policies or practices. The record must be further developed through additional discovery and a hearing to determine exactly what the Agency's policies and practices are for background checks regarding criminal arrests and convictions, and the impact those policies and practices have on African-American employees and applicants for employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following information, along with any other relevant information, should be gathered to determine if the Agency's background check policies and practices disproportionately impacted African Americans. Does the Agency have a formal, written background check policy? Does the Agency conduct a background check for all Agency employees? Does the Agency conduct a background check for all employees selected for the Contact Representative position? Do all background checks include criminal background checks? If so, do all criminal background checks include checks for both arrests and convictions? At what point in the hiring process are employees subjected to a criminal background check? How does the Agency obtain arrest and/or conviction information? How are the criminal records evaluated by the Agency? What criteria does the Agency use to determine whether an arrest and/or conviction results in a person being not qualified for a position? To what extent is information from arrest records and criminal charges that do not result in convictions taken into consideration in employment actions? Does the Agency always allow an employee or applicant the opportunity to explain information found in a criminal record?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, more information is needed regarding how many employees or applicants Agency-wide have a criminal history, and the crimes of which they were convicted. Of those employees or applicants who have a criminal history, which employees or applicants (and their corresponding race) have either been selected for a position, or not selected for a position because of their criminal history? Further, which of those employees or applicants (and their corresponding race) have retained their position, or have been terminated from their employment or had their job offers revoked because of the criminal history? The record indicates that <span id="Page_974"></span>there was at least one other Black employee who had been hired and subsequently terminated after it was revealed through a background check that he had arrests and convictions. ROI at 5, Exhibit F19. However, the information regarding this incident is very sparse in the record, and there is no indication of the outcome of background checks for other employees and/or applicants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency must supply this information and other relevant information to Complainant, who in turn must present sufficient statistical evidence at the hearing, which may be in the form of expert testimony that establishes whether a statistical disparity exists that is linked to the challenged practice or policy. Therefore, we find that additional discovery and a hearing are necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">In remanding the case for further development of the record, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0120133297 (2015), elaborated on the factors that should go into a determination of whether a policy or practice of using arrest and conviction records has an adverse impact:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following information, along with any other relevant information, should be gathered to determine if the Agency's background check policies and practices have a disproportionate impact on African-Americans applicants:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Does the Agency have a formal, written background check policy, including the use of criminal history of applicants?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Does the Agency conduct a background check for all Agency applicants for employment?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Does the Agency conduct a background check for all employees selected for the Information Technology Specialist position?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Do all background checks include criminal background checks? On both arrests and convictions?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--How does the Agency obtain arrest and/or conviction information?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--How are the criminal records evaluated by the Agency?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--What criteria does the Agency use to determine whether an arrest and/or conviction results in a person not being qualified for a position?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Does the Agency always allow an applicant the opportunity to explain information found in a criminal record?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Does a history of an arrest and/or conviction always result in an applicant not being hired? If there are exceptions, what are the policies and practices concerning these exceptions?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Provide agency-wide statistics on those applicants (identified by race) with a criminal history who have been hired and those who have had their job offers revoked.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--What are the policies and procedures for individuals who are already employees when it is discovered that they have a criminal history? Provide agency-wide statistics on those employees (identified by race) who have retained their positions despite a criminal history and those who have been terminated because of that history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, Complainant should be allowed to respond to the evidence gathered with any other relevant information before the investigation is closed. Following the completion of the supplemental investigation, the Agency shall again provide Complainant with his right to request a hearing or an immediate final agency decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not discriminatory for an agency to terminate employment when the complainant conceals an arrest on his employment application if the agency shows that it traditionally views withholding such information as falsification of the employment application. <span class="Italic">Vierra v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01930751 (1993). It is not relevant that the agency employs persons who have allegedly committed more severe crimes if the reason for termination is not the arrest, but the concealment of information on the employment application.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the Commission extended the same policy to criminal arrests. In <span class="Italic">Rodriguez, supra</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the Commission's position that an employer's policy or practice of excluding individuals from employment on the basis of an arrest or arrests not leading to convictions has a disparate impact on Black and Hispanic employees or applicants which is discriminatory where it is not supported by business justification<span class="Italic">. See</span> Policy Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest Records in Employment Decisions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (September 7, 1990) ("Policy Guidance"). Arrest records, unlike conviction records, do not constitute reliable evidence that a person engaged in the conduct alleged. Thus, in order to justify the use of arrest records as a basis for adverse employment action, the agency must show that it considered: (1) the nature or gravity of the offense(s); (2) the time elapsed since the arrest(s); (3) the nature of the employment position held or sought; and (4) whether the arrest record reflects the employee's conduct. The agency should, therefore, examine the surrounding circumstances, offer the employee a meaningful opportunity to explain, and if the employee denies engaging in the conduct, make any necessary follow-up inquiries in order to evaluate the employee's credibility<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Maxwell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03930138 (March 22, 1994). "Where it appears that an applicant or employee engaged in the conduct for which he was arrested and that the conduct is job-related and relatively recent, exclusion is justified." Policy Guidance at 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that complainant's proposed termination was in fact based on his arrest. While the DM also cites complainant's job performance as a basis for termination, we find that this testimony is not credible, inasmuch as management concedes that complainant was advised before he commenced leave that he was "doing okay," and it is implausible for management to contend that his performance suddenly thereafter became an issue during the course of his unpaid education leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing standard, we find that the agency has failed to satisfy its burden to establish a business justification for utilizing complainant's personal arrest record as a basis for employment action. Specifically, while complainant admitted to the DM that he had left the scene of a traffic stop against a police officer's instruction, he explained that he believed his conduct was excusable because the stop was discriminatory, and that he had filed a complaint with the local Human Rights Commission regarding a pattern of harassment by the arresting police officer. Yet, neither the DM nor anyone else from the agency contacted the Human Rights Commission, or the police department, for more information. Similarly, although the DM also contends he relied in part on another employee's report that a video rental store had telephoned the office regarding complainant's failure to return a rented video cassette recorder, the DM complainant told the DM that video tapes, not equipment, were at issue, and that the matter had been resolved. While the DM contends that he sent the ADM to attend complainant's court hearing to obtain additional information, the record reflects that the ADM actually learned nothing about the truth or falsity of the charges from attending the hearing, except that complainant had not entered a guilty plea and was contesting the charges<span class="Italic">. See</span> Agency Exhibit 23. In addition, with respect to job-relatedness, while the agency contends that complainant held a position in which he was soon to acquire significant financial responsibility and serve as a representative to the public, the agency itself concedes that complainant still had three semesters of college to complete before he was even eligible to hold a GS-4 position with low-level responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the agency has failed to demonstrate the requisite business justification for considering complainant's arrest record in making its negative suitability determination, and therefore complainant has established his claim of disparate impact based on national origin. In light of this conclusion, we do not reach complainant's disparate treatment claims based on national origin, disability, or reprisal, since complainant's available remedies would not be affected even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> he proved discrimination on an additional basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A60309 (2006), the Commission held that the complainant failed to show any statistical disparity due to a policy of terminating probationary employees due to arrests. The Commission noted that while the complainant pointed to disparities in the termination of black and white probationary employees, he did not present any evidence linking the disparity to the policy.</p>
