<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-127"><span class="space">A.</span> PREEMPLOYMENT INQUIRIES</h3>
<p class="noindent">An agency is allowed to make only limited preemployment inquiries concerning the existence and nature of a prospective employee's medical condition. The ADA, at 42 USC 12112(d), sets forth the basic parameters for medical examinations and inquiries:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;In general. The prohibition against discrimination as referred to in subsection (a) shall include medical examinations and inquiries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;Preemployment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;Prohibited examination or inquiry. Except as provided in paragraph (3), a covered entity shall not conduct a medical examination or make inquiries of a job applicant as to whether such applicant is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of such disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;Acceptable inquiry. A covered entity may make preemployment inquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-related functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;Employment entrance examination. A covered entity may require a medical examination after an offer of employment has been made to a job applicant and prior to the commencement of the employment duties of such applicant, and may condition an offer of employment on the results of such examination, if--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;all entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of disability;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of the applicant is collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and is treated as a confidential medical record, except that--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;first aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii)&#x2003;government officials investigating compliance with this Act shall be provided relevant information on request; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;the results of such examination are used only in accordance with this title.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Church v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01933350 (1993), the Commission referenced the ADA in holding that an agency may not make a preemployment inquiry into the nature or severity of an applicant's disability. An agency may make a preemployment inquiry that is restricted solely to the applicant's ability to perform the essential functions of the job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21174 (2003) (holding that agency properly asked whether complainant could perform the functions of available positions, such as standing, stretching, reaching and lifting heavy sacks of mail). However, an agency may not inquire if an applicant has a mental or emotional disorder. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. Attorney General</span>, 01994462 (2002). In <span class="Italic">Smallcanyon v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01997060 (2002), the Commission found it was a prohibited inquiry where the complainant, after advising the agency on his application that he had a knee injury, was required to submit to a medical examination or submit medical documentation in order to be considered for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when a disability is obvious an agency is restricted as to the information it can solicit in a preemployment interview. In <span class="Italic">Adair v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A24528.txt">01A24528</a> (2004), the Commission found a violation of the ADA where the complainant, who showed up for the job interview in a wheelchair, was asked if he had any mental or physical disabilities that would prevent him from performing the essential functions of the position. The Commission also found that it did not matter that all applicants were asked the same question.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations address both permissible and impermissible medical inquiries related to employment. Specifically, 29 CFR 1630.13 provides that the following is prohibited:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Pre-employment examination or inquiry. Except as permitted by Sec. 1630.14, it is unlawful for a covered entity to conduct a medical examination of an applicant or to make inquiries as to whether an applicant is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of such disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Examination or inquiry of employees. Except as permitted by Sec. 1630.14, it is unlawful for a covered entity to require a medical examination of an employee or to make inquiries as to whether an employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of such disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">At 29 CFR 1630.14, the Commission covers medical examinations and inquiries that are permissible:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Acceptable pre-employment inquiry. A covered entity may make pre-employment inquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-related functions, and/or may ask an applicant to describe or to demonstrate how, with or without reasonable accommodation, the applicant will be able to perform job-related functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Employment entrance examination. A covered entity may require a medical examination (and/or inquiry) after making an offer of employment to a job applicant and before the applicant begins his or her employment duties, and may condition an offer of employment on the results of such examination (and/or inquiry), if all entering employees in the same job category are subjected to such an examination (and/or inquiry) regardless of disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Information obtained under paragraph (b) of this section regarding the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and be treated as a confidential medical record, except that:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations;</p>
<p class="noindent-3"><span id="Page_1222"></span>(ii)&#x2003;First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii)&#x2003;Government officials investigating compliance with this part shall be provided relevant information on request.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The results of such examination shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Medical examinations conducted in accordance with this section do not have to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. However, if certain criteria are used to screen out an employee or employees with disabilities as a result of such an examination or inquiry, the exclusionary criteria must be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and performance of the essential job functions cannot be accomplished with reasonable accommodation as required in this part. (<span class="Italic">See</span> Sec. 1630.15(b) Defenses to charges of discriminatory application of selection criteria.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Examination of employees. A covered entity may require a medical examination (and/or inquiry) of an employee that is job-related and consistent with business necessity. A covered entity may make inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Information obtained under paragraph (c) of this section regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and be treated as a confidential medical record, except that:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii)&#x2003;Government officials investigating compliance with this part shall be provided relevant information on request.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Information obtained under paragraph (c) of this section regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;Other acceptable examinations and inquiries. A covered entity may conduct voluntary medical examinations and activities, including voluntary medical histories, which are part of an employee health program available to employees at the work site.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Information obtained under paragraph (d) of this section regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and be treated as a confidential medical record, except that:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii)&#x2003;Government officials investigating compliance with this part shall be provided relevant information on request.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Information obtained under paragraph (d) of this section regarding the medical condition or history of any employee shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with this part.</p>
<p class="noindent">At 29 CFR 1630, app. at 1630.13, the Commission explains the idea behind its regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This provision makes clear that an employer cannot inquire as to whether an individual has a disability at the pre-offer stage of the selection process. Nor can an employer inquire at the pre-offer stage about an applicant's workers' compensation history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers may ask questions that relate to the applicant's ability to perform job-related functions. However, these questions should not be phrased in terms of disability. An employer, for example, may ask whether the applicant has a driver's license, if driving is a job function, but may not ask whether the applicant has a visual disability. Employers may ask about an applicant's ability to perform both essential and marginal job functions. Employers, though, may not refuse to hire an applicant with a disability because the applicant's disability prevents him or her from performing marginal functions<span class="Italic">. See</span> Senate Report at 39; House Labor Report at 72-73; House Judiciary Report at 42-43.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also has issued extensive explanation of medical inquiries and examinations in its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 27, 2000), which is available on its website at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a> and in the <span class="Italic">Technical Assistance Manual</span>, "Disability Discrimination," at Tab L.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission construes its exceptions to preemployment medical inquiries very narrowly. In <span class="Italic">Reilly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01881666 (1988), the Commission had the opportunity to address both exceptions in the context of the disqualification of the complainant based on a preemployment medical examination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's Regulations specifically address pre-employment medical examinations to determine whether an applicant is handicapped or to determine the nature or severity of the handicap. Such examinations are disallowed unless they fall within two exceptions. 29 CFR 1613.706(a). The first exception permits the agency to condition an employment offer on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, provided that (a) all entering employees are subjected to such an examination or the preemployment medical questionnaire used for positions which do not routinely require medical examinations indicates a job-related condition for which further examination is required; and (2) the results of the "examination are used only in accordance with the requirements on this part." 29 CFR 1613.706(b) The second exception, 29 CFR 1613.706(c), permits an agency to provide applicants the opportunity to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped..." providing certain requirements are satisfied. 29 CFR 1613.706(c). The stated purpose of this second exception is "to enable and evaluate affirmative action to hire, place, or advance handicapped individuals." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency's use of a pre-employment medical examination, in this case, was not within the second exception described above. The record does not reflect that the examination occurred for the purpose of considering affirmative action for the appellant. The record does not show the agency invited appellant to identify whether he was handicapped, while providing him assurance that the information was voluntary and was intended solely for use in conjunction with affirmative action. 29 CFR 1613.706(c)(1), (2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the examination was not within the first exception. First, we find no persuasive evidence that the agency conditioned an employment offer to appellant on the results of [the medical examination] of appellant. The [selecting official] testified that "(i)t was my intention to hire [appellant] for the position, if he passed the physical examination...." This evidence suggests that there was no employment offer conditioned on the results of the medical examination. It shows [the selecting official] would have offered appellant employment, only "...if he passed the physical examination...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that there was a conditional offer of employment as set forth in 29 CFR 1613.706(b), while the record suggests the examination was required of all applicants, the record does not show that the agency used the results of appellant's examination in accordance with the Commission's regulations. As discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the agency has a duty to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified handicapped individuals. Here, the record does not persuade us that the agency used the results of appellant's examination in an effort to satisfy that duty. Rather, we find the record shows the agency summarily concluded that appellant could not work, as a casual custodian and did little, if anything, to consider the particulars of appellant's condition (including his control of his condition through medication and treatment) against the specific requirements of the custodian's position....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further suggested that the agency examine its policy of requiring preemployment medical examinations prior to offering employment to those applicants on whom the agency believes it needs further medical information. As an alternative, the Commission suggested the agency explore whether other job-related criteria could be used. "Because, under the agency's policy, it is possible that qualified handicapped individuals would appear to need further medical evidence more than non-handicapped applicants, this suggests that the policy screens out or tends to screen out qualified handicapped persons." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">It is also worth noting that under <span class="Italic">Reilly</span>, the agency's obligation does not end upon a determination that the applicant cannot pass the preemployment medical examination. The agency must also discharge its obligation of considering whether reasonable accommodation can be made.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission tied its narrowly tailored analysis to direct threat principles in <span class="Italic">Joshua F. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120181309 (2019). In <span class="Italic">Joshua F.,</span> the agency rescinded its tentative offer of employment to the complainant following the complainant's preemployment medical examination. The agency asserted that the complainant was not qualified for the job because of his vision. He could only identify one of six colors. Applying the direct threat analysis and comparing it with the agency's own policies, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Joshua F.</span> found that the agency had violated the Rehabilitation Act, reasoning:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant alleged that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act in rescinding its tentative offer of employment, based on the results of a physical examination. In order to prove disability discrimination Complainant must first establish that he is an "individual with a disability" and that he is "qualified" for the position desired--in other words, can perform the essential functions of the position with or without an accommodation. Here, the Agency does not dispute that Complainant is an individual with a disability or that, at a minimum, it regarded him as such.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next inquiry is whether Complainant is a "qualified individual with a disability." A "qualified individual with a disability" is one who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The record shows that Complainant met all the Agency's job requirements except its standard related to his vision and was tentatively offered the MVO position. After the pre-employment physical, it is the Agency's position that Complainant was not qualified for the position because of his vision. The Agency cited to its qualification standard for MVO positions in VA Handbook 5019 requiring the ability to "recognize the colors of traffic signals and devices showing standard red, green, and amber colors." The Agency contends that the medical record from Complainant's January 2017 pre-employment physical showed Complainant could only identify one out of six colors and seems to have "red green blindness."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The key question then is whether the vision standard that the Complainant failed, or the manner in which the Agency applied the vision standard to Complainant, is consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. If the standard itself fails to meet the "job-related and consistent with business necessity" requirement, or if the Agency failed to apply the standard in an appropriate way (for example, by failing to determine whether performance could be achieved through reasonable accommodation), Complainant has a valid claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's standard in question does not generically refer to <span id="Page_1223"></span>colorblindness, but rather focuses on "the ability to recognize the colors of traffic signals and devices showing standard red, green and amber colors." Thus, the standard, as written, for the MVO position appears job-related and consistent with business necessity for a position involving driving veterans and their caregiver's significant distances for medical services. Therefore, we must now examine whether the Agency applied its standard to Complainant in an appropriate way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to exclude an individual on the basis of possible future injury, as was done here, the Agency bears the burden of showing Complainant posed a "significant risk of substantial harm" to the health or safety of him or herself or others which cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). A speculative or remote risk is insufficient. This "direct threat" analysis must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to perform the essential functions of the job. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If no such accommodation exists, the Agency may refuse to hire an applicant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency must prove that its decision to discontinue the hiring process of Complainant, due to the results of his pre-employment physical concerning his vision, satisfies the "direct threat" standard. The burden of showing a significant risk is on the Agency. <span class="Italic">Selix v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000). In doing so, the Agency must show that its decision was based on an individualized assessment of Complainant that took into account: (1) the duration of the risk, (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm, (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). <span class="Italic">See Nathan v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070014 (July 19, 2013). <span class="Italic">See also, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal</span>, 536 U.S. 73 (2002); <span class="Italic">Cook v. State of Rhode Island, Department of Mental Health Retardation and Hospitals</span>, 10 F.3d 17 (1st Cir. 1993). A determination of significant risk cannot be based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation, or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. Rather, the Agency must gather information and base its decision on substantial information regarding the individual's work and medical history. <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal,supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03948 (July 30, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that substantial evidence supports a finding that the Agency did not perform an individualized assessment of whether Complainant could perform the essential functions of the MVO position without posing a direct threat to himself or others. Complainant asserts he can safely perform the duties of the MVO position as evidenced by the fact that he holds a commercial driver's license (CDL) and successfully performs in a similar position as a Bus Operator for state mass transit. The record clearly establishes that the decision to rescind the job offer was based solely on the Agency Physician's report that Complainant did not pass the "Ishara Color Blind Test because he was "[a]ble to distinguish Basic Colors" but "seems [to have] red green blindness."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this report, the Agency apparently assumed Complainant would be unable to see traffic signals while driving. However, the Agency conducted no inquiry into how, based on his vision, Complainant obtained and continued to hold his commercial driver's license and performed successfully in his Bus Operator position for the state mass transit authority. Moreover, the Agency acknowledged that it hired other MVOs without utilizing the colorblindness test because they already worked for the Agency and transferred within job category.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the results of the visual examination alone are insufficient to establish that there would be a high probability of substantial harm to Complainant or others. The evaluation of an applicant's unique abilities or disabilities is the crux of an individual assessment. At a minimum, such an assessment should take into account any special qualifications that might allow an applicant to successfully perform the essential functions of a position without posing a direct threat to himself or others. While the Agency refutes Complainant's contention that his color perception deficiency does not impact his daily activities or his current vehicle operator position, they have failed to perform an individualized assessment to determine how Complainant's color perception deficiency would actually affect his performance as an MVO. Because the Agency failed to meet its burden under the direct threat standard as required by the Rehabilitation Act, we find that the evidence supports the finding that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A45646 (2006), the Commission hinted that a policy requiring all applicants who were disabled veterans to supply medical documentation before being offered a job may violate the Rehabilitation Act. In that case, brought as a class action complaint, the complainant alleged that he was a disabled veteran who applied for a job at the agency claiming veterans preference. He also alleged that he was to report for a job interview bringing a sealed envelope with his veterans disability rating decision and medical records from the past 24 months. He was told if he did not comply with these requirements, he would not be considered for a position and would be removed from the hiring register for 30 days. The complainant further alleged that these same requirements were placed on all disabled veterans. He claimed to represent a class of more than 40,000 individuals in the southeastern United States alone.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Hill</span> remanded the case to the administrative judge, reversing the judge's denial of certification of the class based on a failure to demonstrate adequacy of representation. The complainant had requested to represent the class himself. The Commission in Hill, in remanding the case to give the complainant an opportunity to find adequate representation for the class, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that the claim raised in this class complaint is properly framed as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether the agency violates the Rehabilitation Act when it asks all disabled veteran applicants seeking disabled veteran's preference, to bring medical documentation, in excess of that required to verify their entitlement to the preference, to an interview before an offer of employment is made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Commission defines the class as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The class consists of disabled veteran applicants, seeking disabled veteran's preference, who have been asked by the agency to bring medical documentation, in excess of that required to verify their entitlement to the preference, to an interview before an offer of employment is made.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Without addressing the merits of this claim, we find that complaint identifies a policy which, on its face may violate the Rehabilitation Act's prohibition against disability-related pre-offer medical inquiries. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112 (d)(2); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13(a). The agency is entitled to review documents that prove an applicant's claim for veterans' preference; however, the agency is not entitled to ask questions that are "likely to elicit information about a disability" or that are "closely related to a disability" at the pre-offer stage. <span class="Italic">See</span> ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> (October 10, 1995). The Commission finds that in asking for disabled veteran applicants to bring a copy of medical records for the past twenty-four months, and/or a signed statement listing any medical treatments or ailments experienced in the past twenty-four months to the interview, the agency may have made a such a prohibited medical inquiry. Additionally, if the agency retains medical records of applicants, the agency may violate the Rehabilitation Act's confidentiality provisions that require medical information to be maintained in a confidential medical file which is kept separate from personnel records.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is, however, a distinction between an impermissible medical examination or inquiry and asking an applicant if he or she can perform the essential functions of the position or requesting that the applicant demonstrate that he or she can perform the essential functions of the position. The latter is permissible when a conditional offer of employment is made to the applicant. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mearns v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A20015.txt">07A20015</a> (2004), the complainant, who had a speech impediment, applied for a Postal police officer position. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mearns</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency could have asked complainant if he could perform the essential functions of the Postal Police Officer position, or required him to demonstrate his ability to perform the essential functions of the position, such as de-escalating potentially violent situations, using firearms and walkie-talkies, and giving directions and information orally. The Rehabilitation Act permits such requests, as they go to an applicant's ability to perform the essential functions of a specific position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(a); 1995 Enforcement Guidance, at 10 (providing that if an "employer requires applicants to lift a thirty pound box and carry it twenty feet," this "is not a medical examination [but] is just a test of whether the applicant can perform this task"). In addition, after giving complainant a clear conditional job offer, the agency could have questioned complainant regarding his speech impediment and/or evaluated it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 1995 Enforcement Guidance, at 13 (noting that "[a]fter giving a job offer to an applicant, an employer may ask disability-related questions and perform medical examinations," and that a "job offer may be conditioned on the results of post-offer disability-related questions or medical examination"). Instead, before allowing complainant to describe and/or demonstrate how he would perform the essential functions of the position, Inspector-1 advised complainant on July 8, 1996 that he would no longer be considered for the position due to his speech impediment. Then, by letter dated December 12, 1996, the agency notified complainant that he was scheduled for a medical examination without providing him with a clear conditional job offer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the above stated evidence, we find that the agency exceeded the allowable parameters of the Rehabilitation Act when: (1) on or about July 8, 1996, without asking complainant to demonstrate or describe how he could perform the essential functions of the position, the Inspectors determined and advised complainant that he would no longer be considered for the position due to his speech impediment; and (2) more than five months later, on December 12, 1996, the agency improperly <span id="Page_1224"></span>directed complainant to attend a medical examination before it provided him with a clear conditional job offer. We note that, although the agency may have scheduled the medical examination in an effort to remedy its past mistake, the agency scheduled the examination without providing complainant with a conditional job offer. Moreover, the Postal Police Officer position announcement states that "[applicants who qualify on the [written] examination and are in the area of consideration for employment will be scheduled for a drug test and a medical examination," and Inspector-2 testified that an applicant is not offered a Postal Police Officer position until he or she passes the medical examination and all other areas of background investigation have been fulfilled. Report of Investigation (ROI), Aff. A, Att. 13 (emphasis added); Hearing Transcript (HT), at 128. Therefore, we find that this agency activity was a form of prohibited disability discrimination and a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dereyna et al. v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01980077 (January 19, 2001). Moreover, due to the prohibited pre-employment medical examination, the agency must correct its pre-employment process to comply with Commission Regulations. <span class="Italic">See Nolan v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01975113 (Nov. 1, 2000); <span class="Italic">see also McKinley v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01933326 (September 8, 1994); <span class="Italic">affd on reconsideration,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950027 (December 8, 1995) (finding disability discrimination by agency officials who made prohibited preemployment inquiries, but concluding that the complainant would not have been selected absent the prohibited inquiries, and ordering the agency to correct its pre-employment process).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no issue of intent when analyzing claims that an agency has violated preemployment inquiry restrictions. As a result, it is quite possible for an agency to inadvertently violate the restrictions. In <span class="Italic">Lugo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01983971 (2001), the Commission remanded the complaint to the administrative judge after reversing his summary judgment finding where the interviewer discovered the complainant's learning disability in response to a legitimate question, but then possibly went too far:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is a remaining question of whether HR's pre-employment disability related questions and the examination required of complainant were a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Rehabilitation Act. While not completely clear, the record seems to suggest that complainant voluntarily explained that he had a learning problem in response to a possibly legitimate request by HR that complainant fill in the gaps of his employment directly on his application. When complainant could not spell "unemployed," the record seems to indicate that HR became suspicious that complainant had a learning problem. HR then began to ask complainant about his learning problem and administered an examination of complainant by requiring that he read and explain a "religious convictions" paragraph. A reasonable fact finder could conclude that the examination administered by HR, helped HR to conclude that complainant was not qualified for the position. Under the Rehabilitation Act, when an employer reasonably believes that an applicant will not be able to perform a job function because of a known disability, the employer may ask that particular applicant to describe or demonstrate how he would perform such function. We find that the record could support the finding that HR's requirement that complainant read and explain a "religious convictions" statement failed to meet the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. There is no evidence in the record which indicates that reading and understanding such a statement was a job function of the letter carrier position. Moreover, the requirement seems more likely to have been intended to test the extent of complainant's learning deficiencies<span class="Italic">. See</span> ADA <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span>, October 10, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 07A10033 (2001), the Commission found the agency's initial preemployment inquiry was permissible, but ultimately went too far:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may not ask an applicant about job-related injuries, as these questions relate directly to the severity of an applicant's impairments and are likely to elicit information about disability<span class="Italic">. See Enforcement Guidance, Disability Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (July 27, 2000); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Steeltek, Inc.,</span> 160 F.3d 591, 595 (10th Cir. 1998) (holding that a job applicant need not make a showing that he or she is disabled or perceived as disabled to make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that an employer violated the ADA's ban on questioning applicants about their disabilities). EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1630.13 provides that an agency may not make pre-employment inquiries as to whether an applicant is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of a disability. An agency may, however, make a pre-employment inquiry into whether an applicant can perform any or all job functions. 29 CFR 1630.14(a). Moreover, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, 42 USC 12112(d)(3)(b) and 12112(d)(4)(c), requires employers to maintain information regarding the medical condition and history of individuals with disabilities in separate medical files and to treat such information as confidential except in specified situations<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1630.14(b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1). These ADA requirements are applicable to cases brought under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act pursuant to Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, P.L. 102-569 (October 29, 1992). The Commission has stated that an employer's improper pre-employment questions constitutes disability discrimination as it violates the ADA<span class="Italic">. See Enforcement Guidance, Disability Related Inquiries,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that a member of the selection panel disclosed to the other members the fact that complainant was on light duty at the time of the selection. When a current employee applies for a different position, a supervisor having information about the employee's disability is prohibited from disclosing that information to a prospective supervisor or to a selecting official<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In this case, however, the panel member disclosed the mere fact that complainant was on light duty. This disclosure, without more, does not necessarily violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More problematic is the disclosure of information related to complainant's disability by the agency Medical Officer. The agency acknowledged in its brief on appeal that members of the selection panel contacted the Medical Officer with regard to complainant's medical restrictions. The Medical Officer stated in his deposition that it is the agency's practice for him to conduct meetings with supervisors to discuss employees' work restrictions. According to his testimony, however, these meetings are not held one-on-one with the affected employee's supervisor; rather, a group of supervisors are present for discussion of employees who may not be under their supervision. The Medical Officer further stated that at these meetings he endeavors to disclose as little actual medical information as possible, but indicated that the discussion of complainant's restrictions had gone into some detail regarding his possible treatment and prognosis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the record reflects that the panel members discussed complainant's restrictions with the Medical Officer in an attempt to determine whether he would be able to perform the essential functions of the Aircraft Sheetmetal Worker position. At that point, however, complainant had not been offered the position on even a conditional basis. It would have been acceptable for the panel members to inquire solely into complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of the position<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1630.14(a). However, the inquiry extended into the nature of complainant's condition, its possible treatment, and complainant's prognosis. Such an inquiry is not permitted at the pre-offer stage<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1630.13(a); <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance, Disability Related Inquiries</span>. Further, medical information obtained from disability-related inquiries or medical examinations, or voluntarily disclosed by employees, must be treated as confidential and may only be shared in limited circumstances with supervisors and managers. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance, Disability Related Inquiries</span>. In this case, medical information regarding complainant's medical condition, not merely his restrictions, was disclosed to a group of managers who did not necessarily need to know these particulars. This disclosure therefore was a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a30554.txt">01A30554</a> (2004), the Commission stressed that preemployment inquiries must be narrowly tailored for the position in question. In that case, the Commission found that questions on an agency form sought direct information about disabilities and performance of major life activities. In finding a violation of the ADA provisions on preemployment inquiries, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kelly</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the American's With Disabilities Act of 1990 (The ADA), an employer may ask disability-related questions and require medical examination of an applicant only after the applicant has been given a conditional job offer. The rationale for this rule is to prevent the exact scenario that occurred in the instant complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Pre-employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (October 10, 1995). If disability-related questions are posed prior to the conditional job offer, the applicant could not be sure if s/he was rejected because of a disability or because of insufficient qualifications. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Accordingly, EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13 provides that an agency may not make pre-employment inquiries as to whether an applicant is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of a disability. An agency may, however, make a pre-employment inquiry into whether an applicant can perform any or all job functions. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency contends that the form only posed questions that were related to complainant's ability to perform the job functions, we find otherwise. The form did not make a sufficient attempt to narrowly tailor the questions for the Production Assistant position. Indeed, the form explicitly asks whether the applicant has amputations or problems hearing or seeing. Furthermore, the form posed questions about major life activities. Questions about whether an applicant can perform major life activities are almost always disability-related because they are likely to elicit questions about a disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Pre-employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (October 10, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that this case falls into the exception to the rule that <span id="Page_1225"></span>allows for an employer to ask certain limited questions regarding potential reasonable accommodation when an applicant has voluntarily disclosed that they have a disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Pre-employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (October 10, 1995). As an initial matter, we do not necessarily find that SF-177 "Statement of Physical Ability for Light Duty Work" was limited to questions regarding complainant's potential accommodation. Indeed, we have already found that the form posed disability-related questions. Furthermore, we disagree with the agency that complainant disclosed that she had a disability; rather, complainant's application only alerted the agency that she was eligible for a Schedule A appointment. Finally, we do not find the agency's contention credible given that there is no dispute that the agency requested this information of all applicants, not only complainant. To follow the agency's line of reasoning and justify that the form was an attempt to assess the applicants' needs for an accommodation, the agency would have had to establish that all applicants had obvious disabilities, or disclosed disabilities. Here, the agency does not argue or present any evidence that this was the case. Accordingly, we find that by using the SF-177 prior to making an offer of employment, the agency committed a violation of the Rehabilitation Act, and thus a form of prohibited disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01247 (June 26, 2001); <span class="Italic">Dereyna et al. v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01980077 (Jan. 19, 2001); <span class="Italic">Nolan v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01975113 (November 1, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Haviland v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a30375.txt">01A30375</a> (2004), the Commission found violations of the ADA preemployment inquiry provisions where it appeared that a fitness-for-duty examination was designed to demonstrate that the complainant could not perform the job instead of designed to elicit information about the types of accommodation that may be necessary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that beginning in 1997, complainant worked under physical restrictions. Namely, complainant was unable to sweep the DUBS machine, could work no more than two hours of automation work in an eight hour day, could perform no work above the shoulder level, needed a regular daytime shift, and could not lift greater than twenty pounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 12, 2000, the vacancy announcement for the DCT position at issue here was posted. Complainant submitted an application, dated December 25, 2000, for the position. After the announcement closed, the person charged with filling the vacancy, the selecting official, spoke to a Human Resources Specialist (Specialist) to determine if any successful applicants had applied for the job. The Specialist informed the selecting official that complainant was the only one who had applied for the job, and that she (Specialist) would have to request the current status of complainant's medical restrictions to determine if those restrictions would allow him to fulfill the functional requirements of the DCT position as it was posted. Upon doing so, complainant gave the Specialist a letter from his physician, an orthopedic specialist, dated January 25, 2001, which recommended that complainant could perform the duties of the DCT position as outlined and that all previous restrictions should be lifted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the selecting official learned of the lifted restrictions, she questioned the validity of the physician's recommendations because of her previous knowledge that complainant had been on some type of work restrictions since she started working for the agency in 1994. She then spoke with complainant's current supervisor and asked about any current restrictions complainant had. The current supervisor indicated that complainant had diabetes, which he controlled by taking the necessary medications and shots during his breaks and lunch time. He also indicated that complainant had not suffered any seizures since July 1999. It is worthy to note that during this conversation, the current supervisor informed the selecting official that complainant was one of his best employees and that when he assigned complainant a task, he never wondered whether it would be executed because he knew complainant would get the job done.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After receiving this information from complainant's current supervisor, the selecting official met with the Reasonable Accommodation Committee for the Dakotas District. During this meeting, the selecting official expressed concern about complainant's sudden medical release after years of restrictions. Moreover, the meeting participants discussed the functional requirements of the DCT position and the hours complainant would be required to work. After these and other concerns were discussed, it was agreed that complainant would be required to undergo a FFDE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The selecting official interviewed complainant for the position on February 8, 2001. The two discussed the functional requirements for the position (i.e., driving, including at night; the use of complainant's hand and the ability to grasp and finger mail, the need to key on the computer, and the ability to serve as the primary back-up to the two tour one DCT's if one of them was scheduled to be out of the office). At the end of the interview, the selecting official explained that it would be difficult to make accommodations for this position because of the workload, time frames for completing tests, and the variety of locations in which the DCT will work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 8, 2001, complainant reported for his scheduled FFDE. After examining complainant and reviewing his past medical records, the examining physician opined that complainant not be permitted to drive a postal vehicle under routine circumstances; may lift up to seventy pounds, but only occasionally and not repetitively; and must work the day shift only, limited to beginning from 3:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> to 8:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, or beginning from 12:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> to 2:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> The examining physician further opined that complainant should not be allowed to work swing, evening, or midnight shifts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the holding of this Commission that the agency's medical inquiry and FFDE are violative of the Rehabilitation Act. As noted above, such inquires and examinations at the pre-offer stage are prohibited. The lone exception is where the employer already has medical information concerning an individual at the pre-offer stage for the new position (e.g., information obtained in connection with the individual's request for reasonable accommodation in his/her current position) and this information causes the employer to have a reasonable belief that the individual will need a reasonable accommodation to perform the functions of the new job, the employer may ask what type of reasonable accommodation would be needed to perform the functions of the new job, before extending an offer for that job. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance--Disability-Related Inquiries</span>, note 37. That exception does not apply here as it is clear that the agency's actions regarding the medical inquiries and examination were not designed to elicit information from complainant about types of reasonable accommodations that would be needed to perform the functions of the new job. In fact, it appears that the agency's actions in these regards were designed to prove that complainant was not physically capable of performing the functional requirements of the job. Moreover, the revelation from complainant's current supervisor to the selecting official information about complainant's diabetes was also violative of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at Question 4 (which states that where a current supervisor has medical information regarding an employee, s/he may not reveal that information to the person interviewing the employee for the new job or to the supervisor of that job).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the mere fact that a preemployment inquiry results in the applicant disclosing a medical condition is not a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the ADA. For example, in <span class="Italic">McCloud v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A51104 (2006), the Commission found an inquiry about sick leave during a previous job was not a violation of the ADA even where the complainant disclosed she had a thyroid condition in response to the inquiry:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that we find that the AJ erred in failing to recognize that complainant brought a second, distinct claim alleging that H1 made improper medical inquiries. Specifically, complainant asserts that she revealed a past illness (thyroid illness) on Section 16 of her application. Section 16 is entitled "Continuation Space/Agency Optional Questions," and it instructs the applicant to provide details requested in Items 7 through 15 and 18c in the space below or on attached sheets. In Section 16, complainant stated "I was terminated from my job by the below named company because I became ill. I submitted my doctor's excuse 6/22/99 and was informed by my supervisor via telephone on 6/23/99 not to return to work. I began my employment with this company on 5/14/99 and was terminated on 6/23/99." ROI, at Exhibit 7. Complainant contends that H1 stated to her on December 24, 2003, "you indicated on your application that you were out sick, what did the doctor states [sic], how long did you wait to contact your supervisor, do you have the note to prove this." H1 denies the above, and states that she simply asked complainant how many days she was out sick before she was terminated. Complainant goes on to explain that she responded "I really didn't miss any days because I became ill on 6/22 and I contacted my supervisor on 6/23. I informed my supervisor that my doctor had scheduled me to be out of work for 7 days. My supervisor then instructed me not to return to work." Complainant states that she then informed H1 that she was diagnosed with a thyroid condition which was now under control. While there may be a disagreement as to what precisely was said, none of H1's alleged statements or questions, under these circumstances, constitutes a disability-related inquiry.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Here, judgment as a matter of law was proper as the record contains no genuine issue of material fact in dispute. Even assuming complainant was questioned as she alleges, we decline to find that such questions constitute illegal disability-related pre-employment questions. Therefore, the Commission AFFIRMS the final order.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an individual who is already an agency employee applies for another position within the agency, any review for purposes of making a determination on that new position are subject to the preemployment inquiry rules. Moreover, the agency has an obligation to request and analyze all non-<span id="Page_1226"></span>medical information that it can reasonably obtain prior to making an offer of employment conditioned on a medical exam or inquiry. In <span class="Italic">Hoskins v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120042087 (2007), the Commission remanded the case for further investigation, but in doing so explained the agency's obligation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that the agency failed to properly frame complainant's claim of discrimination to include its alleged failure to provide him with a valid job offer before it required him to respond to the Current Medical Status Report forms and undergo the May 16, 2002 medical examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> Claim (1), <span class="Italic">supra.</span> Although the agency asserts that it did not accept this claim, the validity of pre-employment disability-related questions and medical examinations must always be analyzed to determine whether the agency's process is in conformity with Rehabilitation Act obligations. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance on Pre-employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations</span> (Oct. 10, 1995) (web version) (1995 Enforcement Guidance), EEOC Notice No. 915.002, at 3. The agency is reminded that, under the Rehabilitation Act, "an employer may ask disability-related questions and require medical examinations of an applicant only after the applicant has been given a conditional job offer." <span class="Italic">See</span> 1995 Enforcement Guidance, at 2; <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13(a); <span class="Italic">Nolan v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01975113 (Nov. 1, 2000); <span class="Italic">see also McKinley v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01933326 (September 8, 1994); <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950027 (December 8, 1995) (finding disability discrimination by agency officials who made prohibited pre-employment inquiries, but concluding that the complainant would not have been selected absent the prohibited inquiries, and ordering the agency to correct its pre-employment process). The Commission has stated that "a job offer is real if the employer has evaluated all relevant non-medical information which it reasonably could have obtained and analyzed prior to giving the offer." 1995 Enforcement Guidance, p. 12. However, the Commission recognizes that there are times when an employer cannot reasonably obtain and evaluate all non-medical information at the pre-offer stage. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the agency implies that complainant received a valid job offer and that it initially requested and analyzed all non-medical information it could reasonably obtain prior to sending complainant to the Assessment Center to submit the Current Medical Status Report forms and undergo the medical examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> Agency's Opposition to Appeal, p. 4 n.2. However, because the agency has failed to adequately develop the record, the Commission cannot determine whether the agency could have reasonably obtained and evaluated complainant's non-medical information at the pre-offer stage. Specifically, the record remains unclear as to whether the agency had sufficient opportunity to: (1) conduct the interview for the position; (2) assess whether complainant would be selected based upon his performance during the interview; (3) make complainant a conditional job offer; and (4) then request that he submit the Current Medical Status Report forms and undergo the medical examination. Therefore, the agency must conduct further investigation to determine whether it was possible for complainant to be interviewed and provided with a conditional job offer before he was required to submit medical documentation and undergo a medical examination. Based upon the aforesaid evidence gathered from the investigation, the agency shall determine whether it was in violation of the Rehabilitation Act when it required complainant to respond to the Current Medical Status Report forms and undergo the May 16, 2002 medical examination.</p>
