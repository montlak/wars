<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-128c"><span class="space">2.</span> Pungent Food</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Habluetzel v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40025 (2006), the Commission found that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate a complainant, who was asthmatic and also suffered from allergies and restrictive airways disease, when it allowed coworkers to pop popcorn in the workplace. One of the complainant's allergies was to corn, including airborne corn. In finding that the agency failed to accommodate the complaint in <span class="Italic">Habluetzel</span>, the Commission also brushed aside arguments by the agency that a restriction on popping popcorn caused resentment among the other employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that complainant was diagnosed, as having asthma with a chronic cough, allergic rhinitis, underlying reactive airway disease, and multiple allergies, with exposure resulting in wheezing, swelling, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, sore throat, and pulmonary problems. (HT, Exhibit 10; Letters from Complainant's Physicians, dated October 26, 1998 and November 10, 1998). Additionally, complainant suffers from a corn allergy so severe that exposure to any type of corn product, even corn proteins in the air, would result in an asthmatic allergic reaction. The record shows that complainant must, therefore, avoid exposure to airborne corn proteins, and must avoid eating any food made with corn or corn products of any kind, including corn syrup, corn starch, and corn oil. Further, complainant states that when she is exposed to popcorn fumes she is unable to breathe, she experiences "a choking feeling," wheezing and chest pains, and that she is forced to use a rescue inhaler in order to breathe. The record reflects that on at least one occasion she was forced to remain out of work for several days after exposure to popcorn fumes at the facility in order to recover from the severe asthmatic reaction. Finally, the record shows that prior to the events at issue in the instant complaint, complainant was assigned to a modified position by the agency because, according to her medical documentation, she needed to be permanently reassigned to indoor jobs as she was unable to perform any rural or outdoor work due to her "severe allergies preventing her from carrying on her normal activities on an outside basis." Based upon the evidence of record, we find that complainant has shown that she is substantially limited in the major life activity of breathing and, therefore, is an individual with a disability covered under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Lawler v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01535 (March 27, 2003) (complainant, whose asthma severely restricts breathing, as compared to the general public, found to be substantially limited in the major life activity of breathing); <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970727 (September 15, 2000) (complainant, whose ability to breathe and overall health is limited when she comes into contact with fragrances and other chemical fumes, found to be substantially limited in the major life activity of breathing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also must show that she is a "qualified" individual with a disability within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The term "qualified individual with a disability," with respect to employment, is defined as a disabled person who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position held or desired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). Complainant indicated that she was qualified to perform all of the essential functions of her Modified Distribution Clerk position despite her condition. The agency does not contest that complainant was qualified. Accordingly, we conclude that complainant was a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that complainant has shown that she requested a reasonable accommodation when she informed the PM, and other agency management officials, that she suffered a severe allergic reaction when her co-workers popped popcorn at the facility. The record reflects that the PM was aware that complainant was placed in the modified clerk position "specifically to accommodate [complainant]" and that one of the restrictions related to that accommodation was that she could not be <span id="Page_1397"></span>around corn fumes. The PM stated that he gave a stand-up talk to every employee in complainant's facility, informing them that complainant could not be exposed to corn fumes. The PM also stated he did not believe it was "fair to all the employees" to "punish" them by prohibiting them from popping popcorn in the workplace, so it was instead agreed that any time an employee was going to pop a bag of popcorn, they were to inform the PM so that he could tell complainant who would "normally leave the office."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The record reflects that, as a result, complainant had to leave the facility several times per week during her shift until the fumes from the popcorn dissipated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the hearing, the PM testified that complainant's co-workers resented the restriction imposed on their enjoyment of popcorn as a result of complainant's allergy, and that when complainant was not at work, the other employees would have "a field day" in that they would "be able to go pop popcorn without having to ask permission like a little school kid." Additionally, one of the 204-B employees at complainant's facility specifically stated that there was no written policy with respect to popping popcorn, the PM had only "mentioned it." Record evidence shows that complainant's co-workers did not always inform her before preparing popcorn, and on August 5, 1999, after a co-worker refused to "go throughout the [facility] to get her permission to pop popcorn," complainant had an allergic reaction so severe that her physician did not release her to return to work until August 30, 1999.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency contends that complainant is not an individual with a disability because her asthmatic allergic reactions "appeared to be largely preventable and treatable with medication," and she could have avoided the attacks by getting fresh air or "using a mask." We find, however, that the ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodation to remove workplace barriers, regardless of what effect medication, other medical treatment, or assistive devices may have on an employee's ability to perform the job. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Guidance), EEO Notice No. 915.002 (October 17, 2002), at Question 38. We further note that complainant can perform the essential functions of her position with a reasonable accommodation, and she does not pose a direct threat in the absence of medication, treatment, or an assistive device.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Additionally, the record reflects that although complainant did attempt to use several different types of masks, they did not prove to be an effective solution as they caused complainant additional injury and were "more bothersome than...helpful." We find, also, that any mitigating measure, including those identified by the agency, would have been ineffective in light of management's failure to enforce any procedure whereby complainant would have advanced notice of potential exposure to the harmful popcorn fumes, or more appropriately, to issue a specific order prohibiting the popping of popcorn at this facility. An allergic condition, such as complainant's, can be life threatening, and in this instance the agency acted as though employees have a right to pop popcorn while denying complainant her right to an environment free of these allergens. Accordingly, we find that the agency's failure to provide complainant with a reasonable accommodation is a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that under certain circumstances, an agency may escape liability for compensatory damages if it acted in "good faith" in its effort to reasonably accommodate an employee. <span class="Italic">See </span>EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002, at 13, footnote 24, (October 17, 2002); <span class="Italic">Reiley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10019 (June 5, 2002). In the instant case, however, we find that the agency has failed to establish that it acted in "good faith" and, accordingly, we find that complainant is entitled to proven compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another "pungent food" related complaint, <span class="Italic">Rebecca L. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 2021001759 (2021), the Commission found the agency's offer to move the complainant to a workspace "away" from others to "prevent her exposure to allergens" was not a qualifying reasonable accommodation where the complainant's job required that she interact with coworkers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the record sufficient to support the AJ's finding that Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. Complainant was able to answer telephones and work with a database to assist Agency clients. It was not until she was exposed to food allergen triggers that she experienced physical symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, headaches, chest tightness, reduced sight, facial burning, and difficulty concentrating. At the hearing, the parties stipulated that Complainant is entitled to coverage under the Rehabilitation Act. Based on the above, we find the Agency had an obligation to provide reasonable accommodation absent a showing of undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency failed to provide case-specific evidence proving that reasonable accommodation would cause an undue hardship in the particular circumstances. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391 (2002). While agencies are obligated to provide reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with disability, the Rehabilitation Act allows agencies to raise an affirmative defense that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Preston v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120054230 (August 9, 2007); Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation. Generalized conclusions will not suffice to support a claim of undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, a showing of undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. <span class="Italic">See Julius C. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151295 (June 16, 2017); Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation. The Agency should have considered and addressed with specificity how enacting and enforcing a policy requiring employees to eat at least pungent foods outside of the workspace shared with Complainant would have affected the Agency. They did not do so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has also argued that it offered Complainant an alternative accommodation which it claims would have been effective. This offer was to move Complainant to workspace that was away from other staff to prevent her exposure to allergens. We conclude, however, that substantial evidence supports the AJ's conclusion that this proffered alternative accommodation of isolating Complainant would not have been effective due to the nature of her work and need to interact frequently with her coworkers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a discriminatory practice involves the provision of a reasonable accommodation, compensatory damages may be awarded if the Agency fails to demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide the individual with a reasonable accommodation for his disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Gunn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120053293 (June 15, 2007). Here, we are inclined to find that colleagues and management did not take Complainant's allergic condition seriously and failed to honor or enforce the verbal policy, called Complainant "allergy lady" or dismissed her as "overly sensitive," and isolated or taunted her. Complainant stated that management did not support her requests and never issued a written policy so that employees and management were aware of how to assist employees with food allergies. Complainant stated that she had to consistently worry about exposure to allergens in the workplace and wore a scarf or other cover over her eyes and face at times in the workplace. Based on the weight of the evidence, we find adequate support for the provision of compensatory damages in this case.</p>
