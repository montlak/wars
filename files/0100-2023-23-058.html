<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-57"><span id="Page_1162"></span><span class="space">c.</span> Essential Functions and Undue Hardship</h5>
<p class="noindent">Some inconsistency in the Commission's decisions ultimately led to a showdown between the EEOC and the MSPB over the relationship between job attendance and essential job functions. In <span class="Italic">Bouffard v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120065257 (2008), the Commission found that working rotating shifts was an essential function of a seasonal border protection officer in Blaine, Washington, a relatively small border crossing. Despite the Commission's long-standing position that attendance is not an essential job function, the Office of Federal Operations, in <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record, we find that complainant failed to establish that he was a qualified individual with a disability. The agency argued below and on appeal that the ability to work rotational shifts and overtime was an essential function of complainant's position. The record contains the CBP Officer (Limited Duty) job description, which indicates that seasonal employees, such as the complainant, were required to work varying hours. The position description states that "The incumbent of this position serves as a seasonal or part-time worker at ports-of-entry during peak work periods." The position description also contains a "special requirements" section indicating that incumbents of the position "[m]ust work on a shift and rotational basis and perform substantial amounts of overtime." Moreover, the record contains an affidavit from the Area Port Director specifically noting that working rotational shifts and overtime was an essential function of complainant's CBP Officer (Limited Duty) position. <span class="Italic">We find that the agency satisfied its burden in establishing that the ability to work rotational shifts and overtime was an essential function of the CBP Officer (Limited Duty) position. The accommodation complainant requested, namely not to have to work rotational shifts or overtime is in essence a request to change the essential function of his job. The agency is not required to change the essential functions of a job as a form of reasonable accommodation</span>. That said, the reasonable accommodation of reassignment to a vacant funded position is an accommodation of last resort. Complainant has the evidentiary burden to establish that it is more likely than not that there were vacancies during the relevant time period to which he could have been reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Barnard v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10002 (August 2, 2002). We find that complainant has failed to make this showing.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="noindent">The error of OFO in analyzing the case from the perspective of an essential job function instead of undue hardship likely had no impact on the outcome of the case. Given the relatively small size of the Blaine outpost, it likely would have been an undue hardship to accommodate Bouffard by placing him on the day shift. The error, however, did prove critical in moving Alvara's case to the Special Panel.</p>
<p class="noindent">Alvara was removed from his position as a border protection officer at the El Paso crossing based on a medical inability to perform. He appealed his removal to the MSPB and, as an affirmative defense, alleged that the agency had failed to accommodate him. In order to get eight hours of nocturnal sleep a night, Alvara had asked to work four 12-hour shifts that would have permitted him to work primarily a daytime schedule and also work substantial amounts of overtime, which is required to border protection officers. The administrative judge upheld the removal and rejected Alvara's claim of disability discrimination. Relying on <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, the judge determined that working the graveyard shift was an essential function of being a border protection officer and that Alvara, therefore, was not a qualified individual with a disability because he could not work that shift.</p>
<p class="noindent">Alvara filed a petition for review with the MSPB. In <span class="Italic">Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 MSPR 627 (2011), the Board held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A qualified individual with a disability is a person with the skills, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position he holds and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The term "essential functions" means the fundamental job duties of the position, not the marginal functions. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(1). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to, the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; the terms of a collective bargaining agreement; the work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(3)(i)-(vii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the administrative judge did not, in her analysis, specifically cite to the latter regulation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), she nevertheless considered the appropriate factors in determining that the ability to work the graveyard shift and significant overtime is an essential function of the appellant's position. She considered, as evidence of the employer's judgment on the issue, testimony from the Customs and Border Patrol Chief Officer for the Port of El Paso where the appellant was employed, ID at 11-12, the several individuals who served for various portions of time as Acting Port Director (one of whom was the proposing official), <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 13-16, the Mission Support Specialist who was detailed to the Light Duty/Limited Duty Program, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 16-17, the Diversity and Civil Rights Officer, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 17-19, and the Director of Field Operations (the deciding official), <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 19-22. All of these witnesses provided reasons why, in their view, the ability to work the graveyard shift and significant overtime is an essential function of the CBPO position. Those reasons included the fact that CBPOs are assigned to work overtime to meet the needs of the agency on any shift, including the graveyard shift, that overtime is necessary in order for the agency to fulfill its mission, that no CBPO has ever been permanently exempted from working overtime or the graveyard shift, although it has been done on a temporary basis, such as to accommodate pregnant or breast-feeding CBPOs, that morale would be adversely affected if certain CBPOs were never required to work overtime, that the requirement that CBPOs be able to work the graveyard shift and significant overtime was a factor in the classifying and grading of the position, and that the appellant's requested accommodation would circumvent the collective bargaining agreement because it imposes limits on how much overtime each employee can be ordered to work. In addition, the administrative judge considered the CBPO position description which includes, among its Special Requirements, that the incumbent "must work on a shift and rotational basis and perform substantial amounts of overtime." ID at 8; IAF, Tab 7a, Subtab 4oo. And, the administrative judge considered the CBPO's Medical Standards and Physical Requirements which provide that the incumbent "may work extended or unscheduled hours including weekends and holidays and be required to rotate shifts, assignments and duty stations." ID at 8; IAF, Tab 7a, Subtab 4pp at 3. Finally, the administrative judge relied upon the EEOC's findings, in <span class="Italic">Bouffard v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, Appeal No. 0120065257, 2008 WL 276452, at *5 (E.E.O.C. Jan. 16, 2008), that: (1) The ability to work rotational shifts and overtime is an essential function of the CBPO position; and (2) the accommodation of not having to work rotational shifts and overtime is in essence a request to change the essential function of the job which the agency is not required to do. ID at 22.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, the EEOC directly addressed the dispositive issue presented in this case. We note that the Board generally defers to the EEOC on issues of substantive discrimination law unless the EEOC's decision rests on civil service law for its support or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schwartz v. Department of Education</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 12 (2010); <span class="Italic">Parks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2008); <span class="Italic">Evans v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 9 (2007); <span class="Italic">Kimble v. Department of the Navy</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 617, 622 (1996); <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 471 (Spec. Pan. 1986). Accordingly, because the <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> decision involves an issue of substantive discrimination law and is neither based on civil service law or is so unreasonable as to amount to a violation of civil service law, we will defer to the EEOC's determination that the agency is not required to accommodate a disabled CBPO by granting a request not to work rotational shifts and overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the EEOC, in <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, addressed the dispositive issue in this case. Moreover, the appellant's challenge to the administrative judge's findings is unavailing. Specifically, the appellant disputes the way in which she analyzed the appropriate factors in considering whether the ability to work the graveyard shift and substantial overtime is an essential factor in the CBPO position. For example, the appellant argues that other CBPOs, namely females who have recently given birth, are exempted from the graveyard shift indefinitely without any impact to the agency's mission. As noted, the administrative judge considered such evidence but did not find it dispositive of the issue of whether the ability to work the graveyard shift and substantial overtime is an essential function of the CBPO position because, as the agency witnesses explained, the females' condition and their related exemption is temporary whereas the appellant's condition and requested exemption is permanent. ID at 12-16, 19-22. The appellant has failed to show that such a distinction is not a reasonable one. He also challenges the administrative judge's reliance on the CBPO's Medical Standards and Physical Requirements as requiring incumbents to work rotational shifts and significant overtime on the basis that the document provides that the Officer "may" work extended or unscheduled hours and "may" be required to rotate shifts, assignments, and duty stations. Reading this document in conjunction with the position description supports the administrative judge's finding. The use of "may" (along with "required") in the Standards and Requirements does not provide a basis to disregard the position description, which is, on this point, wholly consistent with other evidence, including all of the testimony, that the ability to work the graveyard shift and significant overtime is an essential function of the CBPO position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge ignored the fact that the agency exempted him from working the graveyard shift for a period of time with apparently no adverse effect on the agency's mission. As the administrative judge found, the new Port Director who took that position in May 2008 found an unusually large number of employees on light duty and an inconsistent process used to manage them. ID at 19. <span id="Page_1163"></span>She also found that a significant portion of those employees had been on light duty for a very long time and that management had not been following up on their progress. For these reasons, the new Port Director undertook to change the way the agency handled light duty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The work experience of past incumbents in the job is a factor for consideration under the EEOC's regulations on "essential functions." However, to the extent that the agency accommodated the appellant for a period of time by eliminating essential functions, it was not obligated to do so indefinitely. <span class="Italic">Comerford v. Department of the Navy</span>, Appeal No. 01A44524, 2006 WL 2096269, at *5 (E.E.O.C. July 21, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in failing to consider the availability of other CBPOs to work the graveyard shift. The EEOC's regulations provide that a job function may be essential for any of several reasons, one of which is that there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(2)(ii). By its language, that provision does not require that a function must be considered essential if there are a limited number of such employees. While there was testimony that substantially more CBPOs routinely work at the Port than CBPOs who are required to work the graveyard shift on any particular night, CD (testimony of Acting Port Director William Molaski), there was also testimony that budget and morale implications arise when CBPOs are ordered to work more overtime than their fair share. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (testimony of Michael Brady, Chief Port Officer). Moreover, the administrative judge's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision. <span class="Italic">Marques v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 129, 132 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="noindent">Alvara sought review at the EEOC. This time, on Commission vote as opposed to a decision by OFO, the EEOC issued a decision not concurring with the Board. In <span class="Italic">Petitioner v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0320110053 (2014), the Commission overruled <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> and found that Alvara was a qualified individual with a disability and it would not have been an undue hardship to accommodate him, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">i.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Essential Functions v. Time for Performing Essential Functions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Essential functions are the duties of a job, that is, the outcomes that must be achieved by someone in that position. <span class="Italic">Ta v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is a strong temptation among agencies to frame attendance, or other measures of the time at which functions must be performed, as essential functions. This represents a flawed understanding of the requirements and structure of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Performing certain job functions sometimes requires a person's presence at the worksite. But the fact that attendance can be a condition precedent to performing a function does not render it a job function in and of itself. Job functions are the duties that a person must perform or the outcomes that must be achieved by the person in the job. Attendance and timing are neither duties nor outcomes by themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, attendance and timing are methods, albeit important ones, by which a person accomplishes the essential functions of a job. And, as with other methods by which a function is accomplished (e.g. lifting as a method of transporting packages or use of certain software as a method of transcribing notes), attendance and timing are subject to the law's obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation that does not impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In fact, considering attendance as an essential job function as opposed to a method by which essential functions are accomplished, leads to the perverse and unacceptable conclusion that any employee with disability-related absences is an unqualified individual and, therefore, unable to claim the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Cottrell v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A0004 (Feb. 2, 2001); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950539 (Apr. 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request 05880859 (May 21, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This does not mean, however, that attendance and timing are irrelevant or unimportant to a Rehabilitation Act claim. To the contrary, as we have recognized in our past guidance, attendance and timing can be crucial factors in determining whether a request for accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the finances or operations of an agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">For certain positions, the time during which an essential function is performed may be critical. This could affect whether an employer can grant a request to modify an employee's schedule. Employers should carefully assess whether modifying the hours could significantly disrupt their operations--that is, cause undue hardship--or whether the essential functions may be performed at different times with little or no impact on the operations or the ability of other employees to perform their jobs. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice 915.002, Question 22 (Oct. 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, our precedential federal sector cases have recognized that the proper way to determine whether an individual is qualified for a job is to ask whether that person can perform the essential functions of the job when at work. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Cottrell v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A0004 (Feb. 2, 2001); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950539 (Apr. 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request 05880859 (May 21, 1990). Once that determination is made, the analysis then moves to whether an accommodation (if needed) that would enable the person to perform those functions when at work (such as leave or a modified schedule) imposes an undue hardship on the finances or operation of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> did not adhere to our Enforcement Guidance and precedential federal sector cases in its analysis of the essential functions of a part-time Customs and Border Protection Officer, we find that it was wrongly decided on that point. We therefore overturn that portion of the decision. As the MSPB relied upon <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> in finding that the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer include working rotating shifts and significant amounts of overtime, we must conclude that its analysis was in error and conclude that its decision constitutes an incorrect interpretation of our applicable policy directives and Enforcement Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ii.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Essential Functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For a Customs and Border Protection Officer, the essential functions may include duties such as inspecting travelers; examining applicants for immigration privileges and benefits; seizing suspect property; and detaining people engaging in suspicious activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no question that Petitioner can perform such duties when he is at work. Therefore, we find that Petitioner is a qualified individual with a disability, who can perform the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant is qualified and can perform the fundamental job duties of a Customs and Border Protection Officer, the appropriate question is whether the Agency had a duty to accommodate his sleep apnea by allowing his absence from the graveyard shift. The Agency must therefore establish that modifying Petitioner's work hours would significantly disrupt the facility's operations--that is, cause undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Undue Hardship</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer does not have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the employer. Generalized conclusions will not suffice to support a claim of undue hardship. Instead, undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. A determination of undue hardship should be based on several factors, including:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the nature and cost of the accommodation needed;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the overall financial resources of the facility making the reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at this facility; the effect on expenses and resources of the facility;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the overall financial resources, size, number of employees, and type and location of facilities of the employer (if the facility involved in the reasonable accommodation is part of a larger entity);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the type of operation of the employer, including the structure and functions of the workforce, the geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility involved in making the accommodation to the employer;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the MSPB did not make a finding on undue hardship, the Commission determines that the record is adequately developed to make a finding on this issue. Here, the facility employed about 700 Customs and Border Protection Officers to monitor, at all times, four bridges connecting the United States and Mexico. It is undisputed that the Agency permitted officers at this facility to swap shifts with each other, and exempted female officers, who were pregnant or breastfeeding, from working the graveyard shift for up to two years per child.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on these facts, we find that allowing Petitioner, as one of 700 officers, to work between 6:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> and midnight would not cause an undue hardship at this particular facility. Given that the Agency had previously allowed Petitioner to modify his work schedule for about one and a half years without significantly disrupting the facility's operations,3 and the flexibility with which other officers could adjust their work schedules for various reasons, such as training, leave, an unexpected emergency, pregnancy, and breast-feeding, we find no compelling evidence to suggest that modifying Petitioner's hours would significantly disrupt the facility's operations or the ability of the hundreds of other officers to perform their jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor are we convinced by the generalized assertions of Agency officials, who argued that the Agency had never before permanently modified the <span id="Page_1164"></span>work schedule of a Customs and Border Protection Officer (although they conceded that there have been "temporary" modifications of substantial duration), and that permitting such a permanent modification would lower morale.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our Enforcement Guidance makes it clear that an employer cannot claim undue hardship "based on the fact that provision of a reasonable accommodation might have a negative impact on the morale of other employees." EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002). Moreover, our Enforcement Guidance commands that, absent undue hardship, an employer must provide a modified schedule when required as a reasonable accommodation, "even if it does not provide such schedules for other employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Question 22.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all these reasons, we determine that the Agency failed to show that modifying Petitioner's work schedule would cause undue hardship. Therefore, we conclude that the Agency erred in (1) denying Petitioner's reasonable accommodation request to work between the hours of 6:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> and midnight, and (2) removing him.</p>
<p class="noindent">In accordance with mixed case procedures, the case moved back the MSPB. In an opinion short of analysis, the Board did not concur with the EEOC and certified the case for resolution by the Special Panel. In <span class="Italic">Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 MSPB 453, 457-60, 2014 MSPB 63 (August 13, 2014), the Board found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC decision, to which we are asked to defer, is unreasonable both from a legal and a management/operational perspective. At its core, the EEOC decision fundamentally addresses not an interpretation of discrimination law, but rather an agency's ability to determine the essential functions of any given position, in this case, a law enforcement officer position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To recapitulate, a unanimous Board held in <span class="Italic">Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 627 (2011), that the ability to work the graveyard shift and significant overtime was an essential function of the CBPO position for purposes of the relevant disability discrimination regulation defining a qualified individual with disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We did so based on the well-reasoned decision of the EEOC in <span class="Italic">Bouffard v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120065257, 2008 WL 276452 (E.E.O.C. Jan. 16, 2008), which held that the ability to work rotational shifts and overtime are essential functions of the position, and the accommodation of not having to work rotational shifts and overtime is, in essence, a request to change the essential functions of the job, which the agency is not required to do. The EEOC has now determined that <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, or at least the portion heavily relied upon by the Board in finding that "the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer include working rotating shifts and significant amounts of overtime," was wrongly decided. <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320110053 at 6 of 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More importantly, we based our decision on our knowledge of civil service law. Under the mixed case system governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, the Board generally must defer to the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law. <span class="Italic">E.g., Hooper v. Department of the Interior</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 6 (2014); <span class="Italic">Wingate v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 7 (2012). Likewise, when the EEOC has reasonably interpreted a point of discrimination law, the Board cannot properly apply a different interpretation merely because the Board's interpretation is also reasonable. <span class="Italic">Cf. Fulman v. United States</span>, 434 U.S. 528, 534-36 (1978) (a reasonable interpretation of a statute by the agency primarily charged with its administration is entitled to deference, even when there is a competing interpretation that is also reasonable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Board need not defer to the EEOC's interpretation of what constitutes a civil service law, rule, or regulation, the interpretation of which falls squarely within the purview of the Board's area of expertise. <span class="Italic">Archerda v. Department of Defense</span>, 2014 MSPB 49, &#x00B6; 28 (citing <span class="Italic">Southerland v. Department of Defense</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 20 (2013) (the Board generally defers to the EEOC on issues of substantive discrimination law unless the EEOC's decision rests on civil service law for its support or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law)); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 13 n.4 (2014) (same). The relationship between the Board and the EEOC is reflected in the statutory due deference a Special Panel should give to the respective expertise of the Board and the EEOC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(B); <span class="Italic">see King v. Lynch</span>, 21 F.3d 1084, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the court distinguished between discrimination laws and civil service laws by comparing section 7702(b)(3)(B)(i), which references the discrimination laws set out in subsection (a)(1)(B), with section 7702(c)(2), which references the "civil service laws, rules, regulations, and policy directives").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under civil service law, CBPOs are classified as law enforcement officers. They are charged with the safety and security of the American people, protecting the country's borders from terrorism, intercepting the smuggling of humans, drugs and other contraband, preventing illegal migration and the entry of agricultural pests, and facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel. The special nature of these jobs is why law enforcement officers are treated differently from other civil servants in everything from essential functions to retirement calculations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331 (2); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401 (17) (definitions of "law enforcement officer" for retirement purposes under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System, respectively); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307 (providing that agencies may set a maximum age limit for an original appointment to law enforcement officer positions such as CBPOs).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with any law enforcement officer organization, exigent circumstances obviously will require the occasional performance of duties during the graveyard shift and/or during overtime. For every officer who cannot perform these essential functions, others will be required to meet these responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Silk v. City of Chicago</span>, 194 F.3d 788, 796-97 (7th Cir. 1999) (coworkers were angry at a police officer who was allowed to work only day shift and light duty assignments due to severe sleep apnea, especially given that he also was able to work a night job teaching classes at a local university).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC now asks us to second guess the employing agency in what is an essential function of this position. We refuse to do so. To that end, we note that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not define the term "essential functions." Regulations interpreting the Act, however, provide that "essential functions" means "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires," as distinguished from "marginal functions." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(1). Determining whether a particular function is "essential" or not is generally a factual inquiry, reserved for the finder of fact on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">Bartee v. Michelin North America, Inc</span>., 374 F.3d 906, 915 (10th Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Turner v. Hershey Chocolate U.S.</span>, 440 F.3d 604, 612 (3d Cir. 2006). Absent evidence of discriminatory animus, the Board "generally give[s] substantial weight to the employer's view of job requirements." <span class="Italic">Ward v. Massachusetts Health Research Institute, Inc</span>., 209 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2000). "In other words, [the Board's] inquiry into essential functions 'is not intended to second guess the employer or to require the employer to lower company standards.'" <span class="Italic">Mulloy v. Acushnet Co</span>., 460 F.3d 141, 147 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">Mason v. Avaya Communications, Inc</span>., 357 F.3d 1114, 1119 (10th Cir. 2004)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The practice of second guessing also runs contrary to the EEOC's recent case law suggesting that it is an agency's ultimate responsibility to determine what an essential function of a job is. According to the EEOC, in ***, <span class="Italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613, 2013 WL 8338375 (Dec. 23, 2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The essential functions are the <span class="Italic">duties</span> of a job--i.e., the outcomes that must be achieved by the person in the position. <span class="Italic">Once an agency identifies the essential functions for a position</span>, the agency can then put in place qualification standards, selection criteria, or employment tests that are designed to determine whether an employee or applicant can perform those essential functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (italics added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find no compelling reason to defer to the EEOC's decision. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1347 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Accordingly, we conclude that as a matter of law the EEOC decision is based upon an incorrect interpretation of civil service law, rule, or regulation. In the alternative, we find that the evidence in the record does not support the EEOC decision, and the EEOC decision is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law, rule, or regulation. Thus, the Board cannot agree with the EEOC decision. We therefore REAFFIRM our prior decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.162(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Special Panel, with Chair Dennis Walsh and Commissioner Chai Feldblum writing for the majority, adopted the EEOC's position finding that working the graveyard shift was not an essential function of being a border protection officer. In doing so, the Special Panel focused on defining the essential functions of a position as "the outcomes that must be achieved by someone in that position." Noting that the Board had not specifically identified a civil service law, rule or regulation that was violated by the Commission's interpretation of the Rehabilitation Act, the majority, in <span class="Italic">Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 MSPB 613, 621-32, 2014 MSPB 77 (September 29, 2014), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Special Panel's scope of review is described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2). The Special Panel must first determine whether the issues fall within the purview of civil service law or anti-discrimination law. The Special Panel, in ultimately deciding the issues, is required to give due deference to the respective expertise of the MSPB and EEOC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(B). As set forth in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The balance struck by &#x00A7; 7702 is really quite simple. The EEOC review is to ensure that the MSPB refrains from basing its decisions on incorrect interpretations of discrimination law. The MSPB certification to the Special Panel, on the other hand, ensures that the EEOC may not err by misinterpreting civil service law. The Panel will review the record, according due deference to the expertise of <span id="Page_1165"></span>each agency to determine whether the substance of the EEOC's decision with which the MSPB disagrees was actually predicated on a misinterpretation of civil service law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. at 481.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> and its progeny, the Special Panel's obligation to defer to each agency's expertise will result in one of three possible outcomes:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The Panel will overrule the MSPB and defer to the EEOC where: (a) the EEOC decision does not constitute an incorrect interpretation of a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directives; and (b) the EEOC's decision that the MSPB's interpretation of discrimination law was incorrect has a reasonable basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Panel will defer to the MSPB where: (a) the EEOC decision as found by MSPB incorrectly interpreted a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive; and (b) the EEOC's conclusion in its decision that MSPB's interpretation of discrimination law was incorrect lacks a reasonable basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The Panel will reach a decision addressing the merits of the case only where: (a) the decision of the MSPB that the EEOC decision incorrectly applied a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive is correct, and (b) the decision of the EEOC that the MSPB, in its initial decision, incorrectly interpreted and applied discrimination law is correct, thus leaving the merits of the case to be correctly decided under civil service and discrimination law by the Special Panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 483. In this case, the Panel overrules the MSPB and defers to the EEOC because: (1) the EEOC decision does not constitute an incorrect interpretation of a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive; and (2) the EEOC's decision that the MSPB's interpretation of discrimination law was incorrect has a reasonable basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent, citing only dissenting opinions from previous Special Panel decisions and raising for the first time an issue that was not argued by either party before the Special Panel, argues that the "analytical framework adopted by the majority in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> does not comport with the plain language of the statute and fails to give proper effect to the Special Panel's statutory duty to decide the issue in dispute." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 4. However, the principal of <span class="Italic">stare decisis</span> supports the Special Panel's decision to follow <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>. The principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> have been followed for nearly 30 years. <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>'s deferential standard of review is based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(b), which requires the Special Panel to give "due deference" to the expertise of the MSPB with regard to civil service principles, and of the EEOC regarding discrimination law. We shall continue to follow <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>'s sound principles. The dissent also argues that "[i]ndeed it is absurd to decline to reach the merits of this dispute on the ground that the EEOC did not cite any provision of civil service law given that its decision here is so incompatible with basic principles of civil service law." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 6. The dissent's argument ignores the fact that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(b) requires the Special Panel to give "due deference" to the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law. The dissent's argument also disregards the failure of the Board's certification order to set forth a specific argument as to how the Commission's decision is incompatible with basic principles of civil service law. Thus, the Special Panel has no grounds to address the merits of the underlying decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board's certification to the Special Panel lacked a specific and thoroughly analyzed explanation of how the Commission's decision incorrectly interprets a specific civil service law. The Board's certification also failed to adequately explain how the Commission's decision is unsupported by the record and is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. The dissent seeks to get around this flaw by explaining in more detail its view of the reasoning behind the Board's certification order. However, such after-the-fact justification by one member of the Board cannot save the Board's certification order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Civil Service Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Board held that the Commission's decision constitutes an incorrect interpretation of civil service, law, rule or regulation, it never precisely identified its own interpretation of what constitutes a "civil service law, rule and regulation." Before moving forward with the analysis of the Board's decision it is important to set forth exactly what a civil service law, rule, or regulation is, especially in relation to the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Civil Service Reform Act defines "civil service" as "consist[ing] of all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Government of the United States, except positions in the uniformed services." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2102. Title 5 of the United States Code outlines the government's organization and employees. However, Title 5 does not expressly define "civil service law." "Thus, the question whether civil service law includes employment discrimination laws which have wider application beyond government employment can be answered only after an examination of the statutory context and the underlying policies." <span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, 21 F.3d 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B)(i)-(v), discrimination laws are under the jurisdiction of the EEOC:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;has been affected by an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16),</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206 (d)),</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii)&#x2003;section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791),</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iv)&#x2003;sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a), or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(v)&#x2003;any rule, regulation, or policy directive prescribed under any provision of law described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this subparagraph, the Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701 of this title and this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B)(i)-(v). Under section 7702(b)(3)(B)(i), when the case is appealed to the Commission, it is the Commission's duty to decide whether the MSPB has incorrectly interpreted the provisions of discrimination law listed in subsections (a)(1)(B)(i)-(iv). By process of elimination, therefore, these authorities cannot be the "civil service laws, rules, or regulations" that are referred to in the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, 21 F.3d 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1994), confirms this view. In <span class="Italic">King</span>, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management argued that the MSPB misinterpreted civil service law and regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board's decision would have a substantial impact on civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directives. Specifically, the Director asserted that the MSPB erred in interpreting the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794, and its implementing regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1613.702. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1088. The court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Section 7702 of Title 5 sets forth the appeal procedures for cases where there is an alleged violation of certain discrimination laws. That section distinguishes between discrimination laws and civil service laws. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(3)(B)(i) (referring to the discrimination laws set out in subsection (a)(1)(B)) <span class="Italic">with id</span>. &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2) (referring to "civil service laws, rules, regulations, and policy directives"). Cases in which certain unlawful discrimination is alleged, although initially decided by the MSPB, may at the appellant's option be reviewed administratively by the EEOC following an adverse MSPB decision. When that occurs, as in this case, &#x00A7; 7702(b) gives the EEOC the primary role in interpreting the pertinent discrimination law and regulation (in this case a regulation promulgated by the EEOC) and under &#x00A7; 7702(c) the MSPB has that role in interpreting "any civil service law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(B) (requiring deference to the "respective expertise of the Board and [EEOC]"). The Rehabilitation Act is listed as one of the discrimination statutes subject to this procedure, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B)(iii), and thus is distinguished from civil service laws referred to in &#x00A7; 7702(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1088.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court concluded that the Rehabilitation Act and the other discrimination laws, although applicable to federal employers, have broader application and are not themselves civil service laws. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court also reasoned that "[t]he Senate Report and statutory scheme for dealing with discrimination issues demonstrates that Congress intended that there be a consistent interpretation of these laws whether their alleged violation arises within or without the federal government." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 states that civil service law should not abridge discrimination law. Title I of the Civil Service Reform Act, Section 2302(d), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(d)&#x2003;This section shall not be construed to extinguish or lessen any effort to achieve equal employment opportunity through affirmative action or any right or remedy available to any employee or applicant for employment in the civil service under-,</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16), prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in <span id="Page_1166"></span>Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a), prohibiting discrimination on the basis of age;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(3)&#x2003;under section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)), prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(4)&#x2003;section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), prohibiting discrimination on the basis of handicapping condition; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(5)&#x2003;the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status or political affiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statutory language, legislative history and case law recognize that interpretation of a civil service law, rule, or regulation does not encompass interpretation of statutes and regulations relating to employment discrimination. Thus, the Commission's decision did not misinterpret a civil service, law, rule, regulation, or policy directive when it relied strictly upon the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations and case law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Commission Decision Did Not Constitute an Unreasonable Interpretation of Civil Service Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board interpreted the Commission's decision as encroaching on an agency's "management/operational perspective" and discretion to determine the tasks, duties and responsibilities of any given position, in this case, a law enforcement position. <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 8. The Board misinterpreted the Commission's decision. The dissent argues that "[t]hus, we may reasonably interpret 'civil service law' in this context as encompassing the judicial and administrative decisions and legal principles that govern the operation of the federal civil service in addition to applicable statutory provisions." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 7. The dissent's interpretation would effectively result in any EEOC decision that conflicted with any part of an MSPB decision triggering Special Panel review of the merits. That interpretation is clearly contrary to the intent of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board's misinterpretation of the Commission's decision is illustrated by its citation to random statutes that pertain to law enforcement officers. The Board states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under civil service law, CBPOs are classified as law enforcement officers. They are charged with the safety and security of the American people, protecting the country's borders from terrorism, intercepting the smuggling of humans, drugs and other contraband, preventing illegal migration and the entry of agricultural pests, and facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel. The special nature of these jobs is why law enforcement officers are treated differently from other civil servants in everything from essential functions to retirement calculations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(2); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17) (definitions of "law enforcement officer" for retirement purposes under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System, respectively); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307 (providing that agencies may set a maximum age limit for an original appointment to law enforcement officer positions such as CBPOs).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13. None of the statutes cited in the certification order pertains to the essential functions of a CBPO officer. The cited statutes are silent on "essential functions," and do not support the Board's belief that agencies enjoy unfettered discretion to identify "essential functions." Instead, two of the cited provisions relate to retirement for law enforcement officers and the third establishes a maximum age for hiring law enforcement officers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board further misinterprets the Commission's decision when it states, "The EEOC now asks us to second guess the employing agency in what is an essential function of this position. We refuse to do so. To that end, we note that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not define the term 'essential functions.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. The Board holds that the Commission's decision infringes upon the agency's right and authority to establish the terms and conditions of employment and to determine the essential functions of a position. The Board misreads the Commission's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal agencies do enjoy wide discretion in assigning work, duties and responsibilities to personnel and in determining how agency operations will be conducted, in accordance with applicable employment discrimination laws. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106. The dissent argues that "5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106 gives management exclusive authority, subject to undertaking permissive bargaining, with regard to assigning work, determining the personnel by which the agency operations shall be conducted, and taking disciplinary actions." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, nothing in the Commission's decision restricts or prohibits any agency's managerial and operational prerogatives or any agency's right to establish the terms and conditions of employment. The Board errs where it concludes that under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, management's evaluation of a position's "essential functions" is dispositive. Management can assign duties but cannot determine as a matter of law whether those duties are essential functions. The ADA states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). The inquiry required to define a position's "essential functions" under the Rehabilitation Act is to be performed by the finder of fact--not the employer. The employer's judgment as to what functions are essential is only one factor taken into consideration by the fact-finder who will ultimately determine the essential functions of a position. That fact-finder is the EEOC. The EEOC has final authority to determine what an "essential function" is--not the agency. Further, consistent with the authority granted to the EEOC by Congress, the EEOC has the authority to define the limits of "essential functions" in both regulation and guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the MSPB erred when it held that the Commission interfered with the agency's authority to determine the essential functions of the appellant's position. As explained further <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the Commission's decision did not repudiate the agency's judgment. Rather, it disagreed with the agency on the legal analysis required by the Rehabilitation Act when evaluating scheduling and work requirements. It corrected the agency's legal error of characterizing working rotating shifts and overtime (a method of performing the functions of a job) as essential functions of the CPBO position and held that if the agency believed that it could not provide a scheduling accommodation to the complainant it needed to show that such accommodations imposed an undue hardship on agency operations or finance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so doing, the Commission interpreted its own regulations, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); relied on its own federal sector case law, e.g., <span class="Italic">Cottrell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00004, 2001 WL 1218254 (E.E.O.C. Feb. 2, 2001); and used its own Enforcement Guidance, EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002). <span class="Italic">See Commission Decision</span>, 2014 EEOPUB LEXIS 1810, at *11-*12. The Commission also relied upon its own case law and Enforcement Guidance in finding that the agency failed to show that modifying the appellant's work schedule would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *19. Thus, the Commission relied strictly on discrimination law, not civil service law, in resolving the issues in dispute in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's decision only relied upon the anti-discrimination statutes, EEOC regulations, EEOC case law, and EEOC enforcement guidance to render its decision. Whether an employee is able to perform the functions of a position and whether an agency considered a reasonable accommodation are clearly determinations under discrimination law, not civil service law. It is the EEOC, not the MSPB, that has primary authority to determine this issue, and the Special Panel is required to give the EEOC due deference. The EEOC did not infringe upon or incorrectly interpret civil service rules or regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent argues that the Commission's "categorical exclusion of certain terms and conditions of employment from being considered essential to the effective performance of the position is fundamentally at odds with the Board's jurisprudence concerning adverse actions based on physical inability to perform." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 12. The Commission's decision, however, is an interpretation of discrimination law--not the Board's jurisprudence concerning adverse actions based on physical inability to perform. In fact, the dissent's basic point, that the EEOC should not categorically exclude attendance issues from the definition of "essential functions," is in reality just a disagreement with the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law. The Special Panel cannot give "due deference" to the EEOC on discrimination law and, at the same time, overturn that interpretation based only on the fact that the MSPB disagrees with it. There must be some explicit conflict with civil service law, which has not been shown.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Commission Decision Is Supported by the Record</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board failed to specifically explain and analyze how the Commission's decision is unsupported by the record. The Special Panel should not and will not guess what the Board means in holding that the Commission's decision is unsupported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The EEOC's Decision Is Not Unreasonable</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board also failed to specifically explain how the EEOC decision was so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law, rule, or regulation. The dissent argues that "the EEOC's decision effectively eviscerates the authority of federal agencies, in the first instance, from <span id="Page_1167"></span>ever establishing time and attendance requirements as essential terms and conditions of employment." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 25. The dissent's interpretation of the Commission's decision is not accurate. The Commission's decision does not say that attendance can never be an important term and condition of a position. In fact, the Commission's decision concludes that accommodations based on attendance are not required if the agency establishes that they pose an undue burden on its operations. The Special Panel finds that the Commission's position in this regard was reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is unique because the Commission's decision overturned its own legal precedent and a specific portion of <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>. The administrative judge and the Board relied heavily upon <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> in their decisions. However, the Commission is well within its authority to overturn a decision rendered by the EEOC's OFO.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission relied upon the Rehabilitation Act, an anti-discrimination statute--not a civil service statute. The Commission relied upon its own case law and its own enforcement guidance in rendering its decision. In conducting its analysis of whether the appellant was entitled to a reasonable accommodation, the Commission reviewed <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>. The Commission determined that <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, or at least the portion heavily relied upon by the Board in finding that "the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer include working rotating shifts and significant amounts of overtime," was wrongly decided. <span class="Italic">Commission Decision</span>, 2014 EEOPUB LEXIS 1810, at *6. The Commission found that working substantial overtime and/or the graveyard shift were the methods by which an individual performed the job's essential functions, not the essential functions themselves. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In fact, considering attendance as an essential job function as opposed to a method by which essential functions are accomplished, leads to the perverse and unacceptable conclusion that any employee with disability-related absences is an unqualified individual and, therefore, unable to claim the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Cottrell v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A0004 (Feb. 2. 2001); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950529 (Apr. 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request 05880859 (May 21, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *4. The Commission cited to its Enforcement Guidance in reasoning:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Employers should carefully assess whether modifying the hours could significantly disrupt their operations--that is, cause undue hardship--or whether the essential functions may be performed at different times with little or no impact on the operations or the ability of other employees to perform their jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., citing to EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice 915.002, Question 22 (Oct. 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board failed to clearly explain why it was unreasonable for the Commission to decide that the instant case should have been analyzed through the lens of undue hardship instead of an essential function analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are several steps that an agency must take in analyzing a request for a reasonable accommodation. The Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. Once an agency finds that the employee requesting the reasonable accommodation has a disability, it must determine whether the employee is "qualified."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual with a disability is qualified if the individual "satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment positions such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). Essential functions are the duties of a job, that is, the outcomes that must be achieved by someone in that position. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613, 2013 WL 8338375, at *7 (E.E.O.C. Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Performing certain job functions sometimes requires a person's presence at the worksite. But the fact that attendance can be a condition precedent to performing a function does not render it a job function in and of itself. Job functions are the duties that a person must perform or the outcomes that must be achieved by the person in the job. Attendance and timing are neither duties nor outcomes by themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Commission Decision</span>, 2014 EEOPUB LEXIS 1810, at *10. The Commission found that since there was no question that the appellant could perform the duties of a CBPO when at work, he was qualified. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *14. The next step in the agency's analysis is whether the appellant's requested reasonable accommodation posed an undue hardship. An employer does not have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the employer's operation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several factors must be considered in determining whether a requested reasonable accommodation is an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *15-*16. The Commission's determination that the agency did not meet its burden in substantiating its undue hardship argument is reasonable. The Commission found that the agency made generalized conclusions and assessments supporting its view that providing a reasonable accommodation would result in an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *18. It is not sufficient to merely state in a conclusory manner that an accommodation would be an undue hardship. The undue hardship burden is a "rigorous one" and the agency must "prove convincingly" that such a hardship actually exists. <span class="Italic">Swafford v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01831944, 1984 WL 484605 (May 21, 1984). The agency bears the burden of proof to show not only that an accommodation would impose an undue hardship, but that the agency actually considered the accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the instant case, it was not unreasonable for the Commission to find that the agency did not meet its burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, the MSPB disagrees with the EEOC. However, it failed to specifically explain how the Commission's decision misinterprets civil service law or how the decision is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. The MSPB sought to transform this controversy into a civil service matter by contending that the EEOC violated civil service principles. No matter how vigorously the MSPB characterizes this case as a violation of civil service law, the Commission's decision was based on its interpretation of discrimination law. The Commission's interpretation of discrimination law and their decision are reasonable. As far as this Special Panel's review is concerned, that is the end of the story.</p>
