<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-134"><span class="space">c.</span> $10,001-$15,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has awarded between $11,000 and $25,000 in cases where the symptoms were either severe, but short-lived or lengthy but not particularly severe. In <span class="Italic">Grice v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01976646 (2000), the Commission determined that the complainant was entitled to $11,000 in damages for what it termed "severe emotional distress." The award was diminished because other factors contributed to the stress such as a workplace injury, denial of workers' compensation claim, and problems with her health insurance.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hull v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01951441 (1998), the Commission awarded $12,000 in damages where the appellant suffered emotional distress due to his supervisor's reprisal-motivated harassment. The Commission also awarded $12,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Almera v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A13618 (2002), where the complainant testified that her nonselection resulted in emotional distress and caused her to dissociate from friends and family. The Commission found that only some of the complainant's emotional distress was the result of the nonpromotion. In <span class="Italic">Parker v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A12829 (2002), the Commission awarded $12,000 to a victim of sexual harassment, finding that much of the complainant's distress was caused by a subsequent termination that was not the subject of the instant complaint. The Commission did brush aside agency arguments that the end of two personal relationships and the death of the complainant's mother caused her emotional distress. It found that the arguments were speculative because the complainant testified that she voluntarily ended the relationships and that, while the death of her mother saddened her, she had accepted it.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $12,000 also was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994040 (2002), where the complainant suffered from a preexisting depressive disorder that was exacerbated by the agency's failure to accommodate her disability. The limited damage award was based, in part, upon the fact that the most severe symptoms related to the discrimination lasted only about two months.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $5,000 in damages by the agency was increased to $12,000 in <span class="Italic">Morris v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073171 (2007). In increasing the award, the Commission noted that the complainant was subjected to verbal sexual harassment and some unwanted touching for a period of more than a year. However, the Commission also found that the duration of the harassment was shorter and the incidents of harassment less egregious than in several cases where it had awarded $20,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reduced an award of $15,000 by the administrative judge to $12,000 where the award included compensation for the stress caused by the agency's delay in investigating the complaints. In reducing the award in <span class="Italic">Cosentine v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A20101 (2003), the Commission noted that damages may be awarded only for the harm caused by the agency's discrimination and not for harm caused by delayed investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Steenson v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A13535 (2003), the Commission awarded $12,000 in damages where his nonselection caused hair loss, weight gain, skin rashes, fatigue, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, depression and a general loss of enjoyment of life, family and friends. The Commission, in its decision, did note the duration of these symptoms but, in ruling on the complainant's pecuniary damage claim for medical expenses, upheld the agency's determination that much of the complainant's distress was caused by the delay in investigating and litigating his case.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $12,000 in damages was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Marker v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A33910.txt">01A33910</a> (2004), where the complainant was ridiculed about her hearing loss, her supervisor physically threatened her on several occasions, she was required to do additional work and her supervisor gossiped with customers about her. The Commission also noted the harassment continued over a four-year period.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $12,000 where the complainant was not selected for two temporary positions and later not selected for two supervisory positions. In <span class="Italic">Nixon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A45838 (2005), the Commission noted the findings of the administrative judge that the complainant had testified the nonselections still affected her. However, it also noted the findings of the judge, that the complainant's husband testified that her periods of being upset were "temporary" and that the main effect was that she was less talkative.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found an award of $12,000 in damages was appropriate where a failure to accommodate led the complainant to suffer from depression, stress, high blood pressure, dizziness and headaches. However, in <span class="Italic">Harden v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720080002 (2011), the Commission noted that the complainant previously suffered from depression and also had a stressful home environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $12,500 in damages by the administrative judge was upheld in <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720060079 (2008), where a period of retaliatory harassment culminated in several tangible employment actions, including a negative interim performance appraisal, a letter of reprimand, and an ultimatum that the complainant either transfer or resign. The complainant testified that he suffered from paranoia and depression, felt threatened, and could not eat, sleep or have marital relations. Although the award appears low, it presumably was based on the lack of evidence on damages presented by the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Elvera S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141452 (2016), the Commission upheld an award of $12,000 by the administrative judge where the judge found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that she was emotional, depressed, [had] a lack of interest in things she used to enjoy with [her] family, going out to the movies, restaurants, sporting events, just to name a few. [She was] unable to sleep, anxiety, emotional distress and [had] panic attacks. AJ Decision at 13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ further noted that "Complainant testified that she had chest pains and her physician performed an EKG. Complainant testified that she was taking prescribed medication for depression, anxiety/panic attacks, and inability to sleep. Complainant also testified that she was under the care of a therapist and attended a support group to help with the depression and anxiety...Complainant provided a statement from her son in support of her allegations. Her son's statement reiterated the harm identified by Complainant." AJ Decision at 13.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gerber v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30062.final.txt">07A30062</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $13,000 in damages where the record was somewhat unclear as to how much of the complainant's emotional distress was related to discrimination and how much was related to other factors.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $13,000 in compensatory damages was deemed appropriate where, among other things, the complainant was worried over his wife's medical condition during the period of a discriminatory shift change. In <span class="Italic">Dennis v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060071 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the hearing on damages, complainant called his wife (W1) and C1 to testify in support of his claim. According to complainant's testimony, his schedule began changing from January 2004 until November 2004. As a result of the frequent changes, he was unable to: (1) attend events with his wife, including, dinner; (2) go shopping with his wife; (3) attend bible study classes; and (4) share meals with his father. Further, according to complainant, his sex life significantly decreased. Additionally, complainant stated that his woodworking business deteriorated because he and C1 were unable to complete the work. Moreover, as a result of the frequent schedule changes, complainant became depressed. When he came home from work he was angry with his boss. Mentally he was not there, and he began drinking. Prior to this period, he drank occasionally on the week-ends. However, according to his testimony, during the relevant time period, he drank every day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">W1 explained that based on the frequent schedule changes, she did not know if complainant was coming or going. She estimated that his schedule changed weekly. W1 noted that she worked until 5 pm. After work, she and complainant would engage in various activities. For example, they would have dinner together, ride their bikes in the park, visit complainant's father, attend church, attend Wednesday Bible study, and attend marriage retreats. Similarly, she noticed that complainant and C1 were unable to work on their woodwork. W1 also testified that prior to his frequent change of schedule, complainant would drink socially for celebration. However, during this period, he began to drink excessively. Additionally, W1 testified that their sex lives changed and they discussed divorce. She further noticed that complainant stopped eating and began losing weight. Generally, the changes in schedule effected their communication and they argued all the time. After complainant transferred out of the facility in November 2004, she recounted that it took a few months for their relationship to return to normal. As for her stomach cancer, W1 noted that she had some minor side effects from this disease during the time period at issue here. There were no other stressors for the two of them at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C1 testified that as a result of complainant's frequent schedule changes, complainant became irritable as well as argumentative. C1 was also aware that his own frequent schedule changes affected his relationship with his wife. Further, according to C1, complainant was not dressing the same. Finally, he noted that the frequent changes "killed" their woodworking business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The award seems low given the circumstances, but was apparently tempered by the limited duration of only about one year and the complainant's unrelated concerns regarding his wife's health.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Secretary of Agriculture,</span> 01984574 (2001), the Commission awarded $15,000 in damages where the complainant prevailed on only one claim and there were other external factors causing his emotional distress. In part, the Commission relied on a statement from the complainant's doctor that his emotional problems were related to his job.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A13671 (2002), the Commission awarded $15,000 in nonpecuniary damages where she only partially prevailed <span id="Page_1844"></span>in her complainant against the agency. The Commission determined that the complainant suffered severe depression for approximately nine months due to the agency's retaliatory acts. However, the Commission also found that the complainant suffered from a variety of emotional and family problems during the same nine-month period.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McGraw v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A20121 (2002), the Commission upheld the award of $15,000 in damages by an administrative judge where the complainant suffered extreme depression, lack of self-confidence, sleepless nights, and weight gain. The administrative judge determined, however, that some of the complainant's emotional distress was caused by her rejection for positions during her earlier years with the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Based on the complainant's unrebutted testimony, the Commission awarded $15,000 in nonpecuniary damages in <span class="Italic">Randle-Harris v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04769 (2001), where the complainant suffered from interference in relationships, a worsening of her sickle cell anemia, and depression due to the discrimination. In making the award in <span class="Italic">Randle-Harris</span>, the Commission also gave a summary of similar awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the above legal standards, we agree with the agency that complainant submitted sufficient unrebutted evidence to establish that she suffered emotional harm as a result of the agency's discrimination. The record contains several instances where complainant describes the effects the discrimination had on her mental and physical health. Complainant's hearing testimony and statement in support of compensatory damages indicate that she experienced interference in relationships with family and friends, experienced a worsening of her sickle cell anemia condition, and experienced depression. We find that this uncontroverted evidence establishes complainant's entitlement to compensatory damages<span class="Italic">. See Sinott v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952872 (September 19, 1996) (stating that a complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can establish mental or emotional harm).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While there is no dispute that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages, the parties differ on the appropriate amount necessary to remedy the harm caused by the discrimination. Complainant contends that she should receive $75,000.00. The agency offers that $15,000.00 properly compensates complainant for any harm caused by the discrimination. Initially, we point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions<span class="Italic">. See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura</span>, 477 U.S. 299, 311-12 (1986) (stating that compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Commission has awarded compensatory damages in cases somewhat similar to complainant's case in terms of the harm sustained<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Batieste v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974616 (May 26, 2000)($12,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on complainant's and others' statements of emotional distress due to agency's discriminatory termination); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973551 (April 14, 2000) ($9,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on complainant's statements of the interference with family and marital relations, digestive problems, headaches, anxiety, sleeplessness, and exhaustion resulting from the agency's discrimination); <span class="Italic">Butler v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971729 (April 15, 1999)($7,500.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on complainant's testimony regarding his emotional distress); <span class="Italic">Hull v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, Appeal No. 01951441 (Sept. 18, 1998)($12,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on complainant's testimony of emotional distress due to retaliatory harassment); <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950342 (June 13, 1997)($5,00.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on emotional distress); <span class="Italic">Roundtree v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941906 (July 7, 1995)($8,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where medical evidence testimony was provided regarding complainant's emotional distress, but the majority of complainant's emotional problems were caused by factors other than the discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After analyzing the evidence which establishes the harm sustained by complainant and upon consideration of damage awards reached in comparable cases, the Commission agrees with the agency and finds that complainant is entitled to an award of non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $15,000.00. We find this case analogous to the above-referenced cases with respect to the nature, severity and duration of the harm. Finally, we note that this award is not motivated by passion or prejudice, is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and is consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar</span>, 865 F.2d at 848.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995204 (2001), the Commission increased an award of $8,000 to $15,000 even though the complainant had not appealed the nonpecuniary damage award. In reviewing the appealed pecuniary damage award, the Commission relied on its authority to reopen an appeal at any time by its own motion to review the nonpecuniary award. In increasing the agency's award, the Commission noted the emotional distress suffered by the complainant led to marital difficulties and that she even contemplated divorce.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $15,000 in damages was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Taber v. Postmaster General</span>, 01983780 (2001), where the agency's failure to hire the complainant resulted in his dissociating from friends and family, and caused anxiety, sleeplessness, and stomach problems. Likewise, the Commission awarded $15,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Littlewood v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993919 (2001), where the complainant and her son testified that she was under psychiatric treatment, but the complainant presented no corroborating evidence of the length and nature of the treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $3,000 was increased to $15,000 in <span class="Italic">Carmon-Coleman v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 07A00003 (2002), where the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment based on her disability that eventually led to a constructive discharge. In awarding $15,000, the Commission noted that the complainant testified that her emotional distress at times led to crying and, ultimately, sufficient frustration to quit. However, the complainant did not contend the emotional distress interfered with her personal relationships or was so severe that she developed somatic symptoms or required counseling. In many ways, <span class="Italic">Carmon-Coleman</span> is a demonstration of the axiom that a "tortfeasor takes his victims as he finds them." Most people, forced to resign from their jobs due to harassment, would suffer far greater emotional distress. But it seems the complainant in that case was more emotionally sturdy than most people and, as a result, suffered less distress. Because a compensatory damage award is meant to compensate for the harm suffered and not punish for the wrong done, the damage award in <span class="Italic">Carmon-Coleman</span> was relatively low.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Abdulla v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A02078 (2002), the Commission awarded $15,000 in damages where the complainant took a job as an emergency room physician to wait out an appointment as a staff nephrologist. When he was not selected, the complainant testified that he felt he lost professional status and avoided contact with family and friends. He also stopped interacting with his wife and children and taking part in school activities and sports for about a year.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Collington v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A03359 (2002), the Commission awarded $15,000 where the agency's failure to reasonably accommodate the complainant resulted in her hospitalization for aggravation of her preexisting asthma. Her emotional distress also lasted approximately six months. An award of $15,000 was upheld in <span class="Italic">Oke v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 07A10049 (2003), where the complainant testified that he suffered from sleeplessness and was prescribed medication for insomnia and depression. He further testified that his distress led to marital tension and that he suffered humiliation and financial stress.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although damages are determined by the level of harm suffered by the complainant and not by the egregiousness of the discriminatory actions, the character and severity of those actions can have an impact on damage awards. For example, the more humiliating and degrading the conduct, the more likely that significant damages will be awarded without medical evidence. In <span class="Italic">Wood v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A15274 (2003), the Commission sustained a $15,000 damage award after rejecting the complainant's testimony that the side effects of antidepressants had enhanced her damages. But, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Wood</span> also explained why medical testimony is not necessary to sustain a damage award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While expert medical evidence is necessary to prove causation where a medical condition is claimed to have been caused by discriminatory actions, the rule is different in the case of emotional distress. The Commission has held that evidence from a health care professional is not a prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional distress<span class="Italic">. See e.g. Mayo v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05990302 (July 21, 2000); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 18, 1998); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal 01945652 (July 17, 1995). Courts also have held that "expert testimony ordinarily is not required to ground money damages for mental anguish or emotional distress." <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co.</span>, 37 F.3d 712, 724 (1st Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Wulf v. City of Wichita</span>, 883 F.2d 842, 875 (10th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Busche v. Burkee</span>, 649 F.2d 509, 512 n.12 (7th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 454 U.S. 897 (1981). A complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can suffice to sustain his/her burden in this regard. <span class="Italic">See United</span> <span class="Italic">States v. Balistrieri,</span> 981 F.2d 916, 932 (7th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 114 S. Ct. 58 (1993) (housing discrimination). As the court noted in <span class="Italic">Balistrieri</span>, "[t]he more inherently degrading or humiliating the defendant's action is, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action; consequently, somewhat more conclusory evidence of emotional distress will be acceptable to support an award for emotional damages."</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant was financially unable to pay her bills as the result of lengthy suspension and felt she had been stripped of her dignity, the Commission awarded $15,000 in damages. <span class="Italic">See Wright-Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20118 (2003). In <span class="Italic">Wright,</span> the complainant also testified that she was humiliated by being escorted off the premises in front of coworkers, suffered a deep depression, lost 20 pounds and her mother had to care for her children.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1845"></span>In <span class="Italic">Hvizdak v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20112 (2003), the Commission reduced the administrative judge's award of $90,000 to $15,000 where the complainant suffered stress and depression as a result of discrimination and, because he lost his job, had to file for bankruptcy and borrow $25,000 from family members. In reducing the award, the Commission specifically noted the failure of the administrative judge to cite any decisions supporting his award of $90,000. The Commission also noted that the complainant was reinstated after one year as the result of grievance and that the cases relied upon by the complainant to support a higher damage award involved situations where the emotional distress had continued for at least a period of years.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $15,000 in damages was deemed sufficient in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20004 (2003), where the complainant worried that she would lose her home because of her financial difficulties. Prior to the discrimination, the complainant had been an independent person, but then had to rely on family and friends to help her. The resulting stress and depression also aggravated her previously existing Graves disease.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Norte v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01A24738 (2003), the Commission awarded $15,000 in damages, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her affidavit, complainant asserts that she "felt humiliated, demeaned and degraded.... Going to work every day became an act of shame." Complainant also contends that she had overwhelming feelings of dread, foreboding, anxiety, sadness, sorrow, grief, loss, helplessness and hopelessness. Complainant states that even at home, on the weekend, and on vacation, she thought about the agency's action constantly. She states that she had "lost control of [her] identity, [her] career and [her] future." Additionally, complainant asserts that she would often become immobilized in her office chair, biting her fingernails. Complainant contends that her physician prescribed medication for her which helped the nail-biting, but did not help her emotional distress. Complainant states that her depression and anxiety eased somewhat when she received the Commission's decision in September, 2001, finding that she had been subjected to retaliation. However, she states that her distress returned when she saw that the agency was not following through and compensating her properly. Complainant's husband also described the emotional distress that he saw his wife endure, and asserts that his wife's emotional distress had a detrimental effect on their family and on their marriage.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $15,000 in compensatory damages was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Pearman v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A40063 (2004), where the complainant prevailed on a sexual harassment claim but not her reprisal claim. The complainant's evidence established that most of the emotional distress occurred around the time the complainant had a change in duties which was found to be discriminatory and that the complainant suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and major depression.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered six months of emotional distress as a result of discrimination, was falsely accused of performance problems, had his personnel records altered and was passed over four times for a position for which he was qualified, the Commission upheld an award of $15,000 in damages. <span class="Italic">Ford v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40065_r.txt">07A40065</a> (2004). The Commission also noted the complainant was forced to relocate because of the discrimination and that the relocation caused marital problems.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">King v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 07A40003 (2005), the Commission upheld a damage award of $15,000 where the complainant testified that she suffered emotional distress, hypertension, embarrassment and nervousness over a four-year period. The Commission noted, however, that the complainant failed to present any evidence to corroborate her testimony and that the agency's medical expert testified that the hypertension was not related to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pohlel v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a54696.txt">01A54696</a> (2005), the Commission awarded the complainant $15,000 in damages but rejected his claim that the discrimination has also harmed his wife. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Pohlel</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that the agency's discrimination caused embarrassment, humiliation, anguish, great grief, feelings of guilt and depression, sleeplessness, periods of trembling, confusion, stressfulness, detrimental effects on his blood pressure, numbness, inability to think clearly, fixation on the harassment, and physical and mental exhaustion. He also maintains that his wife incurred emotional harm as well as a stroke due to the agency's discrimination. Complainant's wife submitted a statement averring that complainant changed from being happy, jovial, and compassionate to becoming sad, depressed, preoccupied, mentally exhausted, depleted, with physical ailments such as high blood pressure, numbness in the legs, feet, arms, and chest, and sleeplessness. She further averred that the harassment caused a strain in their marital relationship. Complainant submitted a statement from his physician who reported that complainant complained of emotional distress, inability to sleep, lack of the ability to concentrate and general anxiety and depression. The physician attributed these symptoms to the agency's discrimination and noted that complainant sought treatment for such symptoms up until he retired from the agency "in the summer of 2003." Complainant also submitted statements from two coworkers who stated that complainant became more withdrawn, less happy and spontaneous and that his enthusiasm and energy diminished.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note initially that complainant stated that his wife also suffered due to the agency's discriminatory action. However, the Commission cannot compensate complainant for his wife's harm allegedly caused by the agency's actions against complainant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Carpenter v.</span><span class="Italic"> </span> <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995). Regarding the harm claimed by complainant, several Commission decisions have addressed compensatory damages in cases similar to complainant's.<span class="Italic"> See Sellers v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01964003 (October 3, 2000) (awarding $13,000 to complainant who showed that she suffered additional physical and mental problems as a result of the agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation and forcing complainant to accept a reassignment to a downgraded position over removal); <span class="Italic">Hull v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951441 (Sept. 18, 1998) ($12,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on complainant's testimony of emotional distress due to retaliatory harassment); <span class="Italic">YueLee Wan v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC No. 01995204 (July 11, 2001) ($15,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages for emotional distress, depression, and inability to sleep); <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956675 (July 29, 1998) ($16,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages for stress, depression, and anxiety).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the above, we find that the evidence supports an award of $15,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $15,000 in damages was also deemed warranted in <span class="Italic">Watson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A50731 (2006), where the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment based on his religion in the wake of September 11:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the agency's contentions to the contrary, we find there is substantial evidence to support that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary compensatory damages. Although we take notice that complainant also suffered from factors unrelated to the agency's harassment, we find that complainant has sufficiently proven that he is due an award based on our review of similar cases. We also credit complainant's assertion that: (1) he suffered sleeplessness, depression, emotional distress and anxiety; (2) his fear of termination detrimentally impacted his mental state at both home, and at work; (3) he was forced to endure the humiliation that stemmed from his own Islamic beliefs; and (4) the approximately 25 to 30 warnings letters that he received after September 11, 2001, as a part of the harassment, resulted in a deterioration of his self-esteem and self worth. Complainant's affidavit provides a sufficient nexus between the discriminatory conduct and the emotional distress detailed in the record. Accordingly, we find that an award of $15,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages is proper because it is consistent with other awards that we have issued in similar situations, it is not monstrously excessive, and it is not the product of passion or prejudice. <span class="Italic">See Fraley v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A33418 (July 21, 2004) ($15,000 for anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and humiliation where other factors present); <span class="Italic">McGraw v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A20121 (November 27, 2002) ($15,000 for stress, depression, and sleeplessness with evidence of other contributing factors); <span class="Italic">Taber v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983780 (July 18, 2001) ($15,000 for disassociation from family and friends, and anxiety but other likely causes contributing). Therefore, we reverse the agency's decision on non-pecuniary damages and we award complainant $15,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Clements v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50052.txt">07A50052</a> (2006), the Commission upheld an award of $15,000 where the complainant's job duties were reduced because of her sex and, as a result, she sought counseling from the EAP program for five months, suffered from headaches, loss of hair and insomnia, and testified that her family relations were affected because she would become upset and angry from work pressures.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $75,000 by the administrative judge was reduced to $15,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070022 (2007), because the large damage award was based on speculation by the judge as to injury and not actual proof of the nature, duration and severity of the harm. The administrative judge assumed, without evidence, that the complainant's recovery from surgery had taken longer due to the emotional distress caused by the agency's discrimination. The judge further speculated that the complainant would have a loss of reputation because supervisors implicated in the findings of discrimination would likely make negative comments about the complainant during any future attempts at promotion or advancement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant was discriminatorily denied a hardship transfer after the death of his wife the Commission awarded $15,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Mask v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120080856 (2008), the Commission overturned the agency's decision that the complainant was not entitled to a damage award. The complainant, an air traffic controller, expressed reluctance to detail his emotional distress out of fear that the agency would use it against him. He did, however, execute an affidavit stating that he was greatly humiliated, felt less like a full person, and would remain suspicious of the agency's motives in <span id="Page_1846"></span>taking future personnel actions, as well as fearing reprisal. Though the decision is short on detail, it would appear that the Commission was influenced by the fact that the complainant had sought the transfer after his wife of 24 years died in order to "escape the painful reminders of his life with her and to be closer to his extended family." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $15,000 in damages by the administrative judge was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Philbert v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720090041 (2010), with the Commission explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ found that complainant suffered both emotional and physical distress as a result of the agency's actions. In support of this finding, the AJ noted that complainant suffered from sleeplessness, stress, headaches, and high blood pressure as a result of discrimination and his deteriorating relationship with S1. The AJ noted that complainant's sister came to stay with him for a month to help him cope with the emotional turmoil he faced at work and that complainant began treatment for high blood pressure in early 2007, some months before the incidents involving his medical records and delayed leave, the claims where the AJ found discrimination. However, the AJ considered that complainant continues to be treated for high blood pressure following removal of S1 as complainant's supervisor. Accordingly, we affirm the AJ's award of $15,000.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages. The Commission notes that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission found that the complainant did not submit sufficient evidence of any nexus between claimed past and future pecuniary damages, it did award $15,000 in nonpecuniary damages where the complainant testified she felt beleaguered and was overwhelmed by feelings of anxiety, humiliation, fear and distress. <span class="Italic">Minardi v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120082652 (2008). The complainant, her mother, sister, two former coworkers and a counselor corroborated the complainant's testimony including her testimony that the resulting distress had led to a deterioration and ultimate dissolution of her marriage.</p>
<p class="noindent">In increasing an award by the agency of $6,000 to $15,000 in <span class="Italic">Warch v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120102421 (2010), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant wrote that as a result of the discrimination, she felt she was walking on egg shells at work, and the stress was unbearable most of the time. She experienced situations at work that caused a great deal of anxiety, stress, and humiliation, lost self-esteem, and felt management was trying to get rid of her. She stated that she took some of her bad feelings out on her family, which caused family strain. Complainant's husband wrote that the discrimination at work made Complainant anxious, despondent, moody, depressed, and impacted every facet of her life. He wrote it eroded her self-worth and self-image.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is supporting documentation in the record. Complainant described an incident where, because she did not have a flexible schedule and wanted to follow instructions not to be late, she came to work but had to return home to clean up herself. Complainant's therapist, a social worker, in a February 2006 therapy note wrote that Complainant expressed that being placed on the performance improvement plan made her fear losing her job and home. Fear of losing her job also came up later. In a May 2006 report, Complainant's clinical neuropsychologist wrote that the Agency's failure to give her assistance and accommodations, and the openly negative attitude of some of her superiors and co-workers, and receiving nothing but negative feedback caused problems with increased depression and low self-esteem. He also wrote that Complainant was especially anxious about losing her job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that Complainant had medical conditions which pre-existed the found discrimination or were caused or aggravated by other factors. A May 2002 report by staff at the Rhode Island Hospital, Department of Psychology, indicated Complainant had insomnia throughout her adult life, a history of fibromyalgia, temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), myofacial pain, and migraine headaches, and reported signs of anxiety and depressed mood. Complainant reported problems related to her husband sustaining debilitating injuries at work in 1992 and being out of work, creating financial stress, problems with her daughter, and problems at work. She was diagnosed with insomnia, anxiety disorder, affective disorder, and spouse, stress associated with medical problems. A September 2002 psychological testing report by the same health care provider diagnosed Complainant with major depression, single. Complainant started getting treatment for emotional conditions by 2002. A review of medical documentation shows that some major issues that came up were problems with her adult daughter who had a history of major substance abuse and not helping in the home, her grandson being critically injured in February 2005, her home burning down in June 2005, resulting in her having to live in a mobile home with her spouse, grown daughter, two grandchildren, and three dogs, and being disorganized at home, causing marital strain, and stress with her health issues.</p>
<p class="noindent">In rejecting the complainant's argument that he was entitled to $40,000 in damages instead of the $15,000 awarded by the administrative judge, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120100682 (2011), stressed the importance of citing comparative case law in damage cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency does not contest that the harm Complainant endured was a direct result of the Agency's retaliatory actions. The record establishes that the harassing events took place over a period of five months. The AJ stated in her factual findings that Complainant was seen by his primary care physician because he was experiencing a rapid heart beat, elevated blood pressure, and dizziness. The physician referred Complainant to a psychiatrist for symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychiatrist diagnosed Complainant as having an adjustment disorder with mixed features, including anxiety and depression as well as occupational problems. Complainant was frustrated, depressed, lacked energy, and lacked motivation. The psychiatrist testified that Complainant told her that he felt harassed at work and he began to isolate himself, did not want to leave home, had insomnia, and was worried, anxious, and ruminated. The psychiatrist prescribed Complainant Wellbutrin and Prozac to treat the depression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserted on appeal that the AJ did not state that Complainant's request of $40,000 in non-pecuniary damages would be "monstrously excessive," and therefore $40,000 should be considered reasonable. We note that on appeal Complainant did not provide the Commission with any case precedent that would establish that $40,000 in non-pecuniary damages has been awarded to a complainant in a similar situation who suffered similar harm for a similar length of time. Instead, Complainant pointed out differences between the case precedent that the AJ cited to and the facts of Complainant's particular case. While no two cases will be factually identical, we find that the case precedent the AJ cited to was sufficiently consistent with Complainant's case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find the AJ's award of $15,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages was appropriate. This amount takes into consideration the severity of the harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Van Wolken v. Dep't of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30134 (May 11, 2004), request for reconsideration denied, EEOC Request No. 05A40960 (August 25, 2004) ($12,000 non-pecuniary damages was awarded to Complainant who was harassed and suffered stress, insomnia, headaches, panic attacks, and began seeing a therapist and taking medication): <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dep't of Commerce,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A13671 (May 2, 2002) ($15,000 non-pecuniary damages awarded to Complainant who experienced depression, stomach pains, nausea, headaches, dizziness, and problems with family relationships for approximately 9 months); <span class="Italic">Collington v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03359 (August 30, 2002) ($15,000 non-pecuniary damages awarded to Complainant where disability discrimination resulted in stress, anxiety, elevation of blood pressure and aggravation of asthma for a period of at least 6 months); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dep't of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01984574 (January 10, 2001) ($15,000 non-pecuniary damages awarded to Complainant where disability discrimination resulted in anger, frustration, isolation from family and friends, anxiousness, and resulted in physical manifestations). Accordingly, we conclude that an award of $15,000 will adequately compensate Complainant for the physical and emotional distress he suffered as a result of the Agency's discriminatory acts.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McFadden v. Attorney General</span>, 0720110034 (2012), the Commission upheld an award of $15,000 finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching the amount of non-pecuniary damages, the AJ determined Complainant's and her husband's testimony to be credible. We find no reason to disturb the AJ's credibility findings. Moreover, we have recently found a similar award to be reasonable and not "monstrously excessive." <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090006 (February 1, 2012) (complainant and her husband testified that complainant did not engage as much with the family, had trouble sleeping, was withdrawn and despondent). In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that Complainant had a number of pre-existing medical conditions that were also affecting her at the time. A fair reading of the evidence of record permits the AJ's determination that the Agency's retaliatory actions in this matter exacerbated those problems and contributed additional emotional harm to Complainant for which she is being compensated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed an award of $15,000 in compensatory damages by the agency in <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120100118 (2012), and, in doing so, demonstrated how it uses its previous cases in determining damage awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his statement, Complainant testified that in the days immediately following the retaliatory email, he felt humiliated, ashamed, and embarrassed, and was unable to sleep because he feared he would be removed from the Advisory Council, thanks to the impermissible concerns raised in the email amongst the council members. The affidavits of Complainant, his wife, and friends, state that Complainant suffered "unbearable" emotional pain and mental anguish (humiliation, embarrassment, feeling of worthlessness), and for all these years has <span id="Page_1847"></span>suffered loss of enjoyment of life (friends thought he was depressed, no more joy in walking home with wife, no more playing ball with grandchildren, no more attending art performances and exhibits; loss of sexual drive), and loss of health (fatigue and exhaustion resulted in him not paying attention to his health, sleeping only 2 to 3 hours each night).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant states that the harms have persisted all these years because he has seen "indicators" of how his supervisor can manipulate people and procedures to keep himself "in the loop," even when there is a clear conflict of interest. Complainant's Verified Statement, at 2. He remains very fearful of his supervisor: "I am so tormented that I am not sure when, where or how this will all end. I am worried of what else will happen to me and my family, what other discriminatory and devious ways I will be subjected to by the confirmed discriminator." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Compensatory damages are available to the extent necessary to compensate a victim, but only for an agency's intentional discrimination in the workplace. Under the facts of this case, the intentional discrimination comprised of one retaliatory email by Complainant's supervisor and the response by a member of the Advisory Council, which led to questions and uncertainty about Complainant's future participation in this council. We find that for the days immediately following those retaliatory acts, Complainant suffered acute emotional pain and mental anguish and slept little as he coped with the uncertainty surrounding his leadership status as co-chair of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find it unlikely that any emotional or physical harm attributable to the retaliatory email and Advisory Council's response was likely to extend beyond the date that Complainant learned he would remain as the co-chair of the Advisory Council. Complainant's appellate brief acknowledges that he has not suffered any subsequent discriminatory acts in the years since the retaliatory events at issue here. His emotional distress stems from a fear that his supervisor could discriminate against him again in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find little evidence to indicate that Complainant suffered additional attributable harms after learning that his place on the Advisory Council was secure. Although Complainant's wife stated that Complainant has been to "innumerable" doctor's visits due to his ongoing medical problems, the record contains no medical documentation or testimony from any of Complainant's physicians or psychiatrists, explaining what specific physical or mental conditions Complainant currently has, how long those ailments have persisted, and what factors may have caused those conditions. Complainant's wife states that Complainant "has started seeing a licensed psychiatrist," implying that he had not seen one for the many years after the discriminatory events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that the emotional and physical harm (intense feelings of embarrassment and humiliation and lack of sleep for several nights) actually attributable to the retaliatory email and Advisory Council persisted for only a short time, we determine that the Agency's award of $15,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This result is consistent with recent cases. In <span class="Italic">Minor v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120103711 (May 17, 2012), the complainant requested $250,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages for one act of retaliation by his supervisor. The complainant asserted in his affidavit that his supervisor's conduct was humiliating, threatening, abusive, stressful, demeaning, and caused him anxiety, emotional distress, and physical pain. He asserted that the action caused him mental anguish and loss of enjoyment of life.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Beyond his affidavit, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Minor</span> did not provide any other objective evidence to help support these claims. The Commission found an award of $1,500 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages to be appropriate. It determined that this award was consistent with previous retaliation cases in which the complainants either provided little evidence linking the alleged emotional distress to the discrimination or provided limited and non-descriptive testimony concerning emotional pain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the Commission increased an EEOC Administrative Judge's award of $12,000 in non-pecuniary damages to $75,000 in <span class="Italic">Regist v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120093445 (Feb. 4, 2010). There, the complainant's supervisor emailed a superior: "I also want you to understand that [the complainant] continues to file EEO complaints on harassment in the workplace." The complainant testified that his supervisor's treatment was humiliating and embarrassing. He could not sleep, saw a psychiatrist about a dozen times, and started taking blood pressure medication due to high blood pressure. The AJ awarded $12,000 in non-pecuniary damages for a year's worth of stress, inability to sleep, continual worry, and a deep sense of humiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission found that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Regist</span> was entitled to $75,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. In addition to the AJ's findings that the complainant was subjected to months of constant humiliation, felt unwanted and rejected, his blood pressure rose requiring medication, he had trouble sleeping, and he received psychiatric counseling, the Commission found that the supervisor enclosed the complainant in a small office space with no ventilation or windows for about two months, which made him claustrophobic. The supervisor further embarrassed the complainant when he was publicly ordered him to remove his chaplain's shirt and collar. The Commission also found the supervisor had damaged the complainant's professional reputation by reporting in an email that the complainant continued threatening reprisals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We determine that this case is more similar to <span class="Italic">Minor</span> than to <span class="Italic">Regist</span>, due to the lack of other objective evidence to show that Complainant suffered sustained and significant harm from a particular incident of retaliation. Unlike the complainant in <span class="Italic">Regist</span>, Complainant has not presented sufficient evidence that he suffered medical ailments as a direct result of the retaliatory act, that he saw a psychiatrist throughout this ordeal, or that he suffered permanent or long-lasting harm to his professional reputation among his peers, since it appears he remained co-chair of a prominent Advisory Council and subsequently went on a detail assignment elsewhere. Therefore, we find insufficient evidence in the record to warrant increasing the amount of non-pecuniary compensatory damages beyond the $15,000 awarded by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $15,000 was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Koudry v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0120103545 (2012). The Commission did reject an argument by the complainant that he was entitled to an increased damage award because his wife had to reduce her work hours to help with work around the house and with children that he had previously taken care of prior to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found an award of $15,00o was appropriate where a retaliatory reassignment resulted in the complainant having chest pains, indigestion, headaches, migraines, anxiety that caused her eyes to twitch and loss of energy. <span class="Italic">Fuentes v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120113519 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Schmid v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130923 (2013), the Commission increased an agency award of $5,000 to $15,000 where the complainant presented testimony from a "life-long" friend that the complainant frequently sounded depressed, "would stay in bed all day with the covers pulled over her head," became "antisocial," and the condition lasted for more than one year.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $10,000 to $15,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120112818 (2014), explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter, Complainant testified that after the altercation, she became fearful of encountering S2. She testified that she experienced nightmares and would awake in cold sweats. Complainant's mother also testified to her reaction to the altercation at issue. She stated that Complainant was jittery, had more frequent headaches since the altercation, and was "always watching her back." Complainant's sister also testified to Complainant's reaction to the altercation. Complainant's sister testified that Complainant was teary eyed, tired, and short tempered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ's award of $10,000.00 was insufficient and that Complainant is entitled to $15,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Thompson v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100682 (Oct 21, 2011) ($15,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages awarded where harassment resulted in depression, isolation, and anxiety); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01984574 (Jan. 10, 2001) ($15,000.00 non-pecuniary damages awarded to Complainant where discrimination resulted in anxiousness, sleeplessness, and isolation). We find that this amount is not monstrously excessive and takes into consideration the AJ's finding that while Complainant experienced anxiety, depression and insomnia as a result of the altercation at issue, a portion of Complainant's distress resulted from the alleged incidents that Complainant was not successful on and Complainant's removal which is not before the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">Taking into account the limited duration of the harassment, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120123393 (2015), the Commission upheld an award of $15,000 in damages rejecting the complainant's argument that she was entitled to a higher damage award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant argues that she is entitled to an increased award of damages primarily because of the extended duration of the harm to which she was subjected. In the Agency's analysis, the harassment occurred over the period from October 26, 2008 to November 4, 2008 during which, on one occasion, the harasser kissed Complainant and, on another occasion, the harasser hugged Complainant. In contrast, according to Complainant, the consequences of the harassing behavior extended over a period of more than three years during which the harasser, although no longer working closely with Complainant, was permitted to continue to work in the Atlanta P&#x0026;DC, causing Complainant to encounter him periodically when she was on duty. According to Complainant, these encounters exacerbated the damage caused by the original harassing incidents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The authorities upon which Complainant relies do not support the conclusion that an increased award of damages is called for in this case. Most of the cited authorities involved harassment that extended over many months or years and involved multiple incidents of harassing behavior. For example, in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082790 (September 29, 2008), cited by Complainant, <span id="Page_1848"></span>the sexually harassing behavior began in 1998 and continued until 2004. The Commission found that the resulting emotional harm called for an award of non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $65,000.00. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Hibbert v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070036 (October 25, 2007), involved a pattern of racial harassment extending over a 5-year period which, the Commission found, supported an award of $60,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages. In neither case did the Commission augment the award, as Complainant urges here, because the complainant was continually reminded of the harassment by the presence of the harasser in the workplace. For that reason, the authorities relied on by Complainant are inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's determination that an award of $15,000.00 under these circumstances fully compensates Complainant is consistent with the Commission authorities cited by the Agency. Therefore, the amount of the award of non-pecuniary damages will not be modified.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $15,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120130566 (2015), based on her testimony that she suffered "extreme stress" when her supervisor disciplined her for visiting an elder after work hours. The Commission noted that the complainant did not submit any evidence for her physician in support of her claim.</p>
