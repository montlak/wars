<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-138"><span class="space">F.</span> DISABILITY-BASED HARASSMENT</h3>
<p class="noindent">As with all other bases of discrimination, harassment also finds its way into the field of disability discrimination. If an agency "knows or should have known of incidents of harassment that are more than sporadic, it has a responsibility to take reasonable, affirmative steps to eliminate such incidents." <span class="Italic">In re USPS</span>, <span id="Page_951"></span>05860199 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Murphy Motor Freight Lines</span>, 488 F. Supp. 381, 22 FEP 892 (D. Minn. 1980)). Since a requirement of establishing harassment is that more than a few isolated incidents must have occurred, it is proper for the administrative judge to consider specific past acts outside of the filing period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Cariddi v. Kansas City Chief Football Club, Inc.</span>, 568 F.2d 87 (8th Cir. 1977)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic analysis for hostile environment cases based on disability is set forth in <span class="Italic">Fetters v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120131553 (2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that harassment based on an individual's disability is actionable. <span class="Italic">See Meritor Savings Bank FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986). In order to establish a claim of harassment under those bases, the complainant must show that: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability covered under the Rehabilitation Act; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome conduct; (3) the harassment complained of was based on his disability; (4) the harassment had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with his work performance and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) there is a basis for imputing liability to the employer. <span class="Italic">See Flowers v. Southern Reg'l Physician Serv. Inc</span>., 247 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">see also Fox v. General Motors Corp</span>., 247 F.3d 169 (4th Cir. 2001). The harasser's conduct should be evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 8, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">Harassment can in fact rise to the level where it actually creates a disabling condition. For example, in <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01892549 (1989), the complainant alleged that coworkers were harassing her as a result of her previous EEO complaint and that the harassment led to her psychiatric treatment for stress and her ultimate retirement. The Commission found the allegation to be within the EEO purview and remanded the complaint noting that, if successful, the complainant might be entitled to reinstatement or an adjustment of her retirement benefits. It should be noted that the basis of the harassment in <span class="Italic">Dodd</span> was reprisal; the disability was the result of, rather than the basis for, the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Bafus v. Postmaster General</span>, 01911492 (1991), the Commission found it did not have jurisdiction over a complaint that the employee had developed a mental condition as the result of intense harassment over his perceived sexual orientation. Although not "unsympathetic to appellant's plight," the Commission noted the complainant made no allegations that he was discriminated against on the basis of a disabling condition. Rather, he contended the condition was a result of harassment. The Commission also found it had no jurisdiction over the harassment allegations since Title VII does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The difference between <span class="Italic">Bafus</span> and <span class="Italic">Dodd</span> is that reprisal is a legitimate basis for a claim of harassment, while sexual orientation at least at the time <span class="Italic">Bafus</span> was decided, was not. <span class="Italic">Bafus</span> would likely have a different outcome today as the Commission currently views claims alleging sexual orientation discrimination as also raising claims of sex discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120133080.txt">0120133080</a> (2015), discussed above.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gamboa v. Postmaster General</span>, 05890633 (1989), the Commission held that derogatory statements, standing alone, cause sufficient injury to a person with a disability for the purposes of a complaint under the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also alleges that hurt feelings or a damaged reputation are not sufficient to involve the EEO complaint process. It contends that the EEO system would be severely impaired if the system accepted allegations such as that in the instant complaint. The agency's argument reflects an inadequate understanding of laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of handicap. The goal of such statutes is to ensure that handicapped individuals are not unfairly prevented from entering into the mainstream of society. Derogatory remarks that cause injury clearly cannot be tolerated if handicapped individuals are to be afforded equal opportunity in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Arnold C. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120171001 (2017), the Commission found that the following statements made to the hearing-impaired complainant stated a claim of harassment based on disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that a fair reading of the pre-complaint documentation reflects that Complainant has, in essence raised a claim of harassment. We note, for example, that the record contains the following account from Complainant regarding insults from Agency supervisors:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">This&#x2003;not the first time</span> that someone in the Command has made comments towards me and my Service-Connected issue. On July 10, 2012, my Supervisor at the time made a remark that I needed to wear a shirt that said I was deaf on it. She also made a statement that I needed to get my ears fixed. She made this Statement in the company of my coworker (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Though the above matter relates to an exchange with another supervisor, we considered all of the alleged harassment together and in the light most favorable to Complainant. According to Complainant, he reported the 2012 incident and human resources had "handled it." But later, in late 2016, upon Complainant's return from pre-approved sick leave to receive medical care for his service-connected disability, his then-acting supervisor (S2) issued Complainant a hard copy of Agency leave policy. Thereafter, S2 commented "Can you hear now?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record shows that Complainant has provided sufficient articulation of his claim to state a cognizable claim that the Agency created a hostile work environment on the basis of disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has an increased sensitivity to harassment based on a disability, particularly where that harassment takes place in front of coworkers. "[T]his Commission has held that supervisory actions taken in front of co-workers that publicly demean a complainant's disabling condition can rise to the level of unlawful harassment." <span class="Italic">Morales v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A15133 (2002) (allegation that a supervisor repeatedly checked the breath of complainant, a former alcoholic, in front of coworkers). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hillion v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A13573 (2002) (holding that three incidents within a week where the complainant alleged he was publicly demeaned because of his hearing impairment stated a claim of hostile environment harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Expression of hostility over a disabled employee's reasonable accommodations, if sufficiently severe or pervasive, can constitute unlawful harassment. In <span class="Italic">Horkan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976837 (2000), the Commission noted the pattern of verbal abuse over an extended period of time relating to the complainant's reasonable accommodations, disability, and gender:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence shows that complainant was continuously subjected to demeaning and mean-spirited comments from a number of her male coworkers over a significant period of time which either expressed resentment towards the accommodations complainant was receiving because of her disability or were negative towards women in general. In addition, the evidence also establishes that the Supervisor participated in the harassment, either tacitly by failing to address the coworkers' comments despite complainant's complaints, or explicitly by engaging in verbal harassment himself, including expressing a desire that complainant be killed in an automobile accident and making a physically threatening comment. There is also evidence that the Supervisor encouraged the harassment of complainant by her coworkers by sharing with them confidential information about complainant's disability, financial situation, and her efforts to complain about their harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record further supports a finding that agency management officials were aware of the conduct in question, as the agency acknowledges that complainant had reported being harassed by her coworkers at least as early as October 1993. Moreover, contrary to the agency's assertions, it failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action as soon as it learned of the harassing conduct. While management testified that employees were spoken to individually and as a group about their inappropriate conduct, we find that given the evidence regarding the frequency and continuing nature of the harassment, it is clear that these actions were not effective in causing an end to the discriminatory harassment. The Commission notes, for example, that even after the agency finally commenced an investigation in early January 1994 into complainant's allegations, the Supervisor made threatening remarks about complainant. The record further establishes that the agency's investigation took months to complete and resulted in complainant's removal from her usual work site for an approximately eight week period. The Commission notes that while the Supervisor was disciplined as a result of his misconduct in this matter, his demotion to a nonsupervisory position lasted less than two months, after which he became a supervisor again. Furthermore, there was no evidence of a strong anti-harassment policy that was uniformly enforced throughout the facility, and there appeared to be no clearly defined and effective complaint process for employees with allegations of harassment. Even if those had existed, the evidence shows that management had a history of ignoring a clear pattern of misconduct by these same employees and Supervisor. There is also evidence of breaches in the confidentiality of the complaint system, as well as retaliation, as both the Supervisor and other employees made harassing comments to and about complainant concerning her complaints about the discriminatory atmosphere at the facility. In light of all these factors, the Commission finds that complainant has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was subjected to discriminatory harassment because of her sex and disability.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Ayesha W. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019001899 (2019) (finding no disability related harassment when, on four occasions, supervisors attempted to persuade the complainant to maintain better control over her poorly behaved service dog).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found a hostile work environment was created for injured-on-duty employees (IODs) in <span class="Italic">Velva B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720160006 (2017), where the agency initiated a program that audited the job duties of IOD's. According to the agency, the purpose of the program was to ensure that those duties were in furtherance of the agency's ultimate mission of delivering the mail. The implementation and administration of the program took more than five years and, over the course of those years, resulted in thousands of IODs either being presented with modified job descriptions or placed on leave without pay. As IODs and other employees came to understand the possible <span id="Page_952"></span>fates of IODs job, IODs reported fear and anxiety over the uncertainty of the future of their jobs and enduring hostile comments from coworkers and management. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Velva B</span>. found that the program was used by officials to intentionally target IODs and discriminate against disabled employees and that the demoralizing effect of the program on the IODs rose to the level of severe or pervasive:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harassment of employees that would not occur but for their disability is unlawful if severe or pervasive. <span class="Italic">Wibstad v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01972699 (Aug. 14, 1998). To prevail on a claim of class-wide harassment, the Class Agent must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that because of their status as individuals with disabilities, class members were subjected to conduct so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person in their position would have considered it hostile or abusive. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 22 (1993). That conduct should be evaluated from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victims' circumstances. Enforcement Guidance on <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (March 8, 1994). Only if the Class Agent satisfies her burden of proof with respect to both of these elements, motive and hostility, will the question of Agency liability for discriminatory harassment present itself. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132783 (Sept. 11, 2015). <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., Dayle H. v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120130097 (June 15, 2016), <span class="Italic">citing Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The existence of the first element, motive, has been proven. The NRP, the reason behind the actions taken by the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, the DATs, and other officials, has been shown to be discriminatory in that it targeted IOD employees, many of whom are qualified individuals with disabilities. Accordingly, any action taken by Agency officials in support of or furtherance of the NRP between May 5, 2006, and July 1, 2011, will be regarded as being motivated by unlawful considerations of the class members' disabilities. The only remaining question for liability is whether that conduct is severe or pervasive enough to be considered unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It bears repeating that, in general, neither single isolated acts nor sporadic incidents are enough to prove a pattern or practice of discrimination. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC, supra, citing Teamsters, supra. See also, e.g., Complainant v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120140786 (June 20, 2014) (supervisor's single, isolated suggestion that complainant apply for a greeter position at Walmart not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute harassment); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081659 (Sept. 3, 2009) and <span class="Italic">Gregory v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A43820 (Sept. 10, 2004. The Agency contends on appeal that the conduct complained of consisted only of the "Walmart" comments and similar comments by the Postmaster General, the HHR Manager, and the WCO Director, which were made to each other in emails and were not even directed toward the IOD employees. But it was not just those comments that fueled the fire.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Throughout the Agency there was a pervasive fear among IOD employees that being subjected to the NRP would cause them to lose their jobs with the Agency and have to work in less-desirable jobs for employers such as Walmart or McDonald's, a fear that was stoked not only by managers but by other employees. The WCO Director acknowledged that he encountered anxiety among IOD employees again and again relayed by the unions and at employee town hall meetings. Rumors were being spread and derogatory comments were being made, sometimes by managers and supervisors, and sometimes by other employees. When the HHR Manager was asked in his deposition where employees' concern about ending up at Walmart came from he replied, "from all over the place." He admitted that he went to "so many meetings," and that he heard those rumors "from the unions and at town halls." When the pilot program for what would become the NRP was rolled out in February 2005, comments from non-IOD employees that were incorporated into a power-point presentation included, "way past due," "look for some miracle recoveries," "see you bums at Walmart," "it's about time," "have people sitting around the office doing minor jobs; makes you want to puke," "get rid of them all," "dead weight," and "good riddance." The Postmaster General at the time admitted that he talked with the HHR Manager and the Senior Vice President for Human Resources about working with outside employers to find jobs for people whose jobs had changed to the point where they could no longer sit to do their work. In a discussion that took place in September of 2010 concerning an upcoming meeting with a delegation from the China Post organization, the Manager of Complement Staffing and Field Policy made a joke about China Post taking some of their NRP employees. An anecdotal witness from Radford, Virginia testified that the Postmaster called him into her office and told him that they were going to transfer him to a "public sector" job, and when he asked whether she meant that he could be working at Walmart, the Postmaster replied, "[I]t could mean that." An anecdotal witness from Lansing, Michigan testified that he heard comments about injured-on-duty employees such as "sick laymen," "lazies," and "fakers." An anecdotal witness from Santa Clarita, California testified in her deposition that an NRP representative who was "very derogatory" in his tone and demeanor said that there were "going to be a lot of sorry 'rehabs' working at Walmart soon." Record at 16578-79.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Just as a single comment in <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060086 (Oct. 31, 2008), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520090179 (Feb. 5, 2009), that Tour Supervisor Brown should quit the agency and become a greeter at K-Mart, gave rise to a hostile environment by aggravating Ms. Brown's pre-existing PTSD, so too did conduct of the officials carrying out the NRP give rise to a hostile environment by stoking the fear and anxiety that existed among IOD employees that they would lose their jobs. In both <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and the instant case, the conduct by Agency management aggravated the environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NRP teams' pursuit of their objectives during both phases of the program had a palpably demoralizing effect that was felt in every district. During Phase 1, NRP assessors were pressuring employees to provide their medical information. Employees were warned, in accordance with scripts provided to the assessors by the headquarters NRP team, that if they did not provide the requested information within two weeks, their limited-duty or rehabilitation assignments might be withdrawn. Several witnesses testified that they were constantly being pressured by NRP clerks to get updates from their doctors, even after they provided the requested information. Record at 16181-16184, 16305-16307, 16313. Others testified that they felt harassed because of the entire NRP process. Record, pp. 12321-12322. The WCO Director appeared to "go ballistic" when one district reported no retirements or resignations. Record at 13826. And the "Cripple Creek" incident only exacerbated the situation. Record at 13579, 12888-12890.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Perhaps the most glaring examples of hostility were the dismissals of IOD employees who, like the Class Agent, were given NWA determinations and ordered to leave. Step 14 of Phase 2 explicitly required that, upon completion of the second no-work-available interview, employees would be given the opportunity to clear out their lockers and gather their personal belongings. Afterward, they would be asked to turn their identification badges and would be immediately escorted out of the building. Record at 12992, 13064, 13766. The Class Agent described how emotionally traumatized she was by the incident. Record at 15353-15355. The Class Agent's union representative testified that he watched 20 other IOD employees being escorted out in a similar fashion, and with similar reactions. He noted that the escorts would walk the employees right through the middle of the workroom floor. Record at 15382. Other witnesses reported the same experience, with one testifying that he felt "ambushed." Another stated that she felt that she was being treated like a criminal. Record at 15604-15605, 15679-15680, 15694, 15810-15813, 16041, 16582. Eventually, the EEO Office heard of the practice and expressed concerns about it to the HHR Manager and the WCO Director. Record at 13842-13845.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, it was all of the actions taken by Agency officials to execute the NRP, and not just the Walmart comments, that gave rise to the hostile work environment. The only remaining question on this issue is the extent to which the Agency is liable. The Commission's policy guidance on vicarious liability for harassment states that an employer is always liable for harassment by a supervisor which culminates in a tangible employment action. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). A "tangible employment action" is characterized by the fact that it requires an official act; it usually inflicts direct economic harm; and it is usually initiated by a supervisor or other individual acting with the Agency's authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Removals stemming from NWA determinations would fall within the definition of tangible employment actions. New modified assignments might be considered tangible employment action if they cause harm to the individual or otherwise leave the individual less well-off than he or she was in the previous assignment. For those employees who separated voluntarily, either through retirements or resignation, they would have to prove that they were constructively discharged in order for their retirement or resignation to be considered a tangible employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IOD employees who returned to full duty as a result of the NRP and those whose positions did not change after being audited by the NRP were nevertheless subjected to the hostile work environment and are entitled to claim relief, unless the Agency can show that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment and that the employee failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer to avoid harm otherwise. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Liability</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. As we stated previously, the acts of harassment committed by Agency officials in carrying out the mandate of the NRP to reduce the IOD rolls were numerous and pervasive. Towards the end of the program, the Agency did modify its Phase 2 procedures to explicitly allow for referrals to a DRAC, but only did so after being reminded of its Rehabilitation Act obligations by the EEO Office. By then, most of the damage already had been done. Until those changes were made, IOD employees who received an adverse assessment under the NRP had no recourse. Consequently, the Agency <span id="Page_953"></span>cannot invoke the affirmative defense against the Class Agent's hostile environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, while operating under the auspices of the NRP, the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other Agency officials who supported and assisted in implementing that program violated Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates by reference Section 102(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by subjecting IOD employees assessed under the NRP to a hostile work environment and by subjecting to tangible employment actions IOD employees given NWA determinations, IOD employees given new modified assignments, and possibly IOD employees who voluntarily separated via resignation or retirement. We conclude that the Agency has not raised any genuine issue of material fact that would warrant a hearing on this issue. To be eligible for relief at the remedies stage of this proceeding, class members must establish that they are qualified individuals with disabilities. They must also establish that they suffered compensable harm for which damages may be awarded. Those class members who were subjected to tangible employment actions may be eligible for equitable remedies such as reinstatement and back pay. The Class Agent is eligible for immediate relief, having established that she is a qualified individual with a disability and that she was subjected to a tangible employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent">The class in <span class="Italic">Velva B</span>. further alleged that IOD employees were segregated from the rest of the workforce when they were forced to report to "standby rooms," which also created a hostile work environment, but the Commission found that the use of "standby rooms" was not sanctioned or called for by the leadership of the program.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Skrypka v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953246 (1996), the Commission found the complainant stated a hostile environment claim where the agency spelled his name wrong on an overtime list and his coworkers made fun of it; his supervisor harassed him by inquiring if his hearing-aid was on; and the complainant was made to say "please" before his supervisor would sign a request for work tools.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120121002 (2014), the Commission found a hostile environment based on disability where the complainant was denied reasonable accommodation and, as a result, his clinical privileges were renewed for a shorter period of time than was customary and he was given additional duties outside of his medical restrictions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his affidavit, Person B acknowledged that the normal renewal period for clinical privileges was for two years and that Complainant's privileges were renewed for a three-month period. He stated that the Professional Standards Board reviews all applications for renewing privileges. Person B noted that one area that was examined during the renewal process was whether the physician had any medical issues that would prevent them from performing their duty. He stated that the fitness for duty examination had already been requested so there was pending information on whether Complainant could perform the job. Person B noted that thus, Complainant's medical privileges were not denied but were renewed for a shorter period of three months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find the Agency improperly determined that Complainant failed to show that she was subjected to discrimination with regard to issues (4) and (5). As the Agency noted in its final decision, Complainant's supervisors increased Complainant's workload to add additional patient examinations and/or signoffs, which contradicted Complainant's restrictions. The Agency has already found Complainant was disabled and denied a reasonable accommodation in this matter. We find that both the fitness for duty examination and the renewal of clinical privileges for three months as opposed to the usual two-year period stemmed from the discriminatory denial of reasonable accommodation and the assignment of these additional duties which violated Complainant's medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Agency claimed that the Letter of Counseling was never issued. However, we note that Complainant provided a signed copy of the April 19, 2010 Letter of Counseling. Thus, we find the Agency failed to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Upon review, we find Complainant has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was subjected to unlawful retaliation regarding the issuance of the Letter of Counseling. On appeal, the Agency does not refute Complainant's evidence that the Letter of Counseling was ultimately issued. Even if it had not been issued, we would find that the threat of the disciplinary action constituted retaliation because of the almost immediate timing between the threat and the directly linked protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that Complainant established that she was subjected to discrimination based on her disability as a result of the Agency's actions in threatening her with disciplinary action on April 19, 2010, for not working in contravention of her restrictions, and ultimately issuing her a Letter of Counseling for not completing those assignments in contravention of her restrictions. Specifically, we find that the threat of disciplinary action and the ultimate issuance of the Letter of Counseling stemmed from the discriminatory denial of reasonable accommodation and the assignment of these additional duties which violated Complainant's medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find Complainant failed to show that the Agency's actions constituted harassment based on reprisal for her protected activity, because only the Letter of Counseling issue was motivated by retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's actions constituted a hostile work environment based on disability discrimination. The denial of a reasonable accommodation plus the continual effects from that denial which included the Letter of Counseling, the fitness for duty examination, and the reduction in clinical renewal privileges renewal period, when considered together, created a hostile work environment based on disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120121339 (2015), the Commission found a hostile environment where requests for accommodation were met with placement on performance improvement plans, and the complainant was threatened with removal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that management's actions towards Complainant were based on her requests and need for accommodation. As noted above, Complainant asked for reassignment to the Administrative Building believing the assignment would best accommodate her disability. Instead, Complainant was assigned to the lobby of the ICRC, which she believed did not accommodate her. Thereafter, management accused Complainant of engaging in disruptive behavior, including openly expressing dissatisfaction with its attempt to accommodate her and dragging other employees into her legal matters. According to Complainant, the Agency had provided her with accommodations as a Security Specialist, requiring only that she perform three functions of her position due to her physical limitations. However, also according to Complainant, after being issued a PIP, management withdrew her existing accommodations, and she therefore was required to perform all the functions of her Security Specialist position. Complainant stated that the withdrawal of her accommodations after being issued the PIP presented physical challenges for her due to her disabilities. Therefore, we find that Complainant has established the first three prongs of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of a hostile work environment based on reprisal for requesting and needing accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning now to the fourth prong, we note that whether or not an objectively hostile or abusive work environment exists is based on whether a reasonable person in a complainant's circumstances would have found the alleged behavior to be hostile or abusive. The incidents must have been "sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the conditions of a complainant's employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 17, 21; <span class="Italic">see also Oncale</span>, 523 U.S. 75 (1998). To ascertain this, we look at the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; whether it was hostile or patently offensive; whether the alleged harasser was a co-worker or a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 17, 23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that management's conduct was sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the conditions of Complainant's employment and create an abusive working environment. While needing accommodations for her disability, management gave Complainant an Unacceptable rating and placed her on a PIP, without addressing her need for accommodation. When that rating and PIP were overturned, management gave Complainant another Unacceptable rating and placed her on another PIP, gain without addressing her need for accommodation, stating that she would be terminated. However, after Complainant was given a trial assignment to DocLab, management terminated her even though it was clear that she had an unaddressed need for accommodation and was not given a fair chance to succeed. As such, we find that a reasonable person would find that the cumulative effect of management's actions created a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant alleging a hostile environment based on disability must, as a complainant alleging a hostile environment on any other basis, demonstrate that the conduct is unwelcome. Where a complainant engages in "horseplay" of the same nature as coworkers, a claim for hostile environment harassment will not lie. In <span class="Italic">Wittren v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073308 (2007), the Commission found no reason to overturn the decision of its administrative judge that the complainant failed to establish a hostile environment because he had engaged in "mutual horseplay" with coworkers. The complainant, who had suffered disfigurement and brain damage as the result of an automobile accident, testified that coworkers "taunted him by calling him 'Soche Boy' and 'cripple,' and grabb[ing] his earlobe and twist[ing] it." However, the administrative judge credited the testimony of coworkers that the complainant "passed gas" in a coworker's face, intentionally tripped several coworkers, and verbally taunted coworkers with "names such as 'Herpes Man' and 'Homo.'"</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DeMeuse v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950324 (1997), the Commission held that a single incident of frisking an employee with a mental disability, for no apparent reason, was "uniquely humiliating" and created a hostile environment. The Commission explained its finding in <span class="Italic">DeMeuse</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_954"></span>[T]he Commission finds that appellant established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was frisked by the Supervisor. In this regard, the Commission notes that while the coworker's affidavit and appellant are clear on this point, the Supervisor's affidavit, the ROI and the FAD are noticeably silent. The only reference in the record refuting appellant's claim is contained in an OWCP document which merely notes that the Supervisor provided a statement to the effect that "he [the Supervisor] patted [appellant] on the middle part of his back and on his shoulder just to the right of his shoulder blade [and] did not pull back [appellant's] shirt and was not searching for concealed weapons. This 'statement' may not have been under oath and, in any event, is not addressed in the ROI or the FAD. Accordingly, the Commission finds that appellant's version of this incident is more credible. There is no evidence in the record that a change in appellant's behavior warranted frisking him. The Commission further finds that appellant has shown a nexus between the Supervisor's actions and his disability as there is no indication that any other veterans were frisked. The Commission finds that the act of frisking an individual with a mental disability for no apparent reason other than some other individual had committed criminal acts in another state is uniquely humiliating. Accordingly, the Commission finds that this incident, standing alone, was sufficiently severe as to constitute harassment or a hostile environment based on mental disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Charette v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A23276 (2002), the Commission found the complainant stated a claim of hostile environment harassment where she alleged that when she left her wheelchair unattended, it was placed in the back of a Postal Service jeep and a supervisor subsequently smirked about the incident and failed to investigate it. In <span class="Italic">Hentz v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965507 (1997), the Commission found that one extended exchange between the complainant and his supervisor stated a claim of harassment based on disability (back injury). The sequence of events in <span class="Italic">Hentz</span> was as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to appellant, he was subjected to verbal harassment and humiliation on the work floor, in the presence of coworkers. Appellant stated that on March 23, 1995, he went to work even though he had a cold. Appellant stated that he was "casing" letters when he noticed that Person A, the Manager of Postal Operations, was staring at him. According to appellant, Person A stated, "Is that the way you throw mail? You're lucky to have a job. Take your hand out of your pocket." Appellant stated that Person A then inquired whether appellant was wearing prescription sunglasses, and appellant said that he was. According to appellant, Person A stated, "Maybe it's because your case light is off," upon which Person A walked over to appellant's work area and pulled the light chain. Appellant stated that he informed Person A that his eyes were light-sensitive because of medication he was taking, and so appellant shut off the light again. According to appellant, Person A said, "No, no. Do you have any medical documentation?" Appellant stated that he further explained that the medication also caused him to have blurred vision, and that he had to cope with these side effects of the medication, but Person A insisted on medical documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant stated that Person A then asked, "Who gave you permission to drink coffee at your case? Who told you that you could drink at your case. Put that thermos away and lock it in your locker. You have a ten-minute break to drink your coffee." Appellant stated that he told Person A that he had a cold and was drinking orange juice and needed it for his throat because his medication also made his mouth dry, but nothing he said mattered to Person A. According to appellant, he then asked Person A, "But it's okay if managers drink coffee and eat donuts or bagels in front of us?," and Person A responded, "That's none of your business." Appellant stated that Person A then turned to another supervisor, Person B, and said, "Why is this man not wearing postal shoes?" after which Person A left appellant's work area. Appellant stated that he was then approached by Person B, who told appellant to put his thermos in his locker. Appellant stated that he explained to Person B that he needed the orange juice to keep his throat wet, but Person B insisted that appellant put the thermos away.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, as with other bases of discrimination, in most cases a single incident will not sufficiently aggrieve a complainant to rise to the level of a hostile environment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60876 (2006), the Commission found that a single incident where the complainant's supervisor allegedly signed "your fired" did not rise to the level of stating a claim for relief on the basis of disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic hostile environment analysis has been applied to allegations of harassment based on a disability. In <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01943469 (1996), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to appellant's allegations of harassment based on his disabilities, the Commission notes that acts of harassment directed at an employee because of a physical or mental disability, if sufficiently severe or pervasive, violate the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Pamela Olsen v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930413 (June 16, 1994). Thus, a complainant must show membership in a protected group, such as being a person with a disability, and severe or pervasive harassing conduct that would not have occurred except for membership in the protected class. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The severity of the alleged harassment must be determined from a totality of the evidence. One of the critical components in this type of claim, then, is the environment. Evidence of general work atmosphere, as well as incidents of specific hostility directed toward a complainant, is an important factor in analyzing such a claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer is liable for harassment in a case such as this one when it knew or should have known about the harassing conduct, but failed to take the appropriate preventative or corrective action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In order to avoid liability, the remedial action taken by the agency must be prompt and reasonably calculated to end the harassment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We also note that the Commission has previously held that what is appropriate remedial conduct will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case, the severity and persistence of the harassment, and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps. <span class="Italic">See generally Taylor v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, the Commission found the complainant, an alcoholic, demonstrated a hostile environment where, among other things, his coworkers had placed small plastic alcohol bottles and a cartoon about alcoholics on his desk. However, the Commission also found that the agency was not liable for the hostile environment because it had taken prompt and effective corrective action after being told of the incidents.</p>
<p class="noindent">The courts have also held that the theory of hostile environment harassment applies to disability discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Flowers v. Southern Regional Physicians Services, Inc.</span>, 247 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2001), the court applied the theory to a claim that an employee was harassed after her supervisor discovered she was HIV-positive. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Fox v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 247 F.3d 169 (4th Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as with complaints of disparate treatment, it is possible to combine an allegation of harassment based on a disability with a Title VII basis. In <span class="Italic">Olson v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 05930413 (1994), the Commission gave a detailed explanation of the proper analysis to apply to claims of harassment that are not premised on sexual conduct, but are premised on other bases prohibited by Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, or the ADEA. In <span class="Italic">Olson</span>, the Commission reversed an earlier OFO decision and issued a finding of discrimination based on sex, as in gender, and disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sex-based harassment, that is, conduct directed at an employee because of gender, yet not of a sexual or prurient nature, may give rise to liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The harassing conduct--aggression, intimidation, or hostility of a physical or verbal nature--violates Title VII where it is sufficiently severe or pervasive and is gender-based, occurring merely because of an employee's gender. <span class="Italic">See Andrews v. City of Philadelphia</span>, 895 F.2d 1469 (3d Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Levendos v. Stern Entertainment</span>, 909 F.2d 747 (3d. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Gus Construction Co.</span>, 842 F.2d 1010 (8th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co.</span>, 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">McKinney v.

<p class="noindent-1">Harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive when it unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The same is true for harassing conduct that is based on disability; that is, acts of harassment directed at an employee because of a physical or mental disability, if sufficiently severe or pervasive, violate the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, a complainant must show membership in a protected group, such as gender or disability, and severe or pervasive harassing conduct that would not have occurred except for membership in the protected class. <span class="Italic">See Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1482-83; <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, 842 F.2d at 1013-15; <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 833 F.2d at 1482-83; <span class="Italic">McKinney v.

The severity of the alleged harassment must be determined from a totality of the evidence. One of the critical components in this type of claim, then, is the environment. Evidence of general work atmosphere, as well as incidents of specific hostility directed toward a complainant, is an important factor in analyzing such a claim. <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, 842 F.2d at 1013-15; <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 842 F.2d at 1415; <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902888, at 11. As the Third Circuit noted, pervasive use of derogatory and insulting terms aimed at a protected group may serve as evidence of a hostile environment. <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1485.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer is liable for such harassment in a case such as this one when it knew or should have known about the harassing conduct, but failed to take the appropriate preventative or corrective action. <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, 842 F.2d at 1013; <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194, at 6-7. In order to avoid liability, the remedial action taken by the agency must be prompt and reasonably calculated to end the harassment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> And, as we have previously observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_955"></span>What is appropriate remedial conduct will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case--the severity and persistence of the harassment, and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194, at 6-7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the totality of the evidence, then, we conclude that appellant has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was subject to sex and disability-based harassment, as a result of the conduct of Supervisor I, and that Supervisor II knew of the harassment and clearly failed to take the appropriate remedial steps. Appellant has shown each of the requisite elements of her claim of harassment here. On the initial element, there is no perceptible dispute that appellant is a member of two protected groups, by virtue of her female gender and her visual disability. Next, the conduct exhibited by Supervisor I was first, severe, and second, pervasive in the following ways.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin with, on the issue of severity, the harassment in this case involved physical, as well as verbal, conduct. The abuse that Supervisor I directed at appellant included the violent, hostile touching on March 23, 1989 during which Supervisor I yelled negative remarks at her in an open work area. The Commission finds this harassing conduct to be severe, based on standards of reasonable conduct in the workplace and on appellant's credible statements that she was hurt both emotionally and physically by this assault. There were other acts of physical aggression as well. Appellant stated under oath that on numerous occasions, Supervisor I caused her body to be unexpectedly jerked back and forth when he surreptitiously approached her from the rear, and violently shook her chair. Moreover, we conclude that the physical assaults in this case were more severe by virtue of the fact that appellant's vision diminished her ability to use self-protective measures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There were additional incidents which increase the pervasiveness of the harassment in this case. We find that Supervisor I made rude, demeaning, profane, and threatening comments to appellant with regularity during the time in question, including, for example, "You're bullshitting me," "You're blowing smoke up my butt," "I'm going to write you up" and "So you're telling me that you can't do it." The preponderance of the evidence also suggests that Supervisor I did give appellant an unreasonable deadline on the special project she performed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission also concludes that Supervisor I's conduct was clearly unwelcome and that Supervisor I acted as he did because appellant was a disabled female. It is here especially that we deviate from the previous decision and its suggestion that "[t]he record contains a total of seventeen statements by present and former employees of the agency" and that "[t]hese individuals reported uniformly that [Supervisor I] exhibited a pattern of intimidating and abusive behavior toward his employees, both male and female, both disabled and nondisabled." <span class="Italic">See Pamela Olson v. Jack Kemp, Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922417 at 4 (December 9, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statements by witnesses do not reveal uniformly that Supervisor I's abuse toward his employees was accomplished without regard to gender and disability. In fact, several witnesses provided sworn statements by affidavit supporting appellant's contention that Supervisor I treated females employees worse than he did male employees. Employee C stated that Supervisor I was generally intimidating at work, but that his intimidation tactics were "more focused at women than at men." Employee D suggested that Supervisor I created an "oppressive" work environment, particularly for women. Employee H declared that Supervisor I tended to abuse employees he, Supervisor I, perceived to be weak, more often women than men.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employee G furthermore averred in her affidavit that based on her observations, Supervisor I "push[ed] [appellant] harder because of her handicap," and "treat[ed] [appellant] differently" because of it. And, although the previous decision suggests that witnesses uniformly reported that Supervisor I treated nondisabled and disabled employees equally badly, there is in actuality very little comparative testimony on how Supervisor I treated disabled versus nondisabled employees at work. In addition to Employee G's statements, appellant testified that Supervisor I treated herself and another disabled employee badly. There is other significant evidence, however, that will be discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, going to the issue of harassment based on disability, including, stereotypical slurs and disparaging comments made by Supervisor I about disabled employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the aforementioned evidence, then, at least four witnesses, Employees A, B, E, and F, stated, without qualification, that Supervisor I abused male and female employees alike. Thus, reviewed as a whole, the record demonstrates mixed testimony about how Supervisor I treated employees with regard to gender. There is furthermore some evidence that Supervisor I treated disabled employees less well than employees who had no disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are sworn statements by numerous witnesses, however, which show that Supervisor I made brazen, disparaging comments and open stereotypical slurs about women and individuals with a disability in the workplace. As to women, Employee D averred in his affidavit that he has personally heard Supervisor I "make derogatory remarks about women as a group." Employee G reported hearing Supervisor I favorably compare men as a group to women as a group. As one example, Employee G stated that Supervisor I often criticized the speed of female employees, as opposed to male employees. Employee M declared that Supervisor I made improper remarks about women, often referring to them as "babes." Employee N, who described herself as strong and honest, reported that Supervisor I told her that she "did not fit in the mold of other submissive women."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to persons with a disability, Employee M averred in his affidavit that he had personally heard Supervisor I make unfavorable remarks about disabled employees on several occasions. In fact, when Employee M himself considered applying for a supervisory position in 1989, Supervisor I stopped him in the hall and stated that Employee M's "device" might cause problems for him as a supervisor. In addition, Employee P reported that Supervisor I said at one point that "he does not think that handicapped people should be taking jobs from able-bodied people."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is additional evidence as well on the issue of whether Supervisor I treated appellant as he did because appellant was a disabled female. The record reveals other instances of Supervisor I inappropriately touching individuals, as he indisputably did to appellant, in the workplace. Almost exclusively, those who were inappropriately touched--either violently or sexually--were female. Employee M stated under oath that Supervisor I had "improperly touched" Employee M's own wife when she worked for the agency. Employee P, a female, averred in her affidavit that Supervisor I attempted to have sex with her against her will by inappropriately touching her breasts and lips. Moreover, there was testimony from a disabled female, Employee G, that Supervisor I had on one occasion poked her in the chest, as he did with appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, on the issue of whether appellant was exposed to unwelcome, severe or pervasive harassment due to her sex and disability, we observe that the weight of the evidence on this issue--direct, circumstantial, and in large part, first-hand evidence--indicates that appellant was harassed by Supervisor I, due to her sex and disability, as she alleged in her complaint. We should also point out that where appellant's and Supervisor I's accounts of certain events differ dramatically or are in total opposition, we find that appellant is the more credible witness. Appellant raised this point as grounds for her request to reconsider, and it is an important one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude after carefully viewing the entire record, that Supervisor I made misrepresentations or lied about a number of important factual issues. On these issues, appellant's testimony is consistently corroborated by numerous witnesses, and Supervisor I's version of the facts stands alone. We find this to be the case on, for example, the issue of the context in which the poking incident took place. Supervisor I suggests that the incident was "light and joking" in contrast to appellant's sworn statements and the statement of Employee H who witnessed the incident and heard appellant cry out in pain. Also, on the issue of whether he violently shook appellant's chair on a number of occasions, Supervisor I denied that he grabbed and shook the chairs of individuals at work. Multiple witnesses with personal knowledge, however, reported that Supervisor I had in fact committed this very act, either to them directly or to another employee in their presence. The Commission concludes, therefore, that a preponderance of the evidence in the record demonstrates that appellant was subject to sex and disability-based harassment, as a result of the conduct of Supervisor I.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the last element of appellant's claim of discrimination, we conclude that Supervisor II had direct knowledge of the harassment imposed by Supervisor I and clearly failed to take immediate, appropriate remedial action. Virtually all the evidence supports this conclusion. Appellant told Supervisor II about the March 23, 1989 physical assault the day after it happened, however, appellant got the impression that Supervisor II minimized the incident, suggesting that appellant was "hypersensitive" to Supervisor I's conduct. Supervisor I's sworn statements show that Supervisor II did not properly communicate to him the severity of the March 23, 1989 poking incident. The following day, according to Supervisor I, Supervisor II mentioned to him that a "touching" might be "construed" as harassment, and intimated that appellant might be overly sensitive to such conduct because of an abusive parent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also described a meeting several months after this incident in which appellant, Supervisor I, Supervisor II, and another employee discussed appellant's shaky relationship with Supervisor I. The meeting was hostile, according to appellant, and Supervisor II dismissed appellant's concerns about Supervisor I as "a difference in communication styles." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8. Supervisor II also, for example, refused to concede that Supervisor I's statement "I'll write you up" could reasonably be understood as a threat or that a pattern of such threats were occurring. The record indicates instead that Supervisor II may have had a tendency to otherwise put the blame on appellant because Supervisor II also averred in her affidavit <span id="Page_956"></span>that, at this meeting, it was her impression that appellant "was using her handicap as an excuse" for not being able to complete a certain part of a task Supervisor I wanted her to do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Numerous employees in addition observed that Supervisor II was known to "look the other way" when confronted with evidence of Supervisor I's inappropriate or unlawful conduct openly exhibited with appellant, and similarly, with other female or disabled employees. As one example, Employee L averred that, in her own situation, she had reported Supervisor I's offensive conduct to Supervisor II, as well as her own efforts to try and stop him. Supervisor II, according to Employee L, took the matter as a joke, saying, "The man's from New York, that's the personality of people from New York, and you just have to accept it." Thus, to the limited extent that Supervisor II did not have direct knowledge of Supervisor I's harassing conduct with appellant, we will impute knowledge, because Supervisor I's conduct was pervasive and openly practiced, was well-known, and occurred with more than one employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, then, the Commission concludes that appellant has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was subjected to a pattern and practice of sex and disability-based harassment....</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the substantive analysis of whether harassment occurred and whether the agency is liable for such harassment is the same regardless of the basis asserted.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with sexual harassment, the complainant must do more than establish the existence of a work environment that is hostile. He or she must establish that the hostility is based on his or her disability. In <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02951 (2001), the Commission found that the complainant failed to establish the necessary link between the alleged harassment and her disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that complainant was a Clerk at the agency's facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. On September 2, 1996, complainant was transferred to this facility and was assigned as a clerk in the registry cage along with a co-worker (Co-worker). Soon after they met, the Co-worker informed complainant that he had a mental condition and that he was subject to outbursts. Complainant made efforts to be careful and courteous around him. The record indicates, however, that complainant and the Co-worker did not have a very good working relationship and in March of 1997, complainant alleged that she experienced harassment by the Co-worker. In particular, complainant claimed that the Co-worker began leaving literature about being overweight in her workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In May 1997, complainant was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. When she returned to work from sick leave, the Co-worker attempted to discuss the condition with complainant and left literature on multiple sclerosis on her workstation. On May 28, 1997, complainant formally told her supervisor (Supervisor) that she was having problems with the Co-worker. On June 17, 1997, there was a verbal confrontation between complainant and the Co-worker and the Supervisor was notified of it. She informed a manager (Manager) of the situation. Upon being informed of the incident, the Manager initiated an investigation and temporarily reassigned the Co-worker to a different location. An agreement was signed and included complainant and the Co-worker. Pursuant to the agreement, complainant and the Co-worker were to refrain from acting inappropriately with one another and to participate in the agency's Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The Co-worker was also returned to the registry cage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 30, 1997, the Co-worker resumed his inappropriate conduct towards complainant but she did not alert management of his behavior until July 1997. At that time, complainant found a rebuttal letter from the Co-worker that he left in the registry cage and reported the letter to management. During a meeting with the Manager, complainant informed him that she could not work with the Co-worker. As of July 21, 1997, the Co-worker was removed from his bid position and transferred to another position. The Manager spoke with the Co-worker and then placed the Co-worker on off-duty status. On July 23, 1997, complainant told the Manager of her concerns regarding EAP and joint meeting with the Co-worker. On the same day, the Co-worker received a letter of intent to separate him from employment. On September 11, 1997, the Union, on behalf of the Co-worker, filed a grievance regarding the intent to separate and requested that the Co-worker be returned to his bid position in the registry cage. On September 17, 1997, the Plant Manager determined that there was no legal basis to keep the Co-worker from returning to his bid position in the registry cage and, therefore, he was returned to that position. Based on this decision, complainant contacted the EEO office and filed a formal EEO complaint with the agency on November 19, 1997, alleging that the agency had discriminated against her as referenced above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency accepted her complaint for investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, complainant received a copy of the investigative report and requested a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ). The agency motioned for Findings and Conclusions without a hearing. The AJ reviewed the motion and on February 1, 2000, the AJ issued his decision, finding that there are no genuine material disputes of fact or questions of credibility to be determined at a hearing. The AJ also concluded that the agency did not discriminate against complainant and adopted by reference the agency's statement of facts and law submitted in its Motion for Decision Without a Hearing (Motion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ adopted the agency's motion which determined that complainant failed to state a claim of harassment based on sex, age, or disability. In particular, the agency argued that alleged incidents were not severe or pervasive enough to rise to the level of harassment. Further, complainant failed to demonstrate that the alleged incidents were related to her age or sex. Finally, as to complainant's claim of disability-based harassment, the agency determined that complainant failed to show that she is substantially limited in a major life activity. In particular, the agency noted that complainant failed to provide any medical documentation to indicate that her medical condition substantially limits her. The agency also noted that even if complainant had established her claim of a hostile work environment, it had reasonably responded to the incidents that were brought to their attention. The agency was required to restore the Co-worker to his bid position because there was no basis to deny him that position. Accordingly, the agency determined that complainant failed to establish her claim of discrimination on the bases of age, sex, and disability and the AJ adopted the agency's motion recommending a finding of no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's final action implemented the AJ's decision. On appeal, complainant makes no new contentions, and the agency requests that we affirm its final action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Supreme Court has held that summary judgment is appropriate where a court determines that, given the substantive legal and evidentiary standards that apply to the case, there exists no genuine issue of material fact<span class="Italic">. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</span> 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court does not sit as a fact finder<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The evidence of the non-moving party must be believed at the summary judgment stage and all justifiable inferences must be drawn in the non-moving party's favor<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> A disputed issue of fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable fact finder could find in favor of the non-moving party<span class="Italic">. Celotex v. Catrett,</span> 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</span> 846 F. 2D 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1988). A fact is "material" if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the case. If a case can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence, summary judgment is not appropriate. In the context of an administrative proceeding under Title VII, an AJ may properly consider summary judgment only upon a determination that the record has been adequately developed for summary disposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that there was no genuine issue of material fact in this case. Specifically, we find that complainant failed to set forth sufficient facts showing that there was a genuine issue still in dispute. Moreover, the Commission finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the AJ corrected determined that summary judgment was appropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our careful <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the entire record before us, the Commission finds that the AJ's recommended findings and conclusions correctly found that complainant failed to establish her claim. Assuming that complainant established that she is an individual with a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act, she failed to demonstrate a nexus between the alleged harassment and her protected bases. The Commission notes that complainant did show that one of the incidents alleged related to her condition, multiple sclerosis. However, this was the only incident which related to protected bases. The Commission finds that this single incident is not enough to show that the alleged harassment was based upon her protected bases. Furthermore, the Commission finds that complainant has failed to demonstrate that the alleged actions rose to the level of interfering with her work performance and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that the agency's action was discriminatory based on her sex, age, or disability or constituted harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Ford v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A55610 (2006), where the complainant failed to demonstrate that several pieces of graffiti written on a bathroom stall were related to her disability; and <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A50203 (2006) (complainant produced no evidence that alleged harassment was based on her disability or age). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Norton v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120100736 (2012) (supervisor treated everyone in derogatory manner indicating that treatment was not based on complainant's disability).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lovett v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120092291 (2009), the Commission found that the complainant had not established a claim of hostile environment based on his disability or, in the alternative, his EEO activity where the evidence demonstrated that management's treatment of the complainant was based on an "intense dislike" of him and not a protected basis. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Lovett</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The preponderance of evidence in the record supports complainant's <span id="Page_957"></span>claim that he was subjected to a hostile and abusive work environment. Upon arriving at Redstone, his supervisors, the Store Director and the Store Administrator, subjected him to non-stop belittling and humiliating behavior and constantly undermined him in front of outside vendors and his subordinates. Although the managers deny these actions, complainant's coworkers credibly attested otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The reason, however, that complainant's harassment claim fails is because the evidence does not support a finding that he was subjected to a hostile work environment because of disability or reprisal. Even concluding that all of Redstone management's explanations are entirely unworthy of belief, the evidence on this point is lacking. Complainant's coworkers, who believed he was subjected to horrible treatment, did not believe any of it had to do with disability but rather the Store Director and Administrator's intense dislike of him. Furthermore, although complainant engaged in prior protected activity when he asked not to be assigned to Redstone because of the taxing effect the commute would have on his impairments and the need to care for a badly burned child, there is nothing in the record that links his request for accommodation to the Redstone management's hostile and abusive treatment. To the contrary, the request was directed to an agency official other than the managers accused of harassing him, and it is clear that the Store Director and Administrator at Redstone would have much preferred his request had been granted. We cannot, as a matter of law, find the agency liable for harassment at the Redstone Arsenal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The case of <span class="Italic">Rainbolt v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120033857 (2007), provides a good example of a hostile environment claim based on disability where the agency was liable because if did not take effective corrective action to prevent the harassment. In <span class="Italic">Rainbolt</span>, the employee suffered from psoriasis, a noncontagious disease, and severe arthritis. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Rainbolt</span>., found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the record establishes that complainant's psoriasis has caused arthritis that substantially limits him in the major life activity of walking. Complainant stated that his joints swell, that his legs do not support him and can give out at any time, and that he is in constant pain. Further, complainant stated that he uses a cane, sometimes two, all of the time, except when he is at home and that parts of his body occasionally become "lame." He noted that his physician would like him to use a cane all the time. Complainant added that he uses natural remedies and pain management rather than prescribed medications for his consistent pain. Since the limitations in walking caused by complainant's arthritis are substantial, complainant satisfies the statutory definition of an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also establishes that complainant is qualified to perform the essential functions of his position. Essentially, it is undisputed that complainant could perform the essential functions of his position and, as corroborated by complainant's supervisor--S2, only required assistance with climbing a ladder, which does not appear to be an essential function. Based on the evidence of record, we find that complainant is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that complainant has psoriasis and that his psoriasis is accompanied by excessive skin shedding and arthritis. It is further undisputed that, one coworker, C6, told complainant that he should not be at the workplace if he can not climb a ladder, and that most of complainant's coworkers complained constantly about complainant's skin condition. The evidence shows that complainant's coworkers did not want to sit in chairs or use equipment used by complainant for fear of catching psoriasis, thought his skin debris resulted from poor personal hygiene, characterized his skin shedding as "vile" or "frightening" or "pretty annoying and nasty," did not want to eat around complainant, questioned complainant's bathing habits, indicated he had the skin condition because of his "sinful" lifestyle, made disparaging remarks about complainant, and ostracized him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that coworkers would leave notes on his desk instructing him to bathe or seek medical treatment. Complainant alleged that management encouraged the isolation by failing to address it appropriately. C3 corroborated complainant's contentions about the negative environment toward him and added "[the coworkers] would rather that [complainant] were not [in the workplace]." One coworker stated that he did not like to eat around complainant, and several coworkers stated that they did not like to use the same chair or equipment as complainant. Further, we note the AJ's statement, following a hearing, that there was definitely workplace hostility toward complainant due to his psoriasis. For these reasons, we find that complainant did not welcome the conduct to which he was subjected and that the conduct was based upon his psoriasis which was characterized by various symptoms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant has shown that the harassment was sufficiently pervasive that it created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, such that he did not want to go to work. In this regard, we note the previously cited testimony of complainant, C3, and complainant's other coworkers regarding the way in which complainant was treated due to his flaking skin--a symptom of his psoriasis. In reaching this conclusion, we acknowledge that agency management may clearly require an employee to clean his/her individual or shared workspace and that his/her fellow employees may voice concerns through the supervisory chain if s/he fails to do so. However, in the instant case, the coworkers' conduct was beyond voicing legitimate concerns. The evidence indicates that the coworkers exaggerated the extent of the skin shedding problem as corroborated by witness testimony, and that a custodian cleaned the workspace everyday during the last half of his shift. The vitriolic nature of their attitude towards complainant's condition was revealed in their emails and notes when, for example: C1 wrote that seeing the "vile particles of...flesh makes me ill," and described the situation as "frightening"; C6 called complainant's psoriasis "nasty" and said he should not be in the workplace if he can not climb a ladder; C7 indicating that he tries not to use the same telephone as complainant and not share snacks with him; another coworker referred to complainant as a "dog"; and C9 expressing a fear about catching "something" from complainant. This list is not exhaustive, but it clearly shows the coworkers' conduct here was beyond simply uncivil. Rather, it was "so objectively offensive as to alter the 'conditions' of the [complainant's] employment." <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</span> 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998). Thus, under the facts of this particular case, we conclude that the weight of the evidence establishes that complainant was unlawfully subjected to a hostile work environment because of his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final issue is whether the agency should be held liable for the actions of complainant's co-workers. The record revealed that agency management was clearly aware of the coworkers' actions over a prolonged period of time, and that the only action they took was to distribute pamphlets in the workplace about psoriasis. Coworkers stated that they were not counseled or disciplined for their actions. We find that the agency did not fulfill its obligation to take prompt remedial action reasonably calculated to end the harassment once, it learned of complainant's allegations and that it did not take appropriate steps to ensure that the harassment would not recur. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(d).</p>
