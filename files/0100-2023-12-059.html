<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-59"><span class="space">4.</span> Standing in the Federal Courts</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another general rule to be extracted from the cases on standing is that the EEOC has a more liberal view of what constitutes an injury sufficient to state a claim than the federal courts. In the courts, whether the actions of an employer that do not rise to the level of an adverse employment action constitute an injury sufficient to sustain a claim under the antidiscrimination statutes depends on which circuit the case is in, as well as whether the case involves an oriGINAl claim of discrimination or a claim of retaliation. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities</span>, 957 F.2d 424 (7th Cir. 1992), the court found that in a claim of retaliation, the employer's intent is not the issue. Rather, the issue is the effect on the employee. In that case, the court found that a facially neutral policy which required the cancelation of grievances whenever any complaint over the same action was filed in another forum constituted reprisal when it was used to cancel a grievance after the employee filed an ADEA complaint. In so holding, the court made no mention of <span class="Italic">Spring</span> and the "material change in working conditions" test in distinguishing claims of discrimination from claims of reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the same circuit, in a decision that would no doubt be astonishing to most federal employees, dramatically demonstrates the split between the courts and the EEOC on what constitutes an adverse employment action. In <span class="Italic">Smart v. Ball State University</span>, 89 F.3d 437 (7th Cir. 1996), the court found that a negative performance evaluation did not constitute an adverse employment action. In so holding, the court in <span class="Italic">Smart</span>, 89 F.3d at 441-43, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Adverse employment action has been defined quite broadly in this circuit. <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Cisneros</span>, No. 95-1864, slip op. at 4 (7th Cir. May 20, 1996), 1996 WL 266561, *2. In some cases, for example when an employee is fired, or suffers a reduction in benefits or pay, it is clear that an employee has been the victim of an adverse employment action. But an employment action does not have to be so easily quantified to be considered adverse for our purposes. "[A]dverse job action is not limited solely to loss or reduction of pay or monetary benefits. It can encompass other forms of adversity as well." <span class="Italic">Collins v. State of Illinois</span>, 830 F.2d 692, 703 (7th Cir. 1987). In <span class="Italic">Collins</span> the employee was placed in a new department where her supervisors didn't even know what her job entailed. Her office was taken away from her, and she was assigned to a desk outside her supervisor's office, where a receptionist would typically sit. She also lost her phone, business cards, and listing in professional directories and publications. These changes were found to constitute adverse employment action. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Dahm v. Flynn</span>, 60 F.3d 253 (7th Cir. 1994), we found that "a dramatic downward shift in skill level required to perform job responsibilities can rise to the level of an adverse employment action...." <span class="Italic">Dahm</span> at 257.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While adverse employment actions extend beyond readily quantifiable losses, not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action. Otherwise, minor and even trivial employment actions that "an irritable, chip-on-the-shoulder employee did not like would form the basis of a discrimination suit." <span class="Italic">Williams v. Bristol Myers Squibb Co.</span>, No. 95-3649, slip op. at 6 (7th Cir. May 29, 1996). In <span class="Italic">Crady v. Liberty National Bank &#x0026; Trust Co. of Indiana</span>, 993 F.2d 132 (7th Cir. 1993), we found that a change in title from assistant vice-president and manager of one branch of a bank to a loan officer position at a different branch did not by itself <span id="Page_174"></span>constitute an adverse employment action. Another case where adverse employment action was found to be absent is <span class="Italic">Spring v. Sheboygan Area School District</span>, 865 F.2d 883 (7th Cir. 1989). In <span class="Italic">Spring</span>, a 65-year-old school principal was offered the choice between retirement and transfer to a different school as part of a school district reorganization plan. The transfer would have afforded the principal a two-year contract and a merit pay increase, but she would have had to share the position with a co-principal. The court found that the "humiliation" she claimed the co-principal arrangement would cause did not constitute an adverse employment action because "public perceptions were not a term or condition of Spring's employment." <span class="Italic">Spring</span> at 886. The only negative employment-related consequence of the transfer was found to be an increase in the distance she had to travel to work. This alone did not constitute an actionable adverse employer action. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Flaherty v. Gas Research Institute</span>, 31 F.3d 451 (7th Cir. 1994), we found that a lateral transfer, where the employee's existing title would be changed and the employee would report to a former subordinate, may have caused a "bruised ego," but did not constitute an adverse employment action. Most recently, in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, we found that the strictly lateral transfer of a salesman from one division of a pharmaceutical company to another was not an adverse employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dispositive question in our case is not whether Vivian's performance evaluations were undeservedly negative, but whether even undeserved poor evaluations can alone constitute the second element of her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. If Vivian had been, as she alleges, put on probation, we might have a different case before us. But one thing is clear from the record--Vivian was never threatened with or put on probation. The "probation" line of argument seems to stem from two things: a supervisor's statement that Vivian's completion of the program might be delayed if she didn't master the necessary skills on time; and the district court's holding that unflattering evaluations do not alone constitute adverse action for purposes of Title VII. We learned at oral argument that she completed the training program on time and is currently working at Ball State as a full-fledged tree surgeon. The attempt to bolster Vivian's case by characterizing a trainee's need for training as "probation" fails.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is little support for the argument that negative performance evaluations alone can constitute an adverse employment action. There are certainly cases where allegedly undeserved performance evaluations have been presented as evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex or age. But Vivian has not identified, nor have we discovered, a single case where adverse performance ratings alone were found to constitute adverse action. Vivian relies primarily on two cases to support her argument: <span class="Italic">Vergara v. Bentsen</span>, 868 F. Supp. 581 (S.D.N.Y. 1994); and <span class="Italic">Mead v. U.S. Fidelity &#x0026; Guaranty Co.</span>, 442 F. Supp. 114 (D. Minn. 1977). In neither of these cases were negative reviews the sole basis for a finding of adverse action. In <span class="Italic">Vergara</span>, the court noted that the employer had given Vergara poor evaluations, had failed to notify her of these evaluations in contradiction of company policy and practice, and had removed much of her job responsibilities and perhaps denied her a return to these responsibilities based in part on the poor evaluations. In <span class="Italic">Mead</span>, the plaintiff was overloaded with work, deprived of assistance, and eventually fired after filing a charge of sex discrimination. A supervisor testified that, with the exception of one employee who came in late for five weeks in a row, the only employees she made negative reports on were Mead and two co-workers who had also filed EEOC charges. As if that weren't enough, a memo was discovered which in essence said, "Let's paper her file so we can get rid of her."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The closest thing to support for Vivian's claim we were able to find is a 1994 case, not cited by the parties, out of the Southern District of Florida. There, the court said, "An allegation that false performance evaluations were prepared in retaliation for the filing of an EEOC claim is a recognized cause of action..." <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Brookstone Corp. of New Hampshire, Inc.</span>, 857 F. Supp. 1568, 1571 (S.D. Fla. 1994). Turning to the cases cited by the Florida court in support of that proposition, we see that in one of them the negative evaluations were accompanied by a demotion, <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.</span>, 988 F.2d 1564 (11th Cir. 1993). In another, the retaliatory conduct included not only poor reviews, but a transfer of job responsibilities to the point where the employee's work became the intellectual equivalent of a "dunce cap," <span class="Italic">Sowers v. Kemira, Inc.</span>, 701 F. Supp. 809, 825 (S.D. Ga. 1988). In none of them were evaluations alone found sufficient to constitute adverse action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Looking to the facts of the case before us, in the light most favorable to Vivian, we can only conclude that the evaluations alone do not constitute an actionable adverse employment action on the part of Ball State. Vivian was in training, and the evaluations were characteristic of a structured training program. They were facially neutral tools designed to identify strengths and weaknesses in order to further the learning process. Because we decline to extend the already broad definition of adverse employment action to include such evaluations, we conclude, as the district court did, that Vivian failed to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation. The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Russell v. Principi</span>, 257 F.3d 815 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (a performance evaluation is not an adverse action unless it is accompanied by reduced performance award).</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the decision in <span class="Italic">Smart</span>, it probably is of little surprise that in <span class="Italic">Cullom v. Brown</span>, 209 F.3d 1035, 1044 (7th Cir. 2000), the court held that giving an employee an inflated performance evaluation was not an adverse action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court concluded that the VA overrated Cullom out of concern that if it gave him the lower rating he deserved, he would, in effect, "retaliate" against it by filing another EEO complaint<span class="Italic">. Cullom</span>, 27 F. Supp.2d at 1097 ("one can say that Plaintiff may have used the EEO complaint system as an offensive weapon and a threat"). As a policy matter, the VA's behavior is indefensible. It certainly would have been better if the VA had had the fortitude to rate Cullom accurately (although in doing so it would have probably been risking another EEO complaint). But Title VII liability does not turn on ill-advised personnel decisions<span class="Italic">. Mechnig v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 864 F.2d 1359, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988). And while honesty may be, as the district court put it, "the best policy," it is not for a federal court to say that for job evaluations it is "the required policy." <span class="Italic">Cullom</span>, 27 F. Supp.2d at 1090 (emphasis added)<span class="Italic">. See Wallace v. SMC Pneumatics, Inc.</span>, 103 F.3d 1394, 1398 (7th Cir. 1997) (performance evaluations "serve a variety of purposes, only one of which is objective evaluation. They are also morale-builders and motivators."). Thus overrating Cullom so he would not be placed on probation, while giving him substantial training and oversight, was not "retaliatory" discrimination under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dollis v. Rubin</span>, 77 F.3d 777 (5th Cir. 1996), the court found that denial of a request for a desk audit was "not the type of ultimate employment decision that Title VII was intended to address." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Rabinovitz v. Pena</span>, 89 F.3d 482 (7th Cir. 1996) (loss of a bonus was not an adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim where the employee is not automatically entitled to the bonus). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. City of Fort Wayne, Ind.</span>, 91 F.3d 922 (7th Cir. 1996) (holding that whether the exclusion of an assistant fire chief from an important policy meetings was an adverse employment action was a question of fact to be decided by the jury). Likewise, in <span class="Italic">DeNovellis v. Shalala</span>, 124 F.3d 298 (1st Cir. 1997), the court held that assignment to a position in which the plaintiff had no background and the failure to assign any meaningful duties constituted an adverse employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hashimoto v. Dalton</span>, 118 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 1997), the court found that a negative employment reference given in retaliation for protected EEO activity was a violation of Title VII. In that case, a Navy supervisor gave an employee a poor employment reference for a job with the Department of the Army. Although the employment reference was found to be motivated by retaliation, the Navy was able to demonstrate that she would not have gotten the Army job even absent discrimination. Still, the <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span> court found the employment reference, standing alone, was sufficient to give rise to a claim--a position with which the Commission has expressed agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Compliance Manual</span>, 8-II(D)(3). The court in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span>, 118 F.3d at 674, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government's lack of causation argument must fail. "There is little question that the dissemination of adverse employment references can constitute a violation of Title VII if motivated by discriminatory intent." <span class="Italic">London v. Coopers &#x0026; Lybrand</span>, 644 F.2d 811, 817 (9th Cir. 1981). Thus, it is beside the point that Lowery's negative job reference was not the reason Hashimoto did not get the job with the Army. Lowery's dissemination of the negative job reference is an actionable employment decision. Both the EEOC and the district court found that Lowery gave Hashimoto the negative reference in retaliation for her EEOC activities, and the government does not challenge that finding on appeal. Thus, the requisite causal connection is established.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span> further rejected a government argument that, because the employee would not have gotten the Army job absent discrimination, she suffered no employment harm. Finding that the government was confusing the issues of liability and damages, the court in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span>, 118 F.3d at 675-76, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This presents a thornier question. Traditionally, in cases alleging retaliation, the retaliatory conduct takes the form of discharge, demotion, failure to promote, or similar actions that clearly inflict tangible, employment related harm upon the employee. A retaliatory negative job reference, by contrast, does not itself inflict tangible employment harm in the traditional sense. It requires a prospective employer's subsequent, adverse action (failure to hire) in reliance on that reference to create the demonstrable employment harm. The government correctly points out that in every published case involving a negative reference, the reference allegedly resulted in a failure to hire by the prospective employer. The government contends that, because such an injury is lacking here, no Title VII liability attached.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the government's "no harm, no foul" approach. A plaintiff may seek relief for retaliatory actions taken after her employment ends if "the alleged discrimination is related to or arises out of the employment relationship." <span class="Italic">Passer v. American Chemical Soc.</span>, 935 F.2d 322, 330 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (collecting cases). Title VII "does not limit its reach only to acts of <span id="Page_175"></span>retaliation that take the form of cognizable employment actions such as discharge, transfer, or demotion."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 331.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we have squarely rejected a similar "no harm, no foul" argument in the Title VII context. In <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Hacienda Hotel</span>, 881 F.2d 1504 (9th Cir. 1989), the EEOC initiated an employment discrimination action alleging that the employer had violated Title VII by terminating three pregnant employees. The employer argued that it should not be held liable because the employees suffered no "damage" as a result of the terminations since two of the employees were rehired following their pregnancies without loss of seniority or other benefits, and the third employee would not have been rehired in any event because of her poor work performance<span class="Italic">. Hacienda Hotel</span>, 881 F.2d at 1511. We vigorously rejected the employer's argument:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Hacienda's view of its employees' pregnancy discrimination claims is "no harm, no foul." Beyond the cavalier attitude such statements convey, appellant's argument evidences an almost total misapprehension of the purposes and operation of federal employment discrimination law.... Appellant is confusing the liability determination with the relief phase....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Even if no employee suffered a "tangible loss" of an "economic nature," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a loss of seniority or wages or other monetarily quantifiable employment benefits, appellant's implementation of a policy or practice under which pregnant employees were treated differently from other temporarily-disabled employees with similar capacity for work would still be a violation of both the letter and spirit of Title VII's prohibition against pregnancy discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1511-12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Just as in <span class="Italic">Hacienda Hotel</span>, the government's argument in this case fails to recognize the distinction between a violation and the availability of remedies. Lowery's dissemination of the adverse job reference violated Title VII because it was a "personnel action" motivated by retaliatory animus. That this unlawful personnel action turned out to be inconsequential goes to the issue of damages, not liability<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Smith v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 659 F.2d 1113, 1120 (D.C. Cir. 1981) ("[T]he questions of statutory violation and appropriate statutory remedy are conceptually distinct. An illegal act of discrimination--whether based on race or some other factor such as a motive of reprisal--is a wrong in itself under Title VII, regardless of whether that wrong would warrant an award of [remedies].") (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">Sparrow v. Piedmont Health Sys. Agency, Inc.</span>, 593 F. Supp. 1107, 1119 (M.D.N.C. 1984) (agency's retaliatory refusal to provide a letter of recommendation violated Title VII, but plaintiff was not entitled to a remedy because he failed to demonstrate any harm resulting from the agency's action).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as in <span class="Italic">Hacienda Hotel</span>, adoption of the government's position would undermine both the letter and the spirit of Title VII's prohibition against actions in retaliation for EEO activities. We have recognized that actions taken in retaliation for the exercise of Title VII rights can have a "deleterious effect on the exercise of these rights by others." <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Lawn</span>, 805 F.2d 1400, 1405 (9th Cir. 1986). Although this particular harm was not suffered by Hashimoto in the present case because she was no longer employed by the Navy, the chilling effect which Lowery's retaliatory conduct might have on the remaining employees under his supervision does counsel against accepting the government's narrow conception of what constitutes a "violation" of Title VII. Accordingly, we conclude that the retaliatory dissemination of a negative employment reference violates Title VII, even if the negative reference does not affect the prospective employer's decision not to hire the victim of the discriminatory action.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is virtually impossible to give a single, general rule as to how the Commission views the issue of standing in federal sector complaints. To the extent that generalization is possible, the Commission recognizes three categories of complaints when analyzing whether a complainant is aggrieved: (1) complaints of discrimination that involve personnel actions and the terms, conditions and privileges of employment; (2) complaints of hostile environment harassment based on discrimination; and (3) complaints of retaliation for protected activities. The Commission more narrowly interprets the standing requirement when dealing with claims of discrimination that involve a personnel action, term, condition, or privilege of employment and requires some showing of personal harm to the employee. In cases of harassment, it uses a more liberal standard on the basis that every employee is entitled to a work environment that is free of harassment based on discrimination, even if the complainant would not be entitled to relief for his or her individual complaint. See the discussion of harassment in <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a>. It also has used a more liberal standard when dealing with retaliation because of the potential chilling effect to other employees' complaint rights. Some specific examples involving each of these categories are discussed below.</p>
