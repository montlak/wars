<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-111"><span class="space">G.</span> TIME FOR ASSERTING DAMAGES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's position has been that a complainant may request compensatory damages at any time during the administrative processing of the complaint, including on appeal to the Office of Federal Operations. However, the Commission drew the line at requests for reconsideration and refused to entertain damages requests at that stage. To prevent claims of compensatory damages from arising late in the EEO process, the Commission imposed upon agencies an obligation to request information from the complainant about damages, including advising the complainant of the need to establish causation and the types of damage evidence that can be submitted. The failure of the complainant to respond to such requests resulted in dismissal of the damages claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Roquemore v. Postmaster General</span>, 01997265 (2002). No doubt, much of the Commission's policy regarding the timing of damage requests was driven by concern that complainants, particularly <span class="Italic">pro se</span> complainants, might not be aware that Title VII had been amended to allow compensatory damages. That day, however, has long passed and the Commission now holds that a claim for damages cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">McLain v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120053362 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">Some of the Commission's early decisions on compensatory damages seemed to suggest that a complainant who had not requested such damages in the formal complaint was barred from raising the issue at a later point in the proceedings. However, in <span class="Italic">Carlson v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05930480 (1994), the Commission rejected that notion. In <span class="Italic">Carlson</span>, the Commission held that the issue of compensatory damages could be raised in response to a certified offer of full relief:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this request for reconsideration, then, we must decide the issue of whether the agency's failure to include compensatory damages in its settlement offer precludes the offer from being considered an offer of full relief. We conclude that an agency may not cancel an EEO complaint for failure to accept an offer of full relief which does not include compensatory damages, where, as here, appellant objects to the certified offer, within the requisite time period, because the offer does not contain a provision for compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, appellant made a statement in her objection to the certified offer, stating that the agency had failed to provide her with a monetary award to compensate her for the damage she suffered as a result of the events alleged in her complaint. More specifically, appellant explained in her objection that she was entitled to monetary damages for the hurt she experienced when she approached her first and second-level supervisors about the public prayer incident set forth in her formal complaint and asked that it not be repeated at future work gatherings. This is, in effect, a complaint of retaliation. Appellant claimed that her supervisors rebuffed her and completely failed to acknowledge her right to be free of religious discrimination in the workplace. We find that appellant's objection--in this case her specific request for compensatory damages in the response to the certified offer--gave the agency sufficient notice that it should have requested "objective evidence of the alleged damages incurred" prior to canceling her complaint for failure to accept an offer of full relief<span class="Italic">. Jackson</span>, EEOC Request No. 01923399, at 3-4. The agency should have likewise requested objective evidence that appellant's damages are linked to the alleged unlawful discrimination<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, then, appellant made a timely objection in writing to the agency, maintaining that the offer made to her was not full relief, because she should have been compensated monetarily for the damages she incurred. Appellant further explained that she had been hurt by the religious prayer being offered in the workplace, and by the subsequent conduct of her supervisors. According to appellant, her first-level supervisor mocked her, using a condescending tone, when appellant suggested that at future work gatherings, prayers should not be offered. Appellant also alleged that when she attempted to talk about the prayer incident with her second-level supervisor, her supervisor would not listen to her, stating dismissively that she did not want to hear anything unpleasant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a complainant has set forth an objection to the agency's certified <span id="Page_1804"></span>offer, and specified that the offer is inadequate because it did not include compensatory damages, the agency is obliged to withdraw the offer and follow the precepts of <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> by requesting objective evidence of the alleged damages incurred as well as evidence of linkage. Based upon the complainant's response, the agency can then either make a new certified offer of full relief which addresses the issue of compensatory damages, or resume processing of the complaint. Since the agency in this case did not request such evidence from appellant, it was improper for it to cancel appellant's complaint for failure to accept an offer of full relief. We shall therefore grant this request to reconsider and vacate the final agency decision, remanding the case for further processing at the point processing ceased.</p>

Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01943260 (1994), the Commission held that the administrative judge should advise a complainant of not only the need to support a claim for compensatory damages with evidence, but the kinds of evidence required to support such a claim. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120072400 (2009) (Commission awarded $25,000 on appeal where complainant submitted evidence of damages and administrative judge did not advise complainant to present damages evidence at hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent">A claim for compensatory damages may be filed at any time, up through and including on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Kochhar v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966813 (1998). However, a claim for compensatory damages may not be raised for the first time in a request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05950960 (1998); <span class="Italic">Porter v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05940342 (1994). But if the Commission remands a case because it grants a request to reopen on other grounds, the complainant may assert a claim for compensatory damages on remand. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05950553 (1996); <span class="Italic">Square v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05930910 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">A claim for damages is timely raised and sufficiently asserted even where the complainant does not specifically request compensatory damages when, at the hearing, she testified about the stress and anxiety caused by the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Gudger v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01980054 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where a hearing is requested, many district offices are requiring the complainant to specify whether compensatory damages are being sought and, if so, to enumerate the basis for the claim. Many of the Commission's cases on when a damage claim can be raised have involved situations where it was less than clear the complainant was given an opportunity to request damages. As a result, it is likely the Commission would find that a damage claim has been waived if not made in response to a specific query by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="noindent">The courts have split on whether a claim for compensatory damages may be raised for the first time in U.S. district court. For example, in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 1997), the employee rejected a certified offer of full relief that did not include compensatory damages. However, the employee had never requested such damages. The Fifth Circuit reasoned that allowing the employee to raise a claim for compensatory damages for the first time in U.S. district court would thwart the purposes of requiring administrative exhaustion of claims. As the court in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, 121 F.3d at 208-09, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Francis v. Brown</span>, we held that a "federal employee fails to exhaust his administrative remedies when he rejects a settlement offer for full relief on the specific claims he asserts." 58 F.3d at 193 (emphasis added). Implicit in our holding is the proposition that a settlement offer is one of full relief if it adequately resolves the particular claims that an aggrieved employee asserts. The employee bears the initial burden of notifying his employing agency of the specific relief sought, and here again, we emphasize that a complainant may only receive relief for that which he asks. Indeed, it would be contrary to the purpose of the exhaustion requirement to allow a claimant to pursue a claim in district court that he failed to raise during the administrative investigation. The exhaustion doctrine requires a good faith effort by the aggrieved employee to provide all relevant and available information to the investigating agency. <span class="Italic">See Munoz v. Aldridge</span>, 894 F.2d 1489, 1492-93 (5th Cir. 1990). Administrative agencies should not be forced to guess at the relief sought.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the employee need not present his claim for compensatory damages in a legal or technical manner. He must, however, inform the employing agency or the EEOC of the particular facts of the case that demonstrate that he has suffered an emotional and/or mental injury that requires the payment of compensatory damages to make him whole. Such facts obviously must demonstrate more than the mere fact of forbidden discrimination or harassment. We do not seek to place an undue burden on Title VII claimants, who often proceed <span class="Italic">pro se</span> during the administrative investigation. Even a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> claimant, however, should recognize the importance of informing the employing agency or the EEOC of the pertinent facts of his complaint and injury. Once the agency is put on notice of facts that may justify an award of compensatory damages, the burden shifts to the employing agency to investigate the claim for compensatory damages. For example, if the claimant notifies the agency that he was hospitalized as a result of illegal harassment, then an offer of full relief must either offer to reimburse the employee for the damages sustained or otherwise explain why damages are not being offered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Fitzgerald had numerous opportunities to inform the VA or the EEOC of any damages that he had sustained, but he repeatedly failed to do so. His first opportunity arose when he filed his formal complaint of discrimination with the VA. In this handwritten form, Fitzgerald briefly described the acts of discrimination that he had faced and indicated that he sought a "complete investigation, and appropriate action taken." Nowhere did Fitzgerald mention that he had suffered emotional injuries resulting in hospitalization, and he did not request any form of monetary compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After investigation, the VA mailed to Fitzgerald a certified offer of full relief. As stated in the offer, the VA promised to: (1) provide Fitzgerald with a "fair and equitable work environment" free from discrimination; (2) ensure that Fitzgerald would not be assigned to work on the same shift as the harasser; and (3) formally discipline the harasser. It did not offer to pay Fitzgerald any form of monetary compensation. Further, the offer informed Fitzgerald that if he refused to accept the offer within 30 days, his complaint would be dismissed. Notably, Fitzgerald was also advised that he could call the director of the medical center to discuss the offer of relief. The record contains no evidence that Fitzgerald ever made such a call.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After Fitzgerald failed to respond to the offer of full relief within 30 days, the VA informed him of its final decision to dismiss his complaint. In this missive, the VA also advised Fitzgerald that he had the right to appeal the VA's decision to dismiss his claim. After Fitzgerald filed his notice of appeal, the EEOC informed him of his right to file any statement or other material in support of the appeal. The record indicates, however, that Fitzgerald filed his appeal without comment. Again, we emphasize that Fitzgerald had the opportunity to inform the EEOC as to why the certified offer of full relief was inadequate, but he failed to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC decision affirming the VA's dismissal of the complaint also apprised Fitzgerald that the EEOC might reconsider its decision if Fitzgerald were to submit a written request containing argument or evidence tending to establish, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that: "[n]ew and material evidence is available that was not readily available when the previous decision was issued; "or "the previous decision involved an erroneous interpretation of law, regulation or material fact...." The record does not show that Fitzgerald requested reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted in <span class="Italic">Francis</span>, 58 F.3d at 193, a claimant "is not entitled to relief outside the scope of his claim." Our review of the record discloses that Fitzgerald made no effort to notify either the VA or the EEOC of the particular circumstances of his Title VII claim that might warrant an offer of compensatory damages. The VA's settlement offer fully disposed of those concerns actually presented by Fitzgerald, and as such, it was an offer of full relief. Because Fitzgerald rejected an offer of full relief, he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, <span class="Italic">see Francis</span>, 58 F.3d at 193, and we affirm the district court's order dismissing his civil suit.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 137 F.3d 992 (7th Cir. 1998), the court held that a claim for compensatory damages need not be asserted before the EEOC because the EEOC has no authority to issue damage awards. The <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> court, based on an analysis of the statutory language that allows either party to request a jury trial when damages are claimed, found that damages can only be awarded in the district court. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Babbitt</span>, 148 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir. 1998). In <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 144 L. Ed.2d 196 (1999), the Supreme Court held the Commission does have the authority to award damages. On remand, the Seventh Circuit reversed itself and held that administrative remedies are not exhausted when the complainant does not request damages before the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See Gibson v. West</span>, 201 F.3d 990 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>
