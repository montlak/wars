<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-57"><span class="space">1.</span> Disciplinary Cases</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a case involving discipline of the complainant, the focus remains on the agency's motivation for taking the action and not on the fairness or appropriateness of the disciplinary action. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">O'Dell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981939 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite complainant's arguments to the contrary, we will not second guess the appropriateness of the agency's disciplinary action. In making a determination of discrimination, the Commission has held that the trier of fact must look at the motivation of the decision maker as opposed to the decision maker's business judgment<span class="Italic">. See Dorothy Schaeffer v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A10518 (February 18, 2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Gould,</span> 808 F.2d 493 (6th Cir. 1987). Whether or not a thorough investigation on complainant's alleged threat was conducted is not dispositive of the discrimination claim in this case. The agency has stated that it believed that complainant engaged in inappropriate conduct and it took action to address that conduct. Unless complainant can show that this articulated reason is a mere pretext for discriminatory conduct, he cannot prevail on his allegation of discriminatory treatment. In keeping with the AJ's decision, we find that complainant was not successful in his effort to show pretext. The Supreme Court has held that in making a finding on pretext, it is not sufficient "to disbelieve the employer; the fact finder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</span> 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Complainants often defend on the basis that they did not commit the alleged misconduct. The relevant inquiry, however, is not whether the complainant actually engaged in the specified misconduct, but whether the agency officials who disciplined the complainant believed that he engaged in the misconduct. For example, in <span class="Italic">Farmer v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01986106 (2001), the Commission observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency officials testified that they based their determination that complainant should be terminated on an investigation which concluded that complainant engaged in sexual misconduct with a patient, made inappropriate advances to the wife of another patient, and sexually harassed a co-worker. Complainant argues that the investigation was inaccurate and incomplete and that, therefore, agency officials could not have relied on it in deciding to terminate his employment. In support of this argument he points to the lack of physical evidence that he committed rape or other sexual misconduct and the fact that he was never charged with a criminal offense. We note, however, that these issues are irrelevant to the question of whether agency's officials based their decision to terminate complainant on the results of the 15-6 investigation. The agency did not argue that it relied on physical evidence or that there was sufficient evidence to charge complainant with a crime. Rather, agency officials stated that the investigation's findings led them to believe that complainant had committed misconduct and that even considering complainant's statements to the contrary, they felt the evidence in the 15-6 report was too strong to place other patients at risk by continuing to employ complainant. Moreover, while complainant alleges that the statements of the alleged victims of his misconduct include contradictions, it is undisputed that before concluding that complainant committed misconduct, the 15-6 investigator interviewed fourteen individuals, including complainant, those accusing him of misconduct, and all relevant witnesses. Even assuming the truth of complainant's contentions that he did not commit the alleged offenses and that the 15-6 investigation was based on hearsay and included contradictions, complainant failed to raise a genuine dispute as to whether agency officials based their decision to terminate him on the results of the 15-6 investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Philpot v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A04985 (2001), where the Commission found the administrative judge did not commit error in focusing on whether the agency had, in good faith, relied on the findings of the misconduct investigation and not on whether the misconduct actually occurred. "In this regard, we note that there is no evidence that the agency rejected the investigative findings on any accident involving other employees outside complainant's protected classes." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence that the agency lacked uniformity as to how discipline is meted out and/or that the disciplinary action is disproportionate to the alleged misconduct may establish pretext. In <span class="Italic">Erwin B. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120151276 (2017), the complainant (Hispanic) alleged discrimination when he was issued two separate letters of counseling for two separate incidents. The first letter of counseling involved the complainant raising his voice during a meeting. The complainant pointed to another coworker (Caucasian), who also raised his voice during a meeting, but was not disciplined. The agency issued the second letter for counseling when the complainant missed a work-related phone call. Again, the complainant pointed to comparators outside of his protected class who had also missed phone calls, but who were never disciplined for such failures. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Erwin B</span>. found race-based discrimination, reasoning:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding Claims 5 and 7, we find that Complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on race. Specifically, Complainant is a member of a protected class based on his race. Further, we find that Complainant was subjected to adverse actions, and was treated less favorably than other employees outside of his protected class. In this case, Complainant was issued a Letter of Counseling on June 27, 2012, for Unprofessional Conduct, and another Letter of Counseling for Failure to Meet Employee Duty Responsibilities when he missed a duty call. In both Claims 5 and 7, the Assistant Director's justifications lacked details regarding the reasons Complainant received disciplinary action, when others committing the same or similar infractions received none. We will address both claims individually as follows.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Claim 5, the Assistant Director stated that Complainant interrupted him before he could finish his thought. When it was Complainant's turn to speak, Complainant allegedly spoke with an unprofessional and defensive tone. The Assistant Director stated that he told Complainant to lower his voice or leave and Complainant did lower his voice. Yet, following the meeting, the Assistant Director issued Complainant a Letter of Counseling for Unprofessional Conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, in a meeting held sometime after this incident. Complainant asserted that E1, a Caucasian employee, raised his voice, grabbed his crotch and told a fellow coworker to "grow a pair." Complainant asserted that despite witnessing this exchange, the Assistant Director did nothing. Another inspector who was present, E3, affirmed Complainant's version of events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his interview, the Assistant Director affirmed that E1 raised his voice, but asserted that the main difference was that it was towards the group, and that he (E1) had not interrupted him. Additionally, the Assistant Director stated that he could not recall E1 grabbing his private parts or telling anyone to "grow a pair."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, E1 was arguably more disruptive in exhibiting inappropriate behavior in the workplace. Even if the Assistant Director truly did not witness E1's behavior, in both instances, both E1 and Complainant are arguably disruptive to the meeting as whole. Only Complainant, however, was issued a disciplinary action. While the Assistant Director has offered what, he believed to be a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for issuing Complainant a Letter of Counseling, but not E1, we find that it was pretextual as it lacked uniformity in how he issued discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Claim 7, on July 16, 2013, the Assistant Director issued Complainant a Letter of Counseling for "Failure to Meet Employee Duty Responsibilities." The Assistant Director issued Complainant a Letter of Counseling for missing a duty call. The Assistant Director stated that Complainant failed to answer calls to his government-issued phone, did not respond to his email, and his emergency contacts were out of date. Additionally, the Assistant Director noted that Complainant failed to notify anyone at the Agency that he was having problems with his new phone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant asserted that such disciplinary action was disproportional, particularly given that he had never previously missed a duty call, and that other inspectors had missed a duty call without discipline. As the investigator noted, the Assistant Director "stated, without expounding, that he addressed the issue with each employee on a case-by-case basis." Such a justification is extremely generalized, and provides no substantive explanation why, in Complainant's particular case, disciplinary action was deemed warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record demonstrates that other non-Hispanic inspectors, including Caucasian employees, missed duty calls with no consequences. One Caucasian employee affirmed that he had "missed a couple of duty calls and has not received discipline or corrective actions." The Agency's final decision noted that according to the Assistant Director, the comparators did not receive disciplinary action because when they had not answered a duty call, the circumstances involved were either beyond their control, or had not resulted in an "adverse effect on security." However, aside from the Assistant Director's word, there is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Complainant's missed call caused any "adverse effect on security." We find that the disciplinary action was disproportionate to Complainant's action, which, as far as the record demonstrates, again did not result in any dire consequences.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, an employee does not establish pretext based on a difference in discipline of two employees involved in the same incident where, in the first instance, the agency proposes the removal of both employees but the comparison employee retires in lieu of termination. <span class="Italic">Wojtila v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991794 (2002). The Commission found the agency articulated a legitimate reason in citing the retirement as a reason for the difference in discipline and that the complainant failed to demonstrate the reason was pretextual. The Commission does not require that the misconduct of comparison employees be identical, though it has not specifically articulated just how similar the misconduct must be in relation to that of the complainant. For example, in <span class="Italic">Beyer v. Attorney General</span>, 07A10036 (2002), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the misconduct of the complainant and the comparison employee's was not sufficiently similar:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_736"></span>The record in this regard is undisputed, on September 4, 1996, complainant entered the institution grounds under the influence of alcohol and medication and attempted to withdraw her service revolver from the armory in order to kill herself. On January 21, 1997, the agency issued complainant a letter of reprimand for her actions. On March 13, 1997, Warden T denied complainant's request to remove the letter of reprimand from her personnel file, because of what he called "the seriousness of her actions." Warden B, Warden T's successor, rejected complainant's July 21, 1997, request to remove the letter of reprimand from her personnel file. The record reveals that the reprimand stayed in complainant's file until December 29, 1998. The agency states that it did not remove the reprimand because of the seriousness of complainant's actions. The agency's human resources specialist advised Warden B to remove the reprimand from complainant's personnel file one year after the incident (December 1997), since there had been no recurrence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge found that the agency's reason for maintaining the reprimand was unworthy of belief in light of the discipline issued to two male employees and the testimony of the human resources specialist. Because the Administrative Judge's comparison with these male employees was appropriate and because her conclusions are supported by substantial evidence in the record, the Commission affirms the Administrative Judge's finding that complainant was discriminated against on the basis of her sex when it failed to remove the letter of reprimand from her personnel file by December 1997. The agency argues that complainant and the male employees with whom she compares herself are not similarly situated. While the infractions committed by these male comparators were different (one maintained a sexual relationship with a subordinate employee, the other inappropriately touched a subordinate employee) we affirm the Administrative Judge's conclusion that the differences do not satisfactorily explain why complainant received harsher punishment. The agency prevented damage to the careers of these male employees by failing to discipline at all in one case, and by reducing a suspension to a last chance agreement in the other. The Administrative Judge did not err in comparing the discipline issued to complainant with the discipline issued to the two male employees just because the infractions were not identical in every respect<span class="Italic">. See O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.</span>, 517 U.S. 308 at 312; EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, at n.4 (Sept. 18, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant does not establish pretext where he demonstrates that non-Hispanic employees received lesser discipline but the agency demonstrates that his conduct was more egregious than the comparables. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120123288 (2014), the complainant established that other air traffic controllers received lesser discipline for workplace altercations, but the agency was able to distinguish the complainant's conduct based on its severity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant attempts to establish pretext by pointing to there being lesser disciplinary actions imposed against non-Hispanic employees. Complainant also emphasizes that his infraction was a first offense for him. Additionally, Complainant maintains that his conduct was a reaction to the TMC's conduct. In support of Complainant's arguments, we note that an Air Traffic Control Specialist stated he was unaware of any other Air Traffic Control Specialist receiving a three-day suspension for a first offense. Another Air Traffic Control Specialist stated that the TMC charged at Complainant, and he believed Complainant was the victim. An additional Air Traffic Control Specialist stated that he engaged in a shouting match with another Air Traffic Control Specialist with curses and threats, and they only received oral reprimands with letters recording the oral reprimands.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon consideration of the evidence, we find that the distinguishing factor in this matter is the severity of the altercation and the risk that it posed to public safety. The other referenced disputes do not appear to have been violent or to have posed a threat to the flying public. In the instant matter, it appears that Complainant and the TMC would have been physically fighting each other if not for being kept apart by their coworkers. As a result, the coworkers were diverted and distracted from their focus on the runways on a very busy day at the airport. The magnitude of the altercation and the potential threat to air safety, as well as the need to deter similar misconduct, warranted the imposition of sufficient disciplinary action. We note that the TMC, a non-Hispanic, who had prior arguments with coworkers, received a four-day suspension for the incident at issue. In light of the severity of this situation, we find that Complainant has not established that the Agency's explanation for his three-day suspension was pretext intended to hide discriminatory intent.</p>
<p class="noindent">An analysis of comparable disciplinary actions is not always necessary to the agency's defense. Evidence that the complainant violated agency policy, for instance, may be enough to establish a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the discipline. For instance, in <span class="italic">Drew N. v. Secretary of Commerce,</span> 2022003230 (2022), the agency terminated the complainant for "political speech" posted on Facebook during off-duty hours. Though completed outside of work hours, social media posts are not outside the purview of the Commission if those posts violate agency policies or create a hostile work environment for other agency employees. The agency cited to the following events to support the termination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency became aware of the posts, which were publicly viewable, because several Facebook users had messaged the Agency's social media account with screenshots of Complainant's posts, complaining that he described himself as an Agency employee. One of these screenshots was a comment Complainant made on an article that included a picture of an African-American actress wearing a shirt with a photograph of Breonna Taylor, in which he stated, "Hope a cop kneels on her neck."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant admitted to also posting a follow-up comment saying "Fuck BLM [Black Lives Matter]." In other posts, Complainant referred to the COVID-19 coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Kung flu," he reposted an image of what appeared to be Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and stated, "Send the bitch back to the shithole country," and he captioned a photograph of himself wearing a mask that said "Trump 2020" with the following: "Citizens are now afraid to make public their support of President Trump. I dare someone to confront me, it will not end well for them. Those who know me know that I am a little psycho and Unhinged, so if it’s violence they want, they shall get it."</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding that the posts advocated violence, the Commission upheld the termination as legitimate and nondiscriminatory and the complainant failed to prove pretext in <span class="italic">Drew N.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that discipline is later rescinded does not, standing alone, establish pretext. The focus is on whether the agency official taking the action believed there was a legitimate reason at the time he or she took the action. In <span class="Italic">Imhof v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52217 (2006), the Commission rejected complainant's argument that a letter of warning was discriminatory because a higher level official later rescinded the letter:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency, in its FAD, relied upon the reasons stated in the LOW issued by S2 as the agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action, i.e., complainant's unsatisfactory performance. Complainant seeks to establish pretext based on the fact that the LOW was subsequently rescinded by HRM. We disagree. HRM's decision to rescind the LOW was based on her determination that there was insufficient evidence that complainant acted inappropriately. There is no evidence, however, that HRM's decision was based on a belief that S2 issued the LOW in order to discriminate against complainant because of her race. We also find no persuasive evidence that would support a finding that S2 acted for any reason other than his determination that a LOW was warranted. The fact that HRM, based on her discretion, later overruled him is not, standing alone, evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complaint failed to prove pretext in <span class="Italic">Archie D. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2021000459 (2021), where the complainant alleged that the agency discriminated against him based on his sexual orientation (heterosexual) when it issued him a reprimand. In that case, the agency medical center sent an email to all staff regarding "the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Health Awareness Week." The complainant replied to all asking: "Just out of curiosity, and so I can make allowances, what day is ‘Heterosexual Healthcare Day?'--Asking for a friend." The agency reprimanded the complainant for the "inappropriate comment which was unprofessional and not in line with the Agency's values." Finding no pretext of discrimination, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Archie D</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the AJ determined that the Agency articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. The Agency issued Complainant the reprimand at issue because after his receipt of the Agency's March 25, 2019 email (which was sent to "All Staff" in the medical center) notifying of the LGBT Health Awareness Week, he immediately (within three minutes) inappropriately replied to not only the medical center (the sender of the original email) but also to "All Staff" asking about "what day is ‘Heterosexual Healthcare Day?'" The original Agency email specifically included the designated LGBT Veteran Care Coordinator's name, email address, and phone number for further inquiry about the information therein. After a review of the record, we find that Complainant failed to show that the Agency's articulated reasons were a mere pretext for discrimination. Complainant failed to show that there were any similarly situated employees not in his protected groups who were treated differently under similar circumstances. Based on the foregoing, we find that Complainant failed to show that the Agency's action was motivated by discrimination as he alleged.</p>
