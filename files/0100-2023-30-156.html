<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-147"><span class="space">p.</span> $100,001-$125,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">Noting a psychiatrist's report that the complainant would never recover from the effects of hostile environment harassment by her supervisor and that even partial recovery could take up to 10 years, the Commission awarded $105,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">St. Louis v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01985846 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1910"></span>In <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953977 (1998), the Commission awarded $110,000 to the victim of hostile environment sexual harassment where the complainant had some previous treatment due to marital problems unrelated to the harassment. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he injury sustained by appellant resulted in her hospitalization, and the various symptoms she experienced included hopelessness, loss of energy, agoraphobia, loss of interest in living, depressed mood, impaired memory and concentration, insomnia, agitation, and loss of interest in routine activities and personal self care. Not only did appellant's injury render her incapable, for a time, of taking care of her daughters medical condition, but it effectively ended her career with the agency. In this regard, we are cognizant of the fact that, at this point in time, appellant is unable to even enter a post office let alone return to work for the agency. The Commission notes that the amount of the award is motivated by neither passion nor prejudice; is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone; and is not inconsistent with amounts awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar</span>, 865 F.2d at 848; AIC Security, 823 F. Supp. at 574. Accordingly, that part of the FAD awarding compensatory damages is modified.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, the Commission also awarded $110,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Winkler v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01975336 (2000), where the complainant suffered from severe depression and interference with her marital and social life and the effects of the discrimination were projected to require an additional two years of treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Nia G. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120160716 (2018), the Commission increased a $10,000 award to $110,000 where the complainant proved that the agency terminated her in retaliation for her prior EEO activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining nonpecuniary, compensatory damages, the Commission strives to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases. In this case, Complainant asserted that her retaliatory termination transformed her from a positive, happy person to a person with severe emotional distress. The record reveals that she did not have a preexisting mental health or emotional condition prior to her termination. Complainant stated that she struggled to keep her home, lost her sole means of transportation, had to move in with her parents, could not find a full-time job locally, and had to commute 100 miles daily to a job that paid less than she made in her Agency position. Complainant stated that she slept and cried all the time, felt "worthless," experienced insomnia, and wanted to die. Complainant stated that she felt like she was going crazy and needed professional help, but she could not afford it. Complainant stated that she had to live on her savings and retirement withdrawals. Complainant stated that RMO's lies ruined her reputation and caused her to be removed from Agency property as if she were a criminal. Complainant stated that she lives in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business and she is humiliated. Complainant stated that she continues to be impacted by her discriminatory termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's sister, CS, and their mother, CM, corroborated her contentions. CS stated that her sister changed following her termination and is "a completely different person." CS stated that Complainant lost her sense of identity, the ability to trust herself, and her self-esteem. CM stated, "I felt like I was losing my daughter." Complainant's former supervisor and friend, AHSA, stated that Complainant has been in great emotional pain and experienced a lot of humiliation over the years since her termination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge's award of $110,000 in damages was deemed appropriate by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bohac v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05A40111.txt">07A00030</a> (2003), where the emotional distress lasted several years. In <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the issue of compensatory damages, the Commission notes that the AJ considered the evidence of record and found that due to the discrimination, harassment and retaliation by S1 against complainant between the years 1992-1994: (1) complainant was worried that she was unable to fulfill the obligations of her research project; (2) complainant was "devastated" when she did not get the McKnight grant and was thus nervous, agitated, angry, frustrated and had difficulty sleeping; and (3) due to stress, she suffered a miscarriage in September 1994. The AJ also noted that due to the harassment, complainant testified that she was depressed and cried some, and between 1994 and 1996 stated that she experienced physical problems such as migraine headaches and muscle spasms, in addition to suffering additional miscarriages in 1995 and 1996. The AJ also noted that complainant testified that the agency's actions prior to 1996 caused her to have problems at home, affecting her husband and son, and she stated that she had no energy to enjoy her hobbies. The AJ found that complainant had symptoms of stress such as irritable bowel syndrome, which was diagnosed by her physician. The AJ noted testimony of complainant's colleagues that following the denial of the McKnight grant, she became disillusioned and depressed, and appeared nervous, cried frequently and was unable to concentrate. The AJ noted the further testimony of complainant's husband that after the harassment began in 1992, complainant was tense, short with him and suffered from headaches and stomach disorders. From 1994 to 1996, complainant's husband stated that he noticed physical changes in complainant. The AJ also noted that complainant established damage to her professional standing as the result of the censorship under which she was placed. After consideration of all the evidence, the AJ found that due to the retaliation, complainant suffered physical and mental distress, and she established damage to her professional reputation due to the censorship under which she was placed by the agency. After consideration of awards in situations similar to that of complainant, the AJ granted compensatory damages in the amount of $110,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having carefully considered the facts of this case, the Commission finds that the AJ's award of $110,000.00 is a proper award for the emotional harm which complainant has suffered as a result of the discriminatory and retaliatory actions in this case. In reaching this amount, the Commission has considered a number of factors. For example, we considered the nature, severity and lengthy duration of the discrimination, harassment and retaliation (over five years), as well as the nature and severity of complainant's physical and emotional pain and suffering. We considered the evidence concerning complainant's emotional distress received from complainant's statements and the documentation of complainant's physicians and colleagues detailing that she suffered from physical and emotional distress for a period of several years. We note that the AJ concluded that complainant did not offer sufficient evidence of causation to establish that the miscarriages she suffered were caused by the agency's discrimination. In addition, we have considered the damage done to complainant's professional reputation due to the effects of the censorship under which she was placed. Additionally, we have considered the amounts awarded in similar cases, and find that the AJ did not abuse her discretion in finding that complainant is entitled to nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $110,000.00<span class="Italic">. See Santiago v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (October 14, 1998)($125,000.00 awarded in non-pecuniary damages for emotional distress over a period of several years, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> depression, anxiety, moodiness, insomnia, tearfulness, fatigue, stomach and chest pains); <span class="Italic">Cook v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950027 (July 17, 1998) (the Commission awarded $80,000 in non-pecuniary damages for emotional distress which included physical symptoms such as headaches, stomach cramps and mental anguish).</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying in part upon <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the Commission increased an agency award of $52,000 in damages to $110,000 in <span class="Italic">Webman and Huff v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120071859, 0120071896 (2008). Like her fellow complainant, Barbara Huff has suffered a several year period of sexual harassment and advances by a supervisor. The Commission rejected, however, the complainant's approach to award $25,000 for each year of harassment for a total of $225,000. The complainant's rationale was that the Commission had awarded $125,00 for a complainant who had suffered five years of discrimination in <span class="Italic">Anvari v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, infra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01992843 (2002), the Commission awarded $115,000 where the complainant had a preexisting condition, but the harm extended over a significant period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where harassment and stalking of the complainant lasted over several years and the complainant's psychiatrist testified that she would continue to require extensive treatment, the Commission awarded $115,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Sanford v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A31818 (2004), the Commission found the complainant's testimony regarding emotional distress was supported by the testimony of coworkers and friends and her psychiatrist indicated that she would need an additional 10 years of treatment to recover from the effects of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $15,000 to $115,000 in <span class="Italic">Chastain v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120102409 (2010), where the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment and a forced resignation. The Commission, in increasing the award in <span class="Italic">Chastain</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains testimony from both Complainant and his spouse regarding Complainant's pain and suffering, which the AJ found credible and described as "dolorous." AJ Decision at 1.3. The AJ further stated that "[t]here is ample evidence in the record that Complainant was devastated by the Agency's actions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Complainant provided evidence that he suffered significant weight gain; an inability to sleep; nightmares; aggravation of physical injuries; stomach distress; change in personality; loss of enjoyment in life; withdrawal from family and friends; increased use of alcohol; lack of desire to socialize; isolation; bouts of anger. Hearing Transcript 498-514; 1008-1020. Complainant stated that he suffered from depression and began seeing a therapist twice per week until he could no longer afford the treatments. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 511. The record contains hearing testimony from a clinical psychologist who diagnosed Complainant as suffering from Major Depression as a result of the Agency's actions, and provided testimony stating that without counseling and medication Complainant's prognosis for recovery was only "fair." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 935-936. Complainant also provided testimony that the Agency's discrimination resulted in a deterioration of his relationship with his wife and daughter leading to separation and pending divorce and only being permitted to <span id="Page_1911"></span>see his youngest daughter every other weekend and holiday. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 509-510; 1018. The record further shows that these conditions began at the time of his resignation and are, to a large extent, ongoing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 514.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another constructive discharge case, <span class="Italic">Vaughn C. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120151396 (2016), the Commission increased an award of $20,000 to $125,000, where the complainant was subjected to six months of racially charged harassment, including threats of violence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant indicated he experienced increasing anxiety, difficulty concentrating, a loss of appetite, high blood pressure and severe headaches. He also noted that his physical and emotional relationship with his wife was negatively affected. Complainant also submitted documentation from his mental health counselor that indicated that he lost his motivation to work; felt anxious; developed insomnia; experienced a change in appetite and drinking resulting in a 15-20 pound weight gain; had difficulties with fatigue and focus; and had feelings of hopelessness. She also indicated that he became paranoid that the coworker would physically harm his family, even going to the extent of developing a "safety plan" in that eventuality.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award by an administrative judge of $120,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720050084 (2007), where the agency's discrimination in refusing the complainant assistance in loading and unloading his truck led to a permanent shoulder injury that disabled the employee for future work. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Moore</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ based her award of compensatory damages on the harm that complainant suffered. The AJ stated that complainant has suffered, and continues to suffer, significant physical pain, loss of health, emotional pain, mental anguish, loss of career opportunities, and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of retaliatory and discriminatory conduct for which the agency is liable. The AJ noted that complainant testified that his pain is chronic, he has not been helped by multiple surgeries, steroid injections have not helped, and he has become so depressed and nervous that he sought treatment by a psychiatrist. Complainant's orthopedist testified that the cause of complainant's shoulder injury and subsequent physical problems is the accident of February 26, 2003. The orthopedist further testified that complainant's shoulder has not improved despite surgery and injections of steroids and painkillers designed to reduce inflammation and stiffness. The AJ noted that in the orthopedist's August 26, 2004 report, complainant was reported as having "even more significant right shoulder burning pain and discomfort as well as tightness. It is interrupting his sleep. He essentially cannot use the arm for anything, but very small activities." Complainant's psychiatrist testified that complainant is in a vicious cycle of anxiety and depression caused by his ongoing orthopedic pain. The Commission finds that the AJ's award of $120,000.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Santiago v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (October 14, 1998) ($125,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages for a finding of sex discrimination and retaliation where complainant suffered depression and other emotional and mental disorders, and severe chest and stomach pains, digestive problems, and incidents of shortness of breath due to three years of verbal abuse by her supervisor); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951729 (July 29, 1998) ($100,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages awarded where complainant was subjected, on the basis of sex and in retaliation for prior protected EEO activity, to a hostile work environment that caused her to develop severe psychological injury, from which she was still suffering at the hearing), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 05981118 (Sept. 30, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Donita B. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120160410 (2017), the Commission similarly reiterated the effect of physical pain on a damages awards when it increased the agency's award by $25,000 (from $100,000 to $125,000) where the agency failed to account for complainant's physical pain brought on by the agency's denial of the complainant's need for accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency award of $12,000 in damages was increased by the Commission to $120,000 in <span class="Italic">Aponte v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120063532 (2008). In increasing the award, the Commission specifically found that the agency failed to take into account the severity and duration of the emotional distress that two nonselections caused the complainant. The Commission noted that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, we find that the evidence supports the conclusion that the second and third discriminatory non-selections, which occurred during the 1997-1998 time-frame, caused complainant to endure at least eight years of depression, anxiety, anger, shame, humiliation, marital strain, spiritual turmoil, sleep disturbance and headaches. We also find the record devoid of evidence to support the agency's conclusion that unrelated contributing stressors caused any part of complainant's emotional distress. Lastly, we note that the record does not support the conclusion that complainant suffered any emotional distress or medical condition prior to the 1997-1998 time-frame.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $120,000 in damages by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090050 (2013), where the agency's retaliation resulted in the complainant having panic attacks at work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the AJ properly determined that Complainant established a causal nexus between the harm and the discrimination. The record establishes that the Agency's discriminatory action was the proximate cause of her emotional and financial problems, including depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, panic attacks, social isolation, withdrawal from relationships, weight-gain, severe strains in his relationships with those close to her, and severe financial hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also approved reassignment to another facility as part of the remedy in that case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reduced a damage award of $210,000 by the administrative judge to $120,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100036 (2014), where the judge took into account a time period for which there was no finding of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, AJ2 considered the evidence and awarded Complainant $210,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. However, the AJ did not explain in any detail how he arrived at the amounts awarded to Complainant for each time period. The AJ specified in his bench decision that Complainant was entitled to compensatory damages in the amounts of $70,000 for the period of 2003-2004; $35,000 for 2004-2005; $70,000 for 2005-2006; and $35,000 for 2006-2007. AJ2 did not explain the reasoning for dividing the compensable period into these timeframes, nor did he support his determinations of the amounts awarded with citations to the specific evidence he felt warranted those awards. The record shows that Complainant had filed two subsequent EEO complaints for events that occurred in the 2005 and 2006 timeframe. These EEO complaints were the subject of a separate hearing also before AJ2, who found that Complainant had not established that he had been discriminated against. The Agency argued that the $70,000 awarded by AJ2 for harm suffered in 2005-2006 was in error because the worsening of Complainant's emotional state during that time frame was more attributable to the events which had been found not to be discriminatory than to his October 2003 assignment to the SBPS unit. The Agency also argued that Complainant attributed emotional distress he experienced in 2005 to the stress of his August 2005 EEO hearing, for which he cannot recover damages. The Agency further argued that Complainant had not established a link between the emotional distress he experienced in 2007 and the discriminatory reassignment in 2003, and that AJ2's award of $35,000 for distress in 2006-2007 was therefore unsupported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AJ2 cited Complainant's distress at having to give up his outside consulting employment with the YMCA in February 2004 when calculating the amount of non-pecuniary damages. The Agency argued that AJ2 had issued pre-hearing rulings which disallowed testimony and evidence regarding Complainant's loss of income from the YMCA work, but then contradicted those rulings by allowing testimony about the emotional impact of having to give up the consulting work. It argued that this unfairly prejudiced the Agency in defending its case. Finally, the Agency claimed that AJ2 awarded damages connected to the loss of the YMCA job based on his own assumptions. It cited AJ2's statement at hearing, "I mean, I think we all can relate if we all lost 40 percent of our income, how that would disrupt our personal lives. So that's why I allowed the testimony." It argued that AJ2 substituted his own feelings for evidence presented by Complainant as to how the loss of the second job affected his emotional well-being.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find AJ2's determination, that if Complainant had not been removed from the Automation unit in 2003, he would have likely remained there for the four years that he instead was transferred to other management positions, to be speculative and not supported by the record. The Agency argued in its brief that some of Complainant's emotional harm may have been attributable to other "work-related actions" in the intervening time period. It proffered that Complainant's reassignment to the SPBS unit in 2005, and his assignment to lesser supervisory-duties in January 2006, were each the subject of separate EEO complaints. Complainant did not prevail on those EEO complaints, nor is there a record of his having appealed the adverse findings to the Commission. Complainant was assigned back to Automation in September 2007, which is two months before the Commission issued its finding of discrimination in EEOC Appeal No. 0120060802 (Nov. 20, 2007), which is the basis for the award of compensatory damages at issue in this appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that AJ2's award of $210,000 is not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and that a non-pecuniary compensatory damages award of $120,000 is more appropriate in this case. At the hearing, Complainant argued that he was entitled to $120,000 in emotional pain and suffering. This amount takes into account the severity and duration of the harm sustained by Complainant by the Agency's discriminatory actions as well as the fact that, despite Complainant's pre-existing condition, the Agency's <span id="Page_1912"></span>discriminatory actions were the proximate cause of the majority of his emotional and physical harm during the relevant period of time. We also find that Complainant supported his claim for this specific amount through the evidence and testimony introduced at the hearing on damages. The award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, the product of passion or prejudice, or inconsistent with amounts the Commission has awarded in other cases where the discrimination caused depression and other adverse psychological and physical conditions. <span class="Italic">See Champion v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720090037 (March 10, 2010) ($125,000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered depression, anxiety, sleeplessness and required psychiatric treatment as a result of ongoing harassment for two years); <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110021 (Feb. 10, 2012) ($125,000 awarded in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where complainant suffered depression, anxiety, humiliation, severe emotional distress, physical pain, and sleeplessness); <span class="Italic">Auston v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112574 (July 19, 2012) ($100,000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where Complainant suffered anxiety, depression, lost appetite/weight, constant vomiting, ulcers, worsened insomnia, irritability, and repeated asthma attacks over a period of several years as a result of the Agency's failure to accommodate). Therefore, we find that Complainant should be awarded the amount of non-pecuniary damages that he requested and supported with evidence and testimony, namely, $120,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's challenge to an award of $120,000 by the administrative judge was denied by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720130028 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore turn our attention to the matter at hand, which was the AJ's award of "certain remedies." In the decision the AJ found Complainant was owed both pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages. In so finding, the AJ noted that Complainant credibly testified that she had a previous back injury, and also suffered from depression, both of which were alleviated when her back improved by 2009. However, the harassment caused these issues to resurface and Complainant reported feeling paranoid, anxious and depressed. Complainant suffered from insomnia, difficulty with marital relations and sought out medical help and counseling with the Agency's Employee Assistance Program. She recounts she was intimidated by KH and felt the only solution was to bid on a different tour than her husband. Accordingly, the AJ awarded $120,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency argues that this amount is excessive and not in line with Commission precedent, we disagree, and find the AJ's award was not overly excessive given the facts of this case. We find given the length of the distress (2009-2012), the award is supported by Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Fivecoat v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110035 (May 15, 2012) ($100,000 awarded as result of a discriminatory hostile work environment where Complainant experienced depression, digestive problems, sleep disturbances, crying spells, and episodic high blood pressure); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110036 (Mar. 13, 2012) ($125,000 awarded in 19-month harassment case where Complainant experienced anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep problems, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of self-esteem, damage to professional reputation, and withdrawal from relationships); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070015 (May 22, 2008) ($85,000 awarded as a result of a discriminatory hostile work environment that resulted in emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, health problems, anxiety, stress, depression, loss of self-esteem, and excessive fatigue); <span class="Italic">Morrison v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A50003 (Apr. 18, 2006) ($90,000 awarded in one-year harassment case where Complainant experienced depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and where Complainant's psychological trauma continued well past the date she resigned from the Agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01955684 (1998), the Commission awarded $125,000 in emotional distress damages where the emotional distress was severe and accompanied by physical symptoms. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Santiago</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Due to emotional distress, appellant had depression, anxiety, paranoia, confusion, moodiness, insomnia, social withdrawal, tearfulness, fatigue, loss of libido, loss of self-esteem, and chest and stomach pains, digestive problems, and incidents of shortness of breath. Medical evidence in the record indicates the chest and stomach pains, and digestive problems were quite severe. Appellant repeatedly sought medical treatment for these problems, including an EGD after she was removed in 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that the agency's discriminatory conduct from November 21, 1991 through appellant's removal resulted in severe psychological injury which caused substantial physical discomfort, and the awards the Commission has made in similar cases, we find that appellant is entitled to nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $125,000. This takes into account all of appellant's emotional and physical problems as well as the fact that as a result of digestive system problems caused by the agency's discrimination, she underwent an EGD, an invasive diagnostic procedure involving a scope.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $125,000 was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Anvari v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01996155 (2002), where the complainant suffered from depression that required treatment over a number of years. The Commission also noted that the discriminatory investigation of the complainant had damaged his professional reputation and standing at the agency. The Commission reaffirmed the award in <span class="Italic">Anvari v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05A20546 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A10095 (2002), the Commission reduced the award of an administrative judge from $250,000 to $125,000 where the judge considered the duration and egregiousness of the harassing conduct instead of relying solely on the complainant's duress:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Limiting the period of consideration to events between November 21, 1991 and 1995, we find that the harm suffered by complainant would have been of the same serious nature given 4 years of harassment or 15 years of harassment. Complainant provided medical documentation to support the conclusion that he has been emotionally harmed. He suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), extreme stress, nightmares, depression, sexual dysfunction, as well as fear of homosexuals or those who appear to be homosexual. Complainant further states his marriage failed as a direct result of harassment. Complainant's doctor listed numerous medications complainant is prescribed for the various physical effects, including "intense autonomic symptoms especially of an overwhelming need to vomit as well as headaches that often be quite troublesome," this conduct has caused. Moreover, complainant asserts that, while he is making progress in therapy, he will probably require it for the rest of his life. Given the severity of the harm suffered, we find this assertion to be credible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As compensation for emotional distress, the Commission has awarded $80,000 where harassment resulted in complainant being diagnosed with <span class="Italic">Atypical Paranoid Disorder. See Cook v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950027 (July 17, 1998). In <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997), where a complainant sustained severe psychological injury that affected her for four years and was likely to affect her for the foreseeable future as a result of ongoing sexual harassment, the Commission awarded $100,000. Also, in <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (October 14, 1998), we awarded complainant $125,000 where sex and age-based discrimination resulted in depression and other emotional and mental disorders, as well as several physical problems, including severe chest and stomach pains, digestive problems, and incidents of shortness of breath. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit awarded a plaintiff $200,000 where she experienced emotional and physical harm, including sleeplessness and depression<span class="Italic">. See Daskalea v. District of Columbia</span>, 343 U.S. App. D.C. 261; 227 F.3d 433 (August 8, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Herein, we find that the AJ made improper considerations in ordering the agency to pay $250,000 in compensatory damages. Namely, when quantifying complainant's harm, the AJ cited the duration and the egregious nature of the harassment. This is not proper under 42 U.S.C. 1981a. Non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions. <span class="Italic">See Memphis</span> <span class="Italic">Community School Dist. v. Stachura,</span> 477 U.S. 299, 311-12 (1986) (stating that compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case). Therefore, based on the observations of complainant's doctor, the evidence of harm sustained and the elapsed and expected period of such harm, we conclude complainant is entitled to $125,000 in compensatory damages. This amount considers complainant's diagnosis of PTSD, sexual dysfunction, the failure of his marriage and the lingering social phobias. The amount further considers that complainant will more likely than not continue to experience harm in the future. We find that $125,000 is an appropriate award for the emotional and physical harm complainant experiences now and will continue to experience. This award is similar to previous Commission awards where complainant's experience significant physical and mental harm, as noted above, and not monstrously excessive standing alone.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $125,000 in damages was considered appropriate where the supervisor's harassment spanned some 18 months and, during that time, the complainant was "routinely treated horribly..." In <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A13314 (2003), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, complainant requested $500,000 in non-pecuniary "pain and suffering" damages. Complainant indicated that the harassment she endured caused her intense and permanent physical and emotional harm. In a statement provided to the agency, complainant stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I know the reason my body is the way it is now is because [Supervisor] would not let me get any rest and he kept me in a constant state of stress at work and at home which made my whole body hurt much worse than it ever had before..... I have had physical problems and <span id="Page_1913"></span>body pain all my life and through a positive and active li[f]e I have always managed [to] deal with the physical difficulties and pain my body has presented me. I have always been able to work.... In most instances I have been able to ignore my physical handicaps by using them to help me learn to be more compassionate for other people....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[But] I would come home from a day of working with [Supervisor] and be exhausted. I would try to sleep and he would call and wake me up. I would get so tired I couldn't sleep and the pain would get so bad because I was so tired I couldn't sleep from the pain. It just became an ever-worsening cycle. I had hoped when [Supervisor] left that I would get better, but by then my body was too far gone. I kept working hoping to see an improvement, but it never happened. It took me finally going on leave and applying for disability retirement to stop the down hill slide. As long as I don't do much of anything and avoid stressful situations I am pretty stable with even some small improvement, but the minute I get tired or stressed...I have a fibromyalgia flare up that puts me right back in bed for days....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I provided copies of letters and information from books to [Supervisor] informing him that stress made me worse, and unfortunately his response seemed to be to increase the level of stress not reduce it. I came to understand he was truly trying to drive me from the organization and was using my disability as a way to accomplish it.... In the end it didn't make any difference what his reason was, or why he harassed me, he just did. The tension and stress [were] unbearable for me....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I don't think there is any question I would have been able to continue working, as I had stated I was able to work before the impact of the stress on my body and I think without the stress the fibromyalgia may never have occurred or at the most been a mild case.... [Now] [m]y financial credit is in jeopardy due to the loss of my income.... I have had to borrow money from my thrift savings to pay my bills until my disability retirement is approved.... I don't have any professional standing left; I don't have a job. My self image as someone who has always been able to take care of themselves has been destroyed. The mental anguish shows up in nightmares and fear. My health is gone, and the level of severity to my enjoyment of life is shown in all the things I can't do anymore.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's Statement (Oct. 3, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also told the agency that (among other things) she now cannot walk, sit, stand, lay, or be hugged without pain, participate in church activities, remember things or think like she used to, paint and draw like she used to, sleep without bad dreams, lift her granddaughter, be intimate with a man, or travel any distance without exhaustion<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In her appeal brief, complainant also indicated that one doctor diagnosed her with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome stemming from the supervisory harassment, and that she has been awarded worker's compensation on this basis, as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another of her physicians explained that complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[is] overwhelmed by medical symptoms, chronic pain, nightmares, and financial stress.... [She] cannot climb stairs.... She is using a cane and her movement is noticeably restricted. Her affect is blunted and she reports anxiety and exhaustion from her pain.... [She] has grief issues around the loss of her health, her career, her inability to stand, sit or walk for any length, her inability to use her hands, especially for doing her artwork. Her fibromyalgia is observably disabling and she describes acute pain in her back and shoulders. [Her] symptoms include social isolation and an inadequate support system, difficulty concentrating and completing simply daily tasks. She has difficulty remembering words and often feels "tongue tied." Her sleep is disturbed and she reports having nightmares, especially relating to her abusive work situation.... She describes feeling helpless and aware that her life is unmanageable in every aspect. [She] is fearful of accessing feelings because when she recalls her supervisor's abusive behavior, she becomes so angry she feels sick....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Doctor's Statement (Oct. 6, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Non-pecuniary losses for emotional and physical harm such as this "are more difficult to prove than pecuniary losses," and "there are no definitive rules governing the amounts to be awarded." Damages Guidance, at 6, 8; <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 6 (noting that "[e]motional harm will not be presumed simply because the complaining party is a victim of discrimination," and that "[t]he existence, nature, and severity of emotional harm must be proved"). The agency awarded complainant $10,000 in non-pecuniary damages, reasoning that much of complainant's troubles were not caused by Supervisor's conduct, specifically. We have been convinced that Supervisor inflicted undeniable physical and emotional pain and suffering on complainant for the 18 months she was under his supervision. We therefore think the agency's award was too low. <span class="Italic">Cf. id.</span> at 6 (explaining that "if a complaining party had preexisting emotional difficulties and [her] mental health deteriorates as a result of the discriminatory conduct, the additional harm may be attributed to the" agency). However, given complainant's pre-existing medical condition--and the significant uncertainty over whether the harassment compelled complainant's retirement, and our doubt that the agency's illegal actions should be deemed the cause of all of complainant's past, present, and future pain and suffering--we believe $500,000 would be too high. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 6, 7 (stating that "[a]n award for emotional harm is warranted only if there is sufficient causal connection between the respondent's illegal actions and the complaining party's injury," that "[t]he discriminatory act or conduct must be the cause of the emotional harm," and that "where a complaining party's emotional harm is due in part to personal difficulties, which were not caused or exacerbated by the discriminatory conduct, the employer is liable only for the harm resulting from the discriminatory conduct").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we believe an award of $125,000 in non-pecuniary damages is fair and appropriate here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (Oct. 14, 1998) (where we awarded a complainant $125,000 for somewhat similar supervisory harassment that resulted in ongoing depression, social withdrawal, recurring nightmares and memories of harassment, anxiety, and confusion, as well as severe physical problems, including severe chest and stomach pains, digestive problems, and incidents of shortness of breath); and <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A10095 (Aug. 30, 2002) (where we awarded $125,000 to a complainant who suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, nightmares, depression, and sexual dsyfunction [sic] as a result of illegal agency discrimination); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Teal v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01991097 (July 26, 2000) (where we awarded $95,000 to a complainant who endured 11 months of intimidation, disparaging and demeaning treatment, and verbal abuse from her supervisor, inflicting severe emotional distress and anxiety and causing her to seek medical attention, file a claim for workers compensation, and use extensive sick leave and leave without pay). This figure takes into account the nature, severity, and duration of complainant's suffering, is consistent with other non-pecuniary compensatory damages awards given in similar cases, and is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone or derived from passion or prejudice.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Edie R. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120160784 (2018), argued that not only should the duration of the harm be considered but also the duration of the resulting injury. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Edie R.</span> agreed, but held that the $125,000 award was appropriate under the circumstances of the case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ awarded Complainant $125.000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages. The AJ primarily relied upon Complainant's hearing testimony and that of her psychotherapist. Complainant suffered from PTSD and depression. She experienced panic attacks, nightmares, avoidant behavior and crying.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant argues that the award does not reflect the severity and duration of her injuries. Complainant notes that it has been more than four years since she was subjected to the hostile work environment but that she still suffers from "PTSD and the multiple symptoms associated with that condition." According to Complainant, while the AJ acknowledged that duration of harm should be considered, the AJ did not acknowledge that Complainant's injuries have lasted for years. Complainant asserts that the AJ also neglected to refer to the physical component of the harassment when ascertaining the amount to award. Complainant contends that in prior Commission cases similar to Complainant's situation have awarded $200,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the evidence in light of the Commission's cases regarding non-pecuniary damages awarded for emotional harm, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's award of $125,000. We find that the amount is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with Commission precedent. Because of its implementation of the AJ's decision and damages award, the Agency also found the amount to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other cases, the Commission has awarded similar amounts for emotional harm such as anxiety, depression, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleeplessness, damage to professional reputation, and withdrawal from relationships. <span class="Italic">See Brown-Fleming v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667 (Oct. 28, 2010) ($150.000 awarded in termination case where complainant suffered from depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentration, disassociation, crying spells, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, and nightmares); <span class="Italic">Champion v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720090037 (Mar. 10, 2010) ($125,000 awarded in two-year harassment case where complainant suffered from depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and required psychiatric treatment); <span class="Italic">Morrison v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A50003 (Apr. 18, 2006) ($90,000 awarded in one-year harassment case where complainant suffered from depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and where complainant's psychological trauma continued well past the date she resigned from the agency); <span class="Italic">Teal v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. <span id="Page_1914"></span>01991097 (July 26, 2000) ($95,000 awarded in 11-month harassment case where complainant suffered severe emotional distress and anxiety, sought medical attention, and used extensive sick leave).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, considering the nature, duration, and severity of Complainant's emotional harm and with reference to damage awards reached in comparable cases, we find proper the AJ's award of $125,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the psychological harm was severe and the need for treatment would extend another two years or so, the Commission awarded $125,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Hendley v. Attorney General</span>, 01A20977 (2003), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant in her affidavit statements credibly recounted that she had an initial severe reaction to the agency's decision to discipline her for the incidents of sexual harassment that she reported to the agency in October 1994. Prior to that time she had been seeing a psychiatrist for the emotional harm from the sexual assault just months before, but was improving and was ready to return to work. She stated she shook with anger and pain became extremely distraught and filled with anxiety. Complainant stated she cried uncontrollably for long periods of time and she was filled with despair and depression. This continued for the next six years. Complainant stated that she became fearful and paranoid that prison officials would come to her house and attack her, she became anti-social, developed an eating disorder, experienced sleeplessness and nightmares. Her professional life suffered because she stated she was unable to return to work in her chosen field of law enforcement. She felt "deeply humiliated and embarrassed" because the agency concluded that she was responsible for the behavior about which she complained. Complainant also described a deterioration in family relationships which her husband corroborated in his affidavit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's husband confirmed that complainant had an initial hysterical reaction when she received the proposed suspension and became further distraught when she received the final decision to suspend her. He stated that for months, complainant cried often without notice, she had difficulty sleeping and nightmares and she would "shut down" and withdraw from the family. He corroborated that complainant developed an eating disorder and that their marriage and family suffered. He also confirmed complainant's fear of returning to work at the Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's treating psychiatrist, Dr. K initially treated her beginning in March 1994 through August 1996. He diagnosed complainant with severe Bipolar Disorder and Depressive Disorder with severe emotional outbursts of anger. He confirmed that she had sleep disorders, headaches initially related to the inappropriate sexual advances towards her in the workplace. Dr. K reported that complainant was improving but her condition drastically declined after she received the disciplinary action related to the incidents of sexual harassment. He stated that complainant's difficulties with sleeping, paranoia and eating disorders reoccurred as a result. Dr. K stated that based on his professional experience and training, he expected complainant to be unable to maintain a consistent long-term employment status and that he expected her to need continued treatment most likely for the remainder of her life.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted the statement of a psychotherapist who stated her treatment of complainant began in January 2001. She stated that complainant's need for continued psychotherapy was due at least in part to the agency's administrative actions taken against her in 1994. Complainant began treating with a new psychiatrist in 2001 whose diagnosis was consistent with her first psychiatrist. He stated that at that time her panic attacks and depressive symptoms were no longer evidence but that she continued to struggle with other aspects of a major depressive disorder. He detailed that complainant would benefit from psychotherapy for an additional two years and that she continued to take medication for sleep and anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the AJ found that the agency's investigation of the complainant's claim of sexual harassment was motivated by reprisal and sex discrimination because it was biased against complainant. She further found that the suspension issued as result of the investigation likely would "substantially contribute to the worsening of complainant's pre-existing mental condition." The AJ found sufficient nexus between the discriminatory action and the psychological harm that complainant alleged she suffered. The AJ's findings are supported by complainant's statements, her treating psychiatrists and that of her husband.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In similar cases involving long term emotional harm, some involving aggravation of a pre-existing condition, we have found that an award of substantial non-pecuniary damages is appropriate<span class="Italic">. Cleland v. Department of Veterans' Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970546 (8/9/00) (Award of $125,000 in non-pecuniary damages based on physical and emotional harm for 5 years and expected to continue into the indefinite future); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No 01951729 (7/29/98) ($100,000 awarded based on post traumatic stress disorder aggravation of mental condition but condition directly caused by discrimination); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (4/29/97) ($100,000 awarded for 4 years of psychological harm, ongoing depression and where complainant is unable to work); <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (11/13/95) ($50,000 award for aggravation of a pre-existing injury with effects for 7 years.). In this case, complainant's harm began when she received notice of a proposed suspension in October 1994. Seven years later, complainant has continued to receive treatment in the form of psychotherapy and medication with two additional years being recommended. In addition, we consider the fact that complainant's career pursuits have been diminished as indicated by her statement and that of her physician.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contests that complainant should receive any substantial amount because it characterizes the disciplinary action as relatively "minor" and that it should only be responsible for that harm not related to her pre-existing condition. However, the agency did not submit any medical documentation which disputes complainant's physician's assessment. Furthermore, the record reflects that the agency's independent medical examinations (IME) concurred in the assessment that complainant should not return to work at the Bureau of Prisons due to her mental condition. The agency's IME stated that "a full recovery from Unipolar Disorder and Personality Disorder is not likely within the next several years." Additionally, the agency did not sufficiently document the extent of complainant's pre-existing condition for which she received a diagnosis or medical treatment. The record only discloses that complainant received treatment for major depressive disorder beginning in 1994 just prior to the onset of the agency's investigation. Therefore, based on the foregoing the Commission awards $125,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">George v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30079.txt">07A30079</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $125,000 in damages where the discrimination exacerbated the complainant's rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The Commission in <span class="Italic">George</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's rheumatologist (Rl) testified that prior to the agency's discriminatory conduct, complainant's rheumatoid arthritis had been "rocking along. It was still inflamed, but it was easier to control." Rl stated that complainant's rheumatoid arthritis and lupus worsened substantially as a result of the agency's discriminatory conduct. Rl explained that these auto-immune diseases are directly affected by stress. Rl further asserted that complainant suffered from depression and anxiety due to the worsening of her conditions. Rl additionally stated that complainant will need to receive aggressive treatment (i.e. chemotherapy) indefinitely, and possibly for the remainder of her life. Rl additionally stated that due to the worsening of complainant's condition, complainant would certainly not be able to have children with her husband. Complainant's husband (H1) also provided testimony that there was a marked difference in complainant's life as a result of the discriminatory harassment. H1 testified that complainant became emotionally destroyed; she did not want to go anywhere, her self-confidence was undermined, and her relationship with her stepson was affected. Additionally, H1 noted that due to the severity of her arthritis, complainant needed help dressing herself and buttoning her clothes.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720060003 (2007), the Commission approved an award of $125,000 where the complainant suffered severe emotional and physical distress as the result of prolonged sexual harassment. On the emotional front, the complainant suffered from fear, stress, depression and loss of self-esteem. Physical manifestations of the harm included weight fluctuations, insomnia, headaches and a stress-induced jaw disorder. However, in the same case, the Commission overturned an award of slightly more than $20,000 in pecuniary damages where the medical evidence did not establish causation between the medical expenses and the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed a damage award of $125,000 by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Champion v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090037 (2010), where the complainant suffered from major depressive disorder, anxiety order and panic disorder as the result of discrimination. The conditions required psychiatric treatment and medication and were accompanied by a number of physical symptoms, such as back pain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even in the absence of medical evidence, the Commission upheld an award of $125,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Duran v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720100042 (2011). Although the decision does not contain a detailed description of the complainant's harm, the Commission did note that the complainant was demoted and placed on administrative leave for a two-year period while the agency was allegedly investigating his use of "sensitive" documents as evidence in a nonselection case. The Commission also noted that the agency's actions significantly harmed the complainant's career advancement at the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also upheld an award of $125,000 in <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720110021 (2012), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has reviewed the entire record, including all submissions from Complainant's counsel. Taking into account the evidence submitted by Complainant, including her testimony and statements from her <span id="Page_1915"></span>doctor, family members, and co-workers regarding her humiliation, severe emotional distress. physical pain, and sleeplessness, the Commission finds the AJ's award of $125,000 to be appropriate. This amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Champion v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720090037 (Mar. 10, 2010) ($125.000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and required psychiatric treatment as a result of ongoing harassment for two years);<span class="Italic"> Brown-Fleming v. Dept of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120082667 (Oct. 28, 2010) ($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant experienced anxiety, stress, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, disassociation, social isolation, damage to her professional reputation, withdrawal from relationships, and nightmares because of retaliation).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0720110036 (2012), the Commission upheld an award of $125,000 by the administrative judge explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ primarily relied on testimony from Complainant, her License Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), her husband (H1), and E1 as objective evidence for awarding $125,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages for severe emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that she was embarrassed, humiliated, felt powerless, lacked confidence, and excessively thought about work. In addition, Complainant testified, "I have not returned to the Sherry I <span class="Italic">was before" and "I don't know if that Sherry will ever come back.</span>"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">LCSW testified that she diagnosed and treated Complainant for acute stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, LCSW testified about Complainant's excessive crying, excessive sleeping, difficulty concentrating, feelings of fearfulness and helplessness, intrusive thoughts, guilt, hypervigilance, and paranoia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">H1 testified that, since 2005, he had "direct observations of [his] wife going downhill." Specifically, H1 testified that Complainant lost interest in most things, lacked trust in people, became withdrawn from people (including family), did not socialize, would not make friends, and was angry, very frustrated, and fearful. In addition, H1 testified that Complainant experienced excessive crying, hair loss, and acid reflux. Further, H1 testified that Complainant experienced and still experiences intimacy issues with him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E1 testified that she saw Complainant's health deteriorate before her eyes and witnessed Complainant's excessive crying, shaking, and nervousness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency on appeal did not specifically dispute any of the testimony pertaining to damages, but instead argued that the alleged harm Complainant suffered did not warrant a $125,000 award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our review of the evidence in light of the Commission's cases regarding non-pecuniary damages awarded for emotional harm, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's award of $125,000. We find that the amount is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with Commission precedent. Although the Agency argued that the award was excessive, it did not suggest a lesser amount that might be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $55,000 by the administrative judge to $125,000 where the judge determined that the harassment lasted six months, but the Commission determined it lasted four years. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720130035 (2015), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the entire record, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the conclusion that Complainant is entitled to compensatory damages for emotional distress and other non-pecuniary harm. Additionally, we find that AJ2 erred when he limited the damages to a six-month period because, as we have found above, the timeframe during which the harassment occurred was from February 2005 through January 2009, which is almost four years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was first diagnosed with depression in 2005. A report from Complainant's psychologist dated March 21, 2006, noted that, as a result of Complainant's workplace conflicts, Complainant tested in the "severe" range of the depression and anxiety scales. She diagnosed him with "acute stress disorder."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In July 2008, Complainant began experiencing symptoms of diabetes. His primary care physician excused him from work and stated that Complainant was receiving treatment for "exacerbation of diabetes due to work-related stress." Complainant was proscribed several medications to treat the diabetes. The record reflects that there was a history of diabetes in Complainant's family. At the hearing on damages Complainant admitted into evidence several scientific articles linking severe stress to the onset of diabetes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In September 2008 Complainant was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which the psychologist attributed to Complainant's hostile work environment. Complainant was prescribed psychotropic drugs such as Ativan, Lorazapan, Effexor and Elavil.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that, because of the workplace harassment, he frequently experienced panic or anxiety attacks, and during these attacks was bombarded with shortness of breath, blurry vision, increased heart rate, chest pains, and sweating. Complainant testified to having regular bouts of vomiting and diarrhea. Complainant testified that his anxiety would often result in debilitating headaches, which he continues to experience even in his new position at FAA. Complainant stated that he rapidly gained 50 pounds in 2008 because of all of the stress from the Agency's harassment. Complainant also testified that he suffered from low self-esteem and still lacks the ability to concentrate, which impacts his performance at work and damages his personal relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also stated that he suffered from chronic nightmares at least three to four times a week. Complainant often dreamed that Agency officials were telling lies about him, arresting him, and holding a gun to his head while laughing. The nightmares were so severe that it impacted the sleep of Complainant's wife, who had to move out of the master bedroom in order to sleep. Complainant's nightmares were still ongoing at the time of the hearing on damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that the Agency's harassment severely damaged his professional reputation. Complainant stated that he was once highly regarded within the Agency, but that the allegation that Complainant burglarized the facility destroyed his professional reputation. Complainant stated that his coworkers began to shun him. Complainant stated that the Agency's retaliation also caused him to second-guess himself as a worker, and caused him to question his ability to fulfill his role as the primary breadwinner of his family.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that his lowest moment was when he was being interrogated in the Reno Police Department as a primary suspect in the burglary of the Agency's facility. Complainant testified that this experience made him realize that not only could the Agency force him out of his job, but it could also tear him away from his family.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that the Agency's retaliation caused him to become paranoid, and he even feared that his new coworkers and supervisors would retaliate against him. For example, at his new position at FAA, Complainant stated that he experienced extreme anxiety and flashbacks where he relived the harassment from the Agency, especially when his new coworkers and supervisors made eye contact with him. Complainant stated that the flashbacks occured as frequently as every few days. AJ2 found that the Agency's discriminatory acts were responsible for Complainant's feelings that persisted even during the hearing on damages, such as Complainant being consumed by feelings of paranoia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife testified that she feared that Complainant would commit suicide after he was taken in for questioning at the Reno Police Department. Complainant corroborated this when he testified that he considered suicide on numerous occasions during the time period of the harassment. Complainant's wife stated that during the Agency's harassment Complainant often feared for his life, and believed that if he and his family did not flee Reno they would be in danger because the Agency would not give up until they destroyed him. Complainant testified that his supervisors had run a "campaign of terror" against him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was described by his wife as having once been an extremely social man who organized neighborhood barbecues, who because of the Agency's retaliation began to withdraw from his friends and isolate himself from his coworkers. Complainant's wife testified that they even stopped going out to eat because his anxiety was so severe that he would have severe digestive problems right after he ate, making it difficult to leave the home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife testified that the Agency's retaliatory actions brought their marriage to the brink of divorce and the strain on their relationship continued at the time of the hearing on damages. She stated that Complainant is a "broken man" and their relationship transformed from a relationship between a wife and husband to a relationship between a therapist and a patient. Complainant's wife stated that she only remains married to Complainant because of their daughter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife stated that Complainant and his daughter once enjoyed a close bond, but that their relationship deteriorated because of Complainant's inability to care for and interact with his daughter due to the physical and emotional suffering from the Agency's harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, we find an award of $125,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, and the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060003 (June 18, 2007) <span id="Page_1916"></span>($125,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where Agency's harassment resulted in complainant suffering from emotional and physical distress, including stress, fear, depression, loss of self esteem, insomnia, headaches, weight fluctuations, and a stress induced jaw disorder); <span class="Italic">George v. Dep't of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30079 (July 21, 2004) ($125,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where agency's reprisal and sex-based harassment resulted in the worsening of complainant's physical conditions, depression, and anxiety; complainant's testimony supported by testimony of complainant's husband who said that complainant was a different person, was emotionally destroyed, did not want to leave the house, and lost self confidence); <span class="Italic">Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050084 (March 6, 2007) ($120,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded where agency's race and reprisal discrimination resulted in complainant suffering from physical and emotional pain; complainant's psychiatrist testified that complainant was in serious cycle of depression and anxiety as result of agency's conduct). Accordingly, we conclude that an award of $125,000 is appropriate to compensate Complainant for the physical and emotional harm he suffered as a result of the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission <span class="italic">Felipa A. v. Postmaster General,</span> 2022000547 (2022), upheld an award of $125,000 where the complainant's supervisor was found to have made ongoing insensitive sexist and racist comments which resulted in the complainant's constant fear of physical harm and reprisal from her supervisor, anxiety, and the complainant began to self-medicate with alcohol in order to cope with her symptoms.</p></section>
