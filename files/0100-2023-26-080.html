<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-78"><span class="space">5.</span> Changes to Manner of Work, Work Assignments, Duties, and Performance Assessments</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Shah v. Department of Interior</span>, 01820148 (1983), the employee prevailed by showing that he was required to submit weekly progress reports--a requirement that was not imposed until after he engaged in the protected activity of filing an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720120040 (2013), the Commission found that proximity in time between the protected activity and the adverse treatment combined with a number of other factors, including witness credibility, established pretext:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant engaged in protected EEO activity when she filed numerous EEO complaints, the most recent on April 28, 2009. Further, Complainant's management officials were aware of her protected activity, and she was subjected to adverse actions when she was given increased assignments and issued discipline for violating the Agency's leave policy. Additionally, the most recent previous EEO complaint was being processed while these adverse actions occurred, and as a result Complainant established that a temporal nexus existed. Therefore, we agree with the AJ that Complainant established her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation for prior protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. The Agency asserted that Complainant was not discriminated against when she was assigned duties because those duties were part of her position description. Additionally, the Agency asserted that disciplining Complainant was appropriate because she violated the Agency's leave program when she did not request leave for her absences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the final step in the analysis, the inquiry moves to a consideration of whether Complainant carried her burden to demonstrate pretext. In order to prevail on her claim of discrimination, Complainant must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's articulated reason was a pretext for discrimination. Complainant can do this by showing that the Agency's explanation is unworthy of credence and that its actions were influenced by legally impermissible criteria, i.e., <span class="Italic">animus</span> towards Complainant because of her prior protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that Complainant established that the Agency's reasons for giving her increased duties were pretext for discrimination. The record establishes that after Complainant filed her previous EEO complaint, her supervisors (including her team lead) increased her work load. On appeal the Agency asserts that this was not evidence of retaliation because the duties she was assigned were part of her job description. However, the record supports the AJ's conclusions that this was retaliatory not necessarily because she was given duties outside of her position description, but because the volume of her work duties increased after she filed an EEO complaint, she was given short deadlines to complete her work, she was denied the assistance of her coworkers, and she was given assignments while she was in training or assisting a soldier which made it difficult for her to complete the assignments in a timely manner. The record makes it clear that there is a correlation between her increase in workload and her prior protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that Complainant established that the Agency's reasons for disciplining her for violating the leave policy were pretext for discrimination. The record establishes on July 21, 2010, Complainant was issued a Letter of Reprimand (LOR) for failing to call in to request leave when she was out sick in January 27 through February 2, 2010. The record contains an email that Complainant sent to her supervisor on January 26, 2010, in which she informed her supervisor that she would be having a medical procedure the next day and will be out for the rest of the week and will return when she is approved to return to work by her doctor. Complainant returned to work on February 3, 2010, and submitted her leave paperwork around noon that day. The AJ found it suspicious that the Agency did not issue the LOR until six months after the incident and soon after she engaged in prior protected EEO activity. Additionally, the record supports the AJ's finding that the management officials did not discipline other employees for similar incidents related to leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ stated that based upon a close examination of the responsible management official's tone, demeanor, and disposition he determined that their testimony lacked credibility because it "strained credulity, was implausible, and contradicted the written record." There is nothing in the record that justifies the second guessing of the AJ's credibility determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we note that it is troubling that Complainant's supervisor instructed Complainant that she would need to take annual leave to file an EEO complaint. While the Agency asserts on appeal that this would not have a chilling effect on the EEO process because ultimately Complainant was not required to use leave, we find that the comment itself would have an obvious chilling effect on the EEO process and reasonably would deter Complainant and others from engaging in protected EEO activity. As a result, we find that Complainant established that she was subjected to reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, in <span class="Italic">Jeramy R. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120132089 (2015), the Commission found that the complainant proved pretext for retaliation where the negative comments on the complainant's cooperation and work performance did not arise until after the supervisors became aware of his protected activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interactions With Complainant Subsequent to His Complaint</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the incidents involving the alleged personality conflicts with Complainant started only subsequent to his report of S1 and S2's conduct in May 2010. A number of employees testified to the fact that the harsh everyday conduct against Complainant only commenced after he made the May 2010 complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Deputy Principal Officer, Foreign Service Officer (E5), testified that when S1 and S2 learned that their alleged discriminatory conduct had been reported, "they were upset, which resulted in discriminatory and retaliatory treatment toward [Complainant]." E5 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-15, p. 37. E5 attested that staff witnessed comments referencing Complainant as a troublemaker, who was disloyal, untrustworthy and dishonest." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. E5 also testified that "it became clear that [S1] and [S2], upon learning that their conduct had been reported by [Complainant], became preoccupied with the reports of their abusive treatment of female staff...they were extremely upset and [Complainant's] time at the Embassy became progressively worse under their leadership up until the time that I left." E5 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-15, p. 388.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1530"></span>E4 also testified that when Complainant challenged management's treatment of women, he was punished as a result. E4 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-14, p. 36. E1 testified that after management became aware of who complained about their actions, they spoke negatively to Complainant. E1 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-7, p. 28. E2 testified to the fact that management treated Complainant badly only after his May 2010 complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> E2 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-8. Specifically, E2 indicated that following S2's trip to Washington DC to address Complainant's allegations, the negative comments and treatment of Complainant became more hostile. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 29. A Senior Attorney (E6), testified that S1 and S2 treated Complainant as though he had "snitched" on them. E6 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-9, p. 30. Further, E6 had a meeting with S3, and indicated that S3 told her S2 said his biggest mistake was hiring Complainant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 30.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E3 testified that S2 approached her at an Embassy reception and during their conversation S2 stated that Complainant had filed a complaint against him, but that she "shouldn't take his complaint seriously." E3 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-13, p. 35. S2 allegedly stated to E3 that Complainant "had exaggerated and shown poor judgment when submitting the EEO complaint." E3 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-13, p. 376. E3 also indicated that while she witnessed Complainant being cut off from work issues and ignored by management once he began supporting the women in the office, management's treatment of Complainant became increasingly bad after May 2010, as relayed to her by colleagues and friends still working at the OROLC. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at p. 374. E3 indicated that Complainant's EEO activity, presumably the complaint that he made in May 2010, "is the only reason for management's mistreatment of him...[Complainant] was well known as a committed, high performing, staff member and the only potential black mark against his name was the EEO activity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at p. 375.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Issues With Complainant's Work Product Subsequent to His Complaint</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 and S2 also started to identify issues with Complainant's work subsequent to his May 2010 complaint, when there were no issues and Complainant was regarded as an outstanding employee prior to his complaint. For example, S2 testified that from January to May 2010, [Complainant] impressed me as a generally good and loyal worker..." S2 Interrogatory, ROI, p. 168. S2 noted that he began to have issues with Complainant's written work product. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. S2 indicated that "in the latter part of the January-May period, [S1] informed me that he was unhappy with [Complainant's] written work product, and that [Complainant] was becoming increasingly difficult to manage." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the overwhelming consensus of the OROLC that Complainant was an outstanding attorney, S1 maintains in his testimony that Complainant had issues with his work. Apparently, S1 and S2 communicated with the new Rule of Law Coordinator (S4), who replaced S2, that S1 and S2 did not think Complainant "performed well during his Iraq deployment." S4 Interrogatory, ROI, p. 245. S4 indicated that he "did not afford any weight to their assessments of [Complainant's] work, as [he] had also heard good things, and [he] believed [S1] and [S2's] views were based in large part on personality conflicts rather than work product." S4 Interrogatory, ROI, p. 247. S4 indicated that a number of other attorneys told him that [Complainant's] work performance was outstanding, which had more impact. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at p. 21.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other evidence in the record evinces that Complainant produced outstanding work, further discrediting the testimony of S1 and S2 that Complainant's work product had issues which resulted in disagreements. For example, one former employee of the OROLC and the Agency, a Reporting Office and Executive Assistant (E7), testified that "colleagues and management-level staff outside the ROLC office considered [Complainant's] work product beyond reproach." E7 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-6, p. 26. Further, E7 indicated that "[S1] and [S2] permitted their personal dislike of [Complainant] to color their impressions of his work product." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant's 2008 and 2009 performance appraisals, issued from a different division of the Agency, also discredit S1 and S2's indications that there were issues with Complainant's written work product. For example, Complainant's annual performance evaluation issued in August 2009 states that as we have noted in past performance appraisals, it is difficult to find a sufficient number of superlatives to characterize [Complainant's] continuously outstanding contributions to the mission of the...Department of Justice." ROI, p. 424. Similarly, Complainant's evaluation issued in August 2010, encompassing the detail at the OROLC, makes no mention of issues with Complainant's work product and similarly states that Complainant's contributions to the Agency are "unsurpassed." ROI, p. 433.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, even though S1 and S2 indicated that there were issues with Complainant's written work product, a contention which the record demonstrates was opposed by both co-workers and other managers, Complainant was given more responsibilities in the form of another assignment with the Office of Provincial Affairs. <span class="Italic">See for example</span>, S1 Interrogatory, ROI, p. 211. If Complainant was not successful in performing the duties he already had with the OROLC, such as not meeting his supervisor's standards for written work product, it is unclear why S1 and S2 thought that giving Complainant additional work or a new assignment was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Management's Comments About Complainant</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 and S2 made a number of disparaging comments about Complainant, the substance of which is clearly controverted by the record. S4 reported that "[S1] and [S2] had difficulties with [Complainant] and did not think he had performed well during his Iraq deployment." S4 Interrogatory, ROI, p. 245. S4 further explained that they thought Complainant was not a "productive member of OROLC." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 245. E1 testified that S2 stated to her that "he'd be happy if [Complainant] would leave the office." E1 Interrogatory, ROI, p. 296. E2 testified that E4 related to her that Complainant was "incompetent." E2 Interrogatory, ROI, Tab D-8, p. 311.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent S1 and S2 contend that Complainant was disrespectful toward them, other employees rebut this contention in testifying that Complainant would "never be disrespectful" but that there were instances where S1 was "very harsh on [Complainant]. E6 Interrogatory, Tab D-9, ROI, p. 324. E6 also testified that S4 told her S2 indicated "[S4's] biggest mistake in helping the Rule of Law Office was hiring [Complainant]..." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at p. 336.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The comments made by S1 and S2 go beyond merely commenting on Complainant's work product or any personnel issues they assert they have had with Complainant. Similarly, the record does not support a conclusion that all of the instances of alleged misunderstanding was due to alleged personality conflicts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The entirety of the circumstances which include a difference in treatment of Complainant directly following his EEO activity, the non-credible assertion that Complainant's work product had issues, and the comments made about Complainant which go beyond his work product or personnel issues, strongly indicate that the Agency's non-discriminatory reason is pretext for discrimination. Further, the record does not support the conclusion that the adverse actions were due to some other nondiscriminatory reason not articulated by the Agency. Therefore, Complainant proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was subjected to unlawful reprisal for opposing conduct he reasonably believed to be discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120132430 (2015) (negative comments on performance not supported by testimony of first-line supervisor).</p>
<p class="noindent">Mention of EEO activity in a performance evaluation is a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of Title VII. However, that does not mean that all personnel actions based on that evaluation must, of necessity, be deemed illegal. In <span class="Italic">Crespo v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920842 (1993), the complainant's performance was evaluated as being between below average and satisfactory based on his attendance and low sick leave balance. The evaluation also mentioned that the complainant had filed several EEO complaints that had been resolved. The Commission found mention of the EEO complaints was a violation of Title VII, but found the complainant had not established a connection between those comments and the actual evaluation. The complainant's failure to receive a preferred reassignment based on the evaluation did not violate Title VII. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Crespo</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a threshold matter, we find that the SPO committed a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of EEOC Regulations by mentioning appellant's previous EEO complaints in the July 1988 evaluation. In particular, EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.261 prohibits the agency from restraining and/or interfering with the EEO process. The agency has a continuing duty to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity in its policies and practices. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.202. This duty extends to every aspect of agency personnel policy and practice in the employment, advancement, and treatment of employees. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.203. Agencies shall, among other things, insure that managers and supervisors perform in such a manner as to effectuate continuing affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal opportunity. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.203(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the SPO's statement, rather than encouraging the realization of equal employment opportunity in the workforce, serves to have a potentially chilling effect on the ultimate tool that employees have to enforce equal employment opportunity--the filing of a complaint. Based on the Commission's duty to insure the integrity of the EEO process and the unequivocal evidence of unlawful action in the instant case, we find that a violation of the EEOC Regulations against reprisal and interference has occurred. Thus, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to injunctive relief and removal of the July 1988 evaluation from his official personnel file. However, notwithstanding this violation on the part of the agency, the former Field Director/City Operations stated in his sworn affidavit that although he was aware of appellant's prior EEO activity, reprisal was not a factor in his denial of appellant's reassignment requests. Appellant has not refuted this statement. Furthermore, the former Field Director/City Operations stated that in addition to the unfavorable July 1988 evaluation, his initial denial was also based on appellant's poor sick leave record. The record indicates that appellant had a sick leave balance of 205 hours after eight years of service with <span id="Page_1531"></span>the agency. This amounted to about 25 hours of sick leave balance per year of service. The former Field Director/City Operations asserted that typical criterion for acceptance was 50 hours for each year of service. The record indicates that one of the comparatives that was granted a reassignment had a slightly lower sick leave balance than appellant per years of service. However, the Commission finds this is not indicative of discrimination because this comparative presented the agency with a persuasive explanation of his low sick leave balance and reasonable assurances that his attendance would be significantly better in Florida. The Commission therefore finds that even if the SPO had not mentioned appellant's EEO activity, the former Field Director/City Operations would still have denied appellant's initial request for reassignment due to his low sick leave balance.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Van Druff v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01963759 (1998), the Commission held that mention of the complainant's EEO activity in time records did not constitute a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation. It did, however, order the records expunged. The Commission distinguished <span class="Italic">Crespo</span> from <span class="Italic">Van Druff,</span> explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Progress Report states that appellant had charged 779 hours to assignments, and that a considerable percentage of these hours were "indirect," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, hours that he was not actually working on the assignments. The Report notes that 174 of these hours were attributable to sick and annual leave, and that "[a]nother 59 hours have been devoted to EEO." In response to appellant's allegation that this reference to his prior EEO activity was improper, the RO stated, "The breakout of indirect labor charges that I provided resulted from my detailed approach to analyzing. It was simply my style of presentation. No malicious intent can be read into this approach."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering the RO's comment, we note that, in <span class="Italic">Crespo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920842 (September 17, 1993), the Commission held that referring to an individual's prior EEO complaints in a supervisory evaluation constituted a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Commission's regulations. In considering the present situation, we find that it is distinguishable from the one which existed in <span class="Italic">Crespo</span>. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Crespo</span> the reference to the complainant's EEO complaints was clearly gratuitous and served no legitimate purpose. Conversely, in this case the RO offered a legitimate reason for the reference, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that, in response to appellant charging 779 hours to assignments, he was breaking down the hours appellant had spent on indirect labor which included, in addition to hours spent on sick/annual leave and other assignments, hours devoted to EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the same time, however, we are also cognizant of the potential effect such a comment could have on appellant's future career opportunities. For these reasons, we direct the agency to expunge the comment from the Progress Report in the event the Report still exists in either appellant's official personnel file or agency records.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency relies on poor performance as a legitimate reason, it will be considered persuasive evidence of pretext where the poor performance evaluation is close in time to the contact of an EEO counselor and there are not previous notations of performance problems. For example, in <span class="Italic">Perez v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01990218 (2002), the Commission found retaliation where a fully satisfactory rating was issued some two months after the complainant contacted a counselor, his performance had been rated as exceptional during midyear review and no comments or concerns were expressed about his work until the annual performance rating was issued.</p>
