<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-110"><span class="space">10.</span> Office of Personnel Management</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the Office of Personnel Management is involved in establishing criteria for a position or in referring qualified applicants to an agency for a position, there can be substantial confusion over the appropriate forum for filing a complaint. The procedures for challenging discrimination in the selection process are set forth in 5 CFR 300.104.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under section (a) of 300.104, the general rule is that when the employee is challenging a practice applied by OPM, the appropriate forum is the MSPB. If the employee is challenging the failure of OPM to place his name on a certificate of eligibles, the appropriate course is to file a complaint of discrimination with OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> Section (b); <span class="Italic">Buczynski v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01821829 (1983). Finally, if the employee is aggrieved by a practice or requirement imposed by the employing agency, the complaint of discrimination should be filed with the offending agency. The EEOC treats the regulation as a jurisdictional provision.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complaint involves both issues related to OPM regulations and the agency's own actions in applying the regulations, the proper course is to make both agencies parties to the complaint. <span class="Italic">See Tyler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01A15157 (2002). The agencies should then undertake a joint investigation and issue a joint decision on the case. <span class="Italic">See In re Department of Navy</span>, 05830388 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Secretary of Agriculture and Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01913964 (1992), the employee challenged both the agency's election to use a particular classification series to evaluate the grade level of her job, as well as the classification standards issued by OPM. The employee contended that the agency's election to use the particular series was intentional discrimination and that OPM's standards had a disparate impact on females. In holding that both agencies were proper respondents to the complaint, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Byrd</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals that appellant raised both the election and disparate impact issues in her complaint. For example, appellant alleged in the report accompanying her formal complaint that "the 475 and 1165 designations and criteria have a discriminatory impact on females and older employees...." She also contended that the 475 and 1165 criteria "have not been, nor are they, job-validated, which, on a class action basis, discriminates against females...." In her "Brief in Support of Certification of Proposed Class" filed before the AJ, appellant asserted that the complaint involved, <span class="Italic">inter</span> <span class="Italic">alia</span>, the issue of "whether the X-118 qualification standard for the 14751 series of either a degree in agriculture or 30 semester hours of course work in one or more agricultural fields discriminates and/or otherwise has an unlawful disparate impact...." In its "Opposition to Certification of Proposed Class," the agency recognized that one of the issues raised by appellant concerned whether the agency's use of the GS-475 and GS-1165 "qualification standards discriminates against female and/or older employees and/or has an unlawful disparate impact upon female and/or older employees...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ in her Recommended Decision also appears to have recognized that one of the issues in appellant's class complaint concerned a disparate impact issue. While discussing the class prerequisites of typicality and commonality, the AJ noted: "The Class Agent has demonstrated that she has been 'injured' by the (agency's) policies and/or practices with respect to the GS-475 series. The Class Agent seeks to represent a class of female employees of FMHA who have been similarly injured. Whether the '475' series' qualification standards are discriminatory is a question common to this class." Finally, after the Commission issued its decision in EEOC Request No. 05900291 (May 30, 1990), the agency, by letter dated August 15, 1990, requested the assignment of an AJ for purposes of holding a hearing and indicated that the issues accepted for processing were: "Whether OPM X-118 qualification standard for the 475 series is discriminatory on the basis of sex; and whether the application by FmHA of the OPM classification standards to determine whether a position is in the 475 or 1165 series is discriminatory on the basis of sex." Consequently, after a review of the record, the Commission finds that OPM in its motion has defined too narrowly the accepted issues in appellant's class complaint. The Commission agrees with appellant and the agency that there are two primary issues involved in this complaint which concern the content of the GS-475 series X-118 qualification standards, and the agency's election to use the GS-475 series instead of the GS-1165 series when filling County Supervisor positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that there are two main issues in appellant's class complaint, the Commission must determine whether OPM's participation as a party defendant is necessary in this case. The X-118 qualification standard for the GS-475 series, which is the subject of litigation in this complaint, requires the applicant to satisfy one of the following minimum educational requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;A full 4 year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree with major study in farm, livestock, or ranch management...or other closely related fields of agriculture.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;A total of at least 30 semester hours of course work in one or more of the agricultural fields listed in paragraph A above, plus sufficient additional education or experience of an appropriate nature to total 4 years of education or 4 years of education and experience....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that OPM approved and published these standards in 1968. On July 7, 1989, OPM informed the agency that it had approved the agency's request to revise the GS-475 qualification standards. The standards now contain the following basic requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;Degree: farm, livestock, or ranch management; agricultural economics; agricultural business management...or other related fields.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;Combination of education and experience--course work which provided the applicant with an understanding of the fundamental principles and techniques of agricultural management or other fields appropriate to the position as described in A above, plus appropriate experience or additional education.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although during the discovery period numerous documents were submitted by OPM and the agency concerning the efforts of both agencies to revise the GS-475 qualification standards, particularly during the period from 1986 to 1990, the record reveals that OPM retained the ultimate responsibility to publish the GS-475 qualification standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> Deposition of the Chief, Qualifications Standards Branch, (Chief Dep.) at 16. Because OPM approved the GS-475 qualification standards which have been challenged by appellant on a class-wide basis, the Commission agrees with appellant and the agency that OPM is a proper party defendant for all purposes in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its motion, OPM argues that the Commission did not have the authority to join OPM as a party defendant. Contrary to OPM's assertions, "it has long been the policy of this Commission that when OPM and another agency bear joint responsibility for an act of alleged discrimination, both agencies are proper respondents and the complaint must be jointly processed." <span class="Italic">Larry G. Reyes v. Constance B. Newman, Director, Office of Personnel Management</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900916 (November 15, 1990), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Jimmy Cloud v. Anthony M. Frank, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05881077 (June 9, 1989). In <span class="Italic">Reyes</span>, the Commission stated that "this policy is instituted pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.212 in order to insure that all agencies are joined which are parties indispensable to the joint adjudication of a complaint." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lucius Slay v. John O. Marsh, Jr., Secretary, Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890271 (March 31, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that OPM has not presented any persuasive arguments showing that it should not be joined as a party defendant. For example, we agree with the agency's assertions that OPM's reliance on Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is misplaced. One of the issues in the present complaint concerns the alleged discriminatory contents of the GS-475 qualification standards. Because OPM has the ultimate responsibility to issue the qualification standards, it is necessary to have OPM participate as a party defendant in this case in order for complete relief to be awarded in the event the GS-475 qualification standards were found to be discriminatory. The Commission also is not persuaded by OPM's attempts to distinguish the present case from the <span class="Italic">Martha Smith</span> decision cited by the Commission in its decision dated May 30, 1990. In this regard, the Commission notes that OPM has been joined as a party defendant during the discovery stage of the complaint. In <span class="Italic">Martha Smith</span>, the complainant had already received a final agency decision from one agency when the Commission joined OPM as a party and remanded the case for a supplemental investigation. The Commission, therefore, is not persuaded by OPM's assertions that it is inequitable to be joined at this stage of the complaint. Consequently, the Commission finds that OPM is a proper party defendant in this case for all purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01972052 (1998) (where a portion of the complaint involved an OPM classification decision, OPM should be joined as a necessary party).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Watts v. Attorney General</span>, 01982176 (1999), the Commission did not remand the case for a joint investigation by the Department of Justice <span id="Page_217"></span>and OPM where the agency dismissed the case for failure to state a claim because it was OPM, and not the agency, that determined the complainant was medically unfit to be a Border Patrol agent. The Commission found the agency's determination that it was not responsible for the employment decision amounted to a decision on the merits. In <span class="Italic">Watts</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, appellant is an applicant for employment with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), covered by Part 1614 of the EEOC Regulations. He has alleged that the agency engaged in discriminatory conduct when it failed to hire him for a position as a Border Patrol Agent (Trainee) based on a mental disability. The agency asserts that the decision that appellant's medical condition rendered him ineligible for the position was made by OPM and not by the agency. Therefore, the agency concluded that appellant's claim of discrimination properly lies with OPM. We disagree. The record herein indicates that the agency, i.e. the INS elected not to hire appellant based on the finding of OPM. We determine that the agency's decision discusses the merits of appellant's complaint allegations rather than whether appellant's allegation states a claim of employment discrimination. The fact remains, the agency itself made the employment decision not to hire appellant for the position. In this instance, appellant has raised a cognizable claim of discrimination which should be investigated by the agency<span class="Italic">. See Cervantes v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930303 (November 12, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did not explain why OPM was not a party necessary for adjudication of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the complaint would be properly filed with OPM, the employee should be excused for filing a complaint with the employing agency. The complaint should be accepted as timely if filed with the employing agency within the applicable time period. <span class="Italic">Loeffler v. Department of Treasury</span>, 01862329 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant alleges that OPM was the discriminating agency, OPM's mere assertion that it was not is insufficient to sustain a dismissal of the complaint. In <span class="Italic">Dow v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 0120073144 (2009), the complainant alleged that he was the victim of discrimination when OPM allowed the General Services Administration to pass over his application for a nondisabled Caucasian applicant. In reversing OPM's dismissal of the complaint in <span class="Italic">Dow</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held that the agency that allegedly discriminated against a complainant need not be the agency that employed or considered him for employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Horvath v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956761 (October 25, 1996) (noting that a complainant is required to file his complaint against the particular agency which allegedly has discriminated against him regarding a term, condition, or privilege of employment, even where the allegedly discriminating agency is not the employing agency). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(a) (which states that a complainant may file a complaint with "the agency that allegedly discriminated against the complainant"). <span class="Italic">See also, Koch v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A13849 (December 21, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant repeatedly has articulated his view that OPM had discriminated against him by permitting GSA to pass over him and fill the Chief People Officer Intern position with individuals outside his protected classes. OPM appears to argue that complainant failed to present sufficient proof that OPM had any involvement in the non-selection of complainant for the position of Chief People Officer Intern. However, complainant's belief alone is enough to enable him to file a discrimination claim with OPM. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">citing Pion v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Request No. 05880891 (October 18, 1988) (noting that the forerunner to current 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(a) had once been amended precisely to guarantee the right of complainants "to bring a complaint against any agency they <span class="Italic">believed</span> engaged in discriminatory conduct" [emphasis added]).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, an agency's determination that a complaint does not state a claim for relief because OPM approved its selection procedure is a decision on the merits and cannot be made without investigation and the joinder of OPM, if necessary. For example, in <span class="Italic">Eckman v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120110672 (2011), the complainant alleged he was discriminated against on the basis of sex when he was not selected for a police officer position. The agency dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim because OPM had approved the agency's request to recruit only female applicants for the position. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Eckman</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulation at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1) permits an agency to dismiss a complaint that fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted in the EEO process. An agency must, however, accept a complaint from any "aggrieved" employee (or applicant) who alleges that he or she has been discriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disabling condition or reprisal. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.103 and 106(a). The Commission has long defined an "aggrieved" employee or applicant as one who suffers a present harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05931049 (Apri1.21, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant alleges that, because of his gender, he was denied consideration for the Police Officer position. He has, without question, identified a harm that can be appropriately addressed under Title VII and the administrative complaint process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Agency's proffered explanation for failing to consider Complainant for the referenced position goes to the merits of the claim asserted in Complainant's complaint. It has no bearing on whether the claim is actionable. <span class="Italic">See Ware v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 01992151 (January 3, 2002) (explanations for actions challenged in a complaint are not relevant to whether the complaint states a claim). We, therefore, conclude that the Agency erred in finding that Complainant is not aggrieved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find no merit to the Agency's contention that Complainant's claim is precluded by OPM's approval of its decision to restrict Police Officer applicants to females. If anything, such approval suggests that OPM's participation in this matter may be necessary to a proper adjudication of the claim. To ensure efficient processing of the instant complaint, we find it appropriate to direct that OPM be joined as a party. <span class="Italic">Cf. Koch v. Coles,</span> EEOC No. 01A13849 (December 21, 2001) (citing longstanding Commission policy as basis for directing, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, joinder of the Securities Exchange Commission as a party in complaint against OPM).</p>
<p class="noindent">OPM, as the administrator of the disability retirement fund, normally is not considered to be an employer in that role. However, the mere fact that the complaint relates to disability retirement does not mean OPM will be considered as acting in its role as administrator. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kaiser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 05950289 (1996), the Commission found that OPM was acting in its role as employer and not administrator when it stopped processing the complainant's application for disability retirement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, as the administrator of the disability funds, an agency's actions would not be those of an employer. However, upon review of the record in the instant case, the Commission found that the agency was acting in its capacity as the complainant's employer, and not as the administrator of disability funds, when it suspended the processing of his disability retirement application. The record indicates that the agency's Office of General Counsel (OGC) placed a hold on the processing of appellant's application because of a report that he was challenging the validity of a prior settlement agreement. Thus, there is no persuasive evidence that the agency's decision was merely based on its role as the administrator of disability funds.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agreement that the complainant was challenging was one in which OPM withdrew an adverse action in exchange for a voluntary resignation. When the complainant challenged the agreement, OPM stopped processing the application. The Commission found that action was taken by OPM as the complainant's former employer and not as administrator of the disability fund.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complaint that OPM's method of calculating an annuity violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act fails to state a claim. <span class="Italic">See Muto v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 03960120 (1997). The method of calculating the amount of an annuity is set by statute and there is nothing inconsistent about the ADEA and the disability retirement statutes. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Herchick v. Thomas</span>, 898 F.2d 141 (3rd Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Office of Personnel Management is also the proper responding agency in claims alleging that federal insurance and disability benefits, under contracts administered by OPM, violate the Americans with Disabilities and Rehabilitation Acts. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">James v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 0120054026 (2007), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 0520070615 (2007). For a full discussion, <span class="Italic">see</span> Chapter 14, subsection on "<a href="0100-2023-23-108.html#sec14-106">Medical Insurance Benefits</a>."</p>
