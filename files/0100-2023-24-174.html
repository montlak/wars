<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-149"><span class="space">2.</span> Teleworking as an Accommodation</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency must allow an employee to work at home if this accommodation is needed, the essential functions of the job can be performed from home, and telework does not cause undue hardship. As illustrated by the <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation</span>, at pp. 46-47, [App. 7], the appropriateness of working at home as an accommodation will often depend on the nature of the employee's job:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer must modify its policy concerning where work is performed if such a change is needed as a reasonable accommodation, but <span class="Italic">only if this accommodation would be effective and would not cause an undue hardship.</span> Whether this accommodation is effective will depend on whether the essential functions of the position can be performed at home. There are certain jobs in which the essential functions can only be performed at the work site--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, food server, cashier in a store. For such jobs, allowing an employee to work at home is not effective because it does not enable an employee to perform his/her essential functions. Certain considerations may be critical in determining whether a job can be effectively performed at home, including (but not limited to) the employer's ability to adequately supervise the employee and the employee's need to work with certain equipment or tools that cannot be replicated at home. In contrast, employees may be able to perform the essential functions of certain types of jobs at home (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, telemarketer, proofreader). For these types of jobs, an employer may deny a request to work at home if it can show that another accommodation would be effective or if working at home will cause undue hardship. (Footnotes omitted, emphasis in oriGINAl.) <span class="Italic">See also Hupka v. Secretary of Defense, supra.; Langdon v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 959 F.2d 1053, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (remanding for consideration of whether employee's disability could be accommodated by working at home).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Gabriele G. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 2019000548 (2020) (reviewing the complainant's position description to determine feasibility of telework request); <span class="Italic">Evelina M. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120180711 (2019) (denial of telework did not violate the Rehabilitation Act where the complainant's work involved access to personally identifiable information).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's factsheet entitled, "Work At Home/Telework As A Reasonable Accommodation," notes that the ADA does not require employers to have a telework program, but if one exists it must allow individuals with disabilities to participate to the same extent as other employees. Moreover, if an employer does have such a program, allowing an individual with a disability to participate in the program can constitute reasonable accommodation.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The factsheet also addresses how an employer should determine whether a particular job, or portions of a job, can be performed at home:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer and employee first need to identify and review all of the essential job functions. The essential functions or duties are those tasks that are fundamental to performing a specific job. An employer does not have to remove any essential job duties to permit an employee to work at home. However, it may need to reassign some minor job duties or marGINAl functions (i.e., those that are not essential to the successful performance of a job) if they cannot be performed outside the workplace and they are the only obstacle to permitting an employee to work at home. If a marGINAl function needs to be reassigned, an employer may substitute another minor task that the employee with a disability could perform at home in order to keep employee workloads evenly distributed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After determining what functions are essential, the employer and the individual with a disability should determine whether some or all of the functions can be performed at home. For some jobs, the essential duties can only be performed in the workplace. For example, food servers, cashiers, and truck drivers cannot perform their essential duties from home. But, in many other jobs some or all of the duties can be performed at home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several factors should be considered in determining the feasibility of working at home, including the employer's ability to supervise the employee adequately and whether any duties require use of certain equipment or tools that cannot be replicated at home. Other critical considerations include whether there is a need for face-to-face interaction and coordination of work with other employees; whether in-person interaction with outside colleagues, clients, or customers is necessary; and whether the position in question requires the employee to have immediate access to documents or other information located only in the workplace. An employer should not, however, deny a request to work at home as a reasonable accommodation solely because a job involves some contact and coordination with other employees. Frequently, meetings can be conducted effectively by telephone and information can be exchanged quickly through e-mail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the employer determines that some job duties must be performed in the workplace, then the employer and employee need to decide whether working part-time at home and part-time in the workplace will meet both of their needs. For example, an employee may need to meet face-to-face with clients as part of a job, but other tasks may involve reviewing documents and writing reports. Clearly, the meetings must be done in the workplace, but the employee may be able to review documents and write reports from home.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Generally speaking, an employee is responsible for getting himself or herself to and from work. Although the agency is not responsible for getting the employee to and from the workplace, it may have an obligation to modify the employee's schedule to make commuting possible, or even consider telecommuting.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to demonstrate that she is entitled to telecommunting as a reasonable accommodation the complainant must demonstrate that working outside of her home would violate medical restrictions and that the job can be done outside the workplace. In <span class="Italic">Genmill v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120072201 (2009), the Commission found that the complainant failed to demonstrate the need to telecommute, but that the agency also demonstrated the work could not be performed at home, in part, because it required confidential documents that could not be removed from the agency facility:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that complainant, who works as an air traffic controller, was reassigned in August 2005, to an administrative position in the agency's Safety Office based on her inability to perform the functions of the ATCS position. Complainant testified that she requested to work at home because she was in pain at work, and needed to use a heating pad. <span id="Page_1416"></span>Complainant further asserted her belief that this would be an ideal way to lessen her leave usage. Complainant's supervisors collectively testified that complainant's position in the Safety Office was not amenable to working at home because: (1) her position required access to the agency's intranet computer application; (2) her position required access to documents that could not be removed from the facility; (3) complainant had already been accommodated by reassignment; and (4) complainant's dependability was already an issue. The record contains a copy of the agency's telecommuting guidance, which states that individuals eligible for telecommuting must have demonstrated dependability, good time management, and be in a position which does not require the removal of classified documents from the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we find that complainant failed to show that the agency denied her a reasonable accommodation. Most significantly, complainant failed to produce medical evidence showing that she needed to telecommute as an accommodation for her claimed disability. Furthermore, complainant has not shown that working outside of her home violated any medical restrictions. The agency's reason for denying the request, which includes the confidential nature of complainant's work files and need for the agency's intranet, is supported by the record. Although complainant asserts that there is some work she can accomplish at home, she failed to adequately dispute the agency's reasons for denying her request. Furthermore, complainant asserted that others worked at home in the agency; however, she failed to identify that this was a practice used by individuals at her facility, under similar circumstances to her own. Accordingly, we find that complainant failed to establish that the agency denied her an accommodation when they denied her request to work from home.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's obligation is to provide a reasonable accommodation and not the accommodation of the employee's choice. In <span class="Italic">Wearren v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120100926 (2012), the Commission found that the agency did not fail to accommodate the complainant's asthma where it offered her several alternative workspaces, and a humidifier and fan to eliminate scents that aggravated her condition. As for the complainant's contention that teleworking was a reasonable accommodation, the Commission found that her position required that she work with materials protected by the Privacy Act that could not leave the worksite and that teleworking would not be a reasonable accommodation because it would not allow her to perform the essential functions of her position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like all others, however, an accommodation to telework must be effective. In <span class="Italic">Jona R. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120182063 (2020), the Commission found that the agency's accommodation allowing the complainant to telework on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays was not effective where the complainant requested situational telework:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant has been diagnosed with Diabetes, Neuropathy, Anxiety, Depression, and Autonomic Neuropathy, and the Agency concedes that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. Because of her medical conditions, Complainant sometimes experiences symptoms commonly associated with her conditions, including dizziness, fainting, fluctuating glucose levels, nausea, vomiting, and difficulties with bladder/bowel control. We note that Commission regulations explicitly state diabetes substantially limits endocrine function, a major life activity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(iii); <span class="Italic">see Irina T. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120180568 (Apr. 3, 2019). Moreover, the Agency acknowledges that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. As such, we likewise find that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that Complainant initially requested reasonable accommodation on or about November 1, 2013, when she submitted a Reasonable Accommodation Request form that stated that, because of her Diabetes and Autonomic Neuropathy, she needed to be able to determine each morning if it was "appropriate to go into work or work from home depending upon [her] symptoms." Additionally, Complainant requested telework flexibility that would allow her to decide if she was too ill to drive into the office to work on a particular day when she was experiencing symptoms. In January 2014, Complainant requested fulltime telework because her health had become "progressively worse" and the office environment had noise, chaos, and customer traffic that made it difficult for her to focus on her work. Complainant also reported she needed fulltime telework because it had become dangerous for her to drive when she experienced erratic blood sugar levels, and it was preferable to vomit at home instead of at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that Complainant demonstrated that she needed the reasonable accommodation of situational telework by showing that she had a medical condition that sometimes caused her to experience symptoms that negatively impacted her ability to commute or work in the office. However, we do not find that Complainant proved that she needed fulltime telework because of her medical conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so finding, we note that Complainant did not provide any medical documentation that established the frequency of her symptoms, and Complainant's bare assertion that she was unable to come into the office at any time because of her conditions does not establish her need for the broader accommodation of fulltime telework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency concluded that it provided Complainant with an effective reasonable accommodation when it offered her telework three times per week. However, as Complainant points out, the Agency only offered to allow Complainant to telework on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which is essentially the same telework schedule Complainant had before she requested reasonable accommodation. However, Complainant disclosed she needed to telework when she experienced symptoms related to her condition that impacted her ability to commute and work in the office. These symptoms often occurred without significant notice and were not restricted to Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Therefore, if Complainant experienced symptoms that impacted her ability to commute or work in the office on Tuesdays or Thursdays, the telework agreement would not have provided her with a reasonable accommodation for her medical conditions. The Agency's offer of telework on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays was not an effective accommodation because it did not meet Complainant's need for flexible, situational telework as needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's final decision asserted that fulltime or situational telework would have imposed an undue hardship because: Complainant's position required training and periodic meetings in the office; trip planners were not able to follow all information on telephone calls; Complainant's workload had increased by 135 percent and Complainant had new work commitments; and Complainant had demonstrated an inability to follow proper procedures for reporting her duty station and work status while teleworking. However, S2 stated that "training and periodic meetings" for Complainant only occurred "intermittent[ly]." ROI, Volume 3, p. 912. As such, we are not persuaded that Complainant had to train and attend meetings so often as to preclude her from teleworking situationally. The Agency further maintained that Complainant could not telework situationally because her workload had increased by 135 percent. However, an increase in workload does not necessarily make situational telework implausible, and the Agency did not prove that it was the case here. At any rate, S2 greatly undermined the Agency's assertion by stating that "the actual core duties of the [C]omplainant, as written, may be performed remotely." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that Complainant cannot situationally telework because she stopped sending daily status reports and providing work product since April 14, 2014. However, the record reflects that Complainant sought long term leave for this period because she believed that the Agency's failure to provide her with the effective reasonable accommodation of situational telework was exacerbating her medical conditions. As such, we reject the Agency's claim that Complainant's difficulty in reporting her work status or providing work product during this period indicates that situational telework would impose an undue hardship on the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also maintains that it accommodated Complainant by permitting her to take leave when she experienced medical symptoms that made it difficult for her to commute or work in the office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While an employer may choose between effective accommodations, forcing an employee to take leave when another accommodation would permit an employee to continue working is not an effective accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Denese v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016). In this case, the Agency failed to provide Complainant with the effective accommodation that would have allowed her to continue working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hence, we find that the Agency failed to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation for her disability when it did not approve her for situational telework. <span class="Italic">See Jody L. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151351 (Jan. 17, 2018) (agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it denied Complainant with Paralysis the option of working from home on days when the temperature is below negative twenty degrees.). In so finding, we remind the Agency that the federal government is charged with the goal of being a "model employer" of individuals with disabilities, which may require it to consider innovation, fresh approaches, and technology as effective methods of providing reasonable accommodations. <span class="Italic">Rowlette v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A10816 (Aug. 1, 2003); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(a). We believe that providing Complainant with this reasonable accommodation furthers this goal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, the complainant must show that those accommodations were ineffective where the agency has provided other accommodations in lieu of telework in order to prevail. The fact that the complainant may have to use some sick leave or leave without pay because of her disability does not necessarily mean she is entitled to telecommute as an accommodation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Dennis v. Secretary of Education,</span> 0120090193 (2010), the complainant suffered from a sinus condition that was irritated by perfume and other odors. She initially asked for a work environment free from scents that <span id="Page_1417"></span>cause her throat to swell and cause difficulty breathing. The agency moved the complainant's workstation five times during the interactive process and ultimately provided her with a room without windows and a door that closed. Complainant requested to telecommute as an accommodation contending there were still times when she would come in contact with scents on her way to work or when third parties visited the workplace. The agency did approve her participation in its flexiplace program, which required advance notice and approval to work at home. The agency also contended that the complainant could not telecommute fulltime because the complainant's work involved access to personal identification information that could not be secured offsite. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Dennis</span>, found that the agency had not denied the complainant reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ assumed, for purposes of his decision, that Complainant's impairments rendered her disabled under the Rehabilitation Act. We find, as did the AJ, the undisputed evidence shows that the Agency and Complainant engaged in an exchange of proposals and the trial of modifications to Complainant's work and work environment, in an effort to accommodate Complainant's disability. Neither party disputes that the Agency provided Complainant with many of her suggested modifications and that Complainant was able to perform the essential functions of her position with the modifications the Agency provided, namely, an enclosed workspace. We note that Complainant continued to propose solutions to predictable situations such as when employees would bring Complainant's mail to her, and also allowed Complainant to use a secured, particular door that would further limit her exposure to irritants in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To show discrimination, Complainant must show that the accommodation the agency provided to her was ineffective. We find that on appeal, as she did previously before the AJ, complainant argues that allowing her to work from her home on a permanent basis would be a better accommodation where she could virtually eliminate the chance that she would be exposed to chemical irritants or perfume. Complainant further argues that the agency did not provide enough of a reason for denying her this request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, as the AJ did, that Complainant is entitled to an effective accommodation, not necessarily the accommodation of her choice or even the best available accommodation. We consider, as Complainant argues that from time to time in her enclosed office, complainant may still encounter the occasional irritant from contact with others who occupy the workplace or during her daily commute (visitors, vendors, or other transit passengers wearing strong perfume, for instance). Nevertheless, we find the Agency permitted complainant to use sick leave on those occasions where her symptoms became intolerable. We find that the use of leave (including leave without pay, should Complainant's leave balance become exhausted), is another form of accommodation. Complainant also acknowledges that she has been approved to participate in the Agency's Telework program on an 'as needed' basis. Complainant's responses to Mandatory Interrogatories at 22.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not find that the Agency was required to show that Complainant's requests to be able to work from home were art undue hardship, as complainant insists. We find it is enough that after participating in the interactive process, Complainant was provided with an effective accommodation that allowed her to perform the essential functions of her position. While it is in the nature of some disabilities to change over time, we find that Complainant's performance evaluations and history of sick leave use indicate that for now, the accommodation provided by the agency is effective.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, while Complainant was not provided her choice of accommodation, we find no dispute in the material facts that show the accommodation offered by the agency was effective. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9; <span class="Italic">Polen v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01970984 (January 16, 2001) (holding if more than one accommodation is effective, "the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration; however, the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations.").</p>
