<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-73"><span class="space">1.</span> Definition of Supervisor</h4>
<p class="noindent">From the outset, the EEOC took a liberal view of what constitutes a supervisor for liability purposes. In its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (rev. October 17, 2002), the Commission set forth a two-prong test for when an employee qualified as a supervisor: "An individual qualifies as an employee's "supervisor" if the individual: (1) has authority to undertake or recommend tangible employment decisions affecting the employee (even if the individual does not have the final say); or (2) has authority to direct the employee's daily work activities." As discussed below, that view was rejected by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2434 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">San Diego v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720060014 (2007), the Commission held that it would not determine supervisory status by job title, but by job responsibilities, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in addition to our finding that complainant was subjected to a hostile work environment, we must, nevertheless, consider whether there is a basis upon which to impute liability to the agency. In this regard, we agree with the AJ that the agency is liable for the harassment by RK. The Commission first determines that, contrary to the agency's assertion on appeal, the facts support that RK had supervisory authority over complainant. The Commission has held that a determination as to whether a harasser had supervisory authority is based on his or her job function rather than job title (e.g., "team leader") and must be based on the specific facts. An individual qualifies as an employee's "supervisor" if the individual: (1) has authority to undertake or recommend tangible employment decisions affecting the employee (even if the individual does not have the final say); or (2) has authority to direct the employee's daily work activities.<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (rev. October 17, 2002). The record reveals that RK was the Lead Respiratory Technician and his responsibilities included scheduling work assignments for the therapists, directing employees, granting their leave requests, assisting them when they needed advice/guidance, and receiving their reports of patient complications/injuries. In all respects, RK was "in charge" when S1 was absent. Moreover, the employees viewed him as a supervisor. Therefore, we conclude that RK had authority to direct complainant's daily work assignments, and as such, he qualifies as complainant's supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">James v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120102361 (2012), the Commission reversed and remanded a summary judgment decision finding that whether the alleged harasser should be treated as a supervisor or coworker was a disputed issue of fact. Although the complainant did not report directly to the alleged harasser, he was a deputy branch chief in the same organization. The Commission found "the complainant might reasonably believe that harasser has the ability to significantly influence employment decision affecting her even if the harasser is outside the complainant's chain of command."</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Destiny H. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120130872 (2015), the Commission found that supervisory deputy project superintendent was not a supervisor for liability purposes because he was not in the complainant's chain-of-command and superintendent was working with the complainant on a project. Under those circumstances, the Commission found it proper to apply the liability standard for coworkers.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Vance</span>, the EEOC had long held that employees, such as team leaders who direct daily work assignments, are considered supervisors for purposes of establishing employer liability in hostile environment cases, <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">San Diego v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720060014 (2007), as have the Second, Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals. However, the Seventh Circuit joined the First and Eighth Circuit Courts of Appeals in applying a narrower <span id="Page_893"></span>standard limited to those who have the authority to hire, fire, demote, transfer or discipline subordinate employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 646 F.3d 461 (7th Cir. 2011), the Seventh Circuit upheld a grant of summary judgment for the employer finding that Vance had not established a basis for imputing liability to the employer. Vance was the only African-American working in her department at Ball State. She filed complaints alleging the use of racial epithets, references to the Ku Klux Klan and "veiled threats of physical harm." Vance argued that three of the workers who racially harassed her were supervisors because they had the authority to direct Vance's work and that Ball State should be strictly liable for the harassment subject to the affirmative defense set for in <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742 (1998) and <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775 (1998). The Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court finding that a "'supervisor is someone with power to directly affect the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.'" <span class="Italic">Vance</span>, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Ill. Dep't. of Transp.</span>, 359 F.3d 498, 506 (7th Cir. 2004). Directly affecting, according to the Court, means the authority to hire, fire, demote, promote and discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court in <span class="Italic">Vance</span> then went on to find that one of the alleged harassers was not a supervisor based on Vance's allegations that she could tell Vance what to do and did not "clock-in" like other hourly employees. In other words, the employee did not have the authority to directly affect the terms and conditions of Vance's employment. The actions of a second alleged supervisor were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. Finally, the Court found there was no evidence to establish the alleged harassment by a third supervisor was based on any racial animus. Analyzing the case under the rules of liability for coworker harassment, the Court found the evidence was undisputed that when Vance complained about the harassment, Ball State took prompt actions to investigate and remedy the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to decide the question of what constitutes a supervisor for harassment liability purposes and in <span class="Italic">Vance v. Ball State University</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2434 (June 24, 2013), a 5-4 majority with Justice Alito writing the majority opinion for Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it "an unlawful employment practice for an employer...to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1). This provision obviously prohibits discrimination with respect to employment decisions that have direct economic consequences, such as termination, demotion, and pay cuts. But not long after Title VII was enacted, the lower courts held that Title VII also reaches the creation or perpetuation of a discriminatory work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the leading case of <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, 454 F. 2d 234 (1971), the Fifth Circuit recognized a cause of action based on this theory. <span class="Italic">See Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 65-66 (1986) (describing development of hostile environment claims based on race). The <span class="Italic">Rogers</span> court reasoned that "the phrase 'terms, conditions, or privileges of employment' in [Title VII] is an expansive concept which sweeps within its protective ambit the practice of creating a working environment heavily charged with ethnic or racial discrimination." 454 F. 2d, at 238. The court observed that "[o]ne can readily envision working environments so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following this decision, the lower courts generally held that an employer was liable for a racially hostile work environment if the employer was negligent, i.e., if the employer knew or reasonably should have known about the harassment but failed to take remedial action. <span class="Italic">See Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S., at 768-769 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (citing cases).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the issue eventually reached this Court, we agreed that Title VII prohibits the creation of a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See Meritor, supra</span>, at 64-67. In such cases, we have held, the plaintiff must show that the work environment was so pervaded by discrimination that the terms and conditions of employment were altered. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Rogers</span>, we have held that an employer is directly liable for an employee's unlawful harassment if the employer was negligent with respect to the offensive behavior. <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, 524 U.S., at 789. Courts have generally applied this rule to evaluate employer liability when a co-worker harasses the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, however, we held that different rules apply where the harassing employee is the plaintiff 's "supervisor." In those instances, an employer may be vicariously liable for its employees' creation of a hostile work environment. And in identifying the situations in which such vicarious liability is appropriate, we looked to the Restatement of Agency for guidance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Meritor, supra</span>, at 72; <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 755. Under the Restatement, "masters" are generally not liable for the torts of their "servants" when the torts are committed outside the scope of the servants' employment. See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency &#x00A7; 219(2), p. 481 (1957) (Restatement). And because racial and sexual harassment are unlikely to fall within the scope of a servant's duties, application of this rule would generally preclude employer liability for employee harassment. <span class="Italic">See Faragher, supra</span>, at 793-796; <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 757. But in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, we held that a provision of the Restatement provided the basis for an exception. Section 219(2)(d) of that Restatement recognizes an exception to the general rule just noted for situations in which the servant was "aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation." Restatement 481; <span class="Italic">see Faragher, supra</span>, at 802-803; <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 760-763.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Adapting this concept to the Title VII context, <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> identified two situations in which the aided-in-the-accomplishment rule warrants employer liability even in the absence of negligence, and both of these situations involve harassment by a "supervisor" as opposed to a co-worker. First, the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable "when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action," <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 762; <span class="Italic">Faragher, supra</span>, at 790--i.e., "a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits." <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S., at 761. We explained the reason for this rule as follows: "When a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation....A tangible employment decision requires an official act of the enterprise, a company act. The decision in most cases is documented in official company records, and may be subject to review by higher level supervisors." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 761-762. In those circumstances, we said, it is appropriate to hold the employer strictly liable. <span class="Italic">See Faragher, supra</span>, at 807; <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 765.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> held that, even when a supervisor's harassment does not culminate in a tangible employment action, the employer can be vicariously liable for the supervisor's creation of a hostile work environment if the employer is unable to establish an affirmative defense. We began by noting that "a supervisor's power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation." <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 763; <span class="Italic">see Faragher</span>, 524 U.S., at 803-805. But it would go too far, we found, to make employers strictly liable whenever a "supervisor" engages in harassment that does not result in a tangible employment action, and we therefore held that in such cases the employer may raise an affirmative defense. Specifically, an employer can mitigate or avoid liability by showing (1) that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities that were provided. <span class="Italic">Faragher, supra</span>, at 807; <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S., at 765. This compromise, we explained, "accommodate[s] the agency principles of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII's equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 764.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissenting Members of the Court in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> would not have created a special rule for cases involving harassment by "supervisors." Instead, they would have held that an employer is liable for any employee's creation of a hostile work environment "if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negligent in permitting the [offending] conduct to occur." <span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 767 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); <span class="Italic">Faragher, supra</span>, at 810 (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, it is obviously important whether an alleged harasser is a "supervisor" or merely a co-worker, and the lower courts have disagreed about the meaning of the concept of a supervisor in this context. Some courts, including the Seventh Circuit below, have held that an employee is not a supervisor unless he or she has the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline the victim. E.g., 646 F. 3d, at 470; <span class="Italic">Noviello v. Boston</span>, 398 F. 3d 76, 96 (CA1 2005); <span class="Italic">Weyers v. Lear Operations Corp</span>., 359 F. 3d 1049, 1057 (CA8 2004). Other courts have substantially followed the more open-ended approach advocated by the EEOC's Enforcement Guidance, which ties supervisor status to the ability to exercise significant direction over another's daily work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mack v. Otis Elevator Co</span>., 326 F. 3d 116, 126-127 (CA2 2003); <span class="Italic">Whitten v. Fred's, Inc</span>., 601 F. 3d 231, 245-247 (CA4 2010); EEOC, <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> (1999), 1999 WL 33305874, *3 (hereinafter EEOC Guidance).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to resolve this conflict. 567 U.S. ___ (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that an employer may be vicariously liable for an employee's unlawful harassment only when the employer has empowered that employee to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a "significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits." <span id="Page_894"></span><span class="Italic">Ellerth, supra</span>, at 761. We reject the nebulous definition of a "supervisor" advocated in the EEOC Guidance and substantially adopted by several courts of appeals. Petitioner's reliance on colloquial uses of the term "supervisor" is misplaced, and her contention that our cases require the EEOC's abstract definition is simply wrong.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we will explain, the framework set out in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> presupposes a clear distinction between supervisors and co-workers. Those decisions contemplate a unitary category of supervisors, i.e., those employees with the authority to make tangible employment decisions. There is no hint in either decision that the Court had in mind two categories of supervisors: first, those who have such authority and, second, those who, although lacking this power, nevertheless have the ability to direct a co-worker's labor to some ill-defined degree. On the contrary, the <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> framework is one under which supervisory status can usually be readily determined, generally by written documentation. The approach recommended by the EEOC Guidance, by contrast, would make the determination of supervisor status depend on a highly case specific evaluation of numerous factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> framework represents what the Court saw as a workable compromise between the aided-in-the-accomplishment theory of vicarious liability and the legitimate interests of employers. The Seventh Circuit's understanding of the concept of a "supervisor," with which we agree, is easily workable; it can be applied without undue difficulty at both the summary judgment stage and at trial. The alternative, in many cases, would frustrate judges and confound jurors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner contends that her expansive understanding of the concept of a "supervisor" is supported by the meaning of the word in general usage and in other legal contexts, see Brief for Petitioner 25-28, but this argument is both incorrect on its own terms and, in any event, misguided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general usage, the term "supervisor" lacks a sufficiently specific meaning to be helpful for present purposes. Petitioner is certainly right that the term is often used to refer to a person who has the authority to direct another's work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 17 Oxford English Dictionary 245 (2d ed. 1989) (defining the term as applying to "one who inspects and directs the work of others"). But the term is also often closely tied to the authority to take what <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> referred to as a "tangible employment action." <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2296, def. 1(a) (1976) ("a person having authority delegated by an employer to hire, transfer, suspend, recall, promote, assign, or discharge another employee or to recommend such action").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A comparison of the definitions provided by two colloquial business authorities illustrates the term's imprecision in general usage. One says that "[s]upervisors are usually authorized to recommend and/or effect hiring, disciplining, promoting, punishing, rewarding, and other associated activities regarding the employees in their departments." Another says exactly the opposite: "A supervisor generally does not have the power to hire or fire employees or to promote them." <span class="Italic">Compare Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S., at 762 ("Tangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If we look beyond general usage to the meaning of the term in other legal contexts, we find much the same situation. Sometimes the term is reserved for those in the upper echelons of the management hierarchy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(18) (defining the "supervisor" of a school within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as "the individual in the position of ultimate authority at a Bureau school"). But sometimes the term is used to refer to lower ranking individuals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 152(11) (defining a supervisor to include "any individual having authority...to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment"); 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1396n(j)(4)(A) (providing that an eligible Medicaid beneficiary who receives care through an approved self-directed services plan may "hire, fire, supervise, and manage the individuals providing such services").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the meaning of the concept of a supervisor varies from one legal context to another, the law often contemplates that the ability to supervise includes the ability to take tangible employment actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 9701.511(a)(2), (3) (2012) (referring to a supervisor's authority to "hire, assign, and direct employees...and [t]o lay off and retain employees, or to suspend, remove, reduce in grade, band, or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees or, with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source"); &#x00A7; 9701.212(b)(4) (defining "supervisory work" as that which "may involve hiring or selecting employees, assigning work, managing performance, recognizing and rewarding employees, and other associated duties").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the term "supervisor" has varying meanings both in colloquial usage and in the law. And for this reason, petitioner's argument, taken on its own terms, is unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More important, petitioner is misguided in suggesting that we should approach the question presented here as if "supervisor" were a statutory term. "Supervisor" is not a term used by Congress in Title VII. Rather, the term was adopted by this Court in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> as a label for the class of employees whose misconduct may give rise to vicarious employer liability. Accordingly, the way to understand the meaning of the term "supervisor" for present purposes is to consider the interpretation that best fits within the highly structured framework that those cases adopted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, we are met at the outset with petitioner's contention that at least some of the alleged harassers in those cases, whom we treated as supervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh Circuit's definition demands. This argument misreads our decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, it was clear that the alleged harasser was a supervisor under any definition of the term: He hired his victim, and he promoted her (subject only to the ministerial approval of his supervisor, who merely signed the paperwork). 524 U.S., at 747. <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> was a case from the Seventh Circuit, and at the time of its decision in that case, that court had already adopted its current definition of a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See Volk v. Coler</span>, 845 F. 2d 1422, 1436 (1988). <span class="Italic">See also Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc</span>., 163 F. 3d 1027, 1033, n.1 (CA7 1998) (discussing Circuit case law). Although the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> Seventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> issued eight separate opinions, there was no disagreement about the harasser's status as a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Jansen v. Packaging Corp. of America</span>, 123 F. 3d 490 (1997) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). Likewise, when the case reached this Court, no question about the harasser's status was raised.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same is true with respect to <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>. In that case, <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, a female lifeguard, sued her employer, the city of Boca Raton, for sexual harassment based on the conduct of two other lifeguards, Bill Terry and David Silverman, and we held that the city was vicariously liable for Terry's and Silverman's harassment. Although it is clear that Terry had authority to take tangible employment actions affecting the victim, <span class="Italic">see</span> 524 U.S., at 781 (explaining that Terry could hire new lifeguards, supervise their work assignments, counsel, and discipline them), Silverman may have wielded less authority, <span class="Italic">ibid</span>. (noting that Silverman was "responsible for making the lifeguards' daily assignments, and for supervising their work and fitness training"). Nevertheless, the city never disputed Faragher's characterization of both men as her "supervisors." <span class="Italic">See</span> App., O. T. 1997, No. 97-282, p. 40 (First Amended Complaint &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7); <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 79 (Answer to First Amended Complaint &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7) (admitting that both harassers had "supervisory responsibilities" over the plaintiff).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the parties' undisputed characterization of the alleged harassers, this Court simply was not presented with the question of the degree of authority that an employee must have in order to be classified as a supervisor. The parties did not focus on the issue in their briefs, although the victim in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> appears to have agreed that supervisors are employees empowered to take tangible employment actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief for Petitioner, O. T. 1997, No. 97-282, p. 24 ("Supervisors typically exercise broad discretionary powers over their subordinates, determining many of the terms and conditions of their employment, including their raises and prospects for promotion and controlling or greatly influencing whether they are to be dismissed").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, we have no difficulty rejecting petitioner's argument that the question before us in the present case was effectively settled in her favor by our treatment of the alleged harassers in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent acknowledges that our prior cases do "not squarely resolve whether an employee without power to take tangible employment actions may nonetheless qualify as a supervisor," but accuses us of ignoring the "all-too-plain reality" that employees with authority to control their subordinates' daily work are aided by that authority in perpetuating a discriminatory work environment. Post, at 8 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). As <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> recognized, however, "most workplace tortfeasors are aided in accomplishing their tortious objective by the existence of the agency relation," and consequently "something more" is required in order to warrant vicarious liability. 524 U.S., at 760. The ability to direct another employee's tasks is simply not sufficient. Employees with such powers are certainly capable of creating intolerable work environments, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 9-11 (discussing examples), but so are many other co-workers. Negligence provides the better framework for evaluating an employer's liability when a harassing employee lacks the power to take tangible employment actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although our holdings in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> and <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> do not resolve the question now before us, we believe that the answer to that question is implicit in the characteristics of the framework that we adopted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_895"></span>To begin, there is no hint in either <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> or <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> that the Court contemplated anything other than a unitary category of supervisors, namely, those possessing the authority to effect a tangible change in a victim's terms or conditions of employment. The <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> framework draws a sharp line between co-workers and supervisors. Co-workers, the Court noted, "can inflict psychological injuries" by creating a hostile work environment, but they "cannot dock another's pay, nor can one co-worker demote another." <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S., at 762. Only a supervisor has the power to cause "direct economic harm" by taking a tangible employment action. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. "Tangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor. The supervisor has been empowered by the company as a distinct class of agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control....Tangible employment actions are the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. (emphasis added). The strong implication of this passage is that the authority to take tangible employment actions is the defining characteristic of a supervisor, not simply a characteristic of a subset of an ill-defined class of employees who qualify as supervisors. The way in which we framed the question presented in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> supports this understanding. As noted, the <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> framework sets out two circumstances in which an employer may be vicariously liable for a supervisor's harassment. The first situation (which results in strict liability) exists when a supervisor actually takes a tangible employment action based on, for example, a subordinate's refusal to accede to sexual demands. The second situation (which results in vicarious liability if the employer cannot make out the requisite affirmative defense) is present when no such tangible action is taken. Both <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> and <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> fell into the second category, and in <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, the Court couched the question at issue in the following terms: "whether an employer has vicarious liability when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment by making explicit threats to alter a subordinate's terms or conditions of employment, based on sex, but does not fulfill the threat." 524 U.S., at 754. This statement plainly ties the second situation to a supervisor's authority to inflict direct economic injury. It is because a supervisor has that authority--and its potential use hangs as a threat over the victim--that vicarious liability (subject to the affirmative defense) is justified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> Court sought a framework that would be workable and would appropriately take into account the legitimate interests of employers and employees. The Court looked to principles of agency law for guidance, but the Court concluded that the "malleable terminology" of the aided-in-the-commission principle counseled against the wholesale incorporation of that principle into Title VII case law. <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S., at 763. Instead, the Court also considered the objectives of Title VII, including "the limitation of employer liability in certain circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 764.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor that we adopt today is one that can be readily applied. In a great many cases, it will be known even before litigation is commenced whether an alleged harasser was a supervisor, and in others, the alleged harasser's status will become clear to both sides after discovery. And once this is known, the parties will be in a position to assess the strength of a case and to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute. Where this does not occur, supervisor status will generally be capable of resolution at summary judgment. By contrast, under the approach advocated by petitioner and the EEOC, supervisor status would very often be murky--as this case well illustrates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to petitioner, the record shows that Davis, her alleged harasser, wielded enough authority to qualify as a supervisor. Petitioner points in particular to Davis' job description, which gave her leadership responsibilities, and to evidence that Davis at times led or directed Vance and other employees in the kitchen. <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief for Petitioner 42-43 (citing record); Reply Brief 22-23 (same). The United States, on the other hand, while applying the same open-ended test for supervisory status, reaches the opposite conclusion. At least on the present record, the United States tells us, Davis fails to qualify as a supervisor. Her job description, in the Government's view, is not dispositive, and the Government adds that it would not be enough for petitioner to show that Davis "occasionally took the lead in the kitchen." Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 31 (U.S. Brief).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This disagreement is hardly surprising since EEOC's definition of a supervisor, which both petitioner and the United States defend, is a study in ambiguity. In its Enforcement Guidance, the EEOC takes the position that an employee, in order to be classified as a supervisor, must wield authority "'of sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out the harassment.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 27 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a (EEOC Guidance)). But any authority over the work of another employee provides at least some assistance, <span class="Italic">see Ellerth, supra</span>, at 763, and that is not what the United States interprets the Guidance to mean. Rather, it informs us, the authority must exceed both an ill-defined temporal requirement (it must be more than "occasiona[l]") and an ill-defined substantive requirement ("an employee who directs 'only a limited number of tasks or assignments' for another employee...would not have sufficient authority to qualify as a supervisor." U.S. Brief 28 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a (EEOC Guidance)); U.S. Brief 31.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We read the EEOC Guidance as saying that the number (and perhaps the importance) of the tasks in question is a factor to be considered in determining whether an employee qualifies as a supervisor. And if this is a correct interpretation of the EEOC's position, what we are left with is a proposed standard of remarkable ambiguity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The vagueness of this standard was highlighted at oral argument when the attorney representing the United States was asked to apply that standard to the situation in <span class="Italic">Faragher</span>, where the alleged harasser supposedly threatened to assign the plaintiff to clean the toilets in the lifeguard station for a year if she did not date him. 524 U.S., at 780. Since cleaning the toilets is just one task, albeit an unpleasant one, the authority to assign that job would not seem to meet the more-than-a-limited-number-of-tasks requirement in the EEOC Guidance. Nevertheless, the Government attorney's first response was that the authority to make this assignment would be enough. Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. He later qualified that answer by saying that it would be necessary to "know how much of the day's work [was] encompassed by cleaning the toilets." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 23-24. He did not explain what percentage of the day's work (50%, 25%, 10%?) would suffice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Government attorney's inability to provide a definitive answer to this question was the inevitable consequence of the vague standard that the Government asks us to adopt. Key components of that standard--"sufficient" authority, authority to assign more than a "limited number of tasks," and authority that is exercised more than "occasionally"--have no clear meaning. Applying these standards would present daunting problems for the lower federal courts and for juries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the definition of "supervisor" that we adopt today, the question of supervisor status, when contested, can very often be resolved as a matter of law before trial. The elimination of this issue from the trial will focus the efforts of the parties, who will be able to present their cases in a way that conforms to the framework that the jury will apply. The plaintiff will know whether he or she must prove that the employer was negligent or whether the employer will have the burden of proving the elements of the <span class="Italic">Ellerth/Faragher</span> affirmative defense. Perhaps even more important, the work of the jury, which is inevitably complicated in employment discrimination cases, will be simplified. The jurors can be given preliminary instructions that allow them to understand, as the evidence comes in, how each item of proof fits into the framework that they will ultimately be required to apply. And even where the issue of supervisor status cannot be eliminated from the trial (because there are genuine factual disputes about an alleged harasser's authority to take tangible employment actions), this preliminary question is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The alternative approach advocated by petitioner and the United States would make matters far more complicated and difficult. The complexity of the standard they favor would impede the resolution of the issue before trial. With the issue still open when trial commences, the parties would be compelled to present evidence and argument on supervisor status, the affirmative defense, and the question of negligence, and the jury would have to grapple with all those issues as well. In addition, it would often be necessary for the jury to be instructed about two very different paths of analysis, i.e., what to do if the alleged harasser was found to be a supervisor and what to do if the alleged harasser was found to be merely a co-worker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts and commentators alike have opined on the need for reasonably clear jury instructions in employment discrimination cases. And the danger of juror confusion is particularly high where the jury is faced with instructions on alternative theories of liability under which different parties bear the burden of proof. By simplifying the process of determining who is a supervisor (and by extension, which liability rules apply to a given set of facts), the approach that we take will help to ensure that juries return verdicts that reflect the application of the correct legal rules to the facts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the dissent's suggestions, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 14, 17, this approach will not leave employees unprotected against harassment by co-workers who possess the authority to inflict psychological injury by assigning unpleasant tasks or by altering the work environment in objectionable ways. In such cases, the victims will be able to prevail simply by showing that the employer was negligent in permitting this harassment to occur, and the jury should be instructed that the nature and degree of authority wielded by the harasser is an important factor to be considered in determining whether the employer was negligent. The nature and degree of authority possessed by harassing employees varies greatly, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, 9-11 (offering examples), and as we explained above, the test proposed by petitioner and the United States is ill equipped to deal with the variety of situations that will inevitably arise. This variety presents no problem for the negligence standard, which is thought to provide <span id="Page_896"></span>adequate protection for tort plaintiffs in many other situations. There is no reason why this standard, if accompanied by proper instructions, cannot provide the same service in the context at issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent argues that the definition of a supervisor that we now adopt is out of touch with the realities of the workplace, where individuals with the power to assign daily tasks are often regarded by other employees as supervisors. <span class="Italic">See post</span>, at 5, 8-12. But in reality it is the alternative that is out of touch. Particularly in modern organizations that have abandoned a highly hierarchical management structure, it is common for employees to have overlapping authority with respect to the assignment of work tasks. Members of a team may each have the responsibility for taking the lead with respect to a particular aspect of the work and thus may have the responsibility to direct each other in that area of responsibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, petitioner argues that tying supervisor status to the authority to take tangible employment actions will encourage employers to attempt to insulate themselves from liability for workplace harassment by empowering only a handful of individuals to take tangible employment actions. But a broad definition of "supervisor" is not necessary to guard against this concern.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, an employer will always be liable when its negligence leads to the creation or continuation of a hostile work environment. And even if an employer concentrates all decisionmaking authority in a few individuals, it likely will not isolate itself from heightened liability under <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> and <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span>. If an employer does attempt to confine decisionmaking power to a small number of individuals, those individuals will have a limited ability to exercise independent discretion when making decisions and will likely rely on other workers who actually interact with the affected employee. <span class="Italic">Cf. Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp</span>., 359 F. 3d 498, 509 (CA7 2004) (Rovner, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("Although they did not have the power to take formal employment actions <span class="Italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> [the victim], [the harassers] necessarily must have had substantial input into those decisions, as they would have been the people most familiar with her work--certainly more familiar with it than the off-site Department Administrative Services Manager"). Under those circumstances, the employer may be held to have effectively delegated the power to take tangible employment actions to the employees on whose recommendations it relies. <span class="Italic">See Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S., at 762.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Importuning Congress, <span class="Italic">post</span>, at 21-22, the dissent suggests that the standard we adopt today would cause the plaintiffs to lose in a handful of cases involving shocking allegations of harassment, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 9-12. However, the dissent does not mention why the plaintiffs would lose in those cases. It is not clear in any of those examples that the legal outcome hinges on the definition of "supervisor." For example, Clara Whitten ultimately did not prevail on her discrimination claims--notwithstanding the fact that the Fourth Circuit adopted the approach advocated by the dissent, <span class="Italic">see Whitten v. Fred's, Inc</span>., 601 F. 3d 231, 243-247 (2010)--because the District Court subsequently dismissed her claims for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Whitten v. Fred's, Inc</span>., No. 8:08-0218-HMH-BHH, 2010 WL 2757005, *3 (D SC, July 12, 2010). And although the dissent suggests that Donna Rhodes' employer would have been liable under the dissent's definition of "supervisor," that is pure speculation: It is not clear that Rhodes suffered any tangible employment action, <span class="Italic">see Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp</span>., 243 F. Supp.2d 810, 817 (ND Ill. 2003), and no court had occasion to determine whether the employer could have established the affirmative defense (a prospect that is certainly feasible given that there was evidence that the employer had an "adequate antiharassment policy in place," that the employer promptly addressed the incidents about which Rhodes complained, and that "Rhodes failed to take advantage of the preventative or corrective opportunities provided," <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp</span>., 359 F. 3d, at 507). Finally, the dissent's reliance on Monika Starke's case is perplexing given that the EEOC ultimately did obtain relief (in the amount of $50,000) for the harassment of Starke, <span class="Italic">see</span> Order of Dismissal in No. 1:07-cv-0095-LRR (ND Iowa, Feb. 2, 2013), Dkt. No. 380, Exh. 1, &#x00B6; 1, notwithstanding the fact that the court in that case applied the definition of "supervisor" that we adopt today, <span class="Italic">see EEOC v. CRST Van Expedited, Inc</span>., 679 F. 3d 657, 684 (CA8 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, the dissent is wrong in claiming that our holding would preclude employer liability in other cases with facts similar to these. Assuming that a harasser is not a supervisor, a plaintiff could still prevail by showing that his or her employer was negligent in failing to prevent harassment from taking place. Evidence that an employer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond to complaints, failed to provide a system for registering complaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from being filed would be relevant. Thus, it is not true, as the dissent asserts, that our holding "relieves scores of employers of responsibility" for the behavior of workers they employ. <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard we adopt is not untested. It has been the law for quite some time in the First, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Noviello v. Boston</span>, 398 F. 3d 76, 96 (CA1 2005); <span class="Italic">Weyers v. Lear Operations Corp</span>., 359 F. 3d 1049, 1057 (CA8 2004); <span class="Italic">Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc</span>., 163 F. 3d 1027, 1033-1034, and n.1 (CA7 1998)--i.e., in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. We are aware of no evidence that this rule has produced dire consequences in these 14 jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite its rhetoric, the dissent acknowledges that Davis, the alleged harasser in this case, would probably not qualify as a supervisor even under the dissent's preferred approach. <span class="Italic">See post</span>, at 20 ("[T]here is cause to anticipate that Davis would not qualify as Vance's supervisor"). On that point, we agree. Petitioner did refer to Davis as a "supervisor" in some of the complaints that she filed, App. 28; <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 45, and Davis' job description does state that she supervises Kitchen Assistants and Substitutes and "[l]ead[s] and direct[s]" certain other employees, <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 12-13. But under the dissent's preferred approach, supervisor status hinges not on formal job titles or "paper descriptions" but on "specific facts about the working relationship." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 20-21 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the "specific facts" of petitioner's and Davis' working relationship, there is simply no evidence that Davis directed petitioner's day-to-day activities. The record indicates that Bill Kimes (the general manager of the Catering Division) and the chef assigned petitioner's daily tasks, which were given to her on "prep lists." No. 1:06-cv-1452-SEB-JMS, 2008 WL 4247836, *7 (SD Ind., Sept. 10, 2008); App. 430, 431. The fact that Davis sometimes may have handed prep lists to petitioner, <span class="Italic">see id</span>., at 74, is insufficient to confer supervisor status, <span class="Italic">see</span> App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a (EEOC Guidance). And Kimes--not Davis--set petitioner's work schedule. <span class="Italic">See</span> App. 431. <span class="Italic">See also id</span>., at 212.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the dissent concedes that our approach in this case deprives petitioner of none of the protections that Title VII offers, the dissent's critique is based on nothing more than a hypothesis as to how our approach might affect the outcomes of other cases--cases where an employee who cannot take tangible employment actions, but who does direct the victim's daily work activities in a meaningful way, creates an unlawful hostile environment, and yet does not wield authority of such a degree and nature that the employer can be deemed negligent with respect to the harassment. We are skeptical that there are a great number of such cases. However, we are confident that, in every case, the approach we take today will be more easily administrable than the approach advocated by the dissent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that an employee is a "supervisor" for purposes of vicarious liability under Title VII if he or she is empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. Because there is no evidence that BSU empowered Davis to take any tangible employment actions against Vance, the judgment of the Seventh Circuit is affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a dissent by Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Breyer. Sotomayor and Kagan, she called for Congress to pass a "Civil Rights Restoration Act" to reverse <span class="Italic">Vance</span> and <span class="Italic">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</span>, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf">133 S. Ct. 2517</a> (2013), decided on the same day, see <a href="0100-2023-25-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a>, and wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notably, respondent Ball State University agreed with petitioner Vance and the United States, as <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span>, that the tangible-employment-action-only test "does not necessarily capture all employees who may qualify as supervisors." "[V]icarious liability," Ball State acknowledged, "also may be triggered when the harassing employee has the authority to control the victim's daily work activities in a way that materially enables the harassment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 1-2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The different view taken by the Court today is out of accord with the agency principles that, <span class="Italic">Faragher</span> and <span class="Italic">Ellerth</span> affirmed, govern Title VII. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 3-4. It is blind to the realities of the workplace, and it discounts the guidance of the EEOC, the agency Congress established to interpret, and superintend the enforcement of, Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under that guidance, the appropriate question is: Has the employer given the alleged harasser authority to take tangible employment actions or to control the conditions under which subordinates do their daily work? If the answer to either inquiry is yes, vicarious liability is in order, for the superior-subordinate working arrangement facilitating the harassment is of the employer's making.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that does not appear to be affected by <span class="Italic">Vance</span>, the Commission held that when the supervisor who engages in harassing conduct does not have direct supervisory authority over the employee being harassed, the supervisory standard for liability will be used if the complainant reasonably believes the supervisor has authority over her daily activities. If the complainant could not reasonably believe that such authority existed, then the case is evaluated under the coworkers standard for liability. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A15109 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although H1 was a supervisor, because he did not have actual supervisory power over the complainant, we find that the complainant could not have reasonably believed that H1 had the authority to direct her daily activities. Therefore, the standard of employer liability for co-worker <span id="Page_897"></span>harassment applies. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span> (June 18, 1999). An employer is liable for co-worker harassment if it knew of or should have known of the misconduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. 29 C.F.R. 1604.11(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the LCOM's own testimony, he knew that other employees were intimidated by H1's religious beliefs and by H1's supervisory position as an Assistant Manager for Administration. The LCOM knew of H1's frequent religious interjections while involved in work related situations. Because the LCOM failed to take appropriate corrective action to prevent H1 from intimidating employees on the basis of religion, we find that the agency is liable for the actions of H1 in the instant case. In so finding, we note that "[a]n employer may be on notice of an employee's harassment of a co-worker where the employer is aware of other prior instances of harassment by the same individual of others, even if the [complainant] herself did not complain." Barbara Lindemann &#x0026; Paul Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law, 532-3 (3d ed. Supp. 2000), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. United States Postal Service</span>, 142 F.3d 1334, 1342 (10th Cir. 1998). Therefore, we find that the agency is liable for the harassment committed by H1. Because the agency had no prior knowledge of harassment by H2, we find that the LCOM took immediate and appropriate corrective action when responding to complainant's complaints of H2's behavior, and therefore the agency is not liable for H2's harassing actions.</p>
