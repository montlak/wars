<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec18-104"><span class="space">1.</span> Scope of Review</h4>
<p class="noindent">Where a security clearance is denied or revoked, what is reviewable by the Commission is any underlying employment action resulting from that suspension or revocation. For example, an allegation that male employees who had their security clearances revoked were allowed to retain their employment, while the female complainant was not, states a claim for relief that is within the Commission's purview. The act being challenged was not the revocation of the clearance, but the agency's subsequent employment decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Platt v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 01A20181 (2002); <span class="Italic">Hlatky v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 01A20173 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Thierjung v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 01852370, 1379 (1985), the Commission <span id="Page_1602"></span>determined that an allegation that the agency, for discriminatory reasons, did not follow the same procedures in conducting a security clearance review as it used for other employees stated a claim within the purview of Title VII. "Purview is solely a question of whether the appellant's complaint falls within an employment matter which is under the jurisdiction and control of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. Attorney General</span>, 01A02583 (2002) (revocation of security clearance cannot be challenged, but whether revocation process was discriminatory can); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A11698 (2001) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission's authority to review cases involving security clearances is heavily circumscribed due to the decision of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Department of Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 108 S. Ct. 818, 98 L. Ed.2d 918 (1988). In that case, the Court held that the Merit Systems Protection Board had no jurisdiction to review the merits of a denial or revocation of a security clearance in the context of an adverse action premised on the employee's loss of or failure to obtain a security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission is not permitted to review the merits of security clearance decisions or the actual requirement of a clearance itself. It may, however, review to determine if clearance considerations are applied in a nondiscriminatory manner.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission explained this restriction on its powers in <span class="Italic">Sifflett v. National Security Agency</span>, 01910403 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A long line of precedent limits the Commission's review of cases involving denial (or revocation) of a security clearance. The United States Supreme Court, in <span class="Italic">Department of Navy v. Egan</span>, 108 S. Ct. 818 (1988) stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It should be obvious that no one has a "right" to a security clearance....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">For reasons...too obvious to call for enlarged discussion,...the protection of classified information must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible, and this must include broad discretion to determine who may have access to it. Certainly, it is not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction with confidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 824, 825 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his complaint, appellant alleged that his application for access to classified information was denied due to discrimination based on his mental handicap (depression). Appellant is alleging a violation of the Rehabilitation Act, which specifically incorporates the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act. Consequently, the Commission finds that while not mentioned, Section 703(g) of the Civil Rights Act is likewise applicable when a violation of the Rehabilitation Act is alleged. <span class="Italic">Michael J. Lyons v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890839 (March 22, 1990). This section provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to refuse to employ any employee in any position which is subject to any requirement imposed in the interest of national security. Further, the Commission is precluded from reviewing the substance of security clearance decisions and the validity of the security requirement itself. <span class="Italic">Lyons</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890839 (March 22, 1990); <span class="Italic">see also</span> "Policy Guidance on the Use of National Security Exception Contained in 703(g) of Title VII of the Civil Rights of 1964, as amended," EEOC Notice No. N-915-041 (May 1, 1989). The Commission may, however, determine whether the security clearance considerations are applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">Chatlin v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900188 (June 1, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Grannell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120090581 (2011) (national security clearance exception in Title VII applies to Rehabilitation Act cases).</p>
<p class="noindent">The most sweeping and extensive description of the Commission's review and remedial authority in cases involving security clearances comes in <span class="Italic">Fonda-Wall v. Attorney General</span>, 0720060035 (2009). In that case, a supervisor and coworkers conducted what began as a consensual affair. After the coworker ended the affair, she was subjected first to sexual abuse and later verbal abuse that often occurred in front of other coworkers. The complainant not only reported the abuse on several occasions, but on one occasion physically stepped between the supervisor and coworker when he was subjecting her to verbal abuse and standing so close that she could not stand up. That started a several month chain of events that resulted in the agency advising the complainant that her clearance would be suspended because she had disclosed classified information. She was suspended from work for 24 days. The agency then advised the complainant that because her clearance had been suspended, she was being reassigned to a nonsensitive position in another state and refusal to accept the position would result in removal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Fonda-Wall</span> found that all of the incidents were based on retaliation for protected activity. As a result, he ordered the agency to either reactivate the complainant's clearance or reconsider its decision absent the retaliatory influences, to reinstate the complainant to her former position and revoke the suspension. On appeal, the agency argued that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> precluded the Commission from reviewing security clearances and that the relief was beyond the Commission's jurisdiction to grant. In a lengthy and detailed rejection of the agency's arguments, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Fonda-Wall</span>, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here the AJ found that the suspension of complainant's security clearance was a direct result of S1's retaliation, and therefore the suspension and the resulting adverse employment actions were discriminatory. The seminal case of <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span> provides the legal framework for analyzing security clearance related claims. 484 U.S. 518, 520 (1988). There, the Supreme Court determined that the Merit Systems Protection Board did not have "the authority to review the substance of an underlying decision to deny or revoke a security clearance in the course of reviewing an adverse action." Further, the Supreme Court noted that "the grant of security clearance to a particular employee, a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call, is committed by law to the appropriate agency of the Executive Branch." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 527. Additionally, the Court held that, since each agency must have broad discretion to determine who may have access to classified information, an outside non-expert body could not "review the substance of a judgment and...decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction with confidence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 529. The Court further held that no outside body could determine what "constitutes an acceptable margin of error in assessing the potential risk," and considered it "extremely unlikely" that Congress intended to "involve the [MSPB] in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 531.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1989, the Commission issued policy guidance on the national security exception, explaining that it is an affirmative defense to a charge of discrimination. Policy Guidance on the Use of National Security Exception Contained in &#x00A7; 703(g) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (EEOC National Security Guidance), EEOC Notice No. N-915-041 (May 1, 1989). As such, employers must raise the affirmative defense and prove that the employment decision at issue was made because of national security requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, the Commission restated that no one has a right to a security clearance and non-expert bodies cannot second guess the decisions of agency heads in determining who is qualified to receive a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> at 528). Therefore, the Commission is "precluded from reviewing the substance of security clearance decisions [and] from reviewing the validity of the security requirement itself." EEOC National Security Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and EEOC National Security Guidance, the Commission has consistently affirmed the dismissal of complainants' claims alleging that they were subjected to discrimination due to their security clearance being revoked or denied, finding that such claims fail to state a claim pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1), and are outside the purview of the Commission's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rezaee v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A60451 (April 25, 2006) (citing EEOC National Security Guidance); <span class="Italic">Carr v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A44011 (November 4, 2004) (citing EEOC National Security Guidance). However, the Commission retains authority to review whether the grant, denial, or revocation of a security clearance was carried out in a discriminatory manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Department of Defense (Defense</span><span class="Italic"> </span> <span class="Italic">Mapping Agency),</span> EEOC Request No. 05930248 (April 14, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dodson v. Department of Defense</span>, the Commission found discrimination where a manager sought to have an employee's clearance revoked in retaliation for filing EEO complaints. EEOC Appeal No. 01954101 (June 13, 1997). The Commission did not address whether the agency actually decided to revoke the clearance, nor did it analyze the substance of any information that was part of the decision to grant or revoke the clearance. The decision addressed the manager's motivation for seeking to have the employee's clearance removed. Further, in <span class="Italic">Chatlin v. Navy</span>, the Commission found that an agency's decision to initiate a review of a security clearance was not the result of any substantive decision making process, and was thus reviewable by the Commission. EEOC Request No. 05900188 (June 1, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ determined the initiation of the investigation into complainant's security clearance was retaliatory. Specifically, the AJ found that complainant did not reveal sensitive national security information to X, and S1 willfully lied and influenced X to lie in retaliation for complainant opposing S1's sexual harassment of her coworker. The AJ found that the suspension of the security clearance was discriminatory and ordered the agency to reinstate the security clearance or, in the alternative, to reconsider the suspension without considering any retaliatory information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that this case presents a situation within the Commission's authority. Here, it is undisputed that the motivation to investigate and suspend complainant's security clearance was based upon the discriminatory actions of S1. We note that we are not questioning the agency's judgment as to whether complainant should have access to sensitive information; the agency never made a determination on the merits of whether complainant's security clearance should be revoked for revealing sensitive information because the investigation was abandoned <span id="Page_1603"></span>by the agency after complainant was relocated. While we find that the AJ was correct in finding that S1's motivation for initiating the suspension of complainant's security clearance was retaliatory, we agree with the agency that the Commission lacks jurisdiction to order an agency to reactivate an individual's security clearance. However, we find that the Commission does have jurisdiction to order the agency to reactivate the abandoned security clearance investigation. In its final agency decision, the agency acknowledged that it should reconsider complainant's suspension of her security clearance in light of S1's retaliation. Therefore, we affirm the AJ's finding that the investigation and security clearance suspension were based on retaliation, and affirm that the agency must reactivate the investigation into complainant's security clearance suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the AJ found that the suspension of complainant's top secret security clearance resulted in three agency actions taken against complainant: her 24-day suspension, her three-month involuntary assignment on detail, and her permanent involuntary reassignment. The AJ found that since the underlying suspension of her security clearance was retaliatory, the resulting adverse actions were discriminatory as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserts that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over these claims since they arose from the suspension of the security clearance. We note that Commission decisions have distinguished between claims in which complainants are alleging that their security clearances were revoked and claims in which complainants are alleging that they were removed or suffered some adverse action subsequent to their security clearances being revoked. <span class="Italic">See Okuma v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A31383 (October 14, 2003) (complainant's allegations that he was reassigned to a non-sensitive area after his security clearance was revoked states a claim); <span class="Italic">Lyons v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890839 (March 22, 1990) (the Commission has limited review where an individual has been denied a position or discharged from a position because he does not have a security clearance); <span class="Italic">Zimmerman v. National Archives and Record Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920102 (January 24, 1992) (the Commission found that it was not precluded from considering whether an employee with a disability could be reassigned to a non-sensitive position after his security clearance had been denied). Therefore, we are permitted to look at the subsequent adverse actions against complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given our decision that the initiation of the suspension of the security clearance was discriminatory, the agency's subsequent reliance on the suspension of the security clearance to justify the subsequent actions taken against complainant is not legitimate. Specifically, the agency articulated that complainant was suspended for 24 days because she disclosed sensitive information. Further, the agency stated that complainant was detailed because her security clearance was suspended during the investigation, and her position required a clearance. Finally, complainant was reassigned to another state because her security clearance was suspended.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant must now show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency's articulated reasons for its actions were pretext for discrimination. We first note that complainant was suspended because of the allegations that she breached security, not because her security clearance was suspended. Besides the oriGINAl accounts of S1 and X, the record does not contain any evidence that would support the agency's articulated reason for the 24-day suspension. A preponderance of the evidence of record supports complainant's assertion that she did not disclose sensitive information as alleged by S1. S1 willfully fabricated the allegations against complainant in an attempt to retaliate against her for opposing his sexual harassment of her coworker. Additionally, the record supports complainant's assertion that S1 influenced X to corroborate the allegations. Complainant has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that retaliation was more likely than not a motivating factor in the 24-day suspension. Therefore, we find that the agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, complainant must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency's articulated reasons for detailing complainant and permanently reassigning her to another state are pretext for discrimination. The agency asserts that complainant was detailed and reassigned because her security clearance was suspended. Not only has complainant established that the articulated reasons are not legitimate, but she has also offered additional evidence that would establish that the agency's articulated reasons are pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the record shows that two other individuals, who had never engaged in prior protected EEO activity, had their security clearances suspended yet were permitted to either stay in the their current positions or take paid administrative leave. Specifically, S1 had his security clearance suspended due to domestic violence and a violation of a temporary restraining order. While his security clearance was suspended he was permitted to stay in his assigned location. The only responsibility taken away from him was the ability to authorize financial disbursements. Further, when another employee in complainant's job title had his security clearance suspended he was placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of his investigation and was not forced to go on detail to a non-sensitive position. Memoranda in the record suggest that S1 played a part in the decision to detail complainant and ultimately reassign her. Further, the agency failed to rebut complainant's evidence that there were non-sensitive positions in her location that were vacant and complainant was qualified for that she could have been placed in pending the outcome of the investigation. Complainant has established that retaliation was more likely than not a motivating factor in the decision to detail complainant and permanently reassign her. Therefore, we find that the agency's articulated reasons are pretext for discrimination.</p>
