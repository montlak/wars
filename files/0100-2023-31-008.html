<h2 class="h2" id="sec22-9"><span class="space">II.</span> PREVAILING PARTIES</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to be eligible for an award of attorney fees, the complainant must first be the prevailing party. This is different from many other statutes that allow for recovery of fees, in that the complainant is not required to show that an award of fees would be in the "interests of justice," or meet any other discretionary standards for entitlement to the award. In many respects, this substantially reduces the amount of paperwork involved in seeking an award of fees and costs. The employee's representative will be able to avoid writing lengthy dissertations on why the complainant is entitled to fees. This is in sharp contrast to fee petitions filed with the Merit Systems Protection Board, where counsel must spend significant time establishing entitlement to fees under the various standards approved by the Board.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the EEOC has the discretion to fashion remedies to the individual case, victories are not always clear cut and counsel may have to address the issue of whether or not the employee actually has prevailed on the complaint. The Commission adopted the definition of a prevailing party set forth in <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983). "[P]laintiffs may be considered 'prevailing parties' for attorney's fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit." <span class="Italic">Haddock v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01830822 (1983). In that case, the relief of priority consideration and expungement of any adverse material from personnel files was sufficient for prevailing party status.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the employee has not been awarded the full relief sought in the complaint, counsel should submit a brief with the affidavit and statement of fees with arguments on why the employee is the prevailing party. The brief need not be lengthy, depending upon the disparity between the relief sought and that awarded, but it is an issue best addressed up front, rather than in an appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In MD-110 at 11-9 to 11-10, the Commission has issued general guidance on prevailing party status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;A "prevailing party," within the meaning of Section 706(k) of Title VII, 42 USC 2000e-5(k), is a complainant who has succeeded on any significant issue that achieved some of the benefit the complainant sought in filing the complaint<span class="Italic">. Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland I.S.D.</span>, 489 U.S. 782 (1989). The Commission has relied on a two-part test set forth in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Staats</span>, 706 F.2d 336 (D.C. Cir. 1983), for determining whether a complainant is a prevailing party<span class="Italic">. Baldwin v. Department <span id="Page_1977"></span>of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910016 (April 12, 1991). To satisfy the first part of the test, the complainant must have substantially received the relief sought<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> To satisfy the second part of the test, there must be a determination that the complaint was a catalyst motivating the agency to provide the relief<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> (<span class="Italic">citing Miller</span>, 706 F.2d at 341). A purely technical or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> success is insufficient to confer "prevailing party" status<span class="Italic">. Texas State Teachers Ass'n</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The touchstone is whether the actual relief on the merits materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the agency's behavior in a way that directly benefits the complainant<span class="Italic">. Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103 (1992); <span class="Italic">Bragg v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945699 (March 7, 1996). Even an award of nominal monetary damages may be sufficient to meet this standard<span class="Italic">. Farrar</span>. Monetary relief is not required; non-monetary relief such as reinstatement or a higher performance rating is sufficient<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. W. VA. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 121 S. Ct. 1835 (2001), the Supreme Court rejected the "catalyst theory" as a basis for determining prevailing party status. The Court held that under the attorney fee provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the American with Disabilities Act a plaintiff must either prevail through an enforceable judgment, a consent decree or a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree in order to be considered the prevailing party for purposes of a fee award. Significantly, with respect to EEO cases, the Court, in a footnote to its opinion, noted that the attorney fee provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was nearly identical to the FHAA and ADA attorney fee provisions and relied heavily upon its jurisprudence in Title VII cases to reach the result in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the plaintiff, which operated an assisted-care living facility, was cited for violations of West Virginia law that provided all residents of residential care facilities must be capable of "self-preservation" or otherwise capable of moving themselves out of danger from such hazards as fire. The facility sued the state Department of Health and Human Resources maintaining that state law violated the FHAA and the ADA. While the case was still pending in the U.S. district court, the state legislature repealed the self-preservation provisions of the health code. The district court dismissed the case as moot, and relying on <span class="Italic">S-1 and S-2 v. State Bd. of Ed. N.C.</span>, 21 F.3d 49 (4th Cir. 1994), held that the facility was not entitled to an award of attorney fees as a prevailing party under the theory that its lawsuit was the catalyst for legislative change. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 121 S. Ct. at 1838-43, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Numerous federal statutes allow courts to award attorney's fees and costs to the "prevailing party." The question presented here is whether this term includes a party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree, but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. We hold that it does not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., which operates care homes that provide assisted living to their residents, failed an inspection by the West Virginia Office of the State Fire Marshal because some of the residents were incapable of "self-preservation" as defined under state law.<span class="Italic"> See</span> W. Va. Code 16-5H-1, 16-5H-2 (1998) (requiring that all residents of residential board and care homes be capable of "self-preservation," or capable of moving themselves "from situations involving imminent danger, such as fire"); W. Va. Code of State Rules, tit. 87, ser. 1, 14.07(1) (1995) (same). On October 28, 1997, after receiving cease and desist orders requiring the closure of its residential care facilities within 30 days, Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., on behalf of itself and other similarly situated homes and residents (hereinafter petitioners), brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia against the State of West Virginia, two of its agencies, and 18 individuals (hereinafter respondents), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the "self-preservation" requirement violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), 102 Stat. 1619, 42 USC 3601 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 USC 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondents agreed to stay enforcement of the cease and desist orders pending resolution of the case and the parties began discovery. In 1998, the West Virginia Legislature enacted two bills eliminating the "self-preservation" requirement,<span class="Italic"> see</span> H.R. 4200, I 1998 W. Va. Acts 983-986 (amending regulations); S. 627, II 1998 W. Va. Acts 1198-1199 (amending statute), and respondents moved to dismiss the case as moot. The District Court granted the motion, finding that the 1998 legislation had eliminated the allegedly offensive provisions and that there was no indication that the West Virginia Legislature would repeal the amendments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioners requested attorney's fees as the "prevailing party" under the FHAA, 42 USC 3613(c)(2) ("[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party...a reasonable attorney's fee and costs"), and ADA, 42 USC 12205 ("[T]he court..., in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party...a reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs"). Petitioners argued that they were entitled to attorney's fees under the "catalyst theory," which posits that a plaintiff is a "prevailing party" if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. Although most Courts of Appeals recognize the "catalyst theory," the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected it in <span class="Italic">S-1 and S-2 v. State Bd. of Ed. of N. C.,</span> 21 F.3d 49, 51 (C.A.4 1994 (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("A person may not be a 'prevailing party'...except by virtue of having obtained an enforceable judgment, consent decree, or settlement giving some of the legal relief sought"). The District Court accordingly denied the motion and, for the same reason, the Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished, <span class="Italic">per curiam</span> opinion. Judgt. order reported at 203 F.3d 819 (C.A.4 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To resolve the disagreement amongst the Courts of Appeals, we granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>, 530 U.S. 1304, 121 S. Ct. 28, 147 L. Ed.2d 1050 (2000), and now affirm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the United States, parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney's fees--the prevailing party is not entitled to collect from the loser.<span class="Italic"> See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society</span>, 421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 44 L. Ed.2d 141 (1975). Under this "American Rule," we follow "a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority." <span class="Italic">Key Tronic Corp. v. United States,</span> 511 U.S. 809, 819, 114 S. Ct. 1960, 128 L. Ed.2d 797 (1994). Congress, however, has authorized the award of attorney's fees to the "prevailing party" in numerous statutes in addition to those at issue here, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 259, 42 USC 2000e-5(k), the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, 89 Stat. 402, 42 USC 19731 (e), and the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 USC 1988<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Marek v. Chesny,</span> 473 U.S. 1, 43-51, 105 S. Ct. 3012, 87 L. Ed.2d 1 (1985) (Appendix to opinion of Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In designating those parties eligible for an award of litigation costs, Congress employed the term "prevailing party," a legal term of art. Black's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed. 1999) defines "prevailing party" as "[a] party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded in certain cases, the court will award attorney's fees to the prevailing party.--Also termed <span class="Italic">successful party</span>." This view that a "prevailing party" is one who has been awarded some relief by the court can be distilled from our prior cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hanrahan v. Hampton,</span> 446 U.S. 754, 758, 100 S. Ct. 1987, 64 L. Ed.2d 670 1980 <span class="Italic">(per curiam),</span> we reviewed the legislative history of 1988 and found that "Congress intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims." Our "[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail." <span class="Italic">Hewitt v. Helms,</span> 482 U.S. 755, 760, 107 S. Ct. 2672, 96 L. Ed.2d 654 (1987). We have held that even an award of nominal damages suffices under this test.<span class="Italic"> See Farrar v. Hobby,</span> 506 U.S. 103, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to judgments on the merits, we have held that settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree may serve as the basis for an award of attorney's fees<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Maher v. Gagne,</span> 448 U.S. 122, 100 S. Ct. 2570, 65 L. Ed.2d 653 (1980). Although a consent decree does not always include an admission of liability by the defendant, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., id.,</span> at 126, n.8, 100 S. Ct. 2570, it nonetheless is a court-ordered "chang[e] [in] the legal relationship between [the plaintiff] and the defendant." <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,</span> 489 U.S. 782, 792, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 103 L. Ed.2d 866 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Hewitt, supra,</span> at 760-761, 107 S. Ct. 2672, and <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Stewart,</span> 488 U.S. 1, 3-4, 109 S. Ct. 202, 102 L. Ed.2d 1 (1988) <span class="Italic">(per curiam)</span>). These decisions, taken together, establish that enforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties" necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees. 489 U.S., at 792-793, 109 S. Ct. 1486; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hanrahan, supra,</span> at 757, 100 S. Ct. 1987 ("[I]t seems clearly to have been the intent of Congress to permit...an interlocutory award only to a party who has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims, either in the <span class="Italic">trial court</span> or <span class="Italic">on appeal</span>" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We think, however, the "catalyst theory" falls on the other side of the line from these examples. It allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties. Even under a limited form of the "catalyst theory," a plaintiff could recover attorney's fees if it established that the "complaint had sufficient merit to withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted." Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 27. This is not the type of legal merit that our prior decisions, based upon plain language and congressional intent, have found necessary. Indeed, we held in <span class="Italic">Hewitt</span> that an interlocutory ruling that reverses a dismissal for failure to state a claim "is not the stuff of which legal victories are made." 482 U.S., at 760, 107 S. Ct. 2672. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hanrahan, supra,</span> at 754, 100 S. Ct. 1987 (reversal of a directed verdict for defendant does not make plaintiff a "prevailing party"). A defendant's voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial <span class="Italic">imprimatur</span> on the change. Our precedents thus counsel against holding that the term "prevailing party" <span id="Page_1978"></span>authorizes an award of attorney's fees <span class="Italic">without</span> a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissenters chide us for upsetting "long-prevailing <span class="Italic">Circuit</span> precedent." <span class="Italic">Post,</span> at 1850 (emphasis added). But, as Justice SCALIA points out in his concurrence, several Courts of Appeals have relied upon dicta in our prior cases in approving the "catalyst theory."<span class="Italic"> See post,</span> at 1843; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> at 1839, n.5. Now that the issue is squarely presented, it behooves us to reconcile the plain language of the statutes with our prior <span class="Italic">holdings</span>. We have only awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has received a judgment on the merits, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Farrar, supra,</span> at 112, 113 S. Ct. 566, or obtained a court-ordered consent decree, <span class="Italic">Maher, supra,</span> at 129-130, 100 S. Ct. 2570--we have not awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has secured the reversal of a directed verdict,<span class="Italic"> see Hanrahan, supra,</span> at 759, 100 S. Ct. 1987, or acquired a judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the Constitution unaccompanied by "judicial relief,"<span class="Italic"> Hewitt, supra,</span> at 760, 107 S. Ct. 2672 (emphasis added). Never have we awarded attorney's fees for a nonjudicial "alteration of actual circumstances." <span class="Italic">Post,</span> at 1856. While urging an expansion of our precedents on this front, the dissenters would simultaneously abrogate the "merit" requirement of our prior cases and award attorney's fees where the plaintiff's claim "was at least colorable" and "not...groundless." <span class="Italic">Post,</span> at 1852 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We cannot agree that the term "prevailing party" authorizes federal courts to award attorney's fees to a plaintiff who, by simply filing a nonfrivolous but nonetheless potentially meritless lawsuit (it will never be determined), has reached the "sought-after destination" without obtaining any judicial relief<span class="Italic">. Post,</span> at 1856 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioners nonetheless argue that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act supports a broad reading of "prevailing party" which includes the "catalyst theory." We doubt that legislative history could overcome what we think is the rather clear meaning of "prevailing party"--the term actually used in the statute. Since we resorted to such history in <span class="Italic">Garland,</span> 489 U.S., at 790, 109 S. Ct. 1486, <span class="Italic">Maher,</span> 448 U.S., at 129, 100 S. Ct. 2570, and <span class="Italic">Hanrahan,</span> 446 U.S., at 756-757, 100 S. Ct. 1987, however, we do likewise here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The House Report to 1988 states that "[t]he phrase 'prevailing party' is not intended to be limited to the victor only after entry of a final judgment following a full trial on the merits," H.R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 7 (1976), while the Senate Report explains that "parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief," S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1976, pp. 5908,5912. Petitioners argue that these Reports and their reference to a 1970 decision from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, <span class="Italic">Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co</span>., 433 F.2d 421 (C.A.8 1970), indicate Congress' intent to adopt the "catalyst theory." We think the legislative history cited by petitioners is at best ambiguous as to the availability of the "catalyst theory" for awarding attorney's fees. Particularly in view of the "American Rule" that attorney's fees will not be awarded absent "explicit statutory authority," such legislative history is clearly insufficient to alter the accepted meaning of the statutory term<span class="Italic">. Key Tronic</span>, 511 U.S., at 819, 114 S. Ct. 1960;<span class="Italic"> see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hanrahan, supra</span>, at 758, 100 S. Ct. 1987 ("[O]nly when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims...has there been a determination of the 'substantial rights of the parties,' which Congress determined was a necessary foundation for departing from the usual rule in this country that each party is to bear the expense of his own attorney" (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 8)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioners finally assert that the "catalyst theory" is necessary to prevent defendants from unilaterally mooting an action before judgment in an effort to avoid an award of attorney's fees. They also claim that the rejection of the "catalyst theory" will deter plaintiffs with meritorious but expensive cases from bringing suit. We are skeptical of these assertions, which are entirely speculative and unsupported by any empirical evidence (<span class="Italic">e.g</span>., whether the number of suits brought in the Fourth Circuit has declined, in relation to other Circuits, since the decision in <span class="Italic">S-1 and S-2</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioners discount the disincentive that the "catalyst theory" may have upon a defendant's decision to voluntarily change its conduct, conduct that may not be illegal. "The defendants' potential liability for fees in this kind of litigation can be as significant as, and sometimes even more significant than, their potential liability on the merits," <span class="Italic">Evans v. Jeff D</span>., 475 U.S. 717, 734, 106 S. Ct. 1531, 89 L. Ed.2d 747 (1986), and the possibility of being assessed attorney's fees may well deter a defendant from altering its conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And petitioners' fear of mischievous defendants only materializes in claims for equitable relief, for so long as the plaintiff has a cause of action for damages, a defendant's change in conduct will not moot the case. Even then, it is not clear how often courts will find a case mooted: "It is well settled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice" unless it is "absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." <span class="Italic">Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc</span>., 528 U.S. 167, 189, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed.2d 610 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). If a case is not found to be moot, and the plaintiff later procures an enforceable judgment, the court may of course award attorney's fees. Given this possibility, a defendant has a strong incentive to enter a settlement agreement, where it can negotiate attorney's fees and costs<span class="Italic">. Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Marek v. Chesny</span>, 473 U.S., at 7, 105 S. Ct. 3012 ("[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liability for attorney's fees in whatever amount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have also stated that "[a] request for attorney's fees should not result in a second major litigation," <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983), and have accordingly avoided an interpretation of the fee-shifting statutes that would have "spawn[ed] a second litigation of significant dimension," <span class="Italic">Garland</span> 489 U.S., at 791, 109 S. Ct. 1486. Among other things, a "catalyst theory" hearing would require analysis of the defendant's subjective motivations in changing its conduct, an analysis that "will likely depend on a highly factbound inquiry and may turn on reasonable inferences from the nature and timing of the defendant's change in conduct." Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 28. Although we do not doubt the ability of district courts to perform the nuanced "three thresholds" test required by the "catalyst theory"--whether the claim was colorable rather than groundless; whether the lawsuit was a substantial rather than an insubstantial cause of the defendant's change in conduct; whether the defendant's change in conduct was motivated by the plaintiff's threat of victory rather than threat of expense, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 1852--it is clearly not a formula for "ready administrability." <span class="Italic">Burlington v. Dague</span>, 505 U.S. 557, 566, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the clear meaning of "prevailing party" in the fee-shifting statutes, we need not determine which way these various policy arguments cut. In <span class="Italic">Alyeska</span>, 421 U.S., at 260, 95 S. Ct. 1612, we said that Congress had not "extended any roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted." To disregard the clear legislative language and the holdings of our prior cases on the basis of such policy arguments would be a similar assumption of a "roving authority." For the reasons stated above, we hold that the "catalyst theory" is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney's fees under the FHAA, 42 USC 3613(c)(2), and ADA, 42 USC 12205.</p>
<p class="noindent">A final agency decision with a finding of discrimination is not a voluntary change in conduct subject to <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>. There is no need to rely upon the catalyst theory for prevailing party status when the agency's EEO office, as a neutral adjudicator, has made a finding of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Arnold v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03A2003 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that would appear to depart from the <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> rule, the Commission awarded fees where the complainant filed an enforcement petition and the agency subsequently complied by correcting the back pay award. As a result, the Commission declined the petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Sheehy v. National Security Agency</span>, 0120101664 (2013). The <span class="Italic">Sheehy</span> decision makes no mention of <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> and only notes that the complainant's counsel spent a significant amount of time getting the agency to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement. The <span class="Italic">Sheehy</span> case has a long and complicated history with numerous appeals, petitions for enforcement and a clarification petition. The Commission had previously determined that the agency was in breach of the settlement agreement--a proceeding in which the complainant was the prevailing party. Though not articulated in the 2013 <span class="Italic">Sheehy</span> decision, it could be the Commission considered it merely an extension of the previous compliance proceeding in which the complainant was the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Jansen v. Department of Navy</span>, 01880180 (1988), explained the two-prong test it adopted for determining prevailing party status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the first prong appellant must show that the final result represents a disposition that furthers his interests. The only question at this point of the inquiry is whether appellant has received any benefit at all. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Staats</span>, 706 F.2d at 341, n.30 (1st Cir. 1983). In the second prong appellant must demonstrate that his claims were not wholly unsubstantial and that these claims contributed to his obtaining the resulting relief. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 341, n.31 and 32. For purposes of the attorneys fees provisions, appellant need only allege a claim that is colorable under the civil rights laws--that has some minimum basis in law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 342.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the <span class="Italic">Jansen</span> case, the Commission found the complainant had benefited from the settlement agreement entered and that he had presented a claim that was not frivolous or wholly insubstantial. The Commission also found in <span class="Italic">Jansen</span> the complaint was the catalyst for the settlement and that the agency had not shown that an award of fees would be unjust:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the agency has failed to show that such special circumstances exist such that an award of attorney's fees would be <span id="Page_1979"></span>unjust. We note that in deciding whether such special circumstances exist, we may not consider the absence of a finding of wrongdoing, the possibility that the agency was not motivated by bad faith or that the agency entered into the settlement agreement to avoid the costs of a hearing. The key issue is the provocative role of the appellant's complaint, not the motivations of the agency....</p>
<p class="noindent">In this regard, the focus was not on the motivation of the agency. "The determinative factor must be the role of the plaintiff's lawsuit...." <span class="Italic">Jansen</span>, <span class="Italic">on reconsideration</span>, 05880641 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">More recently, the Commission followed the test enunciated in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992), to determine prevailing party status. That test focuses on whether the complainant has succeeded in a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties--a test which was not changed by <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Booker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933566 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he <span class="Italic">Miller</span> court stated that this inquiry must initially focus on the "precise factual/legal condition that the fee claimant has sought to change, and then determine if the outcome, compared to this oriGINAl condition, confers an actual benefit or relief from a burden." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 706 F.2d at 341 n.30. More recently, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that an individual would be entitled to legal fees only where the outcome of an action materially alters "the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff." <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 113 S. Ct. 566, 573 (1992)....</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Booker</span>, the Commission found the complainant was the prevailing party when he succeeded, through settlement, in having hours charged as AWOL changed to leave without pay. However, in remanding the case to the agency, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Booker</span> noted the settlement was, at best, a modest modification of the legal relationship between the parties and made no determination on the complainant's ultimate entitlement to fees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making this determination, the Commission remains mindful of the Supreme Court's recent admonition that "'the most critical factor' in determining the reasonableness of the fee award 'is the degree of success obtained,'" <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 574 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436), and we note that if "a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436. As the Court further stated in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, a plaintiff indeed may prevail on an issue raised in a case but not be entitled to any attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Anderson Electrical Contractors</span>, 944 F.2d 841 (11th Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 113 S. Ct. 1043 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the "material alteration" test of <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> was not changed by <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, it does appear that a settlement agreement reached between the parties and not made part of an order of judgment cannot form the basis for a fee award based on prevailing party status. In footnote 7 of the <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> opinion, the Court specifically noted that "[p]rivate settlements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees. And federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual agreement will often be lacking unless the terms of agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal." 121 S. Ct. at 1840. It is not entirely clear that this footnote applies in federal sector cases because the Commission's regulations give it jurisdiction over settlement agreements for purposes of enforcement, regardless of whether the terms of the agreement are incorporated into any dismissal order. In any event, it must be understood that the footnote in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> does not address the situation where the parties, in a settlement agreement, provide for the payment of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> does not bar the parties from agreeing to fees and would only apply in those cases where the settlement agreement is silent on the issue of fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without any analysis of footnote 7 or its ramifications, in <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01990920 (2002), the Commission awarded attorney fees to the complainant as a prevailing party where the agency made an offer of full relief at the hearing stage. The complainant accepted the offer only two days after retaining an attorney. However, the complainant subsequently claimed that the agency breached the offer of full relief. As a result, the agency clarified its offer and made additional concessions which were reflected in an order issued by the administrative judge. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Carroll</span> held the agency liable for fees incurred in clarifying the offer. Though not specifically mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Carroll</span> decision, it appears the case came within the parameters of footnote 7 in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> because the final settlement agreement was set forth in the judge's order.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Glazer v. International Trade Commission</span>, 01A14176 (2002), the Commission held that <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> prohibited an award of attorney fees where the agency voluntarily created a reassignment position as a reasonable accommodation and then dismissed the complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, while complainant's EEO complaint primarily concerned the agency's revocation of his reasonable accommodation, and complainant clearly obtained a benefit when the agency subsequently provided him with a reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, he nonetheless cannot be considered a "prevailing party" under the holding in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>. Specifically, we find that complainant's EEO complaint was not "successfully processed," to include reaching a decision on the merits of his claims, because the agency dismissed it pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.107, a determination which complainant does not appeal. Moreover, in light of the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the agency's motivation in providing complainant with a reasonable accommodation is immaterial because "prevailing party" status can no longer be conferred under the "catalyst theory." Furthermore, notwithstanding complainant's arguments to the contrary, we do not find that the agency's March 30, 2001 notice offering complainant a reassignment to a newly created position as a reasonable accommodation is a "decision on the merits" of his EEO complaint, given that the agency specifically informed complainant that he was entitled to the accommodation regardless of whether or not he continued to pursue his EEO complaint. Therefore, without a merits determination and/or order from the Commission requiring the agency to provide complainant with a reasonable accommodation, we find that complainant is not a "prevailing party" under the <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> holding. Additionally, given the disposition of this appeal, we further find that complainant is not entitled to attorney's fees for pursuing this appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03930021 (1994), the Commission expanded on the <span class="Italic">Booker</span> decision and its interpretation of <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>. In <span class="Italic">Lopez</span>, the employees filed appeals with the MSPB when they were removed from their positions. The petitioners contended they were discriminated against on the basis of their physical disabilities. The Board entered a finding of no discrimination. On review, the EEOC found the agency had failed to properly consider the employees for reassignment prior to removing them. The Commission entered a finding of discrimination and remanded the case to the Board with instructions for the agency to conduct an individualized assessment of each employee's eligibility for reassignment. Ultimately, after those assessments, both the Board and Commission agreed that none of the employees were eligible for reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found the employees satisfied the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> test in that they succeeded in achieving a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties. The agency was required to perform individualized assessments. However, in <span class="Italic">Lopez</span>, the Commission found that because of the limited degree of success, the only reasonable fee was no fee at all:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission, like the Board, has long held that attorney's fees may only be awarded to "prevailing parties," and the Commission has adopted the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span> for determining when a party has prevailed for purposes of entitlement to attorney's fees. Petitioners will be considered prevailing parties if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 433. The Supreme Court has elaborated on the definition of prevailing party in four recent cases. In <span class="Italic">Hewitt v. Helms</span>, the Court required the plaintiff to receive at least some relief on the merits of the claim before he could be said to prevail<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 760. In <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Stewart</span>, the Court reversed an award of attorney's fees premised solely on a declaratory judgment where one of the plaintiffs had died and the other was no longer in the custody of prison officials who violated the plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 2. In <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.</span>, the Court held that to be considered a prevailing party, the plaintiff must show a "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>, at 792-793. Finally and most recently, in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, the Court pronounced that to qualify as a prevailing party, the plaintiff must obtain an enforceable judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 573.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the Court stated that, "In short, a plaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 573. The Court specifically stated that the magnitude of the relief obtained is not dispositive in determining whether or not the parties "prevailed" for fee award purposes<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In this manner the court emphasized that the alteration of the legal relationship between the parties is of paramount importance. The Court found the plaintiffs to be prevailing parties in this case because the plaintiffs were entitled to enforce a judgment against the defendant, resulting in a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the Court awarded no attorney's fees. In this regard, the Commission notes that the Court applied a two-part analysis in determining entitlement to attorney's fees. The Court stated that, "Once civil rights litigation materially alters the legal relationship between the parties, 'the degree of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the reasonableness' of a fee award.<span class="Italic">" Id.</span>, at 574, <span class="Italic">citing, Garland, supra</span>, 489 U.S., at 793. The Court found that because an award of nominal damages highlighted the plaintiffs' failure to prove an essential element of their claim for monetary damages, the only reasonable fee was no fee at all<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 575. The Court thus applied the test cited in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> for determining the reasonableness of the award, "the degree of success obtained," to conclude that the plaintiffs were entitled to no fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, Justice O'Connor reiterated the view <span id="Page_1980"></span>that the technical nature of the victory goes not to the prevailing party inquiry, but to the determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee. She suggested that there are three factors to be considered in determining whether a victory is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, technical. The three factors are: (1) the difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought; (2) the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed; and (3) the public purpose served by the litigation<span class="Italic">. Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 578-579. These three factors were applied in a recent Seventh Circuit case where the court noted that the first factor is the most important of the three, and the second factor is the least weighty<span class="Italic">. Cartwright v. Stamper</span>, 7 F.3d 106 (7th Cir. 1993). In its discussion of the public purpose factor, the court in <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span> held that the more important the right at stake and the more egregious the violation, the more likely it is that a public purpose is served<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 110. In <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span>, after consideration of all three factors, the court held that the victory was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, and therefore awarded no fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this analysis to the unique set of facts presented in this case, the Commission finds that petitioners are prevailing parties. As noted above, in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the Court stressed that a judgment which materially alters the legal relationship between the parties is the touchstone for prevailing party status. It is clear in this case that a finding of discrimination was made by the Commission and accepted by the Board. Although the agency disputes this, the Commission notes that the AJ stated in his decision that he accepted the petitioners' contention that the Commission's November 1991 decision contained a finding of discrimination. Specifically, he stated that the agency failed to show that the reassignment of petitioners to other positions imposed an undue hardship on it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission notes that this finding of discrimination materially altered the legal relationship between the parties. Because of this judgment, the agency was required to incorporate an individualized assessment of each employee's qualifications into its reassignment effort. The agency will be hardpressed to show that it was not required to change its legal obligation to petitioners, inasmuch as at the start of this case the agency argued that it was not obligated to consider reassignment at all. Because of the finding of discrimination, the agency must concede that it is now required to consider reassignment, and, it must conduct an individualized assessment as part of its reassignment effort.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that petitioners are prevailing parties, the inquiry turns to the second prong of the analysis, determining the reasonableness of the fee award. Similar to the court in <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span>, the Commission deems it prudent to apply the three factors set forth in Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> to assess the reasonableness of a fee award in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first factor, an examination of the judgment recovered and the recovery sought is made. Petitioners in this case sought reassignment, back pay, and other "appropriate relief." The Commission notes that petitioners mainly sought reassignment, and spent considerable time attempting to establish that they were entitled to reassignment. The agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that reassignment was not possible in this case. Given that this factor is weighted most heavily, the difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought weighs in favor of classifying the success in this case as technical or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second factor involves the significance of the legal issue on which petitioners prevailed. Petitioners correctly point out that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to properly consider them for reassignment. This factor therefore suggests that the success in this case was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>; however, this factor is least weighty in classifying the victory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the third factor considers the public purpose served. As noted by Justice O'Connor, "...success might be considered material if it also accomplished some public goal other than occupying the time and energy of counsel, court, and client." <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 578. The Commission finds that this case served a public purpose. In this regard, the Commission agrees with petitioners' counsel that "something significant" was achieved by the litigation in this case. The finding of discrimination represents a benefit to all employees at Hill Air Force Base, inasmuch as OPM Manual x-118 qualifications can no longer be used as an absolute bar to the accommodation of disabled persons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More generally, the agency has been admonished that it can no longer continue its practice of disregarding reassignment as a form of reasonable accommodation available under the Rehabilitation Act. The right involved in this case, the right of qualified persons with disabilities to be properly considered for reassignment, is thus an important one which affects all employees, not just those involved in this case. This action was an egregious violation of the Rehabilitation Act. Any violation of the Rehabilitation Act detracts from the goal of eradicating discrimination from the workforce, and therefore should be considered serious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the Commission concludes that the weight of this factor, and the weight of factor two, do not suggest that an award of attorney's fees is reasonable in the present case. This conclusion is based upon the fact that petitioners sought to be reassigned to a position within the agency. The agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that there were no positions available for which petitioners qualified. Thus, we are compelled to hold that under the facts of this case, the finding of discrimination is not sufficient to grant attorney's fees to petitioners' counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note, however, that the <span class="Italic">Lopez</span> case involved actions taken by the agency that predated the 1991 Civil Rights Act. Section 107(b) of the 1991 Act, codified at 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), provides that employees may recover an award of attorney fees when a violation of Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act is proven, but the employer demonstrates that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. For example, where a complainant shows that she has been subject to reprisal, but the agency shows it would not have selected her for a position even absent reprisal, the complainant still is entitled to an award of attorney fees under the 1991 Civil Rights Act. <span class="Italic">See Dolan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933677 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">Securing a change in job title is not a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> victory and is sufficient to give the complainant prevailing party status. In <span class="Italic">Burns v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a40530.txt">01A40530</a> (2005), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that, because the only relief he received from his appeal to the Commission was an order that his "personnel paperwork be amended" to show his assignment to a Special Assistant position, his victory was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and therefore insufficient to support an award of attorney's fees. The agency's position is not well taken. Securing a change in one's job title is not so trivial as to be regarded as <span class="Italic">de minimis. See, Van Wersch v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980219 (November 20, 1998) (allegation of discriminatory denial of change in job title sufficient to state a claim).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, complainant asserts that assignment to a Special Assistant position will carry with it managerial and supervisory duties not associated with the Program Analyst position. The agency does not dispute this. A change of duties of this nature is not to be regarded as insignificant. <span class="Italic">See Morman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01964629 (March 17,1997) (allegation of denial of opportunity to perform training duties alleges sufficient harm to terms and conditions of employment to state a claim).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Burns</span> also rejected the agency's argument that the complainant was not a prevailing party because he had not obtained the relief he sought-reinstatement of his complaint for breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In contrast to the <span class="Italic">Lopez</span> case, in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto v. Dalton</span>, 118 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 1997), the court found the employee was the prevailing party, even though the only personal relief she received was the removal of a negative employment reference from her file. In rejecting the government's assertion that the plaintiff was not the prevailing party, the court in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span>, 118 F.3d at 677-78, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A litigant need not prevail on every issue, or even on the "central issue" in the case, to be considered the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Independent Sch. Dist.</span>, 489 U.S. 782, 790-91 (1989). It is enough that she succeeds "on any significant claim affording some of the relief sought." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 791. If the plaintiff is only partially successful in seeking the relief, and achieves only some of the benefit sought by the litigation, she is still considered the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Stivers v. Pierce</span>, 71 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1992)). "The degree of success is irrelevant to the question whether the plaintiff is the prevailing party."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Hashimoto sought a determination of retaliation, reinstatement and backpay in her action before the EEOC. The EEOC declared that Lowery's bad character reference was indeed motivated by retaliatory animus, but declined to award reinstatement or backpay. Instead, to remedy Lowery's retaliatory actions against Hashimoto, the EEOC ordered the Navy to (1) cease and desist its practice of notifying prospective employers of its employees' or former employees' participation in protected EEO activity; (2) remove from Hashimoto's personnel files the negative character reference disseminated by Lowery; (3) provide EEO training to Lowery and all supervisory staff within 180 days; and (4) post copies of an EEOC notice throughout the camp.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government contends that the EEOC's finding of retaliation and the remedial measures it imposed are insufficient to confer "prevailing party" status upon Hashimoto. To support its position, the government relies on <span class="Italic">Slade v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 952 F.2d 357 (10th Cir. 1991), and <span class="Italic">Walker v. Anderson Electrical Connectors</span>, 944 F.2d 841 (11th Cir. 1991). In <span class="Italic">Slade</span>, the plaintiff successfully sought a determination by the EEOC that the Postal Service had discriminated against him on the basis of race in its decision not to hire him. 952 F.2d at 362. The EEOC declined, however, to award the plaintiff back pay or benefits. The plaintiff asserted that the EEOC's finding of discrimination entitled him to attorney's fees as a "prevailing party." The Tenth Circuit rejected this argument on the ground that plaintiff had obtained no relief on the merits of his claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1981"></span>In <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, the plaintiff obtained a jury finding of sexual harassment on the part of her employer, but the jury declined to award damages. The plaintiff asserted that she was a "prevailing party" and therefore entitled to attorney's fees. The Eleventh Circuit rejected this argument, reasoning that a jury's finding of harassment, unaccompanied by any relief, "is not the stuff of which legal victories are made." 944 F.2d at 847 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hewitt v. Helms</span>, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government asserts that <span class="Italic">Slade</span> and <span class="Italic">Walker</span> apply to this case because here, as in those cases, "[t]he most that can be said for [Hashimoto's] 'victory' was that Major Lowery was declared to have acted in a discriminatory fashion." Both <span class="Italic">Slade</span> and <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, however, are distinguishable. Here, the EEOC did more than merely determine that Hashimoto had been the victim of a retaliatory negative character reference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although it did not order reinstatement or backpay, it did order a panoply of remedial measures, at least some of which were unquestionably personal to Hashimoto. The government's failure to acknowledge these important aspects of the EEOC's disposition of Hashimoto's claim manifests an overly narrow view of what constitutes a legal "victory." We therefore conclude that the EEOC's order effected a "material alteration in the legal relationship between plaintiff and defendant" sufficient to confer prevailing party status upon Hashimoto. <span class="Italic">See Stivers</span>, 71 F.3d at 753 n.10 (citing <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 111-12); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 659 F.2d at 1122 (plaintiff who is subject to an adverse performance evaluation in retaliation for EEO activities, but suffers no financial harm from the evaluation, is a "prevailing party" entitled to attorney's fees even though only proper relief on the merits is removal of the improper evaluation from his personnel file).</p>
<p class="noindent">The court in <span class="Italic">Hashimoto</span> also rejected an argument that no fee was the only reasonable fee.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not necessary that a complainant receive monetary relief in order to be eligible for fees as a prevailing party. "[A]ppellant may recover reasonable attorney's fees, in the absence of monetary relief, as long as he proves that the agency has discriminated against him." <span class="Italic">In re USPS</span>, 05860199 (1987); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Frame v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01880759 (1988) (the dollar amount of relief is only one factor for consideration in prevailing party status).</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to achieve total relief is not a bar to an award of fees. However, it must be shown that the filing of the complaint was the catalyst for the agency's decision to award relief. <span class="Italic">McNutt v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01841929 (1986). Usually, this requirement will be fulfilled when the agency makes concessions in settlement even if the concessions do not rise to the actual level of the relief requested in the complaint. In the <span class="Italic">McNutt</span> case, the Commission denied a fee award when the agency demonstrated that it first expressed a willingness to raise the disputed performance ratings in response to a grievance filed by the appellant. In light of this evidence, the Commission found the EEO complaint did not play a "provocative role" in the relief achieved even though settlement actually was reached at the prehearing conference on the EEO complaint. Although <span class="Italic">McNutt</span> has been overruled by <span class="Italic">Buckhannon, supra</span>, as to the "provocative role" the EEO complaint played in the settlement, it remains good law for the proposition that a complainant need not achieve full relief to be considered a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining whether the quantum of relief obtained through settlement is sufficient to warrant a finding that the complainant was the prevailing party, the Commission must give "close scrutiny of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the settlement, focusing particularly on the necessity of bringing the action and whether the party is the successful party with regard to the central issue--discrimination." <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 01820713, 01820714 (1983). In that case, the Commission rejected an award of fees where two employees were terminated for smoking marijuana on-duty. The <span class="Italic">Crawford</span> case ultimately was settled by allowing the employees to resign in lieu of removal, with the agency agreeing to make no mention of the incident in employment references and to expunge all mention of the removal from agency personnel files:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What appellant received fell far short of that relief. They were allowed only to resign with no reference to be maintained to their alleged on-duty misconduct in agency records or to be supplied to third parties. The agency contends that such action is standard in cases of similar controversy and is considered minor. The reason for appellant's complaint was to obtain a reversal of the decision to separate them from federal employment. They were never able to accomplish that goal or obtain a reasonable, remedial substitute, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, priority consideration for the next vacant position or even relocation to another job.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a retroactive promotion is the relief requested, the complainant is not required to actually receive that promotion in order to be considered a prevailing party. The complainant was considered a prevailing party where he obtained compensation through a quality step increase and back pay award, as well as an upgrading of his past performance rating and additional training to enhance future promotional opportunities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01913249 (1991). But the Commission has held that a complainant was not the prevailing party where he sought a retroactive promotion with back pay and settled for priority consideration for a temporary detail and an elevation of his latest performance appraisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05910016 (1991). Noting that the complainant had sought a permanent promotion and elevation of a previous performance rating that resulted in the denial of cash award, the Commission found the complainant had not substantially obtained the relief he sought.</p>
<p class="noindent">A finding that the agency engaged in sexual harassment and the attendant requirement that the agency post a notice of violation is "a significant victory, especially in light of the fact that sexual harassment cases by their very nature do not frequently result in substantial monetary or other relief." <span class="Italic">McGinnis v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01913336 (1991). The fact that the complainant did not succeed in obtaining the sought-after promotion did not prevent her from being a prevailing party for the purposes of a fee award.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reaffirmed its holding on reconsideration. <span class="Italic">McGinnis v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 05920150 (1992). The Commission restated its belief in <span class="Italic">McGinnis</span> that prevailing on a claim of sexual harassment is sufficient to achieve prevailing party status, even if no other specific relief is obtained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the agency contends that the Commission's decision in EEOC Appeal No. 01913336 (September 30, 1991) erred in finding that appellant was a prevailing party entitled to an award of attorney's fees. The agency states that appellant did not raise her allegation of sexual harassment in her formal complaint and the relief which she sought through her complaint was a promotion to a GS-14 position. Since appellant did not receive the specific relief which she sought, rather receiving a finding of discrimination and the agency's assurances that it will not discriminate in the future, the agency contends that appellant is not a prevailing party and thus not entitled to attorney's fees. We find, however, that appellant did receive some of the relief which she was seeking and, therefore, is a prevailing party. While appellant did not raise her allegation of sexual harassment in her formal complaint, she did raise it during the processing of her complaint and the allegation continued to be addressed thereafter in the processing. Clearly, appellant sought a finding of discrimination regarding the actions of the DA. Further, appellant's complaint and the processing thereof were clearly the catalyst for the remedial relief ordered. The Commission has held that to be considered a prevailing party for purposes of entitlement to attorney's fees, an appellant need only succeed on any significant issue which achieves some of the benefits sought. <span class="Italic">Jansen v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880641 (December 13, 1988), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983). Therefore, the Commission finds that appellant is a prevailing party and is entitled to an award of attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since compensatory damages are available under the 1991 Civil Rights Act, a complainant bringing a sexual harassment claim would likely receive monetary damages in addition to a finding of discrimination. However, <span class="Italic">McGinnis</span> still stands for the proposition that a complainant need not obtain monetary relief in order to be considered a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that, due to the passage of time, the complainant no longer desires a personal remedy for discrimination does not mean that she is not a prevailing party for the purposes of attorney fees. In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01924488 (1993), the Commission determined that the agency improperly reassigned the complainant in response to a complaint of sexual harassment. However, because three-and-a-half years passed between her reassignment and the Commission's decision, she no longer wished to be returned to her oriGINAl work unit. The Commission rejected an agency argument that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> was not entitled to attorney fees because she obtained no "personal" relief:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Commission rejects this argument. If appellant had not filed her complaint, and pursued her complaint through the appellate process, the agency would not have been found liable for sexual harassment. The agency would not have been apprised that involuntary transfer of a victim of sexual harassment is not appropriate remedial action. The agency would not have been required to provide EEO training to the supervisory personnel responsible for this inappropriate act, nor would the agency have been required to post notices informing its employees of the occurrence of discrimination in the workplace and the agency's support for proper employment practices; acts of benefit not only to appellant, but to other employees of the agency. The Commission concludes, therefore, that pursuant to its finding of discrimination in this case, which the Commission notes was obtained through the efforts of [appellant's representative], appellant "received significant benefits which were directly related to the harm alleged in her complaint...." The Commission therefore finds appellant to be a prevailing party for the purposes of an award of attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Linda McGinnis v. Dept. of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01913336 (September 30, 1991), <span class="Italic">modif. on other grounds</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920150 (July 15, 1992) (appellant held to be a prevailing party where only relief ordered by Commission was that agency ensure that no other employee be subjected to sexual harassment, and post notices of Commission's discrimination finding).</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1982"></span>When there are disputes over the relief provided by an agency, a complainant is eligible for an award of fees for work done on the relief issue alone if he is the prevailing party in that dispute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Griskonis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902624 (1990). In that case, the appellant declined to accept the agency's offer of reinstatement pursuant to an order from the former Office of Review and Appeals. The agency found this refusal terminated its obligation to reinstate the complainant and also terminated its back pay liability. The appellant again sought ORA review alleging the back pay calculations were incorrect and that he was still entitled to reinstatement. The appellant prevailed on the calculation issue and was awarded another $5,000 in back pay, but did not prevail on the reinstatement issue. The Commission found the complainant's attorney achieved significant relief and was entitled to fees as a prevailing party. The Commission also noted that a provision in the settlement agreement to sever the fee issue and allow it to proceed to a final agency decision was not a concession that the complainant was the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency enters a finding of discrimination and grants relief, the complainant is considered a prevailing party, regardless of whether she was actually represented by an attorney. <span class="Italic">See Clay v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01930997 (1994) ("We conclude that since the agency found discrimination and awarded appellant relief, she was a prevailing party.... That no attorney has represented her so far in the instant case precludes her from receiving attorney's fees for the prosecution of her case up to this point, but not from being considered a prevailing party.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, attorney fees are available to complainants who demonstrate a violation of Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act, even where the agency demonstrates that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. Section 107(b) of the Act, codified at 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On a claim in which an individual proves a violation under section 703(m) and a respondent demonstrates that the respondent would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor, the court--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief (except as provided in clause (iii)), and attorney's fees and costs demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the pursuit of a claim under section 703(m)....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations at Part 1614 do not address whether this provision, which gives "courts" the authority to award fees, also applies to the administrative process. However, the Commission resolved that issue in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01923399 (1992), finding that the compensatory damage provision does apply to the administrative processing of cases under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
