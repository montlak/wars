<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-142"><span class="space">k.</span> $60,001-$70,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $62,000 by the administrative judge where the complainant was the only one who testified on damages. In <span class="Italic">Gist v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070081 (2010), the Commission found that the complainant felt depressed, helpless and withdrew from her normal activities when the agency discriminatorily denied her request for a transfer. The Commission also found that the complainant became "extremely upset" when she discovered that the agency had labeled her as a danger to others after a psychologist informed the agency that she had made remarks about doing bodily harm to a coworker who was harassing her, even though the psychologist also indicated she did not pose a threat to others.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120070003 (2008), the Commission awarded $62,795 in a case where the complainant was subjected to a two-year period of racial harassment. The Commission found that the testimony of witnesses established that as a result of the harassment the complainant suffered from high blood pressure, migraine headaches, and feelings of isolation. The precision in the award was apparently the result of the complainant's specific request for that amount of damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Viers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A14246 (2002), the Commission awarded $65,000 in a case where the complainant suffered from preexisting emotional and psychological issues but presented evidence that the conditions were in remission prior to the discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Viers</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it is clear complainant had many emotional and psychological issues that predate the events of her sexual harassment, it is also clear that her suffering was at a low immediately preceding the events of December 31, 1994. Specifically, her psychological conditions were said to be "in remission" by her doctor. This stabilization, therefore, makes clear that the mental and emotional anguish suffered by complainant in the months following the sexual harassment incidents was directly caused by the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the very heart of the principle of taking a victim as you find her is the idea that one victim's response to harm does not set the standard for what is considered reasonable suffering. Tortfeasors take their victims as they find them, even when the claimed harm is mental anguish or emotional distress<span class="Italic">. Tompkins v. Cyr,</span> 202 F.3d 770, 780 (5th Cir. 2000). A victim's particular susceptibility will not reduce the damages available<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nature, Severity and Duration</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that complainant experienced fatigue, insomnia, loss of marital harmony, apprehension, excessive anxiety, loss of self-esteem, disinterest, feelings of isolation and fear, depression, worry, humiliation, embarrassment, and a general loss of enjoyment of life, friends and family. Complainant became withdrawn and was unable to return to work for approximately one year. During that time complainant was in counseling, but would nonetheless spend days inactive and did not "keep herself up." Complainant was also diagnosed with acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and aggravation of her pre-existing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). She was treated with various medications, including Paxil, Ativan, and Klonopin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that complainant's marital problems were exacerbated by the sexual harassment, but that the problems were more on-going in nature. Thus, the amount which complainant can be compensated for as to the severity of this harm is reduced. Comparatively, her psychological problems were "in remission." The remission creates an inference of a discrete point in time at which suffering because of the discrimination began. Moreover, the nature of complainant's psychological trauma was such that she had to live through a second incident of PTSD, with this one being acute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, according to the record, complainant suffered for a period of approximately thirteen (13) months. She did not return to work for ten (10) months. Further, she remains on medication. With this information, we turn to the award amount.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Damages awards for non-pecuniary losses that have been assessed by juries and courts have varied significantly. Guidance at 13. However, an award of compensatory damages for non-pecuniary losses, including emotional harm, should reflect the extent to which the respondent directly or proximately caused the harm and the extent to which other factors also caused the harm<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 11-12. An award of compensatory damages for non-pecuniary losses should also reflect the nature and severity of the harm and the duration or expected duration of the harm<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">Jury and court awards for emotional distress or mental anguish which did not include major depression have ranged from $500 to $100,000. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Fleming v. County of Kane,</span> State of Illinois, 898 F.2d 553, 562 (7th Cir. 1990) (jury award of $120,000 reduced to $40,000 for embarrassment, humiliation, severe headaches, sleeplessness, and depression following a termination); <span class="Italic">Wulf v. City of Wichita,</span> 883 F.2d 842, 874-875 (10th Cir. 1989) (jury award of $250,000 award remanded for reconsideration and an award of damages no greater than $50,000 for anger, depression, anxiety, frustration and emotional strain following a termination); <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

City of New Haven,</span> 3 AD Cases 1590, 1592 (D.C. Conn.) ($500 award for emotional distress based on testimony that plaintiff was "disappointed," "cranky" with family and friends, "embarrassed" at not having been promoted, and had many sleepless nights), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">without opinion</span>, 29 F.3d 622 (2d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom</span>., <span class="Italic">City of New Haven v. Kuntz,</span> 155 S. Ct. 667 (1979); <span class="Italic">McClam v. City of Norfolk Police Department,</span> <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, 877 F. Supp. 277, 284 ($15,000 award for 18 months of headaches, lowered self esteem, and changes in attitude and devotion toward job following repeated denials of job transfer requests); <span class="Italic">Boyce v. Board of Commissioners of Dickinson County,</span> 857 F. Supp. 794 (D.

Pa. 1989) ($10,000 for mental anguish following the denial of a promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has awarded varying amounts, depending upon the extent and duration of the harm suffered. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Bahaudin v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01993594 (September 13, 2000) ($85,000 awarded where complainant, diagnosed with major depression, produced evidence indicating that the agency's discriminatory actions caused him to, among other things, become very irritable; distant; wake up at night and make sudden jerking movements; not want to go to work; just lay in bed when he was not working; neglect his home duties; and not eat); <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971851 (October 23, 1998) ($75,000 awarded where complainant's testimony and several reports supported a finding that the agency's discrimination reawakened complainant's post traumatic stress disorder); <span class="Italic">Turner v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956390 (April 27, 1998) ($40,000 awarded where discriminatory harassment, particularly forcing complainant to carry a 45-pound back pack, caused her to experience psychological trauma and physical injury with permanent effects); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (April 15, 1999) ($30,000 awarded for emotional harm during a six month period); <span class="Italic">Christian V. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996342 (September 7, 2001) ($30,000 awarded where complainant was continuously sexually harassed by a co-worker for a period of six years, no medical evidence produced); <span class="Italic">Mooney v. United States Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01974494 (May 24, 2000) ($20,000 awarded where complainant suffered from depression and anxiety for 6-7 months, followed by a 4-5 month period of Major Depression, due to the agency's discrimination); and <span class="Italic">Yue Lee Wan v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01995204 (July 11, 2001) ($15,000 awarded where there was loss of marital harmony, emotional distress, depression, and inability to sleep).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, and given the severity, nature and duration of distress experienced by complainant, we find that an award of $65,000 is appropriate. We point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions<span class="Italic">. See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,</span> 477 U.S. 299, 311-12 (1986) (stating that compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case). The Commission notes that this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not be the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Ward-Jenkins v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F. 2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $65,000 in nonpecuniary damages in <span class="Italic">Henery v. Secretary of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a50034.txt">07A50034</a> (2005), where the complainant suffered both emotional distress and physical and mental pain as a result of excessive walking due to the agency's failure to accommodate. Although not specifically set out in the decision, presumably the administrative judge apportioned the award into $15,000 for emotional distress and $50,000 in physical and mental pain in an attempt to avoid the latter being characterized as gross income and, thus, taxable. Interestingly, the Commission made no comment on the apportionment of the award. However, it did find that the agency's failure to provide the complainant with a handicapped parking space over a several year period resulted in obvious physical pain and emotional distress and that the agency's failure to respond to the complainant's multiple requests for accommodation intensified both the degree and duration of the harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $30,000 by the agency to $65,000 in <span class="Italic">Tewilliager v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A53028.txt">01A53028</a> (2006), where, on two occasions, she entered a coworker's office to find him undressed. On another occasion the coworker asked complainant to assist him in fitting a bra with surveillance equipment only to find out that he had videotaped the incident without her knowledge or consent. In increasing the award in <span class="Italic">Tewilliager, the Commission noted that "</span>Complainant's condition appeared to last at least two years in duration; her relationships with her family and friends were strained; complainant and her husband reported lack of consortium; she experienced difficulty sleeping and concentrating; and she had to seek counseling for depression and anxiety due to the agency's discriminatory conduct."</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision of an administrative judge to award $65,000 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Mohr v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720050057 (2007), where the complainant was reassigned in reprisal for protected activity. The complainant suffered from anxiety, depression, humiliation, and sleep deprivation for which he sought medical treatment and was placed on multiple medications. The complainant testified that he still had crying spells and was socially withdrawn from friends and family a year after the reassignment. The complainant's testimony was corroborated by his wife and by medical records.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120082790 (2008), the Commission awarded $65,000 in damages where the complainant's emotional distress lasted for several years. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the record clearly shows that complainant suffered severe emotional distress as a result of the harassment, for a period beginning in 2004, and continuing to the present. In support of his claim for compensatory damages, complainant presented evidence that he suffered depression, sleeplessness, anxiety, irritability, problems with concentration, loss of self-esteem, and humiliation. Complainant states that as a result of the harassment he began smoking a pack of cigarettes per day and his alcohol consumption increased significantly. He states that every night he "would come home and sit in the house and close the blinds and drink." Complainant states that his relationships with co-workers deteriorated, and that "every day [he goes] to work...people look at [him] and basically harass [him], taunt [him], question [his] sexuality and [his] sexual preference." Complainant also states that his long-term relationship with his girlfriend ended as a result of the harassment, and that many of his friends told him that he "should have slept with" S1 and that he probably could have "gotten a full-time job out of the thing." Complainant states that this has caused him to become "a loner" because he no longer trusts anyone. (Report of Investigation, Exhibit 4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also contains affidavit testimony from one of complainant's co-workers (CW), and the individual from whom he sought counseling and guidance (SW), which corroborate many of complainant's contentions. In his affidavit, CW stated that over a period of 3-4 years, as a result of the harassment, complainant went from "kind-hearted" and "benevolent" to "hostile" and "untrusting." CW also stated that complainant withdrew from social interaction and "began to act as a hermit." (R.O.I., Exhibit 7). SW, who holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Behavioral and Social Sciences, stated that complainant "began to alienate himself' and sought "refuge in excessive drinking and smoking, therefore altering his general physical appearance with a weight increase of 30 lbs." (R.O.I., Exhibit 6). We note, however, that the record shows that during the period at issue, complainant was suffering financial difficulties as a result of having been laid off from his full-time job due to a facility closure, and that this was a contributing factor in the emotional harm to complainant. (R.O.I. Exhibit 4).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case where the administrative judge, through a typographic error, awarded $65,000 on one page of the decision and $75,000 on another, the Commission decided an award of $65,000 was appropriate. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Banks v. Social Security Administration,</span> 0720100014 (2012), noted that the complainant "Complainant had testified that she incurred sleeplessness, damage to her social relationships, diminished pleasure in activities, decreased confidence at work, a loss of self esteem, concern for job safety, muscular pain and anxiety/depression as a result of the Agency's actions."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $45,000 by the administrative judge to $65,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120120933 (2015), where the agency's failure to accommodate was over an extended period of time and the complainant's preexisting depression made her emotionally vulnerable. The Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[C]omplainant had been diagnosed with major depression before the Agency's denial of reasonable accommodation. Consequently, the AJ found that to the extent that Complainant was emotionally vulnerable, her condition was made worse by the Agency's discriminatory acts, and the Agency is responsible for those damages. Complainant introduced evidence from her therapist describing the stress she suffered, including her worries about future employment. In addition, Complainant testified that she experienced weight gain, hair loss, and migraine headaches. The AJ noted that the Agency could have brought Complainant back to work in February 2007 and did not do so until August 2008. Thus, the AJ found that there was a period of a year and a half that she suffered additional emotional harm as a result of the Agency's failure to accommodate her.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $10,000 to $60,000 where the complainant alleged that two coworkers used "racial slurs and made derogatory comments" about him on Facebook in <span class="italic">Brenton W. v. Veterans Affair</span>. The incident triggered the complainant's preexisting PTSD, which had previously been "under control," resulting in significant stress, chest pain and elevated heart rate.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $70,000 in damages was made in <span class="Italic">Durrant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01971885 (2000), where the agency's discrimination and repeated failure to accommodate aggravated a preexisting condition and caused the complainant both physical and emotional distress. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Durrant</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the fact that complainant suffered from a pre-existing condition in and of itself should not serve to reduce the amount of compensatory damages she suffered where, as here, there has been no <span id="Page_1885"></span>showing that complainant suffered from the aforementioned aggravated physical manifestations of that condition prior to the discrimination. Here, the agency has not even argued that complainant suffered from pain due to her illness prior to the discrimination. Rather, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that complainant was otherwise physically well and pain free prior to the discrimination. As such, we note that our award of compensatory damages was not reduced based on complainant's pre-existing condition, since we find insufficient evidence that complainant's aggravated pain and suffering was caused by factors other than the discrimination....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by complainant, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $70,000. This amount takes into account the severity and duration of the harm done to complainant by the additional duties imposed on her, as well as the agency's repeated failure to accommodate her. Furthermore, we note that this sum is meant to compensate complainant for the aggravation of her illness, caused entirely by the agency's discriminatory actions. Most importantly, this award is meant to compensate complainant for the physical manifestations of the discrimination which have, according to evidence in the record, rendered her to a wheelchair. However, this amount takes into account that, unlike cases where greater damages were awarded, complainant's injury did not render her totally incapacitated either for work or in her personal life. Finally, this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">AIC Security Investigations</span>, 823 F. Supp. 573 at 574.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Social Security Administration</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30048.txt">07A30048</a> (2004), the Commission upheld an award of $70,000 in damages where the complainant "had increased back pain, due in part by the agency's discrimination, and in part to her increased work hours; she cried frequently for three months; she experienced a loss of friends and social life; she became less outgoing and jovial; she stopped going to movies which she had previously enjoyed; she suffered from stress, depression, nausea, insomnia, and headaches; she had to seek help for her stress from her doctor and church pastor; she experienced embarrassment, loss of self-esteem; and a perceived decline in her professional stature at her place of employment."</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency's failure to accommodate a hip ailment by requiring the complainant to work without a chair aggravated his condition, the Commission upheld an award of $70,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Evanovich v. Postmaster Genera</span>l, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A20029.txt">07A20029</a> (2004), the Commission noted that the agency's failure to accommodate caused the complainant physical pain for a 10 month period of time and that the aggravation of his hip condition resulted in a hernia and delayed hip surgery.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a hostile work environment based on pregnancy and retaliation resulted in feelings of professional isolation and emotional distress that interfered with the complainant's family relationships, the Commission upheld an award by the administrative judge of $70,000 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 07A50079 (2006), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied,</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0520060436 (2006), the complainant's damage award was based primarily on her testimony without the submission of medical evidence. The complainant, a podiatric physician, testified that after she revealed her pregnancy, she was harassed by her supervisor with comments that included threats to her career and that she became afraid she would lose her job and her baby. She further testified that she became so upset that she began losing her hair and that for two to three hours after work she could not even look at her children or husband.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A40871 (2006), the Commission awarded $70,000 in damages where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant led to a significant reduction in work hours over an extended period of time. Although the Commission found that some of the harm was occasioned by the complainant's diagnosis of breast cancer, it agreed with the administrative judge that her emotional distress was mainly the result of her financial concerns and not health concerns. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is ample evidence in the record that complainant was devastated by the agency's actions. HT at 735-39. The AJ noted that complainant testified credibly as to how the agency's actions regarding her employment impacted her. Complainant testified that she was the main breadwinner of the family. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The AJ stated that "[complainant] has two daughters in college, and it was clear from her demeanor during her testimony that she takes great pride in this. The possibility of having to take them out of school because of financial concerns was a main factor causing complainant emotional distress." The AJ further noted that "complainant testified credibly that she worried about paying her bills over this time period."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ properly determined that complainant is not entitled to compensation for the emotional harm arising from the onset of breast cancer. However, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's determination that complainant's emotional distress was based primarily on her concern about her financial situation and how that was having an adverse impact upon her family. While complainant's hypertension increased while she was undergoing chemotherapy, complainant's oncologist (O1) stated that complainant has tolerated chemotherapy "extremely well." CE 19. O1 further stated that complainant had been adamant about her desire to continue working during her chemotherapy treatment. In addition, O1 notes "[complainant's] current illness, I feel, to be stress-related and not secondary to the chemotherapy. It is not usual for a patient to experience significant stress during the chemotherapy as they have attained a type of routine and generally are on an even keel. Therefore, I cannot attribute the patient's current problems to her chemotherapy or malignancy. It is my opinion that the patient's current stress level is related solely to her work and is not related to her breast cancer."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining compensatory damages, the Commission strives to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with similar cases. We note that the Commission has awarded compensatory damages in cases somewhat similar to the instant case. <span class="Italic">See Fauntleroy v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00050 (January 10, 2001) (affirming AJ's award of $80,000 in non-pecuniary damages in a non-selection case when complainant's pre-existing conditions worsened due to the discrimination); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) (awarding complainant $80,000 in non-pecuniary damages after the agency failed to provide complainant with a reasonable accommodation and the agency did not select him for a position due to his disability).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the AJ did not err in awarding complainant $70,000 in non-pecuniary damages. Moreover, we note that this award is not "monstrously excessive" and is consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld a $70,000 damage award in <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080027 (2008), where the complainant suffered from major depression, anxiety, stress and financial difficulties for a period of more than two years. The Commission noted that the complainant still suffered from depression at the time of the hearing. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mardell B. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120172035 (2017) (increasing an award of $25,000 to $70,000 where the Commission found that the agency's two-year delay in providing reasonable accommodation to the complainant resulted in exacerbation of her medical condition, leading to depression, emotional suffering and physical changes).</p>
