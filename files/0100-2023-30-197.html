<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-186"><span class="space">35.</span> Previous Physical or Mental Illness</h4>
<p class="noindent">The past mental and physical history of the complainant is relevant to a determination of damages. An agency may not escape liability entirely by demonstrating the complainant had a mental or physical condition prior to the act of discrimination for which compensatory damages are claimed. But, on the other hand, the agency may be able to mitigate those damages considerably. There are two competing notions at work here. First, evidence of the onset of emotional harm prior to the discrimination undermines, to some degree, a complainant's claim for damages. Based on such evidence, an agency can argue that it was other factors and not the acts of discrimination that caused the complainant harm. An agency is not liable for harm caused by factors other than discrimination. On the other hand, agencies take their victims as they find them and, as a result, are liable for the harm that occurs as a result of discrimination even when the harm is exacerbated by the preexisting condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">In either case, an agency's liability for the total harm suffered by the complainant is reduced. The difference is in how that liability is reduced. In cases involving a preexisting condition, the agency is not liable for the harm caused by the condition up to the point in time where the discrimination occurred. It is, however, liable for all of the additional harm that the discrimination caused even if that harm is out of proportion to what a "reasonable person" would have suffered in similar circumstances. The agency bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that a damage award should be reduced because of a preexisting condition. The focus should be on whether any deterioration in the <span id="Page_1954"></span>preexisting condition would have occurred in the absence of discrimination and, if so, how much. In cases involving other causes for the harm suffered by the complainant, the agency is not liable for any of the harm suffered by factors other than discrimination. It is liable only for the harm caused by the discrimination. The focus in these cases should be on whether other events in the complainant's life--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, marital problems, financial problems, or the death or serious illness of a close family member or friend--caused the complainant harm and, if so, to what degree. Again, the agency bears the burden of proving that factors other than discrimination caused the complainant harm. In these cases, it is less a matter of reducing an award because of other factors than it is assigning the degree of harm caused by each factor.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, the lives of people are not so clear-cut that cases necessarily involve only one rule or the other. In a given case, it is possible that the agency would not be liable for the harm caused by the complainant's divorce that took place before the discrimination. However, it may be liable for the additional harm the discrimination caused when it exacerbated the depression that the complainant suffered from as a result of the divorce.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant suffers from a preexisting condition does not mandate a reduction of the damage award made by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Ferrall v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A30054 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Finlay v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942985 (1997), the Commission gave a good explanation of the rules of law developed to reconcile the two competing notions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argued below that appellant's emotional condition was precipitated, in part or in whole, by the loss of her home in the Oakland firestorm of October 1991. Without regard to whether the agency's argument is supported by evidence of record, the Commission notes that where a complaining party has a pre-existing emotional condition, and that condition deteriorates as a result of the discriminatory conduct, the additional harm may be attributed to the respondent employer following the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.</span>, 817 F.2d 1290, 1294 (7th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">EEOC Notice N</span> 915.002 at 11. The two exceptions to this general principle are set out in <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981). In <span class="Italic">Maurer</span>, the employee sustained a non-disabling back injury while working aboard ship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sometime later, the employee sustained a second back injury aboard another ship, and after the second injury the employee became disabled for work. After first establishing that it is irrelevant whether the plaintiff had a pre-existing condition that made the consequences of the wrongful act more severe than they would have been for a normal victim, the <span class="Italic">Maurer</span> court explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]here are two exceptions to the general rule. First, when a plaintiff is incapacitated or disabled prior to an accident, the defendant is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation that he caused. Second, when a plaintiff has a preexisting condition that would inevitably worsen, a defendant causing subsequent injury is entitled to have the plaintiffs damages discounted to reflect the proportion of damages that would have been suffered even in the absence of subsequent injury, but the burden of proof in such cases is upon the defendant to prove the extent of the damages that the preexisting condition would inevitably have caused.

<p class="noindent-1">The evidence of record, set forth below, does not establish that appellant became disabled for work on account of any factor other than the sexual harassment. Further, the agency has adduced no evidence that appellant inevitably would have become disabled for work even in the absence of the sexual harassment. Accordingly, it is appropriate to apply the general rule that a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them; whether appellant had any factors which rendered her peculiarly susceptible to the stress of the sexual harassment is immaterial.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is error for the agency to deny compensatory damages solely on the basis that the complainant had a preexisting mental condition. <span class="Italic">Wooten v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01960727 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">Balancing the two competing notions in damage cases is not easy, as the Commission demonstrated by its analysis in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01943844 (1996). A preexisting condition not only impacts upon the amount of damages for pain and suffering, but also, as demonstrated in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, impacts on pecuniary damages because it may be necessary to apportion the costs for treatment related to the discrimination and that related to other causes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency found that appellant was subjected to continuing acts of hostile environment sexual harassment discrimination for 33 months. However, the agency found that appellant's compensatory damages claim was seriously undermined by her history of mental illness. For example, the agency found that appellant had a history of depression and had been prescribed minor tranquilizers and antidepressants since the age of 16. Next, the agency emphasized that appellant did not specifically mention "sexual harassment" by her supervisor until 12 days into her first hospitalization--April 14, 1992. The agency also found it noteworthy that although appellant did not work between April and December 1992, she was hospitalized four times and underwent therapy during the same period. The agency concluded that most of appellant's treatment revolved around "other factors." Specifically, the agency concluded that the following factors contributed to appellant's emotional harm: (a) a dysfunctional family (including an alcoholic father, an abusive mother, a childhood kidnapping, and an adolescent rape); (b) four marriages to abusive or alcoholic men; (c) prior alcohol and substance abuse; (d) a manic depressive son, a critical daughter, and three demanding grandchildren; (e) smoking; (f) a new boyfriend; (g) financial problems including a bankruptcy filing; and (h) work pressures/harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency admitted that the Therapist found the sexual harassment to be a "major factor" in appellant's illness, and conceded that Dr. 4 treated appellant for anxiety from the sexual harassment. However, the agency discounted the value of their opinions on the ground that in their letters, neither the Therapist nor Dr. 4 specifically mentioned that other factors "at play" in appellant's life. The agency also found it noteworthy that the Therapist disagreed with the "borderline personality disorder" diagnosis of Doctors 2 and 3. Therefore, the agency denied appellant's compensatory damages claim on the ground that appellant failed to establish with requisite certainty that the sexual harassment caused her emotional harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commission guidance on awarding compensatory damages advises that "[t]he claim of emotional harm will be seriously undermined if the onset of symptoms of emotional harm preceded the discrimination." EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 11. However, our guidance also continues that where a complaining party has a pre-existing emotional condition, and that condition deteriorates as a result of the discriminatory conduct, the additional harm may be attributed to the respondent employer, following the theory that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.</span>, 817 F.2d 1290, 1294 (7th Cir. 1987)); <span class="Italic">See also Reising v. United States</span>, 60 F.3d 1241, 1244 (7th Cir. 1995) (tortfeasor liable for injury he caused, even though injury consisted of aggravation of pre-existing condition).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission recently addressed the applicability of this theory in <span class="Italic">Wallis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (Nov. 13, 1995). In <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, the Commission awarded compensatory damages where it found that the agency's discriminatory conduct substantially contributed to the worsening of the complainant's pre-existing mental condition. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995), the Commission held that the agency was liable for the exacerbation of the complainant's pre-existing asthmatic condition and for the additional physical and emotional harm caused by the exacerbation of the asthma.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Appellant's Evidence of Injury and Causation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant asserts that the sexual harassment caused her emotional condition to deteriorate to the point that she was hospitalized and required extensive therapy. The record shows that before the FAD was issued, appellant submitted various forms of evidence in support of her compensatory damages claim including: medical bills, hospital records, letters and reports from appellant's health care providers, a workers' compensation form, a bankruptcy worksheet, and appellant's affidavit. As described above, some of these submissions addressed the cause and extent of appellant's emotional harm in relation to the sexual harassment, while other submissions did not. In addition, after the FAD was issued, appellants attorney submitted an untimely appeal brief (see footnote 1, page 1) with other evidence in support of the compensatory damages claim. For the reasons that follow, the Commission finds that appellant produced sufficient evidence prior to the issuance of the FAD to support a compensatory damages award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency's finding that appellant had a history of depression since the age of 16, and she had experienced various "stressors" in her life prior to and during the period of harassment. We disagree with the agency's implication that because appellant was not at work from April through December 1992, there could be no connection between the sexual harassment and the deterioration of appellant's emotional condition during that period. At that point, appellant had been subjected to a hostile work environment since October 1990. Although appellant had been in therapy previously, until April 1992, she had never required a mental health hospitalization. Moreover, the admission records for the first hospitalization reveal that Dr. 1 attributed appellant's anxiety to a few factors, one of which was the sexual harassment. A review of the hospital records reveals that during many of her therapy sessions, appellant attributed her anxiety and depression to the sexual harassment, which she perceived as reawakening childhood traumas. We find the Therapist's conclusion to be particularly telling: if not for the sexual harassment, appellant would not have "decompensated to a point of requiring hospitalization, medication and intensive outpatient therapy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency discounted the opinions of the Therapist and Dr. 4 because <span id="Page_1955"></span>they failed to expressly mention the impact of the "other factors" in their reports. We find that the wording of their statements implies their awareness of these factors. For example, the Therapist reported that sexual harassment was a "strong factor" in appellant's rapid deterioration and "over half" of their sessions focused on the sexual harassment. Likewise, Dr. 4 reported that one of appellant's "major problems" was high anxiety due to sexual harassment and stress from her supervisor. These statements reveal that the Therapist and Dr. 4 considered "other factors" in their diagnoses, but considered them to be less significant than the sexual harassment. Moreover, as to the differing diagnoses of appellant's conditions, the record shows that there was a consensus among appellant's health care providers that she suffered from Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, as well as Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Therefore, we do not find the differences in one aspect of appellant's diagnosis (borderline personality disorder) to be significant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several recent Federal Court decisions have awarded compensatory damages where the plaintiff suffered from a pre-existing emotional condition which caused the plaintiff to be particularly sensitive to discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 95 FEOR 5009 (D.D.C. 1994), the plaintiff had a history of mental illness, including two suicide attempts, and her psychiatrist testified that her underlying personality disorder made her particularly vulnerable to stress. The District Court found that the agency was liable for the plaintiff's condition even if she was more susceptible than most to suffer mental and emotional distress<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In a prior case, the same court awarded damages where the plaintiff's psychologist testified that exposure to sexual demands by a person with authority over the employee destroyed the employee's ability to cope with stress and caused her severe reaction to harassment<span class="Italic">. Webb v. Hyman</span>, 861 F. Supp. 1094 (D.D.C. 1994). In that case, the psychiatrist testified that the sexual harassment by the plaintiff's supervisor "tapped into deeply repressed emotions about her childhood abuse."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1114. In <span class="Italic">Meadows v. Guptill</span>, 856 F. Supp. 1362, 1371 (D. Ariz. 1993), the court awarded compensatory damages where it found that, after her husband's death, exposure to a hostile working environment for 17 months "substantially aggravated" the employee's suffering.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency implies that the severity of appellant's condition must be attributable to her pre-existing condition, as opposed to the sexual harassment. Contrary to the agency's decision, we find that the "other factors" cited by the agency caused appellant to be particularly susceptible to the sexual harassment when it occurred. We further find that the sexual harassment substantially aggravated appellant's pre-existing emotional condition to such an extent that appellant is entitled to an award of compensatory damages<span class="Italic">. Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510; Carpenter, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;Calculation of Damages Payable</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission now turns to the calculation of damages payable to appellant. The Commission has awarded compensatory damages in several cases. In a recent case, the Commission awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $60,142.40, broken down as follows: $1,690.40 for past pecuniary damages, $8,452 for future pecuniary damages, and $50,000 for non-pecuniary damages<span class="Italic">. Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510. In another case, the Commission remanded the matter for a supplemental investigation as to past pecuniary damages, awarded no future pecuniary damages, and awarded $75,000 in non-pecuniary damages<span class="Italic">. Carpenter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652. In a third case, the Commission awarded a total of $8,030 in compensatory damages; $8,000 of which was non-pecuniary damages, pecuniary damages were limited to $30 for out-of-pocket expenses, and no future pecuniary damages were awarded<span class="Italic">. Rountree v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941906 (July 7, 1995). In each of these cases, the Commission considered the extent to which the complainant had demonstrated entitlement to the respective damages, as well as the extent to which other factors had caused the complainant to incur losses. In awarding non-pecuniary damages, each case considered the amounts awarded in similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Past Pecuniary Damages</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant may recover past out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of the intentional discrimination. EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 8. In her complaint, appellant requested $50,000 for her medical and psychiatric expenses, but submitted receipts totaling only $28,000. Moreover, appellant did not explain how the majority of the bills submitted were connected to the discrimination. It appears that appellant is attempting to recover her expenses for a variety of medical conditions that she has not proven were caused by the discrimination. Therefore, we deny damages for the following expenses claimed by appellant: (1) $324 for laboratory and x-ray bills; (2) $2,314 claimed on the bankruptcy worksheet; (3) $807 for unspecified treatment from St. Mary's Hospital; (4) $1,760 for services related to appellant's colonoscopy; (5) $533 for unspecified office consultations with a Dr. M; (6) $42 for a visit with a Dr. K for complaints of abdominal and lower back pain; and (7) $918 for treatment from a Dr. D, for assorted complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of our finding that appellant's pre-existing condition was substantially aggravated by the sexual harassment, we will award appellant past pecuniary damages for that portion of her medical and psychiatric treatment which was attributable to the sexual harassment. In that regard, appellant submitted bills for her four Palo Verde Hospitalizations totaling $23,809. The Commission finds that appellant is entitled to reimbursement of slightly more than half of her out-of-pocket expenses, or $12,000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Future Pecuniary Damages</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no basis to award future pecuniary damages. Although appellant did not specifically request future pecuniary damages, appellant implied in her affidavit that she should be compensated for future visits to her therapist. However, appellant did not provide any documentation of the nature, extent, or duration of these visits. The only evidence in this regard is Letter 2, in which Dr. 4 stated "if things remain as they are, [appellant] will need to be in therapy for an undetermined period of time." Appellant did not update this statement. This is insufficient for an award of future pecuniary damages. As noted above, the Commission has awarded future pecuniary damages in one other case<span class="Italic">. Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510. In that case, the appellant specifically requested future pecuniary damages in the full amount of his expected expenses for future psychiatric treatment. In awarding future pecuniary damages in the <span class="Italic">Wallis</span> case, the Commission considered the statement of appellant's psychiatrist that appellant was likely to require treatment for the next five years. We find no such basis for an award in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Non-Pecuniary Damages</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has requested $945,000 for "mental anguish, pain, suffering, humiliation, inconvenience, etc." The Commission notes that, as with pecuniary damages, the agency is liable only for those damages directly or proximately caused by the intentional discrimination<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 11. In addition, as noted above, the agency is liable only for those damages occurring on or after November 21, 1991, the effective date of CRA 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are no definitive rules governing the amount to be awarded. However, non-pecuniary damages must be limited to the sums necessary to compensate the injured party for actual harm, even where the harm is intangible, <span class="Italic">see Carter v. Duncan-Higgins, Ltd.</span>, 727 F.2d 1225 (D.C. Cir. 1984), and should take into account the severity of the harm and the length of time that the injured party has suffered from the harm<span class="Italic">. Carpenter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652; EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 14. The Commission notes that for a proper award of non-pecuniary damages, the amount of the award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. AIC Security Investigations</span>, Ltd., 823 F. Supp. 571, 574 (N.D. Ill. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recent federal and state court awards for emotional distress in sexual harassment cases have ranged from $2,000 to $125,000. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hall v. Gus Constr. Co., Inc.</span>, 842 F.2d 1010 (8th Cir. 1988) (affirming damage awards of $15,000 and $20,000 to two female traffic controllers who were subjected to campaign of verbal and/or physical harassment); <span class="Italic">Sassaman v. Heart City Toyota</span>, 879 F. Supp. 901 (D.N. Ind. 1994) (award of $2,000 compensatory damages upheld where plaintiff's psychiatrist testified that plaintiff "was likely to experience daily pain in a working environment characterized by sexual hostility"); <span class="Italic">Webb v. Hyman</span>, 861 F. Supp. 1094 (D.D.C. 1994) ($75, 000 award supported by testimony that the sexual harassment by the plaintiff's supervisor "tapped into deeply repressed emotions about her childhood abuse"); <span class="Italic">Meadows v. Guptill</span>, 856 F. Supp. 1362 (D. Ariz. 1993) ($50,000 awarded where town clerk was exposed to hostile working environment for 17 months); <span class="Italic">Alphonse v. Omni Hotels Management Corp.</span>, 69 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 465 (La. Ct. App. 1994) (affirming $85,000 award to sexually harassed employee); <span class="Italic">Kelly-Zurian v. Wohl Shoe Co.</span>, 64 Fair Empl. Prac. Case. (BNA) 603 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994) ($125,000 award to sexually harassed employee was not excessive in view of evidence of plaintiff's significant emotional distress).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having carefully considered the facts of this case, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $25,000. In reaching this amount, the Commission has considered many factors. For example, we considered the severity and duration of the hostile environment sexual harassment: 33 months, half of which post-dated CRA 1991. We also considered the nature and severity of appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms. As noted above, appellant was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, as well as Generalized Anxiety Disorder. As a result of these disorders, appellant experienced uncontrolled crying, insomnia, anxiety, tremors, panic attacks, suicidal tendencies, and paranoia, resulting in four hospitalizations and extensive therapy. However, we have limited appellant's award to the extent that a portion of appellant's emotional harm was caused by factors other than the sexual harassment, as discussed above. Finally, we considered the amounts awarded in similar cases. Based on all of these considerations, <span id="Page_1956"></span>we find that $25,000 is a proper award for that portion of appellant's emotional distress that was caused by the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123309 (2014) (reducing by 50% the pecuniary damage award for treatment because complainant was seeing a psychiatrist prior to the discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">McCann v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01971851 (1998), found that the agency was liable for payment for increased psychiatric visits and medications. Prior to the discrimination, the complainant had been seeing a psychiatrist on a monthly basis and taking psychiatric medication. The Commission held that the complainant should be reimbursed for all visits exceeding one per month, and for expenses incurred in any increased dosage of medication. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01992843 (2002) (apportioning future pecuniary damages where there was a preexisting condition).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Androvich v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01950531 (1996), the Commission denied a request for future pecuniary damages for a trip that the complainant planned to Washington, D.C., to "monitor the agency's handling of her case." But, the Commission did grant $8,000 in future pecuniary damages for psychotherapy. The amount granted was only one-quarter of the psychologist's original estimate of required future treatment. The Commission took into account not only the preexisting mental condition of the complainant, but also the fact that some of the described treatment was for the extra stress caused by delays in settlement. In <span class="Italic">Androvich</span>, the Commission stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant further sought future pecuniary damages for psychotherapy. For the reasons set forth below, we find appellant is entitled to $8,000.00 in future pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record includes four statements from appellant's psychologist regarding the effect of the agency's actions on her mental health, as well as the status of her mental health prior to the agency's actions and subsequent to the April 1994 settlement. In this regard, we note first that this case raises the question of the extent of an employer's liability when the injury caused by its discriminatory action is the aggravation of a pre-existing emotional condition. Where a complaining party has a pre-existing emotional condition and that condition deteriorates as a result of discriminatory conduct, the additional harm may be attributed to the respondent employer, EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 11, following the theory that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.</span>, 817 F.2d 1290, 1294 (7th Cir. 1987). Notwithstanding this rule, however, it also is true that where an individual "is incapacitated or disabled prior to an accident, the defendant is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation that he caused." <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98, 100 (2d Cir. 1981) (quoted in <span class="Italic">Wallis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we further note that appellant may not recover nonpecuniary damages caused by the stress of participating in the EEO process<span class="Italic">. See Rountree v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950919 (February 16, 1995); <span class="Italic">Appleby v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933897 (March 4, 1994). In <span class="Italic">Appleby</span>, we stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Congress added compensatory damages to federal EEO statutes...to make the perpetrators of intentional employment discrimination liable for [the] non-wage economic consequences of their acts, to the extent necessary to provide full relief to victims of discrimination. Such damages were not added to the EEO statutes to address how an agency litigates an EEO complaint alleging employment discrimination, but rather, to address how an agency treated an employee or applicant in an employment-related context.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the facts of <span class="Italic">Appleby</span> are somewhat different than those of this case, the broad principle established therein applies equally to the instant case: compensatory damages are available to the extent necessary to compensate a victim, but only for an agency's intentional discrimination in the work place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has produced sufficient evidence bearing on injury and causation. This evidence supports a finding that the agency's actions--issuing the Form 1099 and Official A's statement--aggravated appellant's emotional condition. Because the agency's liability for compensatory damages is limited to the injuries that its actions directly or proximately caused, it is necessary to examine more closely the causes to which appellant's injuries are attributed by both her and her psychologist to the agency's actions at issue herein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his April 16, 1994 statements, the psychologist indicated that appellant's stress-related problems and his treatment of her began in March 1993 following a serious car accident. He further noted that by November 1993, fully 100% of her need for therapy was associated with work-related problems, notably the "discrimination suit." He also stated that the two incidents in this case "have created [substantial] set-backs" for appellant and that the traumatic stress "is now cumulative," causing treatment to become more difficult. The psychologist estimated that appellant would need an additional thirty months of therapy, at a cost of $32,000.00. In his July 23, 1994 statement, the psychologist stated that delays in resolving appellant's April 1994 settlement were causing damage that "may well be impossible to correct." He further stated in his September 7, 1994 statement that because the matter had not yet been fully resolved, appellant's need for therapy now extended to four years, at a cost of $60,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the psychologist's statements, appellant submitted her own statement as well as statements from her sister and ex-husband. The statements from appellant and her sister describe appellant's condition beginning with the period following execution of the October 1993 settlement, during which appellant's mental health showed improvement, and continuing through the two incidents in this case, during which her condition worsened and the effects of alleged prior agency actions resurfaced. Appellant's ex-husband's statement attested to the effect that appellant's disclosure of the October 1993 settlement had on her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the principles of <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, and <span class="Italic">Appleby</span>, the Commission finds that the agency is liable only for the harm directly attributable to the two specific incidents addressed in the April 1994 settlement agreement: issuance of Form 1099 and Official A's statement. The agency is not liable, with respect to resolution of this case, for whatever injuries appellant suffered prior to the agency's actions resolved by the settlement; nor is it responsible for consequences flowing from the EEO process itself, including the process of entering into the April 1994 settlement, appellant's preparation of her request for damages, the agency's actions in addressing her request, or the appeal to the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission further finds that the agency is not responsible for the period of enlargement in the psychologist's estimate of time needed to treat appellant described in his July and September 1994 statements. Appellant's need for an additional eighteen months of treatment, beyond the thirty that he originally deemed necessary, is related solely to the post-settlement period and not to the Form 1099 or Official A statement incidents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The psychologist's April 1994 statements indicated that he began seeing appellant in March 1993 following an automobile accident and that his treatment of her involved matters in addition to the two incidents at issue in this case. The April 1994 statements further indicated that appellant would need thirty months of treatment at a cost of $32,000.00. The psychologist's statements make clear that the two incidents were one cause of appellant's injury. We find, based on the record, that the agency's actions are responsible for twenty-five percent of appellant's injury. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the agency improperly denied appellant's request for future pecuniary damages relating to psychotherapy and award such damages in the amount of $8,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wooten v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01960727 (1997) (allocating a portion of medical expenses as damages where the complainant was receiving treatment prior to the discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the emotional distress from discrimination exacerbates a previously existing physical condition, damages may be recovered for that exacerbation provided the evidence establishes a causal connection between the stress and the previously existing condition. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954362 (1997), the Commission awarded $10,000 in nonpecuniary damages where, among other things, the stress from the discrimination exacerbated previously existing physical conditions. In <span class="Italic">Rose v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01950521 (1998), the Commission awarded half of the complainant's past and projected future medical costs where only some of the emotional distress was caused by discrimination and it was "impossible to determine precisely what portion of the therapy concerned" the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">It does not appear there is any substantial reduction in a damage award where the complainant has a predisposition to a medical condition but there are no symptoms prior to the discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Cook v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950027 (1998), the Commission noted that the complainant was predisposed to hypersensitivity, but the onset of symptoms did not precede the discrimination. As a result, the Commission found the discrimination "substantially contributed" to the worsening of the preexisting condition. There is no indication in the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> decision that the Commission in any way reduced the amount of the damage award because of the complainant's predisposition. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Viers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A14246 (2002), the Commission awarded $65,000 in damages despite a preexisting condition where the complainant submitted evidence that her condition was in remission just prior to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Irvin W. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120141773 (2016), the Commission increased the complainant's award from $10,500 to $60,000 where he was able to establish that his condition was improving prior to the discriminatory incident:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency found that Complainant's pre-existing condition was largely the cause of Complainant's physical and emotional distress during this time, and that the amount awarded was meant to compensate Complainant for the worsening of that condition. The Agency disagreed with Complainant's claim that his condition had stabilized by the time he arrived in Brussels, as evidence revealed he was still on a large dosage of steroids in July 2008, weeks before he began <span id="Page_1957"></span>working. Although Complainant alleged that he suffered from a loss of bone density (Osteopenia) as a result of his long term steroid use, the Agency determined that there was insufficient evidence that this was as a result of the discrimination. Furthermore, although Complainant suffered emotional distress related to the discrimination, such distress occurred prior to his request for reasonable accommodation, which the Agency could not be held liable for. In sum, the Agency concluded that Complainant's condition was inherently unpredictable, and accordingly, his symptoms were unrelated to the discrimination itself. Accordingly, the Agency concluded that $10,500.00 was an appropriate amount to compensate Complainant for the emotional distress he suffered. The Agency declined to award any pecuniary damages in response to Complainant's request. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making an award the Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co</span>., 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987). The Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a Complainant has a pre-existing condition, the Agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. Second, if the Complainant's pre-existing condition inevitably would have worsened, the Agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination, the burden of proof being on the Agency to establish the extent of this entitlement. <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (citing <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997). Here, we find that the Agency has done little to meet its burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the evidence provided by Complainant, we find the Agency's award of $10,500.00 to be inadequate to remedy the harm caused by the Agency. The Commission notes that record evidence confirmed that over a three year period, Complainant experienced an exacerbation of his pre-existing conditions for which he sought treatment caused by the stress created by the Agency's discriminatory actions. Complainant asserts that he suffered from anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and loss of consortium. He maintains he did not go out socially, and suffered from headaches, night sweats and loss of bone density. Most notably, he states he had tapered down his steroid dosage prior to reporting to Brussels, but was forced to increase the medication when the Agency refused to provide him with an accommodation of his disability. We find the evidence supports Complainant's position that his condition had stabilized and thus, the Agency is liable for the worsening of his condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that an award of $60,000.00 is reasonable under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720140022 (Sept. 16, 2015) (Complainant awarded $60,000.00 where Agency's failure to accommodate resulted in depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and exacerbation of existing symptoms); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No, 0720130013 (Aug. 14, 2014) (Complainant awarded $60,000.00 where Agency's failure to accommodate resulted in exacerbation of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, stress, and elevated blood pressure); <span class="Italic">Henery v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50034 (Sept. 22, 2005) ($65,000.00 awarded where Complainant suffered from frustration, negativity, and loss of sleep for a four-year period, as well as physical pain associated with the resulting excessive walking. The discrimination caused significant increase in Complainant's need for medical treatment, as well as an increase in physical and emotional harm).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that this amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered and his pre-existing condition, and is also consistent with prior Commission precedent. Finally, the Commission finds this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (Apr. 15, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F. 2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Lisk-Nesbitt v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A12060 (2002), the Commission rejected the complainant's argument that the damage award should not have been reduced because of a preexisting condition where the complainant was in active treatment prior to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a complainant's preexisting condition is, in part, the result of previous discrimination, the award for the suffering caused by subsequent discrimination need not be reduced. However, to the extent the condition also is aggravated by other factors, the award will be reduced. For example, in <span class="Italic">Guajardo-Hartley v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A02073 (2003), the Commission awarded $30,000 for the aggravation of a preexisting depression that was initially caused by earlier discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Guajardo-Hartley</span>, starting with a recitation of its findings in the earlier case, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant's husband stated that he and complainant were unable to enjoy a normal relationship because of the situation at work. Complainant's mother stated that the harassment to which complainant had been subjected at work had a detrimental effect on her mental and emotional well-being. Similar assessments were voiced by R, D, and M. These lay witnesses gave their statements in December 1995, long after the incidents at issue in the instant appeal and EEOC Request No. 05990563 took place. The psychiatrist who testified at the December 1994 hearing stated that complainant had begun experiencing work-related stress, depression, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, loss of emotional control, and difficulty relating to others since January or February 1993, and that her condition was mild early on. The record indicates that complainant's condition worsened between 1994 and 1996, when the bulk of the incidents at issue in the instant appeal had been occurring. In April 1996, Dr. P diagnosed complainant as suffering from major depression. His concluding paragraph read, "in summary, the harassment, discrimination and problems [complainant] perceives occurred at her workplace are consistent with causing severe impairment of all activities of daily living as well as inducing depression." None of the witnesses, medical or lay, referred specifically to incidents identified in EEOC Request No. 05990563, or in the instant appeal, but only to what they characterized as "ongoing" discrimination and harassment. After reviewing these documents, we find nothing in the record that ties the harm described in CDIF Exhibits C4 and C10 exclusively to the incidents at issue in EEOC Request No. 05990563. We therefore find that the harm suffered by complainant was caused, in part, by the conduct at issue in the above-referenced complaints as well as in complaint no. 931012.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Other factors contributed to her condition, however. The medical reports indicated that complainant's depression and stress-related illnesses resulted not only from the acts that gave rise to the above-referenced complaints, but also from the debilitating residual effects of the injuries that she sustained an on-the-job in November 1993. CDIF, Ex. C5. The long-term effects of that injury were not apparent at the time the events at issue in EEOC Request No. 05990563 took place, and did not come to light until September 1994, well over a year after she filed complaint no. 931012. Between September 1994 and April 1996, complainant had been on a variety of medications, including acetaminophen with codeine and ultram (pain killers), glucophage and glucotrol (medication for diabetes), and synthroid (thyroid medication). CDIF, Ex. C5.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Given the severity and the three year duration of the psychological and physical injuries experienced by complainant and the awards the Commission has made in similar cases, we find that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $85,000. This takes into account all of complainant's emotional and physical problems and the fact that the vast majority of these problems were caused by the agency's discriminatory actions. The Commission finds that the amount of this award is not motivated by either passion or prejudice; is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone; and is not inconsistent with amounts awarded in similar cases.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.</span>, 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987). The Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a complainant has a pre-existing condition, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. Second, if the complainant's pre-existing condition inevitably would have worsened, the agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination; the burden of proof being on the agency to establish the extent of this entitlement<span class="Italic">. Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (citing <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997); <span class="Italic">Ward-Jenkins v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999). If the agency can prove that complainant's pre-existing condition inevitably would have worsened even in the absence of discrimination, the size of the damages award will be reduced<span class="Italic">. Durrant v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971885 (September 15, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Wallis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, had a history of depression before being subjected to discriminatory acts. The complainant had experienced recurring episodes of depression after the incidents in question, and would need treatment for another five years. On that basis, the Commission awarded the complainant $50,000 in nonpecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943844 (May 8, 1996), the Commission awarded the complainant $25,000 in <span id="Page_1958"></span>nonpecuniary compensatory damages after finding that she had been subjected to sexual harassment between 1990 and 1993. She had been diagnosed with depression many years before her employment with the agency, but had never been hospitalized prior to the incidents that gave rise to her complaint. She was hospitalized four times between April and December 1992, as a result of the agency's conduct, however, the trauma that complainant experienced did not last beyond the cessation of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span> EEOC Request No. 05970336 (November 20, 1997). the Commission also awarded complainant $25,000 in non-pecuniary damages, in connection with the depression he experienced after not being selected for a particular position. The Complainant had experienced numerous problems outside the workplace before the nonselection, including bankruptcy, marital difficulties, and his wife's illness. The Commission found that the nonselection exacerbated the complainant's pre-existing emotional and psychological problems, but to a limited extent. In awarding the complainant $25,000, the Commission took into consideration the presence of various outside factors and two-year duration of the complainant's harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant, like the complainants in <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, <span class="Italic">Terrell</span>, and <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, had a preexisting depression. Unlike those cases, however, her depression was caused not by factors outside of work, but by the agency's prior discriminatory conduct, for which she was awarded $85,000 in nonpecuniary damages. As previously noted, complainant's depression intensified between 1993 and 1996, due to the agency's actions in 1994 and 1995 as well as to the debilitating effects of her physical injuries. We therefore find that an intervening factor was present in this case, just as in <span class="Italic">Terrell</span>. In December 1996 complainant transferred out of Honolulu and away from the work situation where her discrimination complaints arose. She was still taking antidepressants one year later. Beyond that, the record is unclear. While complainant has shown that the harm she experienced lasted longer than the harm experienced by the complainant in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, she has not shown that she experienced the same duration of harm that justified the $50,000 award in <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>. After considering these particular circumstances, we will direct the agency to award complainant an additional $30,000 which represents compensation for the harm that complainant suffered in connection with the incidents at issue in the above-referenced complaints. The medical reports are sufficient to support an inference that, due to complainant's physical ailments, which became more acute after the events at issue in complaint no. 931012, her depression would inevitably have worsened even if she had not been subjected to discrimination. A higher award would therefore not be appropriate, notwithstanding the Commission's decision in Request No. 05990563.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is some indication that if discrimination aggravates a preexisting physical condition that results in increased pain to a complainant, the Commission will correspondingly increase the damage award. In <span class="Italic">Turner v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01956390 (1998), the agency's discrimination resulted in assigning the complainant duties that exceeded a lifting restriction due to preexisting degenerative disc disease. The Commission relied heavily on the physical pain suffered by the complainant and the physical side effects of that pain--nausea and vomiting--in increasing the agency's damage award of $10,000 to $40,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Young v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01955120 (1998), the Commission awarded only $5,000 in damages where the complainant previously suffered from migraine headaches, had only two migraines at the time of her nonselection, and had several other stressors in her life. The Commission further found there was no evidence to support the complainant's claim of depression, and that only minor distress was caused by the discrimination. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Young</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Damages for migraines</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ stated that appellant was entitled to damages for mild and limited pain and suffering for the migraines which occurred after the April 1992 nonselection. It is apparent that the AJ set the parameters as "mild and limited pain and suffering" due to the fact that the evidence in the record established a nexus between only the two migraines which occurred shortly after the April 1992 nonselection. The Commission agrees with this limitation of the award. Although it is clear that appellant had a history of suffering from migraine headaches, contrary to appellant's assertions, the medical evidence does not show an increase in the number of migraine headaches experienced by appellant as a result of the nonselections. The evidence used to support this conclusion, treatment notes from Kaiser showing the number of times that appellant was treated for migraine headaches, documents the fact that there were many reasons given by appellant as to the cause of the migraines. Moreover, this evidence does not show any appreciable increase in the frequency of the migraines after the nonselections.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we agree that there is considerable evidence establishing that appellant failed to mitigate her damages because she failed to adhere to the Kaiser treating physicians' advice concerning stress reduction and a change in medication. The AJ found appellant's testimony that her husband would not take her to the clinic for treatment was not credible, given that her husband appeared devoted to appellant, and it was uncontroverted that he took her to the clinic often in the middle of the night for shots of Demerol.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Damages for depression</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although appellant did not specifically object to the AJ's finding on this portion of the award, the Commission deems it noteworthy, inasmuch as it is here that the AJ discredited the testimony and opinion of appellant's psychologist. The AJ noted several deficiencies in the psychological evaluation of this psychologist, including the fact that his report did not include any symptoms to support a diagnosis of depression, it was based upon incorrect facts, and on cross-examination he expressed doubts about the diagnosis. This opinion was compared to that of the agency's physician who reviewed the past medical records, extensively interviewed appellant, and found no apparent symptoms of depression. The AJ thus concluded that appellant was not suffering from major depression. The Commission agrees, and therefore makes no award of compensatory damages for depression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Damages for mild emotional distress, humiliation, and embarrassment due to the nonselections.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the AJ does not elaborate on the reason for setting the parameter of "mild" in this case, interwoven in her decision is the fact that there were a myriad of other problems in appellant's life which would contribute to emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment, etc. In addition, there is little evidence, other than the physical manifestation of migraines which was previously considered, describing the distress, humiliation, embarrassment that appellant endured as a result of the nonselections. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the AJ's parameter is reasonable under the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Damages for diminished sexual relations, decreased social life, and decrease ability to perform household duties.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission agrees with the AJ's finding of no award in these areas claimed. Specifically, with regard to the diminished sexual relations and social life claim, it is clear that appellant cited the pain from her migraines as the cause of these losses. Nonetheless, as shown previously, only two migraines were found to be related to the nonselections. In addition, the evidence is also clear that appellant's husband assumed most household duties prior to the nonselections, and therefore, no loss of ability to perform household duties is compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that there are no "hard and fast" rules governing the amount of nonpecuniary damages to be awarded. Any such award, however, must be limited to the sums necessary to compensate the injured party for actual harm, even where the harm is intangible, <span class="Italic">see Carter v. Duncan-Higgins, Ltd.</span>, 727 F.2d 1225 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and should take into account the severity of the harm and the length of time that the injured party has suffered from the harm<span class="Italic">. Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995); EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 14. The Commission notes that for a proper award of nonpecuniary damages, the amount of the award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989);<span class="Italic"> EEOC v. AIC Security Investigations, Ltd.</span>, 823 F. Supp. 573, 574 (N.D. Ill. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the amount of nonpecuniary damages to which appellant is entitled, the Commission has considered that the agency's actions caused appellant emotional distress and contributed to an exacerbation of her physical pain. The record reveals, however, that there are other sources of appellant's pain and suffering, e.g., her unresolved feelings toward her mother, her worries about her son and granddaughter, her history of breast cancer and back injury. These collateral sources do not diminish completely the relationship between the nonselections and appellant's pain and suffering. Rather, the Commission has considered them and apportioned the award as necessary. Considering all the factors, and the nature, severity and duration of the discrimination, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $5,000.00.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Hogeland v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01976440 (1999), the Commission awarded $25,000 in damages for aggravation of a preexisting depressive condition. In that case, the complainant increased the multiple medications she was taking after the agency withdrew her use of leave without pay as a reasonable accommodation. As a result, the complainant increased her medication to the point where she was required to undergo inpatient detoxification. The Commission indicated the award would have been more substantial if not for the limited duration of the aggravation of the depression.</p>
<p class="noindent">When there is a preexisting condition, each party has a specific proof problem. The complainant must demonstrate the degree to which the preexisting <span id="Page_1959"></span>condition has been aggravated as part of his burden of proving damages, and the agency, to escape damages, must demonstrate that the condition would inexorably have worsened even absent discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Rowan v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120070384 (2009), the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages finding that neither party had met its burden with precision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the discriminatory assignment to pull weeds exacerbated an already-declining emotional state resulting from matters that, while work-related, were not a part of the underlying finding of discrimination. One of complainant's doctors stated that complainant's emotional dysfunction began around the time complainant began his employment with the agency. The additional injury that resulted from the agency's discriminatory actions (directing complainant to pull weeds) included some amount of complainant's stress, humiliation, anxiety, sleeplessness, fears of termination, and depression. The agency has not offered evidence that complainant's condition inevitably would have worsened, but neither does complainant's evidence establish with any precision the extent to which his pre-existing condition was exacerbated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the foregoing, our review of the record, and Commission precedent, we find that complainant is entitled to $10,000 in non-pecuniary damages. An award of $10,000 takes into account, as best may be discerned, the nature, severity, and duration of complainant's suffering. This amount also is consistent with other non-pecuniary compensatory damages awards given in similar cases and is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, nor derived from passion or prejudice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hedgpeth v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A52869 (September 7, 2006) ($10,000 awarded where complainant suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, profound depression with suicidal tendency, fatigue, inability to sleep, frequent crying, and fear that she would lose her job, with other contributing factors); <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A40981 (August 4, 2005) ($10,000 awarded where complainant experienced emotional distress, humiliation, and severe anxiety for approximately two years, became withdrawn, somber, easily angered, and reclusive); <span class="Italic">Eberly v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30085 (May 20, 2004) ($10,000 awarded where complainant experienced depression, sleeplessness, anxiety, low self-esteem, and nightmares, but majority of symptoms were caused by prior unrelated incident); <span class="Italic">Caros v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30094 (February 19, 2004) ($10,000 awarded where complainant experienced an exacerbation of physical ailments as well as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and marital strain).</p>
