<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-70"><span class="space">15.</span> Reasonable Accommodation</h4>
<p class="noindent">A qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities who can, with or without reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the position that the individual holds or desires. 29 CFR 1630.2(m). Assuming an individual meets all other criteria--i.e., he or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity and is otherwise qualified for the position--the final step in deciding whether that individual is a qualified individual with a disability is determining if he or she can perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant is able to establish that his or her deficient performance is the result of an agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation the agency will not escape liability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Michelle G. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120132463 (2016). As the Commission in <span class="Italic">Nicki D. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 0720180023 (2021), noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that the purpose of the Rehabilitation Act is to allow an individual with a disability to work with or without reasonable accommodation, we would be remiss to allow the Agency to rely on Complainant's alleged performance deficiencies, during periods when she did not have an accommodation, as a basis for finding her not qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent">In assessing whether the complainant was a qualified individual, the Commission noted that her work performance only became problematic when her request for telework was delayed. Finding the complainant's removal disability-based discrimination in <span class="Italic">Nicki D</span>., the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to claims 3 and 4 concerning Complainant's removal from federal service. For Complainant to prevail on her claim of disparate treatment, she must satisfy the three-part evidentiary scheme fashioned by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Complainant must initially establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by demonstrating that she was subjected to an adverse employment action under circumstances that would support an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Furnco Constr. Co. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978). Proof of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case will vary depending on the facts of the particular case. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 804 n.14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination under a disparate treatment theory, Complainant must demonstrate that: (1) she is an "individual with a disability" (2) she is "qualified" for the position held or desired; (3) she was subjected to an adverse personnel action under circumstances giving rise to an inference of disability discrimination and/or denied a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Josiah M. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2019003865 (Feb. 14, 2020).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment on the basis of reprisal, Complainant must show that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the Agency was aware of the protected activity; (3) subsequently, she was subjected to adverse treatment by the Agency; <span id="Page_1178"></span>and (4) a nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse treatment. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120132503 (Aug. 28, 2014), <span class="Italic">citing Whitmire v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A00340 (Sept. 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Cmty. Aff. v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). Petitioner must ultimately prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency's explanation is pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Reeves v.

<p class="noindent-1">This established order of analysis, in which the first step normally consists of determining the existence of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, need not be followed in all cases. Where the agency has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the personnel action at issue, the factual inquiry can proceed directly to the third step of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis, concerning the ultimate issue of whether Complainant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's actions were motivated by discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Herb E. v. Equal Emp. Opp. Comm'n</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120171699 (Nov. 27, 2019); <span class="Italic">see also Charlie K. v. Equal Emp.

<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the record, we find that the Agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. With regard to the removal action, our review of the record shows that the Agency removed Complainant from federal service due to her poor performance. Specifically, the Agency alleged that Complainant, among other things, failed to: understand the laws enforced by the Commission; follow her supervisor's instructions; ensure the accuracy and completeness of case data in the Integrated Management System; provide sufficient analysis; and properly assemble case files. The Agency also alleged that Complainant was not receptive to constructive criticism.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, Complainant now bears the burden of establishing that the Agency's stated reasons were merely a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shapiro v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Request No. 05960403 (Dec. 6, 1996). Indicators of pretext include, but are not limited to, discriminatory statements or past personal treatment attributable to those responsible for the personnel action that led to the filing of the complaint, comparative or statistical data revealing differences in treatment across various protected-group lines, unequal application of Agency policy, deviations from standard procedures without explanation or justification, or inadequately explained inconsistencies in the evidentiary record. <span class="Italic">Mellissa F. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141697 (Nov. 12, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arguing pretext, Complainant contended that the removal action was pretext for discrimination based on disability. Specifically, Complainant disputed S1's characterization of her work, and she maintained that S1 poisoned S2's impression of her by selectively providing S2 with biased feedback. Complainant also maintained that no management official other than S1 observed her work performance. Complainant asserted that S1 subjected her discrimination because she had requested a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the AJ credited Complainant's version of events. In this regard, while the AJ considered the Agency's explanation that Complainant's removal was due to performance reasons, the AJ found that the probative evidence failed to support that assertion. Having reviewed the record, the AJ found that the Agency's removal action was based on discriminatory animus because the record clearly showed that Complainant performed at the "fully successful" level in the months prior to her request for reasonable accommodation, but that assessment in the months following Complainant's requests for reasonable accommodation declined. In rejecting the Agency's assessment of Complainant's work, the AJ noted that the Agency did not provide Complainant with any specific warnings about her performance, did not issue her any performance letters, and never counseled her in an official setting. Furthermore, the AJ credited the hearing testimony of Complainant's third-level supervisor, who testified that the removal action was based on the erroneous assumption that Complainant was receiving reasonable accommodation. The AJ concluded that the Agency, in failing to timely provide Complainant with reasonable accommodation, had essentially deprived Complainant of the opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. The AJ reasoned that to hold Complainant accountable for performance deficiencies during periods when she did not have accommodations would be contrary to the Rehabilitation Act's purpose of allowing individuals with disabilities to work with or without accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for Complainant's reprisal claim, the AJ found that the evidence established that Complainant was subjected to discrimination in reprisal for engaging in protected activity (requesting a reasonable accommodation) when she was terminated from her Investigator position with the Agency. The AJ's decision to find reprisal relied on the close proximity between Complainant's request for an extension of her accommodation both in January and February of 2015 and again in May of 2015 and her subsequent termination, along with the finding that the Agency provided little to no evidence of performance problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency contends that the AJ erred in finding that Complainant was deprived of the opportunity to show that she could perform the essential functions of her position with or without accommodation. To the contrary, the Agency vehemently maintains that Complainant in fact was receiving her requested accommodation when her performance deficiencies manifested. Furthermore, the Agency asserts that Complainant's second-level supervisor independently reviewed Complainant's work and found it to be deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration, we find substantial evidence to support the AJ's decision. While we considered the Agency's contention that Complainant in fact was receiving accommodations when her performance deficiencies manifested, we agree with the AJ that the probative evidence fails to show that the Agency effectively accommodated Complainant. In this regard, we note that Complainant <span id="Page_1179"></span>first requested reasonable accommodation on August 27, 2014 and was removed from federal service on May 14, 2015. The record reflects that during this 260-day period, the Agency only allowed Complainant to telework for a total of 85 days (November 18, 2014-January 18, 2015 and March 2, 2015-March 27, 2015). Given that Complainant was not allowed to telework for the vast majority this period, we agree with the AJ that the Agency's failure to accommodate played a significant role in Complainant's performance deficiencies. Moreover, while we acknowledge that there is a dispute as to whether acted S1 acted with discriminatory animus, and whether S1's discriminatory animus tainted the decisions of S2 and 3, we note that the AJ considered the evidence presented by the parties, weighed the evidence, and concluded that S1's discriminatory animus irreparably tainted the removal action. As we find substantial evidence to support the AJ's decision, we decline to second guess the AJ's findings of fact. Accordingly, we conclude that Complainant has successfully shown that the Agency's articulated reasons were pretext for discrimination on the alleged bases.</p>
<p class="noindent">As mentioned above, the definition of a qualified individual with a disability is circular insofar as only such an individual is entitled to reasonable accommodation yet reasonable accommodation must be considered in determining entitlement unless, of course, the individual can perform the essential functions of the position without reasonable accommodation. It may be that in the final analysis, reasonable accommodation is not possible or that any possible accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency. The practical effect of this circular definition is that once an employee or applicant for employment establishes that he or she is an individual with a disability and is otherwise qualified for the position, the agency must engage in the interactive process of considering reasonable accommodation. That process must include consideration of reassignment if no accommodation would permit the complainant to perform his or her present essential job functions, as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Worstell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965798 (2000). In <span class="Italic">Worstell</span>, the complainant was oriGINAlly hired as a mail clerk in a general hiring. Later, he was certified by a state disability agency for employment as a mail processor. However, when the complainant became unable to perform the essential functions of a mail processor, the agency failed to consider him for reassignment to the mail clerk position. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Worstell</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an employee is "qualified," an agency therefore must look beyond the position which the employee presently encumbers to determine whether there is a position to which the employee can be reassigned. In this case, although the agency undertook to explore whether complainant could be accommodated in the Mail Processor position, the agency made no effort to explore reassignment as an accommodation when an accommodation that would allow complainant to remain in the Mail Processor position could not be found....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency placed complainant in the Mail Processor position after discovering that it was the only position for which the state agency had certified him, the Commission notes that complainant initially was hired through general public hiring as a Mail Clerk. Complainant states that he performed this position successfully, and the agency has submitted no evidence to the contrary. Rather, the agency stated that complainant requested transfer to a Mail Handler position, which offered more hours, and was re-appointed to a Mail Processor position when it was discovered that the state agency had not certified him for the Mail Handler position. Considering the length of time that complainant had been working for the agency and that he was not initially hired under a special program, and the agency's position that the Mail Handler and Mail Processor positions are functionally equivalent, which position complainant was certified to hold is immaterial. What is material is that the agency did not consider reassigning complainant to a different position when it became apparent that he could not perform the essential functions of the Mail Handler or Mail Processor positions. As such, the Commission finds that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reasonable accommodation, both the process and the end result including reassignment, are discussed in detail in Chapter 15 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec15-2">Overview of Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission demonstrated that circular analysis in <span class="Italic">Edgardo D. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 2019001871 (2020), where it found that, despite the agency's efforts, the complainant could not perform the essential functions of the job with or without accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Commission's regulations, an agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9. Reasonable accommodation includes modifications to the manner in which a position is customarily performed in order to enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential job functions. EEOC Notice No. 915.002, <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Oct. 17, 2002) (Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation). The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against qualified disabled individuals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630. In order to establish disability discrimination, complainant must show that: (1) he is an individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); (2) he is a qualified individual with a disability pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); and (3) the agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. In the instant case, the Agency concedes that Complainant is an individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. However, unlike the Agency, we find that Complainant has not established that he is a "qualified" individual with a disability with respect to prong 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant did not inform the Agency of his double vision until after he was hired, but nevertheless informed management the next month after his hiring of his vision impairment. While Complainant did not provide the Agency with current medical documentation from his eye doctor until January 29, 2014, the record reflects that the management emailed Complainant the power point slides for the training materials on December 27, 2013, and also permanently beginning on February 3, 2014. The record also reflects that by the time Complainant began the Training Module in April 2014, his workstation was also outfitted with the "MAGic" software, printer, and the CCTV system. However, despite this assistive equipment and software, Complainant could not meet the Agency's reported production quota of at least four cases per day with at least 60 percent accuracy and show progress towards the goal of eight cases per day with an accuracy of 80 percent. The record shows that from June 2, 2014, through July 18, 2014, Complainant's production was only 1.72 case per day, well below the reported quota of four to eight cases per day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that, while the Agency was not required to lower production standards, it nevertheless presented Complainant with several accommodations he requested. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720120034 (Nov. 26, 2014) (agency was not required to a lower production standard but was required to provide reasonable accommodation to enable complainant to meet that standard). <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12367 (June 26, 2002), <span class="Italic">req. for recon den'd</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A21029 (Oct. 3, 2002) (finding that agency reasonably accommodated complainant with alternative measures geared toward reducing stress from production quota).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, while the Agency declined to waive its production quota, it nonetheless provided Complainant with assistive magnifying software and equipment in an effort to accommodate Complainant for his double vision condition. However, these accommodations were not effective, as Complainant was still unable to meet the production quota. While Complainant may have not received the 27-inch monitors as requested, it is unclear if such accommodation would have enabled him to meet the Agency's quota, given that Complainant had already received numerous accommodations and yet was only producing about 1.72 case per day from June 2, 2014, through July 18, 2014.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in addition to the fact that an employer is not required to lower production standards, an employer is also not required to reallocate or eliminate essential functions of a position in association with an accommodation request. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation. We find that as processing cases is an essential function of the BA Trainee position, Complainant was not entitled to reallocation of this duty. <span class="Italic">See Brooks</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12367 (finding that complainant was not entitled to a less-complex docket as a reasonable accommodation). As such, we find that Complainant was not qualified for the BA Trainee position as he could not perform its essential functions with or without accommodation.</p>
