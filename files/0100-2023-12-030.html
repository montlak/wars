<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-31"><span class="space">16.</span> Incapacity, Mental, or Physical</h4>
<p class="noindent">As with waiver of the time period for initiating precomplaint counseling, as <span id="Page_159"></span>a general rule a complainant who seeks a waiver of the time period for filing a formal complaint must demonstrate that a mental or physical inability rendered him or her unable to timely file a complaint. <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A20491 (2003). See also, Chapter 2, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-10-040.html#sec1-41">Dismissal of Complaints</a>." The same rule applies when the notice of final interview is delivered to the complainant's home address and is signed for by a family member. In order to waive the time limit for filing of the formal complaint, the complainant must show that the family member was so incapacitated by a medical condition as to affect the complainant's timely receipt of the notice. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Valentine v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962416 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Weinberger v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920040 (February 21, 1992), the Commission held that "when an appellant claims that a physical condition prevented him/her from meeting a particular deadline, the appellant must be so incapacitated by the condition as to render him/her unable to make a timely filing." The same is true regarding claims of incapacity related to psychiatric or psychological conditions<span class="Italic">. See Crear v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920700 (October 29, 1992); <span class="Italic">accord Speiser v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 670 F. Supp. 380 (D.D.C.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 818 F.2d 95 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (mental illness causing impaired judgment insufficient to toll time limit absent evidence appellant unable to manage own affairs or comprehend legal rights). We find that these same principles apply here: in order for appellant to rebut a finding that his stepfather, an adult member of his household, is not a person of suitable discretion based on a medical condition, appellant must provide evidence that his stepfather is so incapacitated that his condition prevented appellant from receiving the notice in a timely fashion. In this case, there is no evidence that appellant's stepfather suffered from a mental or physical condition that affected his timely receipt of the notice. We find that appellant's stepfather's receipt of the notice of final interview constitutes appellant's constructive receipt. Appellant thereafter failed to file his complaint within fifteen days of his receipt of the notice.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120151874 (2015), the Commission found that the complainant's hospitalization for treatment of blood clots did not render him incapacitated for purposes of timely filing a formal complaint, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a complainant claims that a physical condition prevents him from meeting a particular filing deadline, we have held that in order to justify an untimely filing, the complainant must be so incapacitated by the condition as to render him physically unable to make a timely filing. <span class="Italic">See Zelmer v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890164 (March 8, 1989). There is nothing in the record reflecting that Complainant was so incapacitated during the applicable fifteen day period as to prevent him from contacting his attorney by telephone and arranging for the timely filing of his formal complaint. In sum, Complainant has not offered adequate justification to warrant an extension of the time limit for filing the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120151307 (2015), the Commission did set aside the timeframe for filing the formal complaint where during the 15-day period the complainant had surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome and was on pain medication. Her physician also submitted a statement that she had been diagnosed with acute major depression and anxiety. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jessica R. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019005239 (2019), similarly reversed the agency's dismissal for untimely filing. Excusing the complainant's week delay, the Commission credited the surgeon's letter stating that "Complainant had been admitted to the hospital...[and] that she required surgery and was unable to return to work with restrictions." The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jessica R</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record revealed the Agency emailed Complainant the notice of right to file a formal complainant on the day that Complainant she was hospitalized. Even if the Agency had provided documentation reflecting a read-receipt confirmation of the emailed notice, it has not established that Complainant has not provided justification for any delay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant presented evidence of significant medical incapacitation coupled with surgery, during the 15-day period for timely filing a formal complaint. Based on a consideration of the specific chronology of events in the instant matter, we exercise our discretion to equitably toll the fifteen-day time limitation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Joleen M. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120151001 (2016) (declining to set aside time limits where complainant underwent carpel tunnel surgery seven days after receiving the notice and alleged that "it is very difficult to type using only 'her' left hand" and that her "handwriting was generally illegible"; Commission noted that complainant could have requested an extension).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when stress rises to the level that it justifies sick leave, that is not sufficient to warrant waiving of the time limit for filing a formal complaint. The complainant must show that "she was incapacitated to such an extent that she was not able to file her complaint in a timely manner." <span class="Italic">Cross v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962530 (1998). For example, in <span class="Italic">Placides v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A03114 (2000), the Commission found the complainant demonstrated sufficient mental duress where she submitted evidence from a licensed clinical psychologist that she was incapacitated to the degree that she had to stop working and collect workers' compensation benefits and was unable to complete the paperwork for filing a complaint. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A31127 (2003), the Commission found the complainant had established good cause for the untimely filing of his formal complaint where he submitted evidence from a psychiatrist that he was being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, and anxiety. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hayden R. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120151102 (2016) (untimely filing excused where complainant suffered PTSD and seizures and maintained that the stress of being terminated on the same day he received the notice of right to file caused severe stress, "requiring a period of time to reorient himself and retain legal counsel.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ahmad v. Postmaster General</span>, 05970979 (1999), the Commission reversed an agency dismissal of a complaint where, on request for reconsideration, the complainant submitted medical evidence that she experienced confusion as the result of a head injury. The complainant contended the confusion caused her to incorrectly state the date of the alleged discrimination in the formal complaint. Use of the corrected date made the complaint timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Post traumatic stress disorder and chronic depression were considered sufficient to waive the time limit for counselor contact where the complainant submitted evidence that he was forced to stop working and was prescribed morphine for back pain during the 15-day period for filing a formal complaint. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a54811.txt">01A54811</a> (2005), the complainant also submitted a statement from his doctor that he was unable to timely file the formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120102784 (2010), the Commission found that the complainant, even though represented by counsel, was mentally incapacitated for purposes of timely assisting her counsel in filing the formal complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that the record contains adequate justification to warrant an extension of the time limit for filing the complaint. Complainant submitted an affidavit to the AJ in opposition to the Agency's motion to dismiss in which she averred that during the period when her complaint needed to be filed she "could not assist [her] attorney in preparing [her] complaint and did not have the mental capacity to think about what had happened...at the workplace or anything related to the job." As a result, her attorney asserts on appeal that she was "non-communicative and unresponsive" and unable to effectively assist him in framing her complaint containing allegations were "fact based and uniquely within the personal knowledge of the complainant." He further asserts that after Complainant received therapy, including medication, she recovered sufficiently to assist in the preparation of the complaint and its submission in April.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Report of Investigation contains evidence supporting Complainant's claim. Her treating psychologist provided a statement to the Agency dated February 12, 2008 (the same time frame as the complaint filing period) indicating she had diagnosed Complainant with a "major depressive disorder, severe, recurrent with psychosis," as well as post-traumatic stress, that manifested itself with a variety of symptoms, including severe depression, acute stress, anxiety, confusion, fear, a sense of overwhelm and suicidal ideations. The statement indicated that Complainant was unable to work due to her mental health conditions, with an undetermined return to work date.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Report of Investigation, Exhibits M and U.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it obtained a document written by Complainant's psychiatrist, who was monitoring her medication, dated March 6, 2008, in which he indicated she was "improved," in a "more stable mood" and "able to follow goals, structures." The Agency asserts that this statement is inconsistent Complainant's claims of incapacity and her psychologist's statement. It appears the AJ was persuaded by the Agency's position as the Order of Dismissal stated, without further detail, that evidence "reveals that Complainant was capable of filing her complaint on time."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission, however, disagrees that Complainant has not produced sufficient evidence of the limiting effects of her mental illness on her ability to timely file her complaint even considering the March 2008 psychiatric statement indicating some improvement. Under the facts of this case, we exercise our discretion to waive the limitation period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120120802 (2012), where the complainant suffered from PTSD and major depressive disorder and filed her formal complaint two days late. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record establishes that Complainant filed her formal complaint two days beyond the requisite fifteen-day limitation period. On appeal, her Representative requests that the brief delay be excused because Complainant suffered from depression that interfered with her ability to properly tend to business like filing her complaint. He provided medical documentation to support his assertion. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) provides that the time limits in the EEO complaint process are subject to waiver, estoppels and equitable tolling. Complainant in this case has <span id="Page_160"></span>asserted that in late April 2011, she experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and suicidal thoughts. As a result, she sought psychological services through the Agency's Employee Assistance Program. This was reported to her management and Complainant alleges she was told not to return to work until medically released. A medical report provided by Complainant indicates that she was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD and, sometime in early May 2011, was prescribed medication for her psychological condition. The report indicates that Complainant experienced, among other symptoms, depression, lack of concentration and memory problems. Although Complainant's medical documentation does not explicitly establish that she was totally incapacitated between May 11-26, the filing period for her complaint, we find that the evidence of the seriousness of her medical condition during this time period and the briefness of her delay (two days) is sufficient justification to exercise our discretion to excuse the delay.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120130760 (2013); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120132006 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120112887 (2011), the Commission found that the complainant submitted evidence of good cause to waive the 15-day limitation period where she sought medical treatment and was placed on IV antibiotics and pain medical, and had an "MRSA infection next to her brain." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120122840 (2014) ("Given the specific circumstances of this case, including her medical condition and the surgery on her retina, we find sufficient justification to extend the 15-day limitation period.").</p>
<p class="noindent">However, asserting that one had "difficulties in her personal life" is not good cause for waiving the time period for filing a formal complaint. <span class="Italic">Nunn v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11732 (2001). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Wells v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A11426 (2001), the Commission upheld dismissal of a formal complaint that was filed one day late where the complainant explained that she did not receive the notice of final interview until four days after it arrived because her son mixed it in with his own mail and she was under mental stress at the time.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission may, however, waive the time limit for filing the formal complaint where it has reason to believe that a physical or mental impairment may have interfered with the complainant's ability to understand the requirement. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120081487 (2008), the complainant had a hearing impairment. Although the agency had given the complainant a notice of final interview with written instructions on filing the formal complaint and the complainant had been accompanied to the final interview by a union representative and interpreter, the Commission waived the 15-day period. The Commission noted that on appeal the complainant contended that in addition to her hearing impairment she did not understand written English very well.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many times, the failure of a complainant to receive a waiver of the time limit due to illness or incapacitation is due to the lack of evidence submitted to support the claim. The complainant must submit substantial documentation of the claimed incapacitation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Story v. Postmaster General</span>, 05960332 (1996), the Commission found that the complainant had submitted adequate medical justification for extending the time to file her complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In explaining her untimeliness, she submitted with most of her appeals two notes by her psychiatrist. They were dated January 23, 1995 and June 27, 1995, and stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Appellant] is presently under my care for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Her symptoms presently prevent her from functioning at an appropriate level. Because of this condition she is unable to meet deadlines in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In affirming the agency's dismissals, most of the previous decisions reasoned that the psychiatrist notes were too general to support a finding that appellant was prevented from timely filing her complaints due to medical incapacitation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her request for reconsideration, appellant, among other things, submits more detailed medical evidence. This includes a report by a treating chiropractor written in November 1995. The medical impression of the chiropractor was that appellant had a whiplash injury of the neck and upper back caused by an on-the-job accident in December 1992. Physical examination by the chiropractor revealed severe myospasm of the cervical musculature and trapezius upon palpation. The chiropractor reported that between March 20, 1995 and April 20, 1995 appellant was seen almost daily due to her acute distress, characterized by headache, pain in the neck and shoulders, and muscle spasm of the cervical and thoracic musculature. The chiropractor wrote that appellant continued to experience difficulty in carrying out the activities of normal daily living, and was incapable of returning to her job duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also submits a report of a neuropsychological examination of appellant by a Neuropsychologist, Ph.D. and a Neuropsychological Technician, M.A. The examination occurred on two dates in November and December 1994. The report noted appellant's complaint of unrelenting pain caused by the December 1992 accident. Based on a battery of tests, the report predicted that in everyday life appellant would have occasional lapses in areas of planning and organization. It found appellant had considerable problems with attentional processing, and moderate depression and anxiety. It stated appellant was likely to be in emotional turmoil, and she was presented as being depressed, worried, agitated, and tense. It noted this often leads to complaints of difficulty with thinking and concentrating, and memory difficulties. It concluded that appellant was not ready for full time employment, and was in need, among other things, of pharmacologic management. Appellant submitted evidence that in November 1995 she was prescribed klonopin and nortriptylin for her emotional condition. The additional medical information, taken together with the notes by appellant's psychiatrist, constitutes sufficient documentation to support appellant's argument that she was unable to timely file her complaints due to medical incapacitation. Specifically, the medical report by the chiropractor indicated that during the time appellant was due to file her complaints and filed her complaint in April 1995, she was in acute distress caused by unrelenting pain. Further, the recent prior neuropsychological examination of November and December 1994 noted appellant had considerable problems with attentional processing. It indicated appellant was likely in emotional turmoil, and this often lead to difficulty thinking and concentrating. Thus, the Commission finds that appellant has presented sufficient justification to extend the time limit for filing her complaints.</p>
