<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-107"><span class="space">4.</span> Counselor's Duty to Clarify</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Yokotobi v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05910087 (1991), the Commission commented on the specific duties of the EEO counselor to assist a complainant in clarifying the claims at issue in the complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, although the agency properly referred appellant to the EEO Counselor for counseling on her 16 reprisal allegations, we find that it did not sufficiently attempt to obtain clarification from appellant of the matters being raised before canceling her complaint; nor does it appear that the EEO Counselor executed her duties in accordance with applicable EEO regulations and guidelines. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 29 CFR 1613.213 and the EEO Counseling Handbook. Specifically, although the EEO Counselor claimed that she asked appellant "Who, When, Why and How," such an inquiry apparently was too general and unfocused to elicit the necessary information. For example, with respect to appellant's harassment allegation, the EEO Counselor should have explicitly asked appellant to explain what was done to her and by whom and the dates such alleged harassment occurred. In addition, the EEO Counselor should have made contemporaneous notes during discussions with appellant, writing down the specific questions asked and appellant's responses, rather than trying to recollect her conversations with appellant months after the fact. Most importantly, when appellant attempted to raise new allegations, the EEO Counselor should not have told her that she could not add anything new or start another complaint; instead, she should have considered the meeting in November 1989 a "new counseling contact" and either informed appellant that the nine additional allegations she was attempting to raise would be consolidated with the other allegations being discussed or advised her that these matters would be handled separately and that, following her final interview, she could file a new complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">When it appears from the counselor's report that the formal complaint raises issues not discussed with the counselor, the EEOC will look to the factual information contained in the report. Neither the counselor's nor the complainant's characterization of the claims is dispositive where the factual information contained in the report indicates that the formal complaint contains a claim not previously identified in precomplaint counseling. Claims contained in the factual allegations presented to the counselor, even if not articulated as claims by the counselor in his or her report, or the complainant in his or her formal complaint, must be accepted for processing and may not be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">One recurring difficulty presented in EEO cases, probably because most complainants initiate counseling <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and counselors may not be particularly knowledgeable about legal matters, is that of separating claims from information that is raised as background evidence of discrimination. It is not unusual that a complainant will raise matters that fall outside the 45-day limitation for contacting a counselor. Unless the complainant satisfies some exception to the time limit for counselor contact discussed above under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-11-014.html#sec2-15">Extending the Time Period for Initiating Counseling</a>," any untimely claim is properly dismissed. The complainant is not restricted, however, from relying on incidents that occurred outside of the 45-day period as evidence of discrimination. The agency must permit sufficient development of the record to determine whether a factual allegation is being raised as a claim, which the complainant contends entitles him or her to some relief, or as evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Poxon v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01933724 (1994), the Commission stressed the importance of the complainant and counselor agreeing on the claims submitted for counseling:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_117"></span>In a similar situation, the Commission remanded the complaint back to the agency so that appellant could meet again with an EEO Counselor in order that an agreement could be reached on the issues in appellant's complaint<span class="Italic">. Smith v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05921017 (Apr. 15, 1993). The Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> that EEO Management Directive 110, Chap. 2, III (Oct. 22, 1992), provides that at the counseling stage, the EEO Counselor must be certain that the complainant's issues are clearly defined and that the complainant agrees on what issues are to be the subject of the inquiry and subsequent attempts at resolution<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> On remand, the EEO Counselor, after meeting with appellant, must issue a new report concerning the meeting(s) and defining the complaint<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission provided the following guidance in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> which is applicable to the present case:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In defining the complaint, the agency must be careful to distinguish live allegations from argument or factual background in support of allegations. It is important that the agency make such distinctions in defining the complaint so a focused investigation can be conducted and/or focused FAD [dismissing] issues can be issued.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Commission has taken the position that, as part of the EEO counseling effort, the agency must make efforts to come to an agreement with the complainant on the claims presented. For example, in <span class="Italic">Baker v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01940288 (1994), the Commission found the agency had mischaracterized the complainant's claims by not clarifying which portions of her factual allegations constituted issues for investigation and which portions were merely intended as background evidence of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant at the time of this complaint was a WG-08 Electrical Worker with the agency. The record reflects that appellant initially contacted an EEO Counselor on June 11, 1993, concerning the following matters:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;that she applied for the position of Electrician WG-10 in May 1991 but did not get the promotion when positions were filled on March 8, 1992;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;that no one in management could tell her why she did not get the promotion;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;that she now feels discriminated against because three of the five people who filled the positions at the WG-10 level on March 8, 1992 were transferred on March 26, 1993;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;that the vacancies for Electrician, WG-10, had not been filled and the shop had an opportunity to address underrepresentation of black females after these individuals left; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;that she became aware of underrepresentation for females in the shop on June 11, 1993, when an anonymous person gave her a copy of a sheet of paper with EEO representation figures annotated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant was issued a notice of final interview on July 9, 1993 and appellant filed a formal EEO complaint that same day. Appellant's EEO complaint alleged that she was discriminated against on the bases of her race (Black) and sex (female) when she became aware on May 16, 1993, that she would no longer be employed at the agency due to a RIF (reduction in force) action as of October 15, 1993; in May 1991 she applied for a WG-10 Electrician position and five employees were selected; and on June 11, 1993 she became aware that females were underrepresented in the shop and management had an opportunity to fill the WG-10 position when three of the selectees left.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency by letter dated September 22, 1993, issued a final decision dismissing the complaint on the grounds that appellant failed to contact an EEO Counselor in a timely manner, (within 45 days of the alleged incident), pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(c). The agency characterized appellant's complaint as discrimination based on race (Black) and sex (female) when she was nonselected for the position of WG-10 Electrician on December 16, 1991. The agency stated that appellant had offered that she became aware of the discrimination on June 11, 1993 based on a document from an anonymous person but appellant failed to provide evidence to support her position. The agency noted that the document in question was part of an internal management report dated and circulated on October 1, 1991. For this reason the agency dismissed the complaint for untimely EEO contact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant in her appeal explains that the agency mischaracterized her complaint, that the December 16, 1991 nonselection was only the beginning, that three of these employees had left, and that another white employee was secretly and improperly moved into one of the positions on December 15, 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the record before us, we determine that the agency has not properly defined appellant's complaint. We find that the complaint is vague in places and contains numerous alleged facts. The Commission can not distinguish between live allegations therein from background information intended to support allegations. In a similar situation, the Commission remanded the complaint back to the agency so that appellant could meet again with an EEO Counselor in order that an agreement could be reached on the issues in appellant's complaint<span class="Italic">. Smith v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05921017 (April 15, 1993). The Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> that EEO Management Directive 110, Chap. 2, III (October 22, 1992), provides that at the counseling stage, the EEO Counselor must be certain that the complainant's issues are clearly defined and that the complainant agrees on what issues are to be the subject of the inquiry and subsequent attempts at resolution. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> On remand, the EEO Counselor, after meeting with appellant, must issue a new report concerning the meeting(s) and defining the complaint. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission provided the following guidance in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> which is applicable to the present case:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In defining the complaint, the agency must be careful to distinguish live allegations from argument or factual background in support of allegations. It is important that the agency make such distinctions in defining the complaint so a focused investigation can be conducted and/or focused FAD [dismissing] issues can be issued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, if in defining the complaint the agency finds the allegations otherwise acceptable, the record in this case is unclear as to when appellant became aware of certain events, namely, when appellant became aware that five white and/or male applicants were selected, that a white person was secretly transferred and when the three vacancies in question occurred. For this reason as well, this case is remanded for supplemental investigation as to when appellant learned of these events and the circumstances surrounding them.</p>
<p class="noindent">Though it generally is not required, the Commission may order an agency to physically meet with a complainant in order to "hammer out" differences in defining claims. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01943433 (1995), the Commission reversed dismissal of a complaint where it previously ordered the agency EEO counselor to meet with the complainant in an attempt to reach mutual agreement on the complaint issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency determined that appellant's complaint was comprised, in part, of ten allegations listed by the Commission in its decision of April 15, 1993. In reliance upon the Commission's listing of the allegations, the agency referred to them in various correspondence with appellant in an unsuccessful attempt to have appellant provide dates when the incidents addressed in the allegations purportedly occurred. When appellant failed to provide the requested information, the agency dismissed the allegations for failure to prosecute. We find that the agency's actions with regard to these allegations were improper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Commission's decision of April 15, 1993, found that appellant's complaint was vague, and that it was difficult to distinguish live allegations from background information intended to support allegations. Second, the Commission noted that attempts to define the allegations raised in appellant's complaint without "hammering out the active allegations in meetings with appellant" (emphasis added) has been problematic. Most importantly, the Commission ordered the agency to arrange a meeting between appellant and the EEO Counselor for the purpose of identifying the live allegations, and for the purpose of subsequently issuing a new EEO Counselor's report regarding such meetings and the definition of the issues in appellant's complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are aware that by letter dated May 27, 1994, the Commission informed appellant that after receiving a report from the agency regarding corrective action taken pursuant to the Commission's decision of April 15, 1993, the Commission found, based upon the agency's submissions, that the agency had complied with the Commission's decision. However, subsequent to the issuance of the Commission's letter of May 27, 1994, we find that no meetings were scheduled between appellant and an EEO Counselor and no new EEO Counselor's Report was issued in an effort to identify the issues raised in appellant's complaint of April 1, 1990. Accordingly, the agency's decision in identifying appellant's complaint as consisting, in part, of the ten allegations discussed above, and its decision to dismiss these allegations for failure to cooperate is VACATED.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> was given 30 days to comply with the Commission's order.</p>
<p class="noindent">The definition of claims can be particularly difficult in cases alleging hostile environment, where the complainant must be able to identify several incidents that contribute to the alleged hostile environment. In such cases, agencies have tended to define the claims in terms of whether each incident constitutes a hostile environment. However, the very nature of such cases demands that a hostile environment be evaluated in terms of the totality of the circumstances, rather than in piecemeal fashion by focusing on single incidents<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Nauman v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01994571 (2001) (agency misdefined a complaint of harassment as four discrete incidents involving a named coworker); <span class="Italic">Snyder v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A10260 (2001) (complaint remanded to counseling to secure agreement on claims).
