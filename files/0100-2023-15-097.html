<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-97"><span class="space">9.</span> Harassment Cases</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like all other claims of discrimination, in a harassment or hostile environment case, the complainant must allege that the work environment is adversely affected based on a protected status, i.e., race, color, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, religion, age disability, or having engaged in protected activity. If the complainant cannot produce evidence that creates a triable issue of fact linking the adverse work environment to one of the protected statuses, summary judgment is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in <span class="Italic">Shears v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120070920 (2009), the complainant, who was terminated because of allegations of sexual harassment, failed to adduce evidence that his termination was linked to his gender and did not raise an issue of material fact by disputing the credibility of the alleged victims and the supervisor who terminated him:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his response to the agency's motion for a decision without a hearing, complainant denied that he engaged in the alleged acts of sexual harassment; questioned the credibility of his accusers; objected to the Postmaster's reliance on hearsay reports regarding his conduct; and, criticized the manner in which the administrative investigation was conducted. However, even taking complainant's contentions into account, we do not find that the Postmaster's response to the allegations was unreasonable in this case, in light of the fact that there were two accusers who reported very similar allegations against complainant, and the agency has a duty under EEO regulations to promptly and effectively respond to harassment allegations. Complainant further claimed that the Postmaster also tried to terminate another male employee based on sexual harassment allegations and that the Postmaster has made charges of sexual harassment in the past. However, even if the Postmaster has asserted claims of sexual harassment in the past, we do not find this to be persuasive evidence that the Postmaster harbored animus against men.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, complainant also suggested that one of his accusers' credibility is questionable because she had "no qualms" about reporting a male co-worker who wanted to "go out" with her to management, but claimed that she was afraid to report complainant's alleged behavior to management. However, there is a significant distinction between being asked on a date by a co-worker and the type of physically threatening and demeaning actions complainant was alleged to have engaged in against co-workers. We do not determine that the accuser's credibility is undermined by her claim that she was afraid to report complainant's alleged misconduct. Thus, we find that there is no genuine issue of material fact in this case because complainant failed to provide any evidence from which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the agency's articulated reasons for its actions are pretext for unlawful discrimination. Consequently, we find that the AI properly found no discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember, raising issues of witness credibility does not mean <span class="Italic">per se</span> that there is an issue of material fact.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission reversed a grant of summary judgment in <span class="Italic">Lynwood R. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120171820 (2019), where witnesses statements were missing, inconsistent statements were not resolved, and the record was not sufficiently developed as to comparators:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We must determine whether the AJ appropriately issued the decision without a hearing. The Commission's regulations allow an AJ to issue a decision without a hearing upon finding that there is no genuine issue of material fact. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). EEOC's decision without a hearing regulation follows the summary judgment procedure from federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The U.S. Supreme Court held summary judgment is appropriate where a judge determines no genuine issue of material fact exists under the legal and evidentiary standards. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc</span>., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). In ruling on a summary judgment motion, the judge is to determine whether there are genuine issues for trial, as opposed to weighing the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 249. At the summary judgment stage, the judge must believe the non-moving party's evidence and must draw justifiable inferences in the non-moving party's favor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255. A "genuine issue of fact" is one that a reasonable judge could find in favor for the non-moving party. <span class="Italic">Celotex v. Catrett</span>, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp</span>., 846 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1988). A "material" fact has the potential to affect the outcome of a case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An AJ may issue a decision without a hearing only after determining that the record has been adequately developed. <span class="Italic">See Petty v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A24206 (July 11, 2003). Issuing a decision without holding a hearing is not appropriate for a case that can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence. If the non-moving party "has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition," then a decision without a hearing is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 477 U.S. at 250. The AJ must enable the non-moving party to engage in sufficient discovery to respond to a motion for a decision without a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After receiving an opposition to a motion for a decision without a hearing, an AJ may order discovery as necessary. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We carefully reviewed the record and find that it is inadequately developed. Further, the AJ improperly determined that there are no genuine issues of material fact or credibility that merited a hearing. Therefore, the AJ's issuance of a decision without a hearing was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that a decision without a hearing was inappropriate in this case because the record is not fully developed, and there are genuine issues of material fact. The record is not complete because it does not contain statements from AS, or any of the named coworkers (CW1-CW6). For incident 10, Complainant also named another witness, who was not interviewed. Additionally, the record does not contain a response from WS for incidents 10-13. Complainant stated that WS was a witness for incident 10; and that he notified WS of his need for leave on December 31, 2014 (claim 12). Accordingly, we find that the complaint needs to be remanded to obtain additional relevant testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A genuine issue of material fact exists because evidence in the record contradicts CL's statement. For claim 8, CL stated that "none of the other drivers are issued a government cell phone or GPS." However, one witness (W1) stated that "previous drivers had phones as part of their jobs." Another witness (W2) stated that he previously worked as a driver, and that "all other drivers and myself were mandatorily given phones." A third witness (W3) stated that "ALL Distribution drivers are definitely provided phones to maintain communications and in the event of road emergencies."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts have been clear that summary judgment is not to be used as a "trial by affidavit." <span class="Italic">Redmand v. Warrener</span>, 516 F.2d 766, 768 (1st Cir. 1975). The Commission has noted that when a party submits an affidavit and credibility is at issue, "there is a need for strident cross-examination and summary judgment on such evidence is improper." <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940339 (February 24, 1995). We find that a hearing is necessary to make a credibility determination with regards to CL's testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we note that the AJ found that Complainant's lack of cell phone and GPS was not an adverse employment action, we find that Complainant has shown an injury or harm to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Diaz v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (April 21, 1994). The Agency provided cell phones and/or GPS as a privilege of employment for their drivers,3 and CL denied a cell phone to Complainant. As such, Complainant has a viable discrimination claim that he was treated differently than other drivers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find that there is a genuine issue of material fact with regards to identifying similarly-situated comparators for claim 6. The AJ stated that there was a lack of evidence regarding CW4 and CW6. We find that the record needs to be further developed to determine if CW4 and CW6 are outside of Complainant's protected class. While the AJ noted that Complainant did not identify any female comparators, the record shows that CW3 used profanity and the n-word during the June 4, 2014 meeting. Complainant was suspended for use of profanity and disrespectful conduct towards another employee, and it can be argued that CW3's conduct was similar to Complainant's. More information is needed to determine if CW3 is an appropriate comparator with regards to Complainant's suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that additional information is needed to determine if there was a hostile work environment based on Complainant' sex or in retaliation for his prior EEO activity. Witnesses provided statements to suggest that this needs to be further explored. S1 stated that he believed that there is a hostile work environment. W1 stated that she believed that the environment was "very hostile" for Complainant, and that she witnessed hostility directed at him by coworkers. She added that <span id="Page_485"></span>she believed that incidents 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9 were due to Complainant's sex, and in reprisal for his EEO activity. W2 repeatedly noted that it was "obvious" that management was retaliating against Complainant for his prior EEO activity. W3 stated that she learned of the animus towards Complainant from coworkers' comments that include calling Complainant "questionable." Accordingly, we find that a decision without a hearing was not appropriate for this complaint and will remand the matter back for a hearing in accordance with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, conflicting statements in <span class="Italic">Chad T. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020000836 (2021), led the Commission to reverse summary judgment that was granted in favor of the agency. In that case, the complainant alleged that a noose hung in his work area for three days. In defense, the agency moved for summary judgment alleging:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It did not dispute that Complainant believed that the ropes or cords in question were hangman's nooses, or even that a single incident involving the intentional placement of a hangman's noose may be severe enough on its own to constitute a hostile work environment. However, the Agency asserted that cases addressing noose allegations specifically have examined whether the object in question could reasonably be viewed as a hangman's noose based on the results of the employer's investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency stated that here, MM, a Maintenance Operation Support Manager (MOSM), and a Supervisor Maintenance Operations (SMO1), all three of whom are African-American, testified that the rope reported by Complainant was used by maintenance employees for pulling/hoisting/hauling equipment and was not a hangman's noose; and a Manager Distribution Operations (MDO), also African-American, testified that one of the alleged hangman's nooses was about two feet long and "the weight of a shoe string."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency stated that MMO testified that "ropes with slip knots are used throughout the building and have been for 18 years. Ropes are used to hoist tools, equipment and parts to different levels."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency noted that the record contained an undated photo of the noose, and that it did not dispute that the rope in the picture was tied as a noose, which is merely "a loop with a running knot that binds closer the more it is drawn." However, the Agency argued that witnesses do not refute management's explanation that the rope was used for a legitimate maintenance purpose, and that there was simply no evidence in the record to support the claim that the rope in question either looked, or was intended to convey, the image of a hangman's noose. The Agency also argued that there was no evidence to support that the alleged hangman's nooses were hung in retaliation for Complainant's prior protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The AJ granted summary judgment, adopting the agency's statements of fact and legal analysis, but the Commission reversed finding issues of material fact that could not be resolved without a hearing in <span class="Italic">Chad T</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the AJ did not view the evidence in the light most favorable to Complainant, and that the record contains conflicting information that raises genuine disputes of material facts, a need for further development of the record, and a need for credibility determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that there is a genuine dispute about the description of the ropes alleged to be nooses and their use. The record contains conflicting statements regarding the ropes. For example, MDO stated that in 2011, Complainant showed him what appeared to be a noose, but that it was a string about two feet long. SMO1 stated that in 2011, Complainant pointed out something he called a noose, but that it did not appear to be a noose. ROI at 243, 277. However, a Mail Handler (MH) stated that at some time between September and November 2011, he saw a rope that was "about 6 feet long and appeared to [him] to be a noose." ROI at 288. In addition, while management officials stated that the ropes were used for tying tarps or lifting equipment, another Supervisor Maintenance Operations (SMO2) stated that he saw the noose twice, and whether it was "used for rigging or intimidation I cannot say." ROI at 264.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the record contains photos of a rope with a loop tied at the bottom end, and that the Agency did not dispute that the rope in the picture was tied as a noose. Based on the other items in the photos, it appears that the rope is not a string and is longer than two feet, and that it is hung far from the ground. ROI at 322-24. However, the record does not reveal who provided the photos, or when the photos were taken. MMO stated that he took pictures of the rope on October 25, 2012, and MOSM stated that she took photos on September 9, 2011, yet it is unclear if the provided photos came from MMO, MOSM, or another individual. ROI at 152, 210. The record contains no evidence regarding who was responsible for the alleged nooses, and we find that additional information is needed to determine the nature of the alleged nooses and the reasons they were hung in Complainant's work area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the record contains conflicting information about whether an investigation was conducted into Complainant's reports about finding nooses in his workspace. MM stated that MOSM and SMO1 investigated the issue and found that the rope was not a noose. ROI at 183. However, neither corroborated that they investigated Complainant's complaint and MOSM stated that she forwarded pictures to MM for further investigation. ROI at 210. In addition, a Manager Network Distribution Center stated that an investigation was not conducted, and SMO2 stated that when he notified MMO of the noose, MMO "did not want to deal with the employee's concerns and told [SMO2] to cut it down." ROI at 231, 268. Complainant stated that there was a threat assessment. However, there is no additional information regarding any threat assessment. ROI at 97. As such, we find that additional information is necessary to determine the Agency's actions in response to Complainant's reports of the nooses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that there is a need for credibility determinations for MM and MMO. The courts have been clear that summary judgment is not to be used as a "trial by affidavit." <span class="Italic">Redmand v. Warrener</span>, 516 F.2d 766, 768 (1st Cir. 1975). The Commission has noted that when a party submits an affidavit and credibility is at issue, "there is a need for strident cross-examination and summary judgment on such evidence is improper." <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940339 (Feb. 24, 1995). MM stated that he was only aware of the noose reported on October 25, 2012, and that he was not aware of other dates, but evidence shows that he was informed that Complainant reported a noose on September 15, 2011. ROI at 192, 194. MMO stated that Complainant was the "only person who associates work ropes with slip knots with a hangman's noose." ROI at 163. However, as noted above, MH stated that he also saw a rope that "appeared to [him] to be a noose." ROI at 288. Further, SMO1 stated that MMO and MM handled things in a "tough way" and that their "tough actions" gave him "the impression that racism was involved," and SMO2 stated that MMO and MM were "Hostile!!" toward Complainant. ROI at 278, 266.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the hearing process is intended to be an extension of the investigative process, designed to ensure that the parties have "a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain and supplement the record and, in appropriate instances, to examine and cross-examine witnesses." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO MD-110 at 7-1; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e). "Truncation of this process, while material facts are still in dispute and the credibility of witnesses is still ripe for challenge, improperly deprives Complainant of a full and fair investigation of her claims." <span class="Italic">Bang v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01961575 (Mar. 26, 1998). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Peavley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950628 (Oct. 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Chronister v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05940578 (Apr. 25, 1995). In summary, there are simply too many unresolved issues which require an assessment as to the credibility of the management officials and there is a need for further development of the record regarding the alleged nooses and the Agency's actions in response to Complainant's reports of the nooses. Therefore, judgment as a matter of law for the Agency should not have been granted as to Complainant's allegation of a hostile work environment when he reported nooses in his work area and management officials failed to take sufficient action. Accordingly, we VACATE the Agency's final order adopting the AJ's decision without a hearing and REMAND the matter for a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Citing to "unresolved issues" which required assessment of the complainant, supervisor and coworker's credibility, the Commission reversed summary judgment in favor of the agency in <span class="Italic">Felton Z. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019002311 (2021). In that case, the complainant alleged harassment based on sex (LGBT male) when "his coworkers mistreated and ignored him and made comments to influence" his supervisor. The Commission noted that genuine issues still existed related to whether certain comments made by complainant's coworkers substantiated his claims of harassment in <span class="Italic">Felton Z</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the AJ, Complainant's response to the Agency's motion for summary judgment included testimony from CW3 that the CT Lead referred to Complainant as a "gay fucker," CW1 referred to Complainant as a "gay bastard," and more than once CW1 referred to Complainant as a "fag."4 Complainant asserted that these coworkers had discriminatory motive in their complaints to S1 and that CW1 informed him that "some" coworkers were uncomfortable with Complainant changing in the men's locker room. The testimony raises a genuine issue of material fact about whether discriminatory motive existed in relation to claim 1. The AJ stated that Complainant presented no evidence that he overheard any of the comments, that they were directed at him, or that S1 made such comments. But there are genuine issues as to whether the comments contributed to a hostile work environment by poisoning the atmosphere with disrespect toward Complainant. Complainant provided testimony that "[S1] did nothing to intercede or otherwise attempt to make the CT environment more collegial and to make the CT environment more accepting of [Complainant]." Moreover, to the extent that the comments did get back to Complainant, as he asserts, they would contribute to an overall atmosphere of harassment aimed at Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for claim 1, Complainant alleged that prior to January 2016, he and another coworker changed their clothes in a storage area adjacent to the worksite for several years. Complainant further alleged that management officials subsequently informed employees that they must change clothes in their respective gender-designated locker rooms, but that S1 <span id="Page_486"></span>told him that he would be allowed to change clothes in a place other than the men's locker room where he would be comfortable. S1 averred that he received a complaint from CT staff that Complainant was changing in the CT suite and that his intent in offering Complainant an alternative location was to stop Complainant from changing in the CT suite. Report of Investigation (ROI) at 82. Upon review of the record, we find that the record is devoid of evidence regarding the timing of S1's conversation with Complainant and S1's knowledge of Complainant changing in the CT suite prior to the complaint from his coworkers. The record does not indicate whether other employees were offered alternative changing areas or whether other employees were given the same instruction to stop changing in the CT work area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 indicated that he discussed the issue of Complainant changing with other management officials and the Agency EEO office. This testimony raises concerns of whether discriminatory motive existed in relation to claim 1 when considering the comments made by Complainant's coworkers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant never expressed discomfort in changing in the men's room or requested any accommodation following the Agency directive that employees should change in their gender-designated locker rooms, it is unclear why S1 escalated the matter to the EEO office if Complainant was simply in violation of the Agency's policy that employees must change in the locker rooms. The record is unclear on the catalyst for S1's actions with respect to claim 1 and requires further development. Moreover, we find that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the complaints regarding Complainant's changing area were due to the location or to Complainant's sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to claim 5, the AJ credited S1's assertion that Complainant was rated "not meeting" in Customer Service because he was discourteous to coworkers, did not promote teamwork, and that S1 had concerns about Complainant's anger toward his coworkers. The AJ stated that Complainant's "hostility is evident by his lack of communication regarding work related issues" and went on to address an admonishment that took place outside of the rating period. The AJ determined that Complainant failed to show that he was courteous to his coworkers while Complainant proffered that he often covered shifts for others. ROI at 71. The investigator failed to question S1 on whether he had discussions with Complainant regarding the alleged deficient conduct prior to the issuance of the rating or obtain witness affidavits regarding Complainant's relationships in the workplace. Further, while the investigator questioned S1 on whether he felt the rating was fair, the investigator failed to ask S1 the specific reasons for the rating, examples of the alleged deficiencies, or why the rating differed from Complainant's prior evaluations in the deficient area. Complainant maintained that his coworkers were treated more favorably, and the record does not indicate whether Complainant's coworkers were similarly downgraded for using derogatory terms in reference to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It appears that, in granting the Agency's motion for summary judgment, the AJ either erred in failing to consider Complainant's account of the facts, instead solely relying on the Agency's account, or failed to consider the events as a whole regarding Complainant's claim of harassment. The AJ determined that Complainant was angry at his coworkers but dismissed Complainant's history of interactions with his coworkers and his allegation that the work environment created by his coworkers, and allegedly enabled by S1, resulted in ostracism and an intolerable work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the AJ failed to discuss Complainant's reprisal claim, which we find troubling in light of comments made by the Chief of Diagnostic Imaging during the investigation of the instant matter in April 2017. Specifically, the Chief of Diagnostic Imaging stated that he "[was] trying very hard to forgive [Complainant] for making what [Complainant] knows full well is a false allegation..." ROI at 94. We find these comments, and the investigator's failure to question the Chief of Diagnostic Imaging regarding reprisal, particularly troubling considering Complainant's reprisal claim, as the Chief of Diagnostic Imaging was the deciding official in Complainant's proposed reprimand in March 2017. Comments such as these have the potential to deter employees from engaging in EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">We note that the hearing process is intended to be an extension of the investigative process, designed to ensure that the parties have "a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain and supplement the record and, in appropriate instances, to examine and cross-examine witnesses." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO MD-110, Chap. 7 at I.; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e). "Truncation of this process," while material facts are still in dispute and the credibility of witnesses is still ripe for challenge, improperly deprives Complainant of a full and fair investigation of her claims. <span class="Italic">Bang v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01961575 (Mar. 26. 1998). <span class="Italic">See also Peavley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950628 (Oct. 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Chronister v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05940578 (Apr. 25, 1995). In summary, there are simply too many unresolved issues which require an assessment as to the credibility of S1, Complainant's coworkers, and Complainant, himself. Therefore, judgment as a matter of law for the Agency should not have been granted.</p>
