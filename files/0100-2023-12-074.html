<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-73"><span class="space">e.</span> Day to Day Activities; Performance; and Supervision</h5>
<p class="noindent">A critical factor in whether a federal agency will be considered a "joint employer" of a contract employee is who controls the day-to-day supervision of the employee. In <span class="Italic">Mooney v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a45921.txt">01A45921</a> (2005), the Commission found that the agency was in "joint employer" status, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth herein, we find that the agency exercised sufficient control over the Systems Technician to qualify as a joint employer with Northrop Grumman. In so finding, we note that the agency retained supervisory control over complainant's position. We also take in consideration complainant's length of time in his position, and the skills required in his position. Specifically, the record reveals that complainant began working at the Del Rio Border Patrol in June 1996, as a System Technician. In the almost eight years that complainant has worked, five different contracting companies have held the Legacy/INS contract for this position, and complainant always retained his position. Complainant's duties include, but are not limited to, maintenance of the Del Rio Sector Novell computer network. This includes file servers, computers' installation, maintaining desktop, configuring workstation, desktop maintenance and supporting end-user.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also shows that S1 has been the Automated Data Processing (ADP) Department supervisor since 1999. S1 directed all the ADP operations for both government employees and contractors. The record further shows that S1 assigned complainant all work assignments via e-mail or verbal instructions. Complainant's testimony reveals that S1 initiated a policy whereby any and all computer-related support calls were to be directed exclusively to his office. Complainant alleged that S1 instructed all ADP government and contract employees that he "personally, would determine who handled what work assignment, in what order, and in what time frame." For example, complainant alleged that on many occasions S1, either via--mail or verbally, instructed him what computer to install, where to install it, and when to install it. Complainant further alleged that he never contacted his contracting company regional manager for clarification on work assignments. If he had questions regarding the work assignment, he would immediately contact S1 for further guidance. Furthermore, the record reveals that all work performed by Systems Technician was performed on agency premises using agency equipment and supplies. The record also reveals that S1 submitted his comments and recommendations for complainant's performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the fact that Northrop Grumman provided wages, benefits and leave for the Systems Technician, the record before us demonstrates that the agency retained sufficient control over the Systems Technician position to qualify as a joint employer....</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Maynard v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A20699 (2002), the Commission found the circumstances warranted a finding that the agency and the contractor were joint employers of the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth above, we find that the agency jointly employed complainant, along with Flex-Tech, based on the means and manner of control the agency's Manager maintained over the conditions of complainant's day-to-day work at the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the record, complainant's work was specified, negotiated for a set period, and to be performed at a specified location. The record shows that complainant was closely supervised by an agency Supervisory Environmental Engineer/Customer Representative. In fact, the record discloses that the Supervisory Environmental Engineer/Customer Representative, not Flex-Tech, recruited, interviewed and selected complainant for her position. It is equally clear that Flex-Tech had little, if any, input into complainant's day-to-day assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, notwithstanding the fact that the Flex-Tech employment contract shows that it employed complainant part time, providing wages, benefits, and leave, the record before us nonetheless demonstrates that the agency, via the Supervisory Environmental Engineer/Customer Representative, controlled essentially all aspects of complainant's day-to-day work. The Supervisory Environmental Engineer/Customer Representative assigned complainant to an office near her own, and provided complainant with all of her assignments. Complainant did not work independently, and she received supervision from no one other than the Supervisory Environmental Engineer/Customer Representative. Given the nature of this relationship, and the cooperative process used by the agency and Flex-Tech regarding personnel actions, we find that the agency exerted the degree of control necessary to qualify it as a joint employer with Flex-Tech, such that complainant may be deemed an "employee" of the agency for the purpose of invoking Title VII protection.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A22997 (2003), the Commission found insufficient agency control over the contract employee where the contractor still retained ultimate supervisory and disciplinary control. This was true, according to the Commission, even though an agency official discussed job performance with contractor employees, oversaw their shifts and received direct reports from them.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a federal agency exercises control over virtually every aspect of a contractor's work, this is sufficient control under Title VII to establish the agency as an employer. In <span class="Italic">Fields v. General Services Administration</span>, 01A51814 (2006), the Commission found that GSA exercised sufficient control to be considered an employer of the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth herein, we find that the agency exercised sufficient control over the complainant's secretarial position to qualify as a joint employer of the complainant. <span class="Italic">See generally, Baker v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A45313 (March 16, 2006). First, prior to her removal in May 2002, the complainant did clerical and secretarial work exclusively at the agency's Charleston office since 1993, a long continuous relationship. She was initially hired by the agency as a federal employee. With regard to her most recent contract, the record shows that the complainant continued to work at the Charleston office at the behest of the agency. Property manager 2 stated that she secured and approved a raise for the complainant, and agency argument suggests this was with Lionel. Further, the record shows that the agency retained full supervisory control over the complainant. While property manager 2 stated that Lionel controlled or oversaw the manner of the complainant's performance, the record shows that Lionel did not even have a corporate office in Charleston, and the complainant's supervisor at Lionel never met the complainant. Property manager 2 assigned the complainant all her work, and direction. Further, in response to her contention that there was poor filing and the complainant attempted to shift blame, property manager 2 gave the complainant a letter of warning with a copy to Lionel. The complainant's work was reviewed and supervised by <span id="Page_187"></span>the agency. The agency supplied the office and equipment for her work, and the complainant worked in part on contracting and procurement, a core function of the Charleston office. Further, the complainant had set reporting hours of 8:00 to 4:30 Monday through Friday. The complainant stated that when she needed leave, she got permission from property manager 2, and this is corroborated in the record by a copy of a leave slip signed by property manager 2. The agency terminated the complainant's services by telling Lionel it was dissatisfied with the complainant. When asked about who decided to end the complainant's job at the Charleston office, the President of Lionel responded that there was no decision, rather, the customer--property manager 2 of the agency--asked that the complainant be removed, and Lionel did so. At that time, the complainant was also separated from Lionel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the contract between Lionel and the agency states there is no direct employee/employer relationship between contractor employees and the federal government, and the contractor shall provide project management direction of the administrative staff, we find this language is not controlling given the nature of the working relationship between the agency and the complainant. The nature of the relationship was such that the agency retained full authority over the complainant and her work. Notwithstanding the fact that Lionel paid wages, benefits and leave for the complainant, the record before us nonetheless demonstrates that the agency retained sufficient control over the complainant to qualify as a joint employer.</p>

Attorney General</span>, 0120110412 (2013) (agency controlled virtually every aspect of performance including right to terminate and complainant performed normal agency business--security during handling and transportation of detainees).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Brazeal v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073338 (2008), where the contractor hired the complainant and set her hours, but the agency provided her work equipment, she worked in an agency facility monitoring networks that performing core agency functions fighting wars and maintaining defense readiness and was supervised by agency personnel. She received all of her work assignments from agency personnel and all of her work products were reviewed and approved by agency personnel. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lucas-White v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120100131 (2011) (Air Force Academy volleyball coach was employee where agency controlled virtually all aspects of employment, paid taxes, provided a car and insurance, and complainant had to obtain permission for outside employment); <span class="Italic">Bashrawl v. Secretary of State</span>, 0210101859 (2010) (complainant worked directly under agency supervisor, who provided complainant with all her work and controlled time and place of work); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120052842 (2007) (agency controlled complainant's day-to-day activities, complainant was hired on agency's recommendation, and complainant's contract was subject to termination at agency's request); <span class="Italic">Benbow v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120071890 (2007) (even though contractor paid wages, benefits and leave for complainant, agency exercised day-to-day control and made recommendation that her position with agency be terminated); <span class="Italic">Chamberlain v.

Secretary of Army</span>, 01A53152 (2006) (fee based medical practitioner working under subcontractor agreement was agency employee where she was required to abide by agency practices and policies, agency provided workspace and materials, dictated work hours and was under direct supervision of agency employee).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Shorter v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120131148 (2013), the Commission found that the complainant, who was an assistant program analyst working for a contractor should be considered an agency employee for Title VII purposes where the agency controlled many of the work assignments, the work was performed on agency premises using agency equipment, she had served fulltime at the agency for approximately two years and the agency had substantial input into the contractor's decision to terminate her employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where agency personnel provided on-the-job training and feedback for a contract instructor, as well as dictating the means of instructions, this was sufficient control to make the complainant an agency employee for Title VII purposes. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120122912 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors 1, 3 6, 9, 11 Indicate That Complainant is Jointly Employed by the Agency</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant started serving the Agency in May 2011, and did so until being terminated in December 2011. According to the EEO counselor's report, an Agency Manager stated Agency Information Technology (IT) staff assisted Complainant in developing his proficiency. Complainant's writings indicate this included regular on-the-job training with feedback. He stated that Agency personnel gave him the format to follow when lecturing, decided if he was the instructional lead for a class, told him not to use a diagram he created as an instructional tool, instructed him not to use notes he prepared for a lecture, insisted that he stand throughout the class period, and did not permit him to lecture. While the Lockheed Site Manager signed at least two Instructor Feedback forms rating Complainant's instruction, and was the signatory of a Performance Improvement Plan for Complainant, the bottom of an Instructor Improvement Plan Report for Complainant indicates Agency staff participated in providing the feedback therefore. (Factors 1, 5 and 6). Complainant trained and gave instruction on Agency premises (factor 4). There is no indication in the record that Complainant was in his own business or hired and paid assistants, and the record suggests otherwise (factors 9, 11).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors 2, 8, 10, 12-13 Indicate That Complainant is not Jointly Employed by the Agency</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's instruction, highly technical in nature, required a high level of skill or expertise (factor 2). In the FAD the Agency found that Lockheed Martin paid Complainant's compensation (factors 8, 12, and 13). As Complainant does not dispute this, we will presume the finding is accurate. While training employees is critical to the accomplishment of the Agency's mission, training is not the Agency's mission (factor 10).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors 3, 7, 14 and 15 Are Inconclusive</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not reflect who furnishes the tools, materials and equipment for instruction (factor 3), who sets Complainant's work hours (factor 7), whether Lockheed Martin terminated Complainant as a result of the Agency indicating it no longer wanted his services (which would mean the Agency had <span class="Italic">de facto</span> firing authority) (factor 14), or whether both the Agency and Complainant believed they were creating an employer-employee relationship (factor 15).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth herein, we find that the Agency exercised sufficient control over Complainant's position to qualify as his joint employer for the purpose of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although no single factor is outcome determinative, in recent years the Commission has increasingly focused on Factor 10--"[t]he work performed by the worker is part of the regular business of the employer." For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120141059 (2014), the Commission found a joint employment relationship noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Agency allegedly perceived that Complainant variously gave improper patient care, did not engage in proper training of a medical student, treated staff poorly, and engaged in misconduct, it placed Complainant on an Action Plan in April 2010, removed her supervision of medical students and other residents in February 2013, and in March 2013, no longer permitted her to be on call while assigned to the Agency (factors 1, 3, 4, 6). Complainant served the Agency since 2010, a continuing relationship (factor 5). She performed work which was part of the Agency's mission--medical care (factor 10). There is no evidence that Complainant hired or paid assistants, and the record shows she was not in business for herself (factors 9, 11). Based on a preponderance of the evidence, we find that the Agency had <span class="Italic">de facto</span> removal authority. It removed significant functions from Complainant's medical resiliency--being on call and supervising medical students and other residents. It also did not recommend that Complainant's. contract be renewed for the fourth and final year, which more likely than not had a role in Carilion Clinic's decision to terminate Complainant (factor 14).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors 2, 8, 12 and 13 Indicate that Complainant May not be an Employee of the Agency</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's work requires a high level of skill or expertise (factor 2). Carilion Clinic took care of Complainant's compensation and benefits (factors 8, 12, 13).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not reflect who set Complainant's hours nor whether the Agency believed it was creating an employer-employee relationship. Accordingly, factors 7 and 15 do not point in any direction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth herein, we find that the Agency exercised sufficient control over Complainant's position to qualify as her employer for the purpose of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process. We find, however, that this only applies actions which arose or occurred from Complainant being on rotation with the Agency, on call with the Agency, and/or working with Agency patients, and include her initial interview and removal.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120071769 (2007), where the complainant, a skilled electrician, worked at the agency's premises without much direct supervision. However, to the extent supervision was given, it was under the direction of an agency maintenance manager. Moreover, the agency provided tools, materials and equipment. The main function of the contractor was to receive time cards, which the agency approved, and pay the complainant. The Commission found that the complainant was an employee of the agency for Title VII purposes. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120141104 (2014) (agency controlled virtually all aspects of nursing assistant's duties); <span class="Italic">Ames v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120073926 (2008) (contract dentist deemed employee where agency provided all equipment, scheduled appointments, set hours, and approved leave); <span class="Italic">Alark v. Broadcasting Board of Governors</span>, 0120072047 (2007) (skilled videotape editor was deemed agency <span id="Page_188"></span>employee where agency controlled hours, location, provided equipment and had right to discharge complainant).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kereem v. Secretary of State</span>, 052011069 (2012), the Commission gave a good account of how it weighs the various factors in the <span class="Italic">Ma</span> analysis in a case involving an Arabic Language Instructor/Curriculum Developer at the Foreign Service Institute. The case provides an example of how no one factor is controlling in the analysis. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Kereem</span> found that the complainant, whose services were retained under a blanket purchase agreement, was an employee for Title VII purposes explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors (1), (2), (4)-(7), and (9) Indicate Complainant Is an Employee</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding factors (1) and (2), we find that the Agency had the right to control the means and manner of Complainant's work performance and that Complainant's work usually was done under the direction of a supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, the Agency had the authority to monitor and change different aspects of Complainant's day-to-day work. In a declaration submitted to the EEO Counselor, Complainant alleged that S1 attended her classes to observe her performance on an "almost daily" basis, changed her schedule, moved her office, obtained computer equipment for her, and assigned her as his testing partner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency had the authority to formally evaluate Complainant's work. A 2008-2009 evaluation reflects that S1 and two other Agency employees rated Complainant on her performance and recommended whether or not the Agency should use her services again.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency had the authority to give Complainant additional projects and training opportunities. The EEO Counselor's report noted that the Chair of the FSI Language Department (Chair) stated that "teachers are evaluated based on what they are assigned to do...The immersions and testings are given out as regular assignments...It is seen not as a privilege, just work assigned by management." The report also noted that the Chair agreed to put Complainant on an immersion and to sign her up for training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency had the authority to control Complainant's work hours and work tasks. As to work hours, BPA Section C.6 (Schedule) states that classes are held Monday through Friday between 7:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> and 7:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, and that all contractors "need to coordinate their schedules closely" with the Government Technical Monitor (GTM).2 As to work tasks, BPA Section C.4 (Requirements) specifies that contractors will be required to do any number of the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Work on training and/or testing matters "under the direct guidance" of the GTM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Adapt teaching techniques and approaches to the students' individual learning styles and needs "[i]n consultation with" the GTM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Provide feedback and analysis of the students' progress and problems to the GTM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Make maximum use of the technological facilities and incorporate the use of instructional technology into the instructional program "in consultation with" the GTM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Participate in the Learning Consultation Service "in whatever fashion deemed appropriate by" the GTM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Participate in conferences related to foreign language teaching, workshops, and other types of sessions "as determined by the school management"</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Collaborate on, perform assigned tasks or execute single-handedly, in the development of language training materials, Language-School-relevant reference materials, and Language-School-relevant research and development projects "[i]n close consultation with" the GTM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Record audio or video materials "as assigned"</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Participate in in-service staff development and orientation activities sponsored by the FSI "in whatever fashion deemed appropriate by" the GTM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Follow techniques, methodologies, and approaches used by the office/section "as required by" the GTM</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--"May be asked" to become a certified Tester by the FSI Language Testing Office</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--"May be requested" to conduct end of training tests at one of the FSI's field schools overseas</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding factor (4), we find that the Agency furnished the equipment used and the place of work. As to the equipment used, BPA Section C.9 (Government Property) states that the Agency "will provide all necessary materials and supplies to perform the duties" and will "provide multimedia equipment and technology-based materials." In addition, the section states that "[a]ll materials developed and/or used by the contractor remain the property of the Agency. As to the place of work, BPA Section C.12 (Place of Delivery) states that services "will be performed primarily, but not exclusively" at the Agency's facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding factors (5) and (6), we find that Complainant had worked at the Agency for over 17 months and was paid by the Agency by time, i.e., by the hour. As to the length of the working relationship, the record reflects that Complainant began working at the Agency in August 2008 and filed her EEO complaint in January 2010. As to the method of payment, BPA Section C.13 (Payment/Invoicing) states that contractors "will submit invoices bi-weekly for hours worked." The continuing relationship between Complainant and the Agency, and the fact that Complainant was paid by the hour (rather than for the agreed cost of performing a particular job), both indicate that Complainant is an Agency employee. Commission guidance holds that factors indicating that a worker is an employee include: (a) the existence of a continuing relationship between the worker and the agency; and (b) the worker is paid by the hour, week, or month rather than for the agreed cost of performing a particular job. See EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Application of EEO Laws to Contingent Workers Placed by Temporary Employment Agencies and Other Staffing Firms</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, Question 1 (Dec. 3, 1997) (Guidance).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding factor (7), we find that the Agency had the authority to unilaterally terminate its work relationship with Complainant without notice and explanation. Specifically, BPA Section C.17 (Termination of Task Orders) states that the Agency can terminate a contractor "without discussion and without...giving a reason." In addition, the section specifies that possible reasons for termination include failing to follow directions/guidance from the GTM, complete designated tasks, work collegially with colleagues, and behave professionally. Commission guidance holds that a factor indicating that a worker is an employee is the agency's ability to discharge the worker. See Guidance, Question 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding factor (9), we find that Complainant's work as a Language Instructor/Curriculum Developer at the FSI was an integral part of the Agency's business. In so finding, we note that BPA Section C.1 (Background) states that FSI "is responsible for the diverse and complex mission of language training for employees of the [Agency] and other U.S. Government agencies." Such language training of Agency employees would reasonably be a vital part of the Agency's mission of foreign diplomacy and international relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Factors (3), (8), and (10)-(12) Indicate That Complainant Is Not an Employee</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding factor (3), we find that Complainant's position requires a high level of skill. Specifically, BPA Section C.3 (Qualifications) requires Complainant to be an educated native speaker of the language and Section B.3 (Supplies or Services, and Prices/Costs) reflects that the Agency paid her $30-35 an hour for her expertise. Commission guidance holds that a factor indicating that a worker is an employee is that the work does not require a high level of skill or expertise. See Guidance, Question 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding factors (8), (10), and (11), we find that the Agency does not afford annual leave, provide retirement benefits, or pay social security taxes. Specifically, BPA Section C.16 (Self-Employed Contractors) specifies that the Agency provides no benefits and that Complainant is responsible for managing her own social security payments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding factor (12), we find that the Agency and Complainant did not believe that they were creating an employer-employee relationship. In so finding, we note that BPA Section C.16 (Self-Employed Contractors) expressly states that Complainant is a contractor and not an Agency employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Weighing of the Factors</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">After examining all the incidents of the working relationship between the parties as specified in <span class="Italic">Ma</span>, we find that the Agency exercised sufficient control over Complainant's position to establish a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> employer-employee relationship between the Agency and Complainant. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the nature of the working relationship was such that the Agency retained a considerable degree of control over Complainant's job performance. As shown above, during their 17-month working relationship, the Agency controlled the means and manner of Complainant's performance, supervised her work, furnished the equipment used and the place of work, and could terminate her without notice and explanation. In addition, the Agency paid Complainant by the hour to provide language training--an integral part of the Agency's foreign diplomacy mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge the fact that the BPA language identified Complainant as a contractor and the fact that the Agency did not provide her with leave, retirement benefits, or social security taxes. Notwithstanding those facts, the record before us nonetheless demonstrates that the Agency retained sufficient control over Complainant to qualify as an employer. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A45313 (Mar. 16, 2006) (finding, despite contractual language identifying the complainant as a contractor and the agency's failure to provide wages, benefits, and leave, that the agency exercised sufficient control over the position because it retained approval over the selection process and supervisory authority over the position); <span class="Italic">Lonergan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970406 (July 10, 2000) (finding that the agency exercised sufficient <span id="Page_189"></span>control over the position because the complainant worked designated hours at an agency facility for 14 months, the complainant's work fell within the parameters of the agency's regular business, and the agency assigned the complainant work and controlled the manner of the work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the legal standards and criteria set forth herein, we find, under the facts of this case, that because the Agency exercised sufficient control over Complainant's position, the Agency serves as her <span class="Italic">de facto</span> employer for the purposes of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Caarranza v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120092727 (2010), had little difficulty determining that the complainant, who was a contractor's employee, was also an agency employee for purposes of filing an age discrimination complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find the agency exercised sufficient control over the complainant's position for a joint employment situation to exist, allowing complainant to file an EEO complaint against the agency within the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process. It is undisputed that Honeywell acted as a staffing firm in this case, placing complainant into the Executive Assistant position at issue. However, the record indicates that the agency, through LTC, controlled the means and manner of complainant's work as she served under his general supervision as his Executive Assistant. The record further reflects that the agency provided complainant with her worksite, materials, equipment and supplies. Most significantly, complainant has asserted that LTC, an agency manager, was the party directly responsible for her removal from her Executive Assistant position. Complainant alleges that LTC provided Honeywell with critiques of her work performance and specifically requested that she be removed from her position with him. In its brief submitted on appeal the agency does not dispute LTC's role in complainant's removal, although arguing that Honeywell ultimately retained the relevant personnel authority over her. We find this argument unpersuasive, however, because all the incidents complainant alleges were discriminatory were the result of the actions of LTC, an agency manager, rather than managers at Honeywell.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Gray v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120091375 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">The mere screening and certification by an agency of outside contractors for eligibility for provision of services does not amount to sufficient control of the relationship to make such contractors employees where the agency does not control the "means and manner" of the employee's performance. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05930076 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, the Commission found that a child care services provider was not an employee within the meaning of Title VII:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well settled that whether an individual is an "employee" for the purposes of calling forth the protections promised by Title VII requires an analysis of the economic realities of the work relationship. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spirides v. Reinhardt</span>, 613 F.2d 826 (D.C. Cir. 1979); <span class="Italic">Abidin v. U.S. Information Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890123 (March 1, 1989). As the previous decision concluded, appellant and the agency were not in an employer-employee relationship. According to <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> and <span class="Italic">Abidin</span>, the most important factor to consider in this context is the extent of the alleged employer's right to control the "means and manner" of the worker's performance. 613 F.2d at 831-32; EEOC Request No. 05890123, at 3. In the case before us, the agency involved merely screens and certifies individuals, like appellant, as "family child care providers." A family child care provider is then able to contract with individual families seeking care for their children. The agency sets basic safety prerequisites for family child care providers, but is not involved in the agreement between the provider and the family seeking child care. The certification documents demonstrate that the agency monitors a set of basic safety factors, but does not otherwise determine the day-to-day work patterns of the child care provider.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other factors set forth for analysis by <span class="Italic">Spirides</span> and <span class="Italic">Abidin</span> also suggest that appellant is not an "employee" of the agency in this case. First, child care services are certainly not an "integral part of the business" of the agency. Second, the intent of the parties is crucial here and appellant, as a family child care provider, signed a statement of understanding which provided that she understood that she was not a government employee, that there was no contractual relationship between the agency and herself, and that since the agency assumed no responsibility under the Federal Torts Claims Act or otherwise, she would be individually responsible for any injury or harm that might befall children under her care. Third, it does not appear that family child care providers accumulate retirement benefits or annual leave. Fourth, all aspects of the service relationship, including fees, fee policy, and fee collection are set by the provider and the family.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that courts have regularly held that entities providing licensing or certification functions are not "employers" for purposes of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Waterfront Comm'n</span>, 665 F. Supp. 197 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). For this reason, too, then, we conclude that appellant is not an "employee" of the agency for purposes of her employment discrimination claim under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Fearn v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 01962874 (1996), the Commission determined that the complainant was an employee of the contractor rather than an employee of the agency where the contractor, and not the agency, controlled the job assignments, pay, and benefits. The agency simply gave assignments to the contractor who, in turn, decided which employees would complete those assignments. In the same case, the Commission rejected an argument that the complainant should be considered an applicant for employment because he had twice applied for jobs with the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Fearn</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant contends that he was an "applicant for employment" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103(c), because he had filed two prior applications for employment with the agency. The Commission notes, however, that these applications were for permanent positions with the agency, which were different from appellant's position as an hourly employee of the contractor. Hence, the Commission finds that these applications do not make appellant an "applicant for employment" for purposes of the present case.</p>

Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019000953 (2019) (no joint employment where the evidence showed that the complainant was free to decline any work assigned by the agency); <span class="Italic">Prouse v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966393 (1997) (where the complainant was supervised by a postmaster but received no benefits, commendations, awards or training and was responsible for paying own taxes, complainant was contractor and not employee).</p>
