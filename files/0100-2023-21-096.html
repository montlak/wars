<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-102"><span class="space">p.</span> Disciplining the Victim</h5>
<p class="noindent">Although an agency is liable for sexual harassment if it does not take prompt and effective corrective action, that does not exempt the victim of harassment from discipline for improper responses to the harassment. In <span class="Italic">Jean-Louis v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120064683 (2009), the complainant was subjected to an incident of egregious sexual harassment that the Commission described as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim (1), the record reflects that on September 27, 2005, at approximately 3:00 AM, an altercation occurred between complainant and CW1. The exact nature of that altercation is disputed by the parties. However, we find that the record supports the following facts: On September 27, 2005, complainant was walking from the staging area when she saw CW1 sitting on the rail next to his machine looking at her as he pulled up his apron and began to touch, grab and play with his genitals. Complainant interpreted CW1's gestures as simulated masturbation. CW1 shouted at her "that is what you need, you need my d***, you need a big d***." Complainant stated that when she got to her machine CW1 got up from the railing and he was standing still shouting to her that "you need to suck my d***, I'm going to put my d*** in your p****." CW1 began to lick his lips and sticking his tongue out at her. Complainant stated that she looked at CW1 and pretended that she was going to spit on him. CW1 continued to shout and make sexual gestures towards her. Complainant again pretended to spit on him. Complainant walked a little closer to CW1 and this time she actually spat on him. Thereafter, CW1 walked up to complainant and kicked her on her buttocks, the lower part of her back and the left side of her face. Complainant walked to the office and reported the incident.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency placed both employees on an emergency suspension and later proposed their removals for the altercation. Both employees were subsequently through settlement agreements. The Commission found that the agency was liable for sexual harassment because, in proposing and implementing equal discipline for the harasser and the victim, the agency had not taken prompt and effective corrective action. However, the Commission also found no discrimination in the emergency suspension and proposed removal of the complainant. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Jean-Louis</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since we have determined that CW1's actions created a hostile work environment for complainant, we now turn to the question of whether the agency is liable for CW1's actions. In the case of co-worker harassment, an agency is responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace where the agency (or its agents) knew or should have known of the conduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(d); <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999) (Enforcement Guidance). What is appropriate remedial action will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case, such as the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Dept. Of Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992). However, when an employer receives a complaint or otherwise learns of alleged sexual harassment in the workplace, the employer should investigate promptly and thoroughly. Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, N-915-050 (March 19, 1990). The employer should take immediate and appropriate corrective action by doing whatever is necessary to end the harassment, make the victim whole by restoring lost employment benefits or opportunities, and prevent the misconduct from recurring. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Disciplinary action against the offending supervisor or employee, ranging from reprimand to discharge, may be necessary. Generally, the corrective action should reflect the severity of the conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the agency was notified about the September 27, 2005 events, complainant and CW1 were placed on off-duty status on September 27, 2005, beginning at 4:00 AM. In a letter dated October 31, 2005, the agency issued complainant a Notice of Removal, effective Saturday, December 10, 2005. The agency provided that complainant was removed due to the altercation that occurred on September 27, 2005. In a letter dated October 31, 2005, CW1 was also issued a Notice of Proposed Removal, effective no sooner than 30 days after his receipt of the October 31, 2005 letter. The record reflects that the agency engaged in an investigation on October 4, 2005. The record also reflects that both complainant and CW1 were reinstated as a result of two separate Pre-Arbitration settlement agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the agency explains in its FAD, the agency's only response to the events of September 27, 2005 was to impose identical discipline on complainant and CW1, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>. immediate suspension and proposed removal. That disciplinary action was based on the physical altercation between complainant and CW1. In doing so, the agency completely failed to acknowledge CW1's pre-altercation conduct and complainant's allegations of harassment. The agency's response completely ignores the outrageous sexual aspect of the events and only addresses the physical confrontation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency does not acknowledge that CW1's conduct constituted sexual harassment, but instead treats two employees in an identical manner for spitting on and kicking one another in an altercation. Nor is there any indication that the MDO, who admittedly was aware that complainant had much earlier complained about sexual harassment by CW2 and others, ever took any specific action to address those allegations in such a manner which could have prevented the conduct by CW1 which occurred herein. Certainly, the agency's response to the later September 2005 sexual harassment should, at a minimum, have included training of the work force about the nature and consequences of such harassment. We order the agency to provide such training below. As 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(d) makes clear, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that it took appropriate corrective action. It has not done so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find the agency is liable for CW1's sexual harassment of complainant. Since the record is devoid of any evidence regarding any compensatory damages requested by complainant, we remand the issue of compensatory damages to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to complainant's remaining claims that she was discriminated against when the agency placed her in an off-duty (without) pay status for unacceptable conduct and issued her a Notice of Removal, effective December 10, 2005.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that complainant failed to put forth any evidence that the agency's actions were taken due to discriminatory or retaliatory animus. Therefore, we affirm the agency's finding that complainant failed to prove she was subjected to disparate treatment with regard to these claims. Based on a thorough review of the record and the contentions on appeal, including those not specifically addressed herein, we reverse in part and affirm in part the agency's FAD finding no discrimination. The Commission finds that complainant was subjected to sexual harassment for which the agency was liable. The agency is required to comply with the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies must, however, also be careful not to turn their investigations on the accuser. In <span class="Italic">Hendley v. Attorney General</span>, 01974582 (1998), the Commission found the agency engaged in both retaliation and sex discrimination where complainant's accusations of sexual harassment resulted in an investigation of her own conduct. Following an investigation that was one-sided, the complainant was suspended for five days. Particularly significant in <span class="Italic">Hendley</span> is that the Commission noted that whether the complainant had actually engaged in inappropriate conduct was not relevant to her claim of discrimination. The only relevant issue was the agency's motivation for turning the investigation around to focus on the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a mutual warning to the perpetrator and victim to stay away from each other is not effective corrective action. In <span class="Italic">Sorensen v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120092332 (2009), on on-the-job training coach made racial comments to the complainant. The agency's response was to give both the complainant and the coach instructions to stay away from each other. After those instructions were issued, there was a further incident where the coach hit the complainant with his arm as he walked by and refused to apologize. The Commission had little difficulty in <span class="Italic">Sorensen</span> finding that the agency's actions were not effective in stopping the conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_887"></span>Appropriate corrective action is a response that is reasonably calculated to stop the harassment and should not adversely affect the complainant. Thus, for example, if it is necessary to separate the parties, then the harasser should be transferred (unless the complainant prefers otherwise). The agency's only action in this case amounted to issuing identical written directives to complainant and T1 to stay out of each other's unit. The brushing of the arm incident without acknowledgment or apology occurred in April 2008 after the directives were issued. First, since complainant's husband worked in T1's unit, and there is no evidence to suggest it was inappropriate for complainant to occasionally visit with her husband, we find that complainant was adversely affected by the directive. Second, issuing identical directives to both individuals suggests that they were equally at fault when it was T1's conduct, not complainant's, that forms the basis of this Title VII violation. Third, being admonished to stay out of complainant's unit does little to educate T1 that his behavior was in fact illegal. Fourth, it is clear from the arm brushing incident that occurred after the admonishment that T1 had not understood the consequences of his conduct towards complainant. The Commission finds that in this case, the agency, at a minimum, should have provided T1 with sufficient training to ensure that he understood why his conduct violated the agency's anti harassment policies; should have required T1 to offer complainant a formal apology; and should have considered whether and what kind of discipline would have been appropriate for T1. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, Section V(C)(f), (June 18, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the agency promptly takes significant steps in response to a harassment complaint, if the steps are ineffective, the agency will be liable for the harassment. In <span class="Italic">Pruden v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01970573 (2000), the Commission found that an investigation and discipline of the harasser was not sufficient where it was clear that the harassment rendered the complainant unable to work in the same department where she was harassed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the agency took prompt actions (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, ordered an immediate investigation, suspended the AHE from duty for three days and required him to issue a formal apology to complainant). We find, however, that those actions were not totally sufficient, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, appropriate. While the AHE never harassed complainant again, complainant was required to continue working in the same department where she was frequently questioned and criticized by other employees. These frequent questions and criticisms constantly reminded her of the incident, caused her to become mentally depressed, and alienated her from her co-workers. After informing her supervisors, on several occasions, that she was not comfortable working in her assigned area, she was denied the opportunity to transfer based on race, discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>. When she was finally transferred on August 3, 1994, she had already endured almost three months of a hostile work environment. Further, the evidence does not suggest that, notwithstanding complainant's constant pleas, the agency moved to prevent or stop her co-workers from harassing her about the incident. Even the agency's Commander stated that he would have reassigned complainant earlier had he been informed in a more timely manner of her desire to be moved. Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency is liable to the complainant for sexual harassment and hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Interestingly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Pruden</span> found that the agency's failure to take prompt and effective action to transfer the complainant also constituted discrimination based on reprisal for complaining about the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the other hand, although discipline of the offender is an option open to the agency, it is not required. Where an admonishment is effective in ending the harassment and preventing its recurrence, this may be sufficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Barlow v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01971585 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">Threatening disciplinary action and referring the alleged offender to an employee assistance program may not be effective corrective action for sexual harassment. This is particularly true where the agency fails to investigate the allegations of harassment and the initial response of threatening discipline does not bring an end to the harassment. In <span class="Italic">Bouchell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932122 (1994), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the record, the Commission finds that appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of Title VII based on sexual harassment. Appellant was subjected to harassment in the form of requests for dates, repeated inquiries about her personal life, and interference with her movements at the work site by Employee A. But for appellant's sex, she would not have been subjected to the harassing behavior. Employee A's behavior became so severe and pervasive that it created a hostile working environment for appellant. The conduct unreasonably interfered with her work performance, caused her to suffer an emotional condition, and made it necessary for her to obtain a court injunction to keep Employee A away from her. The agency was put on notice that appellant was subjected to such conduct, yet it failed to take the required, immediate steps to alleviate the cause of the hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this instance, the Commission finds that the agency failed to show that it did not tolerate a hostile environment of sexual harassment. The Commission finds that the agency failed to take the necessary, immediate, and appropriate corrective action when it was put on notice as to appellant's harassment claims. The agency took no action following appellant's first complaint of harassing behavior by Employee A. In the second contact appellant had with a management official about the behavior, her complaint only resulted in the Acting Superintendent directing appellant to keep her informed on future such occurrences. Rather than conducting an investigation at such time to determine whether the claims were valid or if appellant needed assistance, the agency official did not act to resolve the situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employer becomes aware of alleged sexual harassment, the employer has the duty to investigate such charges promptly and thoroughly. EEOC "Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex," p. 30; <span class="Italic">see also Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d 251, 255 (employer is on notice of alleged harassment once an employee lodges a complaint and is liable unless it then takes prompt and adequate remedial action); <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 641 F.2d 934, 947 (D.C. Cir 1981) (an employer is responsible for sexual harassment by nonsupervisory employees unless it takes immediate and appropriate action when it learns of the conduct). The employer should not only take immediate and appropriate corrective action to end the harassment, but also make the victim whole by restoring lost benefits and prevent the misconduct from recurring<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The Commission notes that the agency failed to respond to appellant's first report of sexual harassment made to Supervisor A. At a minimum, when the misconduct continued in March 1991, the agency should have taken steps to respond to appellant's complaint by investigating the matter and taking appropriate steps to end the harassment. The Commission agrees with the AJ that the agency failed to act in September 1991 with disciplinary action after it had threatened such action in April 1991. Referring Employee A for EAP was not sufficient action to alleviate the discriminatory environment to which appellant was subjected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in light of the agency's responsibility to take effective action to prevent further harassment on the job and its knowledge of the court's restraining order, we find that some effort should have been taken to keep appellant and Employee A apart during the work day. In light of all the above, the Commission finds that the agency's failure to take appropriate action amounts to discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the other hand, advising the complainant to obtain a restraining order, advising the alleged perpetrator's supervisors of the allegations, ordering the alleged perpetrator to stay away from the complainant, and providing the alleged perpetrator with an escort when at the complainant's facility does constitute effective remedial action. <span class="Italic">Yake v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01951770 (1998). Similarly, the Commission found that the agency took prompt and effective action sufficient to avoid liability in <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A40026 (2005), where the coworker was placed on leave the day the allegation was received and kept on leave pending the outcome of an investigation, was instructed not to enter the facility except for treatment as a veteran or to visit an EAP counselor and only then with a police escort and was suspended for 14 days and demoted after completion of the investigation. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a45508.txt">01A45508</a> (2005), where the agency was not liable because it immediately conducted an investigation, reassigned the offending employee, prepared a proposed removal and, ultimately, demoted and transferred the offender.</p>
