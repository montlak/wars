<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-33"><span class="space">18.</span> Laches</h4>
<p class="noindent">The doctrine of laches is used to bar a party from pressing a claim, even though technically it may be timely, where the party has inordinately delayed pursuing the claim. Usually, it is applied where the party's delay would work some prejudice on the other party.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when initial contact with an EEO counselor is otherwise timely, the Commission can apply the legal doctrine known as "laches" to a complaint. "[A]ll appellants must act with due diligence in the pursuit of their claims or the doctrine of laches may be applied. The doctrine of laches is an equitable remedy under which an individual's failure to diligently pursue their actions could bar their claim." <span class="Italic">Washington v. Postmaster General</span>, 01930300 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, the complainant originally contacted a counselor about his disqualification from applying for a particular position in a timely fashion. Thereafter, apparently believing the agency would provide him additional training to qualify for the position, the complainant did not pursue his claim. After some 13 months, when the complainant did not receive the training, he recontacted the counselor to revive his complaint. The Commission found the doctrine of laches should be applied to bar the complainant from proceeding. It is worth noting that there is nothing in the facts of <span class="Italic">Washington</span> to indicate that the agency took any affirmative action that misled the complainant into failing to pursue his claim. In such a case, an agency may be estopped from asserting a defense based on laches.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rebar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01A02800 (2000), the Commission applied the doctrine of laches when the complainant waited for five years after his civil action was dismissed without prejudice before asking the agency to reactivate his administrative complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The doctrine of laches is an equitable defense under which an individual's failure to diligently pursue their actions can bar their claims from further consideration<span class="Italic">. Sapp v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No 05950666 (May 31, 1996) (three-year delay); <span class="Italic">Davis. v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910476 (August 15, 1991) (four-year delay)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the complainant waited five years to contact the agency after the dismissal of his civil action. While arguably the dismissal of the civil action, without prejudice, could have justified the reactivation of the complainant's administrative complaint, the record reflects that the complainant did nothing for five years. The complainant's extensive inaction warrants the application of the doctrine of laches, particularly where the complainant has not provided any persuasive justification for the delay. The Commission finds nothing in the complainant's April 8, 1991 letter to indicate that he wanted, the agency to take any further action on his complaint. To the contrary, he specifically instructed the EEO Officer to take no further action.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60899 (2006) (complainant waited five years to inquire as to status of his complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10546 (2001), the Commission applied the doctrine of laches to bar a claim that the complainant should have been given a permanent assignment earlier. The complainant was assigned to limited-duty status for 13 years and alleged that it was only after he was granted a permanent assignment that he learned that others were given such assignments ahead of him. Although the complainant initiated counseling within 45 days of learning of the assignments, the Commission held the complainant failed to act with "due diligence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Burgy v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A31087 (2003) (applying the doctrine of laches to bar a complaint by a former air traffic controller some nine years after he filed an application for reemployment rejecting complainant's arguments that he only became aware of possible discrimination a few weeks before contacting a counselor when he learned that three new controllers had been recently hired).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01923716 (1993), the Commission applied the doctrine of equitable estoppel to bar the agency from rejecting a complaint on the basis of timeliness where there was credible evidence the agency engaged in affirmative misconduct that prevented the complainant from filing a formal complaint. In that case, the employee initiated precomplaint counseling alleging racial harassment over a three-year period. During counseling, the employee's supervisor proposed to resolve the complaint by offering a transfer to another part of the agency. The supervisor also told the employee that if he did not sign the resolution, a "red flag" would be placed in his personnel file and he would never be hired as a permanent employee. Although the employee never signed the resolution, he did accept the transfer in exchange for not pursuing his complaint. The employee then attempted to resurrect the allegations when he subsequently received notice of termination of his temporary appointment to the agency. The Commission held that the agency should be estopped from asserting the timeliness issue where its own affirmative misconduct prevented pursuit of the complaint. The Commission opined that, under the circumstances, the employee had no choice but to succumb to the agency's pressure to abandon his complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even in the absence of affirmative misconduct, an agency's actions may prevent it from raising a laches defense if those actions have contributed to the confusion of the complainant and consequently his delay in pursuing his complaint. In <span class="Italic">Dowell v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01940339 (1994), the complainant contacted an EEO counselor in March 1991 over a five-day suspension. After his contact with the counselor, the complainant was under the mistaken impression that the suspension issue would be processed with another pending complaint. The complainant did not recontact a counselor until March 1993, after becoming aware that the suspension issue was not being processed. The Commission refused to apply the doctrine of laches to bar processing of the suspension complaint. The decision was not based on any affirmative misconduct on the part of the agency in contributing to the confusion, but "the doctrine of laches, an equitable remedy, should not apply when, in this case, the agency apparently contributed to the confusion and appellant did indeed contact an EEO Counselor within a not unreasonable amount of time after his initial contact with an EEO Counselor." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Colebrook v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01983169 (1999), the Commission declined to apply the doctrine of laches where the agency received a document labeled "EEO complaint" in 1994 and the complainant did not again pursue the allegations until 1997. Finding that the agency should have viewed the 1994 document as a request for counseling, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Colebrook</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question is whether appellant is barred by the doctrine of laches for not pursuing these claims until October 1997. Once appellant seeks EEO counseling the agency is required to provide EEO counseling pursuant to &#x00A7; 1614.105. The agency never provided counseling in this instance (prior to October 1997) and there is no indication that appellant was ever informed of his rights or of what time frames he could expect any action by the agency. There is nothing in the record to indicate that appellant pursued the matter after his initial contact in December 27, 1994 and subsequent meetings at unspecified times (described as "shortly thereafter" by the Chief) until he filed October 1997 document. Although the Commission is troubled by appellant's failure to pursue the matter until October 1997, the Commission finds that because of appellant's not unreasonable presumption that he had filed a complaint and because of the agency's failure to provide written information to appellant about the complaint process and the time frames for agency actions in the process, appellant is not barred by the doctrine of laches from raising these matters in his October 1997 contact of an EEO Counselor. Therefore, we find that the agency improperly dismissed the portion of the December 5, 1997 complaint which raised the allegations contained in the December 27, 1994 document.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0520140315 (2014) (laches defense barred where agency ignored EEOC order to process complaint for several years). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Giancola v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01982867 (1999) (applying laches where complainant contacted a counselor in 1990-91, but did not pursue the allegation until 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency never issued a notice of final interview to the complainant and also led her to believe the complaint would be processed, the Commission declined to apply the doctrine of laches where the formal complaint was not filed until some two and a half years after the initial counselor contact. In <span class="Italic">Gunn v. Small Business Administration</span>, 0120080844 (2010), the complainant, an attorney in the General Counsel's office, contacted a counselor with allegations that she was being subjected to discrimination and a hostile environment on the basis of religion. Because the allegations involved high-level officials at the General Counsel's office, the complainant requested to remain anonymous during counseling. The agency determined that it should procure a contract counselor for the complainant. In the meantime, the complainant had three different agency EEO counselors. She also made numerous inquiries about the status of her counseling request. When she filed the formal complaint, the agency dismissed it for failure to provide a reasonable explanation for the more than two-year delay in filing the complaint. On appeal, the agency argued the doctrine of laches should be applied. In rejecting that argument, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Gunn</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we address the agency's argument that the doctrine of laches applies in this case. The Commission has held that complainants must act with due diligence in the pursuit of their claims or the doctrine of laches may be applied. The doctrine of laches is an equitable remedy under which an individual's failure to diligently pursue her actions could bar her claim. <span class="Italic">See O'Dell v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901130 (December 27, 1990). We find that the doctrine of laches is not applicable, because regardless of what may have transpired subsequently (and whether or not the agency in fact acted with "unclean hands" as complainant suggests), there is no dispute that that the agency failed to meet its obligation to issue complainant a notice of right to file a formal complaint after the termination of informal counseling. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(d). Instead of meeting its own obligation, after several years had passed, the agency issued complainant a letter closing the informal counseling based on complainant's alleged failure to act with due diligence. We find that this was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_162"></span>The Commission contrasted <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> with the facts presented in <span class="Italic">Kimberly H. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120170901 (2017), a case in which, like <span class="Italic">Gunn</span>, the agency failed to issue a notice of final interview to the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Kimberly H</span>., the agency advised the complainant in writing that "if resolution of her complaint is not achieved within 30 calendar days from the date Complainant initiated EEO counseling she would be given a notice of right to file a formal complaint, but if she was offered and accepted mediation, the notice time would be extended to 60 days." The complainant thereafter elected mediation, but the initial mediation date offered her did not fit her schedule, and the agency advised her that mediation would be rescheduled. Several weeks later, the complainant contacted the EEO office and was told that they were working on her complaint. More than two years had passed when she contacted the EEO office to update her work contact information and to advise that she had changed positions to an EEO specialist. Less than a year later, she requested an update on the processing of her complaint, and after receiving no response, she filed a formal complaint, which the agency dismissed under the doctrine of laches. On appeal, the Commission affirmed the agency's dismissal, writing in <span class="Italic">Kimberly H</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find laches. Complainant contacted the EEO Office in May 2013, to get information on the EEO complaint process, and once there said she had another job offer and wanted to decide later if she would file a complaint. This did not trigger the Agency's obligation to issue a notice of right to file a complaint. In opposition to the appeal, the agency argues that mediation alone does not show Complainant was actively pursuing a specific claim because mediations via the EEO Office are often conducted for a variety of reasons and not just when a complainant is formally pursuing a claim of discrimination. Prior to filing her formal complaint, Complainant was not assigned an Agency docket number, which the Agency suggested was its practice when there is an intention to file a complaint. The mediation email contains no docket number. While Complainant contends through her attorney that around November 2013, she contacted EEO Officer 1 and was told they were working on her complaint, there is no documentation of this, and given the timing of this alleged exchange it could have been about mediation Unlike <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> and <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, there is a question on whether Complainant should have been given a notice of right to file a complaint. Complainant's next documented contact with the EEO Office was in October 2015, when she merely updated her contact information. By December 2015, Complainant was an EEO Specialist in an EEO Office working as an Affirmative Program Manager, and hence more likely than not was very familiar with the EEO process, which weighs against her on culpability on delay. She next contacted the EEO Office close to or in the Summer of 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that culpability and equities weigh against Complainant for causing the delay of over three years before she filed her formal complaint, and hence lathes apply.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant is an employee of a contractor may excuse the initiation of counseling within the 45-day time period. However, in <span class="Italic">Goel</span> <span class="Italic">v. Agency for International Development</span>, 0120091503 (2009), the Commission waived the 45-day time period for counselor contact because the agency failed to demonstrate that he was aware of the time limit, but applied the doctrine of laches to dismiss the complaint as untimely since the allegations were not raised with a counselor until some three years later.</p>
