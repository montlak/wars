<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-75"><span class="space">J.</span> REQUESTS FOR ACCOMMODATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Normally an employee will not be heard to complain of a failure to accommodate in the absence of a request for reasonable accommodation. However, there are cases where the Commission held that no such request is necessary because the need for accommodation was, or should have been, apparent to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission restated its position in its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation</span>, noting that generally an employee is required to make a request for accommodation, but noting certain exceptions. The employee is not required to use the phrase "reasonable accommodation" or any other particular language. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission described the request for accommodation as "the first step in an informal, interactive process between the individual and the employer." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 9. The request may come from the individual, family member, friend, health care professional, or representative. There is no requirement that the request be in writing. Although the employer may seek to have the employee make a request in writing or fill out a form, the employer cannot ignore the original request for accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">On July 26, 2000, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13164, 65 Fed. Reg. 46565, requiring each federal agency to develop written procedures for processing requests for accommodation. To assist agencies in developing written procedures, the Commission issued EEOC Directive No. 915.003, <span class="Italic">Policy Guidance on Executive Order 13164: Establishing Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation</span> (Oct. 20, 2000). In the introduction to the policy guidance, the Commission explains that written procedures</p>
<p class="noindent-1">will enable agencies to handle requests in a prompt, fair, and efficient manner; they will assure that individuals with disabilities understand how to approach the system and know what to expect; and they will be a resource both for individuals with disabilities and for agency employees, so that all parties can understand the legal requirements of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The general parameters for developing written procedures are set forth in <span class="Italic">Policy Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation Procedures</span> at pp. 3-4:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reasonable accommodation procedures should be designed to expand employment opportunities for people with disabilities, not to create new bureaucratic requirements. The Rehabilitation Act requires that individuals be given substantial leeway in the ways in which they can make requests for reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. Additionally, agency procedures must permit flexibility in the processing of requests and assure that agency officials act expeditiously in providing reasonable accommodations.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency procedures must also inform individuals with disabilities and agency employees about their rights and responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act. The procedures must be written in plain language so that they can be understood by those not familiar with the law. They must also explain relevant terms (e.g., essential functions, undue hardship, etc.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency may permit different components of the agency to adopt their own procedures as necessary to expedite the processing of reasonable accommodation requests. However, all procedures must comply with the requirements of the Order and the standards set forth in this Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Emphasis in original.)</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies are also required to notify their collective bargaining representatives, and to bargain over their reasonable accommodation procedures, to the extent required by law. Order 13164, &#x00A7; 3.</p>
<p class="noindent">The policy guidance further requires that agencies must educate their employees about the procedures and disseminate the procedures. Specifically, the policy guidance requires:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each agency's procedures must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. Where agencies post their procedures on their websites, those websites must be accessible. Agencies should also make their procedures available in alternative formats, such as large print or Braille, on request. Moreover, agencies should provide other reasonable accommodations where necessary to make the procedures accessible for particular individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE</span>--Matthew, who is mentally retarded, cannot understand the agency's reasonable accommodation procedures as written. The agency must provide the information contained in the procedures in a manner accessible to him.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee is not required to request accommodation where the employee is unable, because of her disability, to think clearly enough to make a request for accommodation. In such situations, the Commission indicated that it will apply a procedure that amounts to a constructive request theory. The agency will be required to consider reasonable accommodation if the supervisor's knowledge of an existing medical condition, combined with the employee's performance and behavior, should have put the supervisor on notice that the problems were being caused by the medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Rodgers v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01921948 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation</span>, at 8-12.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the <span class="Italic">Rodgers</span> case, the complainant had a history of paranoid schizophrenia, of which the supervisor was aware. The Commission found that, given the numerous instances of erratic and inappropriate behavior, it was at least plausible the supervisor should have concluded that the complainant was experiencing a relapse. Because the precise knowledge of the supervisor regarding the complainant's medical condition was not apparent from the record, the Commission remanded the case for the taking of additional evidence. The Commission concluded that if the supervisor should have drawn a connection between the aberrant behavior and the complainant's past medical condition, then the agency should have attempted reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">For purposes of a request for accommodation, the Commission treats the agency as a monolithic entity and there is no requirement that the request be made to a supervisor. As the Commission noted in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120122540 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record, however, is unclear as to what actions the Agency has taken since 2002 in response to Complainant's request for reasonable accommodation. Complainant averred that the Agency "never responded to any request.... They only have said or indicated that they do not believe me, that I am lying, that I am unreliable, that there is no trouble with the facility, that I am telling my doctor what to say." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Si and S2 averred that they were not aware of any request for reasonable accommodation from Complainant. Although the AJ found that Si and S2 were unaware of Complainant's request for accommodation, we emphasize that it is "the employer," and not a particular supervisor, who has an obligation to provide reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, emphasizing that no "magic words" are necessary, the Commission rejected an agency argument that the complainant failed to request accommodation in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120093256 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that while Complainant requested a reasonable accommodation on December 5, 2008, Complainant did not request a reasonable accommodation in the issues underlying the first complaint. The Agency is reminded, however, that under the Rehabilitation Act, an employee is not required to use the "magic" words "reasonable accommodation" when making a request. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Enforcement Guidance), EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002) at Q.I. Instead, the employee or the employee's representative need only inform the Agency that he or she needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Triplett-Graham v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A44720 (Feb. 24, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the issues underlying the first complaint, we note that while Complainant stated in response to a question in his sworn statement that he never requested a reasonable accommodation, he also indicated that he did not understand the question. The record contains several instances where management officials and human resources officials should have been on notice that Complainant was seeking a reasonable accommodation. For example, Complainant stated on numerous occasions that except for the requirement that he have a seven-state CDL and pass the S5 medical examination, his impairment has not affected his ability to perform the functions of the foreman position and he was never required to drive a Commercial Motor Vehicle when he served as a foreman. Further, Complainant stated on numerous occasions that the <span id="Page_1184"></span>requirement to have a CDL and pass the S5 medical examination were not essential functions of the foreman position, and therefore he should be allowed to serve as a foreman. Additionally, the Agency had knowledge of Complainant's impairment and his need for an accommodation when it provided Complainant with a reasonable accommodation in his journeyman electrician position by making adjustments to his work assignments so he would not have to drive a Commercial Motor Vehicle. Therefore, we find that a reasonable accommodation analysis should be applied to the issues underlying both complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, there are three criteria in evaluating whether an employee has essentially made a constructive request for accommodation: 1) whether the agency knows or has reason to know of the disability; 2) whether the agency knows or has reason to know that there may be a connection between that disability and problems being experienced in the workplace; and 3) whether the agency knows or has reason to know that the employee's disability may prevent him or her from requesting accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jody L. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120151351 (2018) (where the disability was obvious, i.e., the employee required a wheelchair for mobility, the employee need not "officially" request accommodation or make a "formal" or "actual" request. It was enough that the employee asked his new supervisor for a modification to his usual telework schedule that had been in place for years).</p>
<p class="noindent">As the case law has developed, this latter criterion has taken on more significance. Although the employee is not required to use any precise language in requesting accommodation, unless the disability prevents the employee from doing so he or she must do something that affirmatively alerts the agency to the need for an accommodation. The Commission seems less and less willing to read a request for accommodation into an employee's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An example is provided by <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120061991 (2007). In that case, the employee was diagnosed with breast cancer. She submitted a leave request under the Family Medical and Leave Act stating that she would receive 16 weeks of chemotherapy and 22 weeks of radiation therapy. The form she submitted also noted that she might have complications and side effects such as nausea, fatigue and infection. The employee later filed an EEO complaint alleging a failure to accommodate when the agency did not switch her from a street route to a less strenuous building route. The Commission found that the employee in <span class="Italic">Hudson</span> had never requested accommodation and that the FMLA request was not sufficient to put the agency on notice of the need for an accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The undisputed record shows that in October 2004, complainant submitted medical documentation requesting leave for her treatment under FMLA. The documentation indicated that complainant would receive chemotherapy for 16 weeks and radiation therapy for 22 weeks. The medical documentation also described possible side effects of the treatment as fatigue, nausea and infection as reasons why complainant might need to miss work. We find that the FMLA documentation was the only medical evidence submitted by complainant, in which no medical restrictions were listed. We note that complainant argued that once she submitted the FMLA documentation, the agency should initiated an interactive process to accommodate her disability. However, the fact that complainant was eligible for leave under FMLA does not mean that she was an individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act, nor does the FMLA documentation constitute a request for accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant additionally argues on appeal that the agency knew or should have known that she required an accommodation, and should have initiated an interactive process to accommodate her disability. However, we note that as a general rule, the individual with a disability who has the most knowledge about the need for reasonable accommodation must inform the employer that an accommodation is needed. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> ("Guidance"), No. 915.002, Question 40 (rev. Oct. 17, 2002) ("an employer should initiate the reasonable accommodation interactive process without being asked if the employer: (1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation."). In the instant case, we are not persuaded that the agency knew or should have known that complainant needed an accommodation. We note that her managers deny that they ever received a request to switch routes as a reasonable accommodation. Moreover, the record contains no doctor's note requesting a route change or explaining how a route change would enable complainant to perform the essential functions of her job. The record reveals that complainant was performing the duties of her job successfully, and also asked for overtime on several occasions. Under the instant circumstances, we cannot conclude that the agency failed in its obligation to provide complainant with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since complainant provided no information to her managers regarding her physical limitations and work restrictions, we are not persuaded that complainant was denied an accommodation. The Commission has published extensive guidance on reasonable accommodation. It is well settled Commission policy that a request for reasonable accommodation does not have to be in writing, does not have to use the magic words "reasonable accommodation," and can come from someone other than the individual who needs it. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance, Questions 1-3. However, when requesting accommodation, an individual or his/her representative must let the agency know that the individual needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. al Question 1. The preponderance of the evidence in the record does not demonstrate that complainant informed the agency of her need for an adjustment or change at work. As such, the Commission finds that complainant failed lo establish her claim that the agency did not provide her with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130537 (2014), where the Commission rejected an agency argument that the complainant had not requested accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management officials do not dispute that upon his arrival at the Sullivan Post Office Complainant provided medical documentation describing his medical condition and limitations. Nonetheless, in its decision the Agency asserts that Complainant did not request an accommodation. We find that the Postmaster failed to recognize Complainant did indeed request an accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002, Question 1 (rev. October 17, 2002) ("When an individual decides to request accommodation, the individual or his/her representative must let the employer know that s/he needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. To request accommodation, an individual may use 'plain English' and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase 'reasonable accommodation.'") By describing his limitations, providing medical documentation, and asking for breaks related to his conditions, Complainant's actions constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is not under an obligation to continually remind an agency of his disabling condition. In <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Postmaster General</span>, 01900982 (1990), the Commission found that a medical report submitted five years earlier should have put the agency on notice of the complainant's disability. The Commission noted that in 1983 the agency was advised that the complainant suffered from degenerative disc disease. This, combined with standard medical textbook descriptions of the disease and the complainant's progressive difficulty in working, was sufficient to demonstrate knowledge on the part of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, an agency's awareness of one of appellant's disabilities does not obligate it to provide accommodation for additional disabilities of which it has no knowledge. In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954089 (1997), the Commission found the agency did not discriminate against the complainant in enforcing the terms of a last chance agreement where the agency was aware of the complainant's depression, but had not been advised he was HIV positive:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant further argues, consistent with the AJ's findings, that the agency failed to accommodate his HIV positive condition and attendant depression when it implemented the terms of the LCA [last chance agreement] rather than excuse his absences from work on April 1, May 5, and May 6, 1993. Under the Commission's regulations, an agency is required to make reasonable accommodation of the known physical and mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c) ("An agency shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an...employee"); <span class="Italic">see also Brown v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05921024 (April 1, 1993). As a general rule, it is the responsibility of the individual with the disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed. <span class="Italic">See</span> Section 1630.9., Appendix to [29 CFR] Part 1630, Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the ADA, 42 USC 12111, <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (Interpretive Guidance). The issue here thus is whether the agency knew about appellant's HIV positive condition and depression when he missed work and violated the terms of the LCA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the record makes manifest, the agency had no knowledge of appellant's HIV positive condition when he had unscheduled absences on April 1, May 5, or May 6, 1993. By the time appellant advised the agency that he was HIV positive, he already had violated the terms of the LCA as extended. Once appellant violated the terms of the LCA, the agency was free to address that violation in a manner consistent with its actions in all such cases. That is, section 104(c)(4) of the ADA permits a covered employer to hold an employee with a disability to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior as other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the employee's disability. 29 USC &#x00A7; 12114(c) (4). While the ADA requires employers to consider other forms of reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities, employers do not have to excuse the violation of uniformly-applied conduct or job performance standards as <span id="Page_1185"></span>a form of reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940100 (March 29, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that agency regulations require an employee specifically to request light duty does not negate its obligation to provide accommodation in the absence of a request where the agency has sufficient knowledge of the disability to be aware that accommodation is required. In <span class="Italic">Barnett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01951925 (1997), the Commission faulted the agency for issuing a finding that the appellant was not disabled, contradicting earlier acknowledgments that the appellant was substantially impaired in major life activities. It further rejected the agency's argument that the appellant was required to make a written request for accommodation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the final agency decision stated that appellant "submitted no evidence to substantiate that he had an impairment which affected a major life activity," the Commission notes that the agency had previously acknowledged: appellant's "clear and recent medical documentation [<span class="Italic">see</span> Report of Investigation, Ex. 6]"; appellant's inability to sit for more than 30 minutes; his restriction on lifting more than 25 pounds; the permanent nature of his impairment; and his need for a total knee replacement. In light of the foregoing, the agency's finding to the contrary in its final decision, without any discussion of or reference to the record, is insupportable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency erred in failing to consider whether its issuance of the Notice of Removal constituted a failure to provide appellant with the reasonable accommodation to which he was entitled. While the agency found that appellant's disability precluded him from performing the duties of an MPLSM Operator, the term "position in question," as contained in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6), is not limited to the position actually held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held as a result of job restructuring or reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c)(2)(ii) and (g). While Federal law does not require that an agency create a new position for a disabled individual, the agency must consider reassignment to a vacant position that the individual is qualified to perform. <span class="Italic">See Owens v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03930129 (December 17, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is the agency's burden to show that appellant's disability could not be accommodated without imposing an undue hardship on the agency. In this case, the agency was aware of appellant's disability and his need for continued accommodation at the time he was removed. However, there is no evidence that the agency considered reassigning appellant to another position. Although the agency states that appellant was obligated to file a written request for a permanent light duty assignment, given the agency's knowledge of appellant's disability and the need for accommodation, his failure to formally apply for permanent light duty did not negate the agency's obligation to seek out ways of accommodating him. <span class="Italic">See Humiston v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940937 (February 10, 1997) (Advising appellant to apply for light duty is not synonymous with providing reasonable accommodation). As in <span class="Italic">Humiston</span>, the agency failed to show that there were no other positions available for which appellant was qualified with or without reasonable accommodation, or that it even considered appellant for any available assignments after determining that appellant's impairment was permanent and non-job-related.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement that an employee use the phrase "reasonable accommodation" in making a request. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Marriott v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994803 (2001) (complainant deemed to have made request for accommodation by giving agency a letter from his doctor requesting alternate duties); <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981981 (2001) (letter from doctor stating that complainant's tardiness was due to asthma constituted a request for accommodation).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lyons v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120053779 (2008), the complainant requested placement in a "suitable job" because her Hepatitis C required she not come in contact with infectious materials. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complainant had not requested reasonable accommodation finding that her request made it clear she was requesting a workplace modification because of her medical condition. However, the complainant did not prevail because, in any event, the agency did offer her a position as a program support clerk.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Feder v. Attorney General</span>, 0520130004 (2013), the Commission cautioned the agency about taking "too narrow a view" of what constitutes a request for accommodation. In denying the agency's request for reconsideration, the Commission noted that agency managers were well aware that the complainant suffered psychological trauma as the result of being a Holocaust survivor. Although the complainant never specifically requested reasonable accommodation, he had made several requests for a work environment away from ambient office noise and the flexibility to work on weekends due to his noise sensitivity.</p>
