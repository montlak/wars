<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-24"><span class="space">G.</span> DISCRIMINATORY INFLUENCE OF OTHERS--THE "CAT'S PAW"</h3>
<p class="noindent">In most cases, the focus is on the agency official who actually made the employment decision and whether his or her motives were discriminatory. However, there is a subset of cases in which the official making the decision lacks discriminatory intent but is influenced in the decision by someone who does have discriminatory intent. It is not a defense that the official taking the action lacked discriminatory motive if the complainant can demonstrate that someone else with discriminatory motive substantially influenced the decision. The theory of imputing discriminatory intent from one who influences a decision to the actual decisionmaker is sometimes referred to as the "cat's paw" theory, deriving its name from an opinion written by Judge Posner in <span class="Italic">Shager v. Upjohn Co.</span>, 913 F.2d 398 (7th Cir. 1990). It is a theory adopted by the EEOC in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Attorney General</span>, 01200451211 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission gave a good explanation of the cat's paw theory in <span class="Italic">Reveles v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01201105759 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "cat's paw" seeks to describe an instance where the discriminatory animus of one employee is transferred through another, who acts as a conduit. This prevents the escape of liability where discrimination is happening, but the deciding official did not knowingly take part. To show that this is occurring it is necessary that "the employee can demonstrate that others had influence or leverage over the official decision-maker, and thus were not ordinary coworkers" to be able to "impute the discriminatory attitudes to the formal decision-maker." <span class="Italic">Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture</span>, 235 F.3d 219, 226 (5th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">citing Long v. Eastfield College</span>, 88 F.3d 300, 307, 308-309 (5th Cir. 1996). This requires more than the fact that a coworker of the deciding official exhibited discriminatory attitudes. There must be some use of influence or persuasion. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Randolph A. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120120184 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent">The cat's paw theory was recently accepted by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1136 (2011). Before turning to the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Staub</span> cases, a review of Judge Posner's opinion in <span class="Italic">Shager</span> is helpful.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Shager</span> involved a claim under the ADEA in which the plaintiff, a sales representative and manager for a seed company, was fired by a review committee for alleged performance deficiencies. The district court granted summary judgment to the Upjohn Co., which had purchased the Asgrow company that Shager worked for on the basis that there was no evidence that the review committee took Shager's age into consideration in making its decision. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit reversed, finding that there was a material dispute of fact over whether Shager's 35--year--old supervisor had tainted the review committee's decision by providing false information on Shager's performance in order to replace him with a younger employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Judge Posner, writing the decision in <span class="Italic">Shager</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But we must consider whether hostility on the part of Lehnst to older workers can be imputed to Asgrow. If it cannot be, then Asgrow's case for summary judgment is strengthened. The discharge of Shager was approved by Asgrow's "Career Path Committee," and assuming, as the parties do--though the record is surprisingly meager on the point--that Lehnst was not a member of the committee, there is no evidence that any of its members harbored any hostility to old workers or preference for young ones. Asgrow contends that the committee is a nonconductor that shields the company from liability for the wrong of employee Lehnst.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The common law rule is that an employer is liable for intentional torts of its employees committed in furtherance of their employment, a condition satisfied here. <span class="Italic">Lancaster v. Norfolk &#x0026; Western Ry.,</span> 773 F.2d 807, 817 (7th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers Corp</span>., 797 F.2d 1417, 1421-22 (7th Cir. 1986). The rule usually is carried over to statutory torts, because statutes creating torts rarely bother to set forth all the ancillary doctrines--governing such issues as causation, immunity, or, here, derivative liability--that are necessary to compose a complete regime of tort liability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1983 is a famous example of an incomplete tort statute on which the courts have engrafted all sorts of common law doctrines to make it workable--although not <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act is not completely silent on the issue of agency. The Act imposes liability only on employers, but defines "employer" to include "agent," 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 630(b), a term that embraces but is more encompassing than "employee": all employees are agents, but not all agents are employees. So it may seem obvious that Asgrow is responsible for Lehnst's discriminatory actions. In fact this inference is not compelled. The statutory language that we have quoted could mean nothing more than that Lehnst, the agent, is liable along with Asgrow, or even possibly instead of Asgrow. Shager could have sued Lehnst (perhaps, on this reading, only Lehnst), but did not. <span class="Italic">House v. Cannon Mills Co</span>., 713 F. Supp. 159, 159-62 (M.D.N.C. 1988), and cases cited there. On this understanding, the statute is silent on the issue of derivative liability and it is thus left to the courts to decide as a matter of federal common law whether to apply the doctrine of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> in age discrimination cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A further and considerable complication, however, comes from the fact that in interpreting the same definition of "employer" in Title VII, the Supreme Court has held that it "surely evinces an intent to place some limits on the acts of employees for which employers under Title VII are to be held responsible." <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 72, (1986). That was a case of sexual harassment by a coworker of the plaintiff, and the Court held that the coworker's misconduct was not automatically to be ascribed to the employer. Later cases, illustrated by <span class="Italic">Brooms v. Regal Tube Co</span>., 881 F.2d 412, 421 (7th Cir. 1989), hold that the employer, to be held liable for sexual harassment of one worker by another, must know or have reason to know of the harassment and fail to take prompt and effective measures to correct it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rule that falls out of <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> and the cases following it is less a derivation from the statutory language than a recognition of the unrealism of expecting an employer to be able to purge every trace of sexual harassment from the workplace; so strict liability would add nothing to liability based on fault. Concern with the futility of derivative liability is absent where the challenged action is not harassment, whether on sexual or other grounds, by a fellow employee but discharge by a supervisory employee. The deliberate act of an employee acting within the scope of his authority is the act of the employer, for an employer, at least where it is a corporation, acts only through agents. <span class="Italic">Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., supra</span>, 797 F.2d at 1422; <span class="Italic">North v. Madison Area Ass'n</span>., 844 F.2d 401, 407 (7th Cir. 1988). This much derivative liability (if that is what it should be called) surely survives the <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> line of cases; if it did not, the Age Discrimination 405 in Employment Act would have a very soft bite indeed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The cases such as <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> that place limitations on the employer's liability in harassment cases, and the cases such as <span class="Italic">Hunter</span> that affirm the employer's liability for the acts of its supervisors, may seem in tension with each other, as remarked in <span class="Italic">Brooms v. Regal Tube Co., supra</span>, 881 F.2d at 420-21. But in fact they are consistent both with each other and with the common law rule of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span>. Discrimination is an intentional tort and as we noted earlier an employer is liable for the intentional torts of an employee only if they are in furtherance (though possibly misguided) of the employer's business, implying some relation between the tort and the business. If one low-level employee makes sexual advances to another, his conduct is so unrelated to the employer's business that the employer will ordinarily be excused from liability under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span>; the employer's own fault must be shown. But a supervisory employee who fires a subordinate is doing the kind of thing that he is authorized to do, and the wrongful intent with which he does it does not carry his behavior so far beyond the orbit of his responsibilities as to excuse the employer. Restatement (Second) of Agency &#x00A7; 228 (1958). From the outside, at least, it looks as if he is doing his job, which is not the case when one worker sexually harasses another; and the appearance of authority provides a rough-and-ready criterion of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span>--which is not to say that there must be the same "apparent authority" as would be necessary to bind Asgrow to a contract made by Lehnst with <span id="Page_703"></span>a third party<span class="Italic">. Id</span>., &#x00A7; 140(b). In both sorts of case, however, the ultimate concern is with confining the employer's or principal's liability to the general class of cases in which he has the practical ability to head off the injury to his employee's, or other agent's, victim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All that follows, though, is that if Lehnst had fired Shager, Asgrow would be liable whether or not anyone else connected with the company was at fault. Lehnst did not fire Shager; the Career Path Committee did. If it did so for reasons untainted by any prejudice of Lehnst's against older workers, the causal link between that prejudice and Shager's discharge is severed, and Shager cannot maintain this suit even if Asgrow is fully liable for Lehnst's wrongdoing<span class="Italic">. La Montagne v. American Convenience Products, Inc., supra</span>, 750 F.2d at 1412. But if Shager's evidence is believed, as in the present posture of the case it must be, the committee's decision to fire him was tainted by Lehnst's prejudice. Lehnst not only set up Shager to fail by assigning him an unpromising territory but influenced the committee's deliberations by portraying Shager's performance to the committee in the worst possible light. Lehnst's influence may well have been decisive. The committee's deliberations on the question whether to fire Shager were brief, perhaps perfunctory; no member who was deposed could remember having considered the issue. A committee of this sort, even if it is not just a liability shield invented by lawyers, is apt to defer to the judgment of the man on the spot. Lehnst was the district manager; he presented plausible evidence that one of his sales representatives should be discharged; the committee was not conversant with the possible age animus that may have motivated Lehnst's recommendation. If it acted as the conduit of Lehnst's prejudice--his cat's-paw--the innocence of its members would not spare the company from liability. For it would then be a case where Lehnst, acting within (even if at the same time abusing) his authority as district manager to evaluate and make recommendations concerning his subordinates, had procured Shager's discharge because of his age. Lehnst would have violated the statute, and his violation would be imputed to Asgrow. The committee would be out of the picture. It would no more be a nonconductor, insulating the company from liability for Lehnst's misconduct, than would be the secretary who typed Shager 's discharge papers knowing nothing of the age discrimination that lay behind the discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the complainant brought a claim alleging hostile environment harassment based on race and sex. Ironically, the complainant did not prevail on her harassment claim. Although the EEOC found that the comments to which the complainant was subjected were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment, it also found that the agency escaped liability because, in the first instance, it had no knowledge of the harassment by coworkers and, in the second instance, took prompt and effective action when it learned of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, <span class="Italic">Brown</span> also claimed that her subsequent termination by a new assistant U.S. attorney was the result of race and sex discrimination. Specifically citing the <span class="Italic">Shager decision</span> and the "cat's paw" theory, the Commission agreed finding that the supervisor's reasons for terminating the complainant were tainted by the racial and sexual animus of coworkers. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of complainant's termination claim (claim 10), we first note that it is not necessary for complainant to rely strictly on comparative evidence to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race or sex discrimination. <span class="Italic">See O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp</span>., 517 U.S. 308, 312 (1996); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp</span>., EEOC Notice No. 915.002, n.4 (September 18, 1996). In this case, the record reveals that the agency official (A2) responsible for terminating complainant referenced complainant's allegations that she was subjected to harassment on the bases of sex and race in the letter proposing to terminate complainant. Further, A2 partly justified complainant's termination by stating that complainant's co-workers reported that she was rude and condescending, complainant alleged that she was subjected to racial harassment by co-workers, and complainant was not a team-player because she clashed with her co-workers in the Huntsville office. We find that by referencing matters pertinent to complainant's valid race and sex harassment claim and accrediting her harassing co-workers' versions of the events in the termination letter as true, A2 implicated the racial and sexist animus of the co-workers as a motive for the termination decision. Therefore, we find that complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race and sex discrimination with respect to her termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding complainant's reprisal claim, the record reveals that complainant began assisting with the investigation of her former supervisor's EEO case in mid 2000 and continued her assistance until after her termination. Protected activity consists of opposing a practice made unlawful by one of the employment discrimination statutes (the "opposition" clause); or filing a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the applicable statute (the "participation" clause).<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEOC Compl. Man. (CCH) No. 915.003, Ch. 8, Retaliation, at 8-1 (May 20, 1998). Complainant clearly engaged in EEO activity when she reported racial harassment to management in late 1998 and early 1999 and when she assisted her former supervisor with his EEO case. Complainant notified AUSA2 that she would testify on behalf of her former supervisor AUSA1 in December 2001, and the record contains a copy of an email dated March 18, 2002, wherein supervisor AUSA2 informed the United States Attorney and the administrative officer that complainant was going to play an important role in her former supervisor's case as a witness. Moreover, USA2's April 29, 2002 letter recommending complainant's termination also referenced complainant's EEO activity in detail, further indicating management's awareness of complainant's EEO activity before she was terminated. Consequently, we find that A2 clearly was aware of complainant's prior EEO activity at the time of complainant's May 10, 2002 termination. Because complainant engaged in EEO activity contemporaneously with her termination, and the activity was referenced in A2's letter recommending complainant's termination, we find that there is a strong nexus between complainant's EEO activity and her termination. Consequently, we find that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal concerning her termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the agency articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating complainant; namely, that complainant was not a "team player," did not want to work with her new supervisor, complained about her assignments, and had personality conflicts with employees that negatively affected the entire Huntsville office. However, we determine that A2's assessment of complainant's relationship with her co-workers was tainted with the racist and sexist prejudices of complainant's co-workers. For instance, A2 stated that complainant's relationship with the staff was characterized by accusations of mistrust, but A2 did not acknowledge the evidence supporting complainant's claim that she was subjected to race and sex-based harassment. Instead, A2 placed credence in the paralegal and agents' claim that complainant was "rude" and "condescending" and the paralegal's claim that complainant yelled at her and threw a book towards her. Significantly, A2's letter did not acknowledge that the paralegal and other employees were counseled for referring to complainant in a racially derogatory manner or that AUSA4 was removed because of credible evidence that she engaged in racist conduct. Further, A2's letter did not disclose the First Assistant's opinion that the problems in the Huntsville office appeared to be caused more by the paralegal than complainant and that complainant "seemed to go out of her way to be nice" to the paralegal despite the paralegal's attacks on her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A2 also cited complainant's poor relationship with some agents as a reason for terminating her, but she ignored the administrative secretary's statements that the agents also used a racist and sexist term to refer to complainant and that the paralegal transmitted her animosity against complainant to agents. Moreover, although A2 claimed that two criminal division chiefs and two First Assistants unanimously recommended that complainant be terminated, one of the criminal division chiefs stated that he played no part in the termination process, and the other stated that he merely interviewed agents and staffers to determine if complainant should be retained. Further, one of the First Assistants did not testify in this case, and the other First Assistant did not indicate that he played any role in the decision to terminate complainant. The criminal chief who interviewed co-workers for A2 stated that he relied heavily upon the input of a senior agent in recommending complainant's termination to A2, but we note that the administrative secretary testified that this same agent had openly referred to complainant in racially derogatory terms in conversations with the paralegal in 1998. The criminal chief further stated that he also relied upon the opinion of complainant's former supervisor (AUSA2) to recommend complainant's termination, but the former supervisor stated that he had "very, very little" to do with complainant's termination and merely gave the "pros and cons" of complainant's performance when questioned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are further persuaded that although A2 also claimed that complainant resented a co-worker, once stated to an employee that she would not work for him if he ever became a supervisor, and yelled at him on December 7, 2001, it is highly unlikely that these matters alone would have led to complainant's termination. Instead, we conclude that A2's perspective of these relatively minor incidents was tainted and colored by the views of the paralegal, AUSA4, and agents, who harbored racist and sexist bias against complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence that A2 sought to get complainant's version of the events to objectively determine the merits of her harassment claims. We note that A2 was not in the Huntsville office until September 2001 and did not meet complainant until October 2001, which makes it even more incredible that she relied so heavily upon the accounts of employees known to harbor racial animus against complainant to terminate complainant. While it is unclear from the record whether A2 harbored racial or sexist animus against complainant, we determine that she was the conduit of subordinate employees' race and sex-based animus against complainant, and her decision to terminate complainant was based upon these co-workers' biased assessments of complainant. <span class="Italic">See <span id="Page_704"></span>Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture</span> 235 F.3d 219, 226 (5th Cir. 2000) "[i]f the employee can demonstrate that others had influence or leverage over the official decision-maker, and thus were not ordinary coworkers, it is proper to impute their discriminatory attitudes to the formal decision-maker"], citing <span class="Italic">Long v. Eastfield College,</span> 88 F.3d 300, 307, 308-309 (5th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">see also Shager v. Upjohn Co</span>., 913 F.2d 398 (C.A.7, 1990) (holding that if review committee that was unaware of district manager's age-based animus acted "as the conduit of [manager's]--prejudice--his cat's paw--the innocence of its members would not spare the company from liability"); <span class="Italic">Echard v. Department of Justice</span>, Appeal No. 07A20137 (November 5, 2003) (Commission held that responsible management official did not need to have actual knowledge of complainant's prior EEO activity when he was acting as a conduit of another employee's prejudice against complainant). Therefore, we conclude that complainant was subjected to race and sex discrimination when she was terminated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found that the complainant established her termination was based on retaliation for protected activity. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Green v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0720060058.txt">07200600581</a> (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the validity of the cat's paw theory reached the Supreme Court in the case of <span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1136 (2011). In that case, which was brought under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 ("USERRA"), the plaintiff claimed that animus based on his military service on the part of two supervisors ultimately influenced the hospital's decision to terminate his employment. Staub never contended that the actual decisionmaker had any discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span>, but instead relied on the cat's paw theory of liability. A jury found in Staub's favor and awarded him $57,640 in damages. On appeal, however, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal reversed finding that, as a matter of law, an employer could not be liable where the decisionmaker had no discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an opinion written by Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court reversed and upheld the use of the cat's paw theory, though it did place some limitations on use of the theory requiring that a plaintiff establish not only discriminatory intent on the part of the subordinate actor, but also establish the intent to cause the adverse employment action. As Justice Scalia explained in <span class="Italic">Staub</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"A person who is a member of. . .or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership,. . .or obligation." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It elaborates further:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"An employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited. . .under subsection (a), if the person's membership. . .is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such membership." &#x00A7; 4311(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute is very similar to Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination "because of. . .race, color, religion, sex, or national origin" and states that such discrimination is established when one of those factors "was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(a), (m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central difficulty in this case is construing the phrase "motivating factor in the employer's action." When the company official who makes the decision to take an adverse employment action is personally acting out of hostility to the employee's membership in or obligation to a uniformed service, a motivating factor obviously exists. The problem we confront arises when that official has no discriminatory animus but is influenced by previous company action that is the product of a like animus in someone else.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In approaching this question, we start from the premise that when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the background of general tort law. <span class="Italic">See Burlington N. &#x0026; S. F. R. Co. v. United States</span>, 556 U.S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13-14); <span class="Italic">Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr</span>, 551 U.S. 47, 68-69 (2007); <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 764 (1998). Intentional torts such as this, "as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts,. . .generally require that the actor intend 'the consequences' of an act,' not simply 'the act itself.'" <span class="Italic">Kawaauhau v. Geiger</span>, 523 U.S. 57, 61-62 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Staub contends that the fact that an unfavorable entry on the plaintiff's personnel record was caused to be put there, with discriminatory animus, by Mulally and Korenchuk, suffices to establish the tort, even if Mulally and Korenchuk did not intend to cause his dismissal. But discrimination was no part of Buck's reason for the dismissal; and while Korenchuk and Mulally acted with discriminatory animus, the act they committed--the mere making of the reports--was not a denial of "initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment," as liability under USERRA requires. If dismissal was not the object of Mulally's and Korenchuk's reports, it may have been their result, or even their foreseeable consequence, but that is not enough to render Mulally or Korenchuk responsible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, however, Staub is seeking to hold liable not Mulally and Korenchuk, but their employer. Perhaps, therefore, the discriminatory motive of one of the employer's agents (Mulally or Korenchuk) can be aggregated with the act of another agent (Buck) to impose liability on Proctor. Again we consult general principles of law, agency law, which form the background against which federal tort laws are enacted. <span class="Italic">See Meyer v. Holley</span>, 537 U.S. 280, 285 (2003); <span class="Italic">Burlington, supra</span>, at 754-755. Here, however, the answer is not so clear. The Restatement of Agency suggests that the malicious mental state of one agent cannot generally be combined with the harmful action of another agent to hold the principal liable for a tort that requires both.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Restatement (Second) Agency &#x00A7; 275, Illustration 4 (1958). Some of the cases involving federal torts apply that rule. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Science Applications Int'l Corp</span>., 626 F. 3d 1257, 1273-1276 (CADC 2010); <span class="Italic">Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp</span>., 595 F. 3d 219, 241 (CA5 2010); <span class="Italic">United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc</span>., 566 F. 3d 1095, 1122 (CADC 2009). But another case involving a federal tort, and one involving a federal crime, hold to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See United States ex rel. Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co</span>., 352 F. 3d 908, 918-919 (CA4 2003); <span class="Italic">United States v. Bank of New England, N. A.</span>, 821 F. 2d 844, 856 (CA1 1987). Ultimately, we think it unnecessary in this case to decide what the background rule of agency law may be, since the former line of authority is suggested by the governing text, which requires that discrimination be "a motivating factor" in the adverse action. When a decision to fire is made with no unlawful animus on the part of the firing agent, but partly on the basis of a report prompted (unbeknownst to that agent) by discrimination, discrimination might perhaps be called a "factor" or a "causal factor" in the decision; but it seems to us a considerable stretch to call it "a motivating factor."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proctor, on the other hand, contends that the employer is not liable unless the <span class="Italic">de facto</span> decisionmaker (the technical decisionmaker or the agent for whom he is the "cat's paw") is motivated by discriminatory animus. This avoids the aggregation of animus and adverse action, but it seems to us not the only application of general tort law that can do so. Animus and responsibility for the adverse action can both be attributed to the earlier agent (here, Staub's supervisors) if the adverse action is the intended consequence of that agent's discriminatory conduct. So long as the agent intends, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he has the scienter required to be liable under USERRA. And it is axiomatic under tort law that the exercise of judgment by the decisionmaker does not prevent the earlier agent's action (and hence the earlier agent's discriminatory animus) from being the proximate cause of the harm. Proximate cause requires only "some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged," and excludes only those "link[s] that are too remote, purely contingent, or indirect." <span class="Italic">Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York</span>, 559 U.S. 1, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not think that the ultimate decisionmaker's exercise of judgment automatically renders the link to the supervisor's bias "remote" or "purely contingent." The decisionmaker's exercise of judgment is also a proximate cause of the employment decision, but it is common for injuries to have multiple proximate causes. <span class="Italic">See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain</span>, 542 U.S. 692, 704 (2004). Nor can the ultimate decisionmaker's judgment be deemed a superseding cause of the harm. A cause can be thought "superseding" only if it is a "cause of independent origin that was not foreseeable." <span class="Italic">Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc</span>., 517 U.S. 830, 837 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the approach urged upon us by Proctor gives an unlikely meaning to a provision designed to prevent employer discrimination. An employer's authority to reward, punish, or dismiss is often allocated among multiple agents. The one who makes the ultimate decision does so on the basis of performance assessments by other supervisors. Proctor's view would have the improbable consequence that if an employer isolates a personnel official from an employee's supervisors, vests the decision to take adverse employment actions in that official, and asks that official to review the employee's personnel file before taking the adverse action, then the employer will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommendations of supervisors that were designed and intended to produce the adverse action. That seems to us an implausible meaning of the text, and one that is not compelled by its words.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proctor suggests that even if the decisionmaker's mere exercise of independent judgment does not suffice to negate the effect of the prior discrimination, at least the decisionmaker's independent investigation (and rejection) of the employee's allegations of discriminatory animus ought to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We decline to adopt such a hard-and-fast rule. As we have already acknowledged, the requirement that the biased supervisor's action be a causal factor of the ultimate employment action incorporates the traditional tort-law concept of proximate cause. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Anza v. Ideal <span id="Page_705"></span>Steel Supply Corp</span>., 547 U.S. 451, 457-458 (2006); <span class="Italic">Sosa, supra</span>, at 703. Thus, if the employer's investigation results in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the supervisor's original biased action (by the terms of USERRA it is the employer's burden to establish that), then the employer will not be liable. But the supervisor's biased report may remain a causal factor if the independent investigation takes it into account without determining that the adverse action was, apart from the supervisor's recommendation, entirely justified. We are aware of no principle in tort or agency law under which an employer's mere conduct of an independent investigation has a claim-preclusive effect. Nor do we think the independent investigation somehow relieves the employer of "fault." The employer is at fault because one of its agents committed an action based on discriminatory animus that was intended to cause, and did in fact cause, an adverse employment decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">JUSTICE ALITO claims that our failure to adopt a rule immunizing an employer who performs an independent investigation reflects a "stray[ing] from the statutory text." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment). We do not understand this accusation. Since a supervisor is an agent of the employer, when he causes an adverse employment action the employer causes it; and when discrimination is a motivating factor in his doing so, it is a "motivating factor in the employer's action," precisely as the text requires. JUSTICE ALITO suggests that the employer should be held liable only when it "should be regarded as having delegated part of the decisionmaking power" to the biased supervisor. <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> But if the independent investigation relies on facts provided by the biased supervisor--as is necessary in any case of cat's-paw liability--then the employer (either directly or through the ultimate decisionmaker) will have effectively delegated the factfinding portion of the investigation to the biased supervisor. Contrary to JUSTICE ALITO's suggestion, the biased supervisor is not analogous to a witness at a bench trial. The mere witness is not an actor in the events that are the subject of the trial. The biased supervisor and the ultimate decisionmaker, however, acted as agents of the entity that the plaintiff seeks to hold liable; each of them possessed supervisory authority delegated by their employer and exercised it in the interest of their employer. In sum, we do not see how "fidelity to the statutory text," <span class="Italic">ibid</span>., requires the adoption of an independent-investigation defense that appears nowhere in the text. And we find both speculative and implausible JUSTICE ALITO's prediction that our Nation's employers will systematically disfavor members of the armed services in their hiring decisions to avoid the possibility of cat's-paw liability, a policy that would violate USERRA in any event.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore hold that if a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA.</p>
<p class="noindent">Justices Alito and Thomas joined in a concurring decision and Justice Kagan did not take part in the decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has since relied upon <span class="Italic">Staub</span> in finding that a postmaster with retaliatory animus influenced the supervisor taking the actions against the complainant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burruss v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100002 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Feder v. Attorney General</span>, 0720110014 (2012), the Commission distinguished two situations where the cat's paw theory applies--1) when a coworker has influence or leverage over the decisionmaker; and 2) when the decisionmaker acts as a conduit for a supervisor's prejudice:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under certain circumstances, the cat's paw theory of liability holds an employer liable for the animus of an employee or supervisor, who was not charged with making the ultimate employment decision. Our previous decisions have recognized the general principles underlying the cat's paw theory, but there has been no uniform standard for its application. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Isaac Smith v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0120073300.txt">0120073300</a> (Dec. 18, 2009); <span class="Italic">Deirdra Brown v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0420080016.brown-fleming_for_web_dating.txt">0120045121</a> (Dec. 20, 2006). Instead, our previous decisions have referenced two of the general approaches that the federal circuit courts have used to examine cat's paw liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--If a coworker had influence or leverage over the official decisionmaker, it is appropriate to impute the coworker's discriminatory attitudes to the official decisionmaker and hold the employer liable. <span class="Italic">See Russell v. McKinney Hospital Venture</span>, 235 F.3d 219, 226-227 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--If the official decisionmaker acted as a conduit of a supervisor's prejudice--his cat's paw--the employer is liable. <span class="Italic">See Shager v. Upjohn Company</span>, 913 F.2d 398 (7th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the "influence or leverage" standard, we find that the Regional Program Manager wielded sufficiently great informal power within the Agency to influence or leverage the ultimate deciding official, making it appropriate to impute the manager's retaliatory animus to the deciding official and to hold the Agency liable for retaliatory discrimination. The first-level manager testified that the Regional Program Manager had been "the boss" in the New York field office, and many people still went to him for advice and guidance. The first-level supervisor had the Regional Program Manager review his initial draft of the electronic correspondence, and he went along with the manager's addition of bullet point (6) because he "trusted" him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Besides adding bullet point (6) to the initial electronic communication, the Regional Program Manager influenced the removal proceedings in other ways. The first-level supervisor testified that headquarters would have been aware of any recommendations made by the Regional Program Manager because Regional Program Managers spoke daily with headquarters. Indeed, the emails in the record bear this out.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record includes an email by the deciding official, in which he states that the Regional Program Manager spoke with him and persuaded him to attempt to draft a cure letter for Complainant, rather than continue the adjudicative removal process. But even after the deciding official's supervisor ordered the investigation to continue, the Regional Program Manager persisted by emailing the deciding official that he had "briefed" Complainant's first and second-level supervisors on their options for creating a fair resolution of this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, even though the deciding official attempted to omit bullet point (6) from the investigation, the Regional Program Manager still managed to insert his testimony regarding bullet point (6) into the investigative report. The deciding official relied solely on the contents and recommendation of the investigative report.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Regional Program Manager was intimately involved in the adjudicative process, from partially drafting the document that instigated the proceedings to corresponding with the deciding official to participating in the investigation, we find that he influenced the deciding official enough to hold the Agency liable for the retaliatory animus of the Regional Program Manager.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, under the "conduit" standard, we find that the deciding official acted as the conduit of the Regional Program Manager's retaliatory animus against Complainant. The Regional Program Manager helped initiate the removal proceedings by adding bullet point (6) and convincing other officials within the New York field office to adopt this ground in their request to remove Complainant. In recommending to remove Complainant, the investigator relied, in part, on the Regional Program Manager's representations about Complainant's "problem" of reasonable accommodations, as reflected in the initial electronic communication. The deciding official concurred with the investigation's recommendation, which was based solely on the representations of the Regional Program Manager and Complainant's other accusers. Hence, we determine that the deciding official was the conduit of the Regional Program Manager's retaliatory animus against Complainant, and we find it appropriate to hold the Agency liable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We briefly note that after the AJ issued his decision in this case, and while this appeal was pending, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified the standard for evaluating "cat's paw" cases. In <span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1186 (2011), Vincent Staub sued his former employer under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, alleging that his termination was motivated by his employer's hostility to his military obligations. Although a human resources official, who made the decision to terminate, lacked such military hostility, her decision was influenced by his supervisors, who possessed enmity to his military obligations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1190.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Seventh Circuit held that under its "cat's paw" precedent, an employer is liable only if the nondecisionmaker exerted such "singular influence" over the decisionmaker that the decision to terminate was the product of "blind reliance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But if a decisionmaker is not wholly dependent on a single course of information and conducts her own investigation, then the decision to terminate is not the product of blind reliance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court rejected the "singular influence" test. Instead, it stated that the correct test to evaluate employer liability was twofold: (1) the supervisor performs an act motivated by discriminatory animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and (2) that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1194. "Proximate cause requires only 'some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged,' and excludes only those 'link[s] that are too remote, purely contingent, or indirect.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1192 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York</span>, 559 U.S. 1, _____, 130 S. Ct. 983, 989, 175 L. Ed.2d 943 (2010)). It is "causation substantial enough and close enough to the harm to be recognized by law." <span class="Italic">Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain</span>, 542 U.S. 692, 704 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court was not persuaded by the employer's argument that a decisionmaker's "independent investigation (and rejection) of the employee's allegations of discriminatory animus" automatically relieves the employer of fault. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1193. The Court explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]f the employer's investigation results in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the supervisor's original biased action. . .then the employer will not be liable. But the supervisor's biased report may remain a causal <span id="Page_706"></span>factor if the independent investigation takes it into account without determining that the adverse action was, apart from the supervisor's recommendation, entirely justified. . . .The employer is at fault because one of its agents committed an action based on discriminatory animus that was intended to cause, and did in fact cause, an adverse employment decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Commission declines to retroactively apply the <span class="Italic">Staub</span> test here, we note that the Agency's main argument on appeal, under <span class="Italic">Staub</span>, is that the independent investigation severed the causal connection between the Regional Program Manager's retaliatory animus and the deciding official's ultimate decision to terminate Complainant. Essentially, the Agency contends that the Regional Program Manager's animus was not a proximate cause of Complainant's termination because the independent investigation was an intervening superseding cause. We do not agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"A cause can be thought 'superseding' only if it is a 'cause of independent origin that was not foreseeable.'" <span class="Italic">Staub</span>, 131 S. Ct. at 1192 (quoting <span class="Italic">Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc.,</span> 517 U.S. 830, 837 (1996)). Here, the investigative report, on its face, explicitly incorporated and investigated all the grounds for removal that were proposed in the initial electronic communication, including bullet point (6). The investigative report included statements from the author of bullet point (6), whose comments principally focused on matters relating to bullet point (6). Because the investigative report took the statements of the Regional Program Manager into account without determining that removal was warranted apart from the Regional Program Manager's representations, we find the investigative report is not an intervening superseding cause that severed the causal connection.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. National Security Agency</span>, 0720120011 (2013) (noting that even if officials taking action did not have discriminatory animus cat's paw theory would impute liability to agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">Another good example of the application of the cat's paw theory is provided by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120120184 (2015), a reprisal case involving a nonselection:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no question that Complainant was highly qualified for the position. The average score of the panel members' ranking of the original application package resulted in Complainant being ranked highest and tied with the Selectee at a score of 20. ROI, Exhibit C10, p. 248. The record shows that all of the panel members marked Complainant high, and some ranked him the highest by a few points, except for S1 who ranked him lower than the other applicants. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 251. Had S1 not rated Complainant so low, his ranking would have been higher than the Selectees' ranking. The question now turns to whether Complainant's EEO activity played a role in the panel's decision not to select Complainant for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 stated in his affidavit that he became aware of Complainant's EEO activity after he did a Google search of Complainant's name. ROI, Exhibit B3, p. 147. Specifically, S1 stated that he learned through Google that Complainant filed an EEO complaint against an Agency official in the Agency's Palo Alto facility, and that Complainant was not successful in his complaint. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is worthy to note that S1 previously worked at the Agency's Palo Alto facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 stated that before the interviews he told the other panel members about Complainant's prior protected EEO activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 151. Other members of the panel confirmed that S1 told them about Complainant's prior EEO activity, and as a result Complainant's prior complaint against the Palo Alto VA was discussed during a meeting. ROI, Exhibit 132, p. 128. After the interviews, Complainant went from being the highest ranked applicant to the lowest ranked applicant. ROI, Exhibit C12, p. 260. While the Agency asserts that Complainant did not interview well, Complainant stated that his interview was great and most of the panelists responded to each of his answers with exclamations such as "excellent!"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ stated that mere knowledge of prior EEO activity, without more, is insufficient to establish reprisal discrimination. However the AJ did not refer to S1's sworn affidavit, where S1 stated that the panel took Complainant's EEO activity into consideration. Specifically, the following are S1's responses to the investigator's questions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Q:&#x2003;Did you discuss [Complainant's] EEO activity with the other members of the review panel?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A:&#x2003;Yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Q:&#x2003;What did you tell them?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A:&#x2003;That I Googled him and I had seen that he had filed an EEO complaint against the Palo Alto VA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Q:&#x2003;Do you think that was taken into consideration by the other panel members?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A:&#x2003;I think it's impossible to ignore, so, yes, I think it was taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ROI, Exhibit B3, p. 151.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This establishes that at least for S1, and more likely than not the whole panel, Complainant's prior protected EEO activity was taken into consideration when the decision was made to not refer Complainant to the selecting official. As a result, we find that the record establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the panel was motivated by retaliatory animus when they made the decision not to refer Complainant for the Statistician position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserted that it does not matter if the interview panel knew about Complainant's EEO activity because they did not make the final determination of who to select for the position. Further, the record reflects that the selecting official (S5) stated that he did not know about Complainant's prior protected EEO activity. ROI, Exhibit B6, p. 196.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we were to assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that S5 was unaware of S1's and the interview panel's retaliatory motivations, under the "cat's paw" theory, the Agency is still liable for the discrimination based on the discriminatory or retaliatory animus of an individual (or individuals) who greatly influences, but does not make, the ultimate employment decision and the Agency blindly relies on the individual's discriminatory assertions in making the ultimate employment decision. <span class="Italic">See Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1186 (2011); <span class="Italic">Jones v. National Security Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720120011 (June 11, 2013); <span class="Italic">Feder v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110014 (July 19, 2012). Here, the record shows that the interview panel selected only one applicant to refer to S5; the Selectee. As a result, the panel (including S1) dearly influenced, but did not make, the ultimate employment decision to not select Complainant for the position, and S5's decision to not select Complainant was based on reliance on the panel's biased recommendation. Therefore, the Agency is liable for the discrimination.</p>
