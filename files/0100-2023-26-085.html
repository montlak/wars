<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-83"><span class="space">10.</span> Nexus With Personnel Actions</h4>
<p class="noindent">With the broad range of agency actions that can form the basis of a retaliation complaint, it can be difficult to determine whether there is a nexus between proven retaliation and a particular personnel action. For example, assume a supervisor gives an employee a lower performance evaluation in retaliation for protected activity. Subsequently, the employee applies for a promotion. The offending supervisor is not involved in the selection process, but the selection panel or selecting official does have access to the performance appraisal. If the employee prevails on his or her complaint over the performance appraisal, one clear remedy is to correct the appraisal. Does the employee get the promotion? The answer to that depends on the nexus between the established retaliation and the personnel action at issue. There is no easy answer to the question. The answer is fact-dependent and the burden is on the complainant to establish that nexus.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pizzo v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720100027 (2010), the Commission found that the administrative judge properly found retaliation in the evaluation of the complainant's performance, but erred in not finding the retaliation extended to a subsequent nonselection for a permanent position. Because the question of the proper remedy is a function of establishing nexus and because nexus is a fact-dependent determination, the <span class="Italic">Pizzo</span> case doesn't give a bright-line rule, but does give some insight into resolution of the question:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant established that she filed a prior complaint in June 2007 regarding Supervisor 1's evaluations of her performance. The Branch Chief was well aware of the prior EEO complaint just months before she placed Complainant's case files on the shelves with a sign stating "Please Do Not Touch." We note that the prior complaint involved Supervisor 1's critical review of Complainant's work and the Branch Chief placed Complainant's <span id="Page_1534"></span>work on the shelves in order to review them to see if Supervisor 1's assessment of Complainant's work was accurate. Therefore, we find that there was a link between the placing of the cases on the selves and Complainant's prior protected activity. Complainant was not selected for a permanent Adjudications Officer position. As for the nexus, the record indicates that the Branch Chief was on the panel for the selection of the position in question. The Branch Chief cited Complainant's four shelves of backlogged cases as a significant reason for her ranking of Complainant in the selection process. Therefore, contrary to the Agency's arguments on appeal, we find a nexus between the prior complaint and the non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden shifts to the Agency to establish legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its action. The AJ properly determined that the Agency met its burden. As noted above, the record indicated that the Agency used the Rule of Three. The applicants were interviewed and ranked by the panelists. Complainant was not ranked high enough to be considered for the position. Based on a review of the record, we find that the Agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden now shifts to Complainant to establish that the Agency's reasons were pretext for discrimination. We note that the AJ found that Complainant failed to do so. However, the AJ continued her analysis to find that the Branch Chief who was one of the three members of the selection panel placed Complainant's caseload on the shelves and used her backlog to retaliate against Complainant. We find that the AJ should have used these findings of fact and law as related to the non-selection. The record clearly showed that the Branch Chief added her "personal knowledge" about Complainant in rating and ranking Complainant amongst the candidates for the position at issue. The first item listed by the Branch Chief was "4 Shelves of backlog cases." We also note that the AJ determined that the Branch Chief had provided no reason for keeping Complainant's cases past January 2008, when the Branch Chief had made changes to Complainant's performance evaluation for 2007. Further, the AJ found that comments made by the Branch Chief indicated that Complainant was a "poor" employee based on the backlog. As such, the AJ concluded that the backlog was an important consideration during the hiring process and that the other panel members received input from the Branch Chief regarding the backlog. The AJ then noted that Complainant's backlog was not out of the ordinary and noted that evidence in the record showed that backlog was a common problem not unique to Complainant. Accordingly, the AJ concluded that the Branch Chief used the backlog to in essence sabotage Complainant's efforts to gain permanent employment. The AJ believed that such action constituted unlawful retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the record supports the AJ's findings regarding the Branch Chief's use of the backlog to retaliate against Complainant. The AJ noted that Complainant never had a fair chance at getting selected for one of the positions available based on the Branch Chief's tainting of the selection process. Based on the AJ's conclusions, we find that the AJ should have taken this evidence and to establish that the Agency's reasons for not selecting Complainant were pretext for unlawful retaliation. Therefore, we conclude that Complainant has shown that she was subjected to unlawful retaliation when she was not selected for the Adjudications Officer position.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that in the <span class="Italic">Pizzo</span> case, the original offending management official was not part of the selection process, but the Branch Chief, who was also found to have a retaliatory motive, was involved. Although it is unclear, the case may have had a different outcome if the Branch Chief had not been directly involved in the selection.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar approach is used in disciplinary cases as demonstrated by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120134456 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant, who is actively engaged with the agency in disputing its compliance with an EEO settlement agreement at the time an adverse action is issued, may be able to establish a temporal nexus between his prior EEO activity and an adverse employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The application of the Agency's misconduct and behavior policies would be legitimate if warranted here. However, the Agency does not provide any explanation for why Complainant was issued the proposed removal nearly two months after the May 3 incident when even the most basic of inquiries would have verified Complainant's explanation to S1 that he was sent on a break by Maintenance Control and had informed a supervisor that his radio was defective. This was later verified by the maintenance control official who provided him with the new battery. For this very reason, the proposed removal was rescinded as soon as Complainant filed a grievance on the matter. Moreover, there is nothing in the record that shows that the Agency's mail processing systems were harmed by the seven minute delay at issue when Complainant was on his break.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also provides no credible reason for why Complainant was ordered to leave the premises and placed on administrative leave after being served with the notice of proposed removal. It appears that the more common practice at the Agency was for employees to continue working during the time between a proposed disciplinary action and its effective date. Inexplicably, the final agency decision indicates that Complainant was placed on administrative leave prior to his removal taking effect because his management was "fearful that he may injure himself in the final days prior to his removal." The evidence of record provides absolutely no evidence to support this claim. Pretext may be demonstrated by showing the weaknesses and inconsistencies in the Agency's proffered reasons for its action that a reasonable fact-finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence. We find that it is just as likely that S1 placed Complainant on administrative leave to intimidate him due to his prior EEO activity, knowing that the facts would not support the proposed removal and it would eventually be rescinded.</p>

Attorney General</span>, 0720110014 (2012) (apply "cat's paw" theory to retaliation claim); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120110544 (2013) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that another employee who has not engaged in protected activity does not preclude a complainant from establishing a nexus between her own protected activity and the action at issue. For example, in <span class="Italic">Mohammadi v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720110019 (2011), the Commission upheld a finding of retaliation where the complainant, a nurse, complained that she was being harassed by a supervisor because of her Muslim religion. The agency subsequently reassigned both the complainant and the supervisor to different units. In finding that the reassignment of the supervisor in <span class="Italic">Mohammadi</span> did not preclude a finding of retaliation, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the Agency's arguments to the contrary, the evidence of record clearly supports the AJ's determination that Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation. The AJ determined that Complainant engaged in protected activity when she sent a letter to management complaining, among other things, the RN2 told other coworkers that Complainant had participated in a meeting concerning a January 2006 dispute between the two of them with a "Muslim attitude." In essence, Complainant was lodging a complaint with management of religious harassment. Management concedes that the decision to reassign Complainant was made, at least in part, because of Complainant's allegations about RN2's harassment. This clearly establishes a nexus between the protected activity and the reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that its witnesses rebutted any inference of retaliatory animus raised by Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The Agency argues that both employees (Complainant and RN2) were accusing each other of harassment and since management was unable to determine who was at fault, the decision was made to reassign both of them. However, substantial evidence supports the AJ's determination that this was not the reason given by one of the responsible management officials during the investigation of the complaint. Rather, the Associate Chief Nurse, who claimed she learned of Complainant's hostile environment claim through her letter and during a meeting, said that because the whole unit could not be moved, she recommended moving Complainant to a new environment. However, because she thought just moving Complainant would appear retaliatory, she recommended reassigning both Complainant and RN2. Therefore, the evidence of record supports the AJ's determination that management made the decision to reassign Complainant as a knee-jerk reaction to her allegations of discriminatory harassment, interpreting these allegations as a sign that she could not get along with the entire unit. This evidence is sufficient to support the AJ's finding that unlawful retaliation played a role in the decision to reassign Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Denise Y. v. Secretary Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120150665 (2018), the complainant alleged reprisal when she was terminated from a podiatry residential program and later terminated from employment with the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Denise Y</span>. inferred nexus from the agency's explanation for the terminations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant previously contacted an EEO Counselor on May 31, 2011. Director S1 became aware of Complainant's initiation of the EEO process on June 6, 2011. On August 4, 2011, Complainant filed an EEO complaint in which she alleged that the Agency had subjected her to a hostile work environment on the basis of reprisal, listing incidents dating from November 2009 through October 2011, and including claims that she had been placed in LWOP status on July 5, 2011 without her authorization, and that on October 7, 2011, Director S1 failed to provide Complainant with a Certification of Completion of Residency Podiatry Medicine and Surgery. Complainant's claimed initial protected EEO activity consisted of her earlier complaints to Director S1 concerning her claim of harassment by a co-worker and discrimination based on her national origin. She also claimed that Director S1 created a hostile work environment by encouraging such discrimination in the workplace. In <span class="Italic">[</span><span class="Italic"> </span><span class="Italic">] v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120703 (April 10, 2012), the Commission reversed the Agency's dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim, and remanded the matter for processing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that Complainant engaged in protected EEO activity when she complained to Director S1 about harassment by a co-worker <span id="Page_1535"></span>and discrimination based on national origin prior to May 31, 2011. At the very least her previous EEO activity occurred on May 31, 2011, when she initiated EEO counseling regarding the multiple incidents of an alleged hostile work environment, as enumerated in the complaint at issue in EEOC Appeal No. 0120120703. That complaint was being processed during the period at issue in the instant complaint, which concerns Complainant's termination from the Podiatry Program and from the Agency. We find that Director S1 and S2 were aware of Complainant's EEO activity. We find the necessary nexus between Complainant's prior EEO complaint and the two termination actions, in that the reason given for the terminations was Complainant's "unauthorized absences" from the workplace, which were due to her not being given assignments, and not being placed in the rotation schedule which was sent out on June 15, 2011, within 2 weeks of Director S1 becoming aware of her protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Denise Y</span>. further found that the agency's articulated reasons for the personnel actions were a pretext for reprisal. Notable to the Commission was the agency's lack of documentation and supportive evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argued that she was the only podiatry resident who did not receive a schedule and that her supervisory chain refused to assign her any clinical or surgical work. Complainant emphasized that the Agency refused to produce a copy of the 2011-2012 academic year work/rotation schedule when requested by the EEO Investigator. A review of the complaint file and report of investigation, including the supplemental report of investigation, shows that the Agency did not produce the rotation schedule for the 2011-2012 academic year, which began on July 1, 2011. Although the email from Director S1 is included in the report of investigation showing that Complainant was sent the schedule, the actual schedule was not provided. The Agency has therefore not shown that Complainant was assigned any work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When asked by the investigator why she believed that Director S1 and S2 had retaliated against her when they terminated her, Complainant replied, "it was clearly evident that from May 31, 2011, when I filed my complaint (contacted an EEO counselor on the prior complaint), everything quickly went downhill." IR 104-06. Complainant also asserted that Director S1 told another resident that if he supported Complainant in anyway, his job would be in jeopardy. The EEO Investigator contacted this resident to obtain an affidavit regarding Complainant's claim, but he refused to testify.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant claims that she reported to work several times after completing the research project she was assigned, namely after June 22, 2011. She was told there was no work for her. The Agency does not provide any convincing reason why Complainant was not simply informed of the rotation schedule at these times and sent to perform her duties. The Agency does not provide any convincing reason why Complainant's self-arranged assignment at Hospital A was not permitted and why she was told to report to the Baltimore Medical Center instead but then not given any assignments. Complainant was under the understanding that she was in a LWOP status, but the Agency had placed her in an AWOL status. Complainant's response to the Agency's proposed letter of termination is not included in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has shown that the Agency's reasons for her removal from the Podiatry residency program and from the Agency, that she had been in an unauthorized leave status and refused to report to work, were pretext for discrimination based on reprisal.</p>
