<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-142"><span class="space">5.</span> Requests for Updated Medical Information</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a medical condition is not permanent and stable, it may be job-related and consistent with business necessity for an agency to seek periodic updates of medical information. That is particularly true if the employee's medical condition or position changes. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hoang v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130454 (2013), the complainant was a distribution clerk who had been accommodated due to gout and a heart condition. He then suffered a heart attack at work and, subsequent to returning, bid on a mail processing clerk position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In response, the agency awarded him the bid conditioned on his providing updated medical information indicating he could perform the essential function of the job or would be able to within six months. The complainant provided additional information but it did not contain information about when, it at all, his medical restrictions would be lifted. The agency sent him home on a few days because it did not have work within his restrictions and ultimately rescinded the bid award. In finding there was no failure to accommodate in <span class="Italic">Hoang</span>, the Commission also explained that the agency's request for medical documentation was justified:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record shows that Complainant had been working under medical restrictions due to gout and heart disease since 2002 and the Agency had been accommodating those restrictions during that period. Complainant suffered a physical injury at work on January 10, 2009 and was released to work with a new restriction dated January 14, 2009 barring him from using his right hand. On a date unspecified in the record Complainant applied for the position of Mail Processing Clerk. Prior to being awarded the position, however, Complainant was notified on February 21, 2009 that he was "currently unable to perform the full duties of the [new] position" and was asked to provide medical documentation showing that he could perform the duties of the position. The letter further notified Complainant,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If you fail to provide the requested medical documentation, you will remain in your current assignment and the next senior bidder shall be declared the senior bidder. If you submit the required medical documentation, are awarded the assignment, but fail to recover within the six-month period or the extended six month period, you will become an unassigned regular and the assignment will be reposted for bid.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Acting Operations Support Specialist (AOSS: no claimed disability) averred that the reason she sent the request was because when a senior bidder shows up on the light or limited duty roster, I must require a medical to see if he can perform the requirements of the position....I awarded [Complainant] the [position] provided that he would fully perform the duties of the position within [six] months."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 25, 2009, Complainant's medical documentation showed that he was restricted from lifting more than eight lbs. continuously or 15 lbs. intermittently with either hand, standing for more than 1/2 hour continuously or three hours intermittently, walking for more than one hour continuously or two hours intermittently, or sitting for more than 4 hours continuously or 6 hours intermittently. We note that the February 2009 medical form did not provide a date indicating when Complainant would be able to perform full work duties. Despite this, however, on or about March 2, 2009, Complainant was awarded the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Manager of Distribution Operations (MDO1: no claimed disability) averred that she sent Complainant home on March 5, 2009 "because the medical documentation he provided was incomplete. It did not have dates on it." Complainant returned to work on March 8, 2009 and, <span id="Page_1243"></span>according to the Supervisor of Distribution Operations (SDO, no claimed disability) "he was told to go home because there was no work for him within his restrictions." Complainant similarly averred that "they sent me home stating that they did not have eight hours of work for me based on my restrictions." A dispute ensued during which Complainant suffered a heart attack at work and he was off work recuperating for over a month, until April 13, 2009. Complainant applied for retirement on April 15, 2009, which became effective May 5, 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following a review of the record we find that Complainant has not shown he was denied a reasonable accommodation. We note that when making an accommodation request, an employee is not required to use the "magic" words "reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Enforcement Guidance), EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002) at Q.1. Instead, the employee need only inform the Agency that he or she needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Triplett-Graham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120044720 (February 24, 2006). However in the instant case, as previously noted, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Agency was aware of Complainant's claimed disability because it had already been accommodating Complainant since 2002 by giving him light duty assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note, however, that an employer is permitted to seek documentation where it is necessary to determine that the individual has a covered disability for which the requested accommodation is necessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.14; <span class="Italic">Ross v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01982798 (August 2, 2001). Complainant maintained that he had been under the same restrictions since 2002 but we note that employers are entitled to request periodic medical updates since medical conditions can change. Furthermore, Complainant had incurred a work injury on January 10, 2009 and he had also just been offered a new position, so again the Agency was entitled to request updated medical information regarding his current medical limitations and how they affected his new position. We note in this regard that MDO1 averred that she sent Complainant home "because the medical documentation he provided was incomplete. It did not have dates on it." Affidavit E, p. 5, and the record shows that the copy of Complainant's February 25, 2009 medical documentation does not provide a date to indicate how long his restrictions were expected to last. An employer is entitled to seek such information. Furthermore, where an employee fails, as here, to provide reasonable documentation requested by the employer, then that employer is not entitled to a reasonable accommodation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we further find that Complainant failed to identify any reasonable accommodation he requested that the Agency failed to provide. We note that Complainant states that he resigned from the Agency because he had exhausted his paid leave balance and could not afford to remain unpaid so he resigned in order to access his retirement funds. Even though Complainant did not explicitly request leave as a reasonable accommodation, the Agency did not deny Complainant the use of leave. The Agency was under no obligation to provide him with additional paid leave once his paid leave had run out.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Velva B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720160006 (2017), the agency rolled out a program meant to, per the agency, ensure that all injured-on-duty employees, who were either in limited-duty or rehabilitation status, were performing mission critical work for the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Velva B</span>. found an unlawful disability-related medical inquiry when the agency gathered the standard workers' compensation forms of injured-on-duty employees and requested updated medical information for those employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A covered entity shall not make inquiries of an employee as to the nature or severity of the disability unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. 42 U.S.C. 12112(d)(4)(A); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13. The Americans with Disabilities Act, which applies to federal employees pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 prohibits disability-related inquiries, including inquires as to the nature and severity of a disability, unless such inquiries are shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance of Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 27, 2000). Furthermore, the restriction applies to all employees, not just those who can establish that they are qualified individuals with disabilities. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dept. of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131126 (Dec. 19, 2013); <span class="Italic">Hartless v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120101017 (June 4, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An inquiry is disability-related if it is likely to elicit information about a disability. <span class="Italic">See Torres v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120061190 (Feb. 6, 2008) (supervisor's contact with complainant's physician as to whether complainant could do his physical therapy at a VA medical center not job-related and consistent with business necessity); <span class="Italic">Chambliss v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A21179 (Mar. 19, 2003) (supervisor asking complainant to announce at staff meeting that she required hospitalization for bi-polar disorder not job-related and consistent with business necessity). Disability-related inquiries include asking employees to provide medical documentation regarding their disabilities. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at Question 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted extensively above, in Phase 1 of the NRP, teams gathered and scrutinized the medical records of over 100,000 IOD employees. Those records included statements of diagnoses and prognoses, Form CA-17's and other forms required by the Department of Labor for the purpose of obtaining workers' compensation benefits. According to a memorandum template entitled, "National Reassessment Process Phase 1," the goal of the process was to ensure that all limited duty and rehabilitation employees have "a current medical on file," and that teams of management members from operations, medical, labor relations, and injury compensation would be established to complete this process. Step 5 of Phase 1 required medical staff to review such information from treating physicians as diagnosis and type of injury, and to direct employees to provide medical updates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The form-letters and scripts mandated by the NRP leadership group at the Agency's headquarters explicitly called for IOD employees to be warned that if they did not submit updated medical information within two weeks of the request, their modified limited-duty and rehabilitation assignments might be withdrawn. Step 6 of Phase 1 required that managers determine appropriate action to be taken for those employees who fail to comply with requests for updated medical information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The inquiries carried out in accordance with Phase 1 of the NRP were not merely "likely" to elicit information about IOD employees' disabilities; they were guaranteed to elicit that information. The WCO Director himself confirmed the extensiveness of the NRP's recordkeeping operations and the thoroughness of its records. He described how a comprehensive file was maintained for each IOD employee that included anything related to the injury, including medical updates, from the time the injury was sustained until the present. He emphasized that the medical documentation was key to everything that was done with the IOD' employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no question that Phase 1 of the NRP meets the statutory definition of a disability-related medical inquiry. Indeed, by the WCO Director's own admission, this medical inquiry was part and parcel of the NRP; in fact, it was the NRP's central element. As such, it must be job-related and consistent with business necessity to be considered lawful. A disability-related medical inquiry is justified if the employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence that: an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries</span>, Question 5. Objective evidence is reliable information, either directly observed or provided by a credible third party that an employee may have or has a medical condition that will interfere with his or her ability to perform essential functions of the job or will result in a direct threat. <span class="Italic">O'Malley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal. No. 01994945 (Sept. 26, 2002) <span class="Italic">citing Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992683 (Nov. 21, 2001). <span class="Italic">See also Estate of Schauf v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A42440 (Jan. 26, 2006), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A60456 (Mar. 17, 2006); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120559 (Mar. 10, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not enough for a management official to merely suspect that an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job or poses a direct threat when ordering a medical inquiry. Such suspicions must be supported by enough documentation to establish that they are reasonable under the circumstances that the situation presents. Those responsible for implementing Phase 1 of the NRP based their inquiries solely on the status of the IOD employees as limited-duty or rehabilitation, without any evidence that those employees were not performing the essential functions of their positions or that they posed a direct threat to themselves or others by remaining in their positions. The Class Agent, the other anecdotal witnesses, and presumably the other class members were performing the essential functions of their positions when they were asked to submit medical documentation pursuant to steps 5 and 6 of Phase 1. Therefore, the Agency has not shown that Phase 1 of the NRP was job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, while operating under the auspices of Phase 1 of the NRP, the HHR Manager, the WCO Director, and other Agency officials who supported and assisted in implementing that program violated Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates by reference Section 102(d)(4)(A) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by subjecting IOD employees assessed under the NRP to a disability-related medical inquiry that was not job-related and consistent with business necessity. We conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists on this issue that would warrant a hearing. To be eligible for relief at the remedies stage of this proceeding, class members must show that they suffered compensable harm as a result of being subjected to the unlawful disability-related medical inquiry for which damages may <span id="Page_1244"></span>be awarded. The Class Agent is eligible for immediate relief, having established that she was subjected to an unlawful disability-related medical inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency was not entitled to additional medical documentation linking the complainant's disability to his accommodation request, in <span class="Italic">Jody L. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120151351 (2018), where the Commission found that a 2003 doctor's note already at the agency's disposal provided a "workable definition," and that was enough to trigger the agency's duty to engage in the interactive process. The complainant, who required a wheelchair for mobility, had, for years under his prior supervisor, teleworked both on a scheduled and recurring basis and on a situational basis when inclement weather made his commute to work prohibitively difficult. The complainant, in <span class="Italic">Jody L</span>., explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant states that he requested situational telework because it is too dangerous during extremely cold temperatures to be out because his wheelchair lift freezes and he often cannot get into his vehicle. He also explains that it is very difficult and exhausting for him to transfer from wheelchair to vehicle, then drive 50 miles, transfer from vehicle to wheelchair, push through the snow or severe cold to get into the building, and then repeat this process to go home. In addition, it is prohibitively dangerous to commute in extreme cold weather because he could develop frostbite without knowing it as he cannot feel anything below his chest.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Complainant's new supervisor in <span class="Italic">Jody L</span>. requested a "clearer definition of the type of inclement that would trigger the option to telework" to gain a more fulsome understanding of how bad weather was tied to his physical disabilities, rather than the condition of his equipment. The complainant's request for situational telework was, thereafter, denied. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that the new supervisor in <span class="Italic">Jody L</span>. was entitled more information, noting that the complainant had already provided the supervisor with a "workable definition":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 asserts that Complainant asked about working at home during inclement weather conditions, and S1 responded that he would consider reasonable accommodations based on a physician's recommendations, but the only documentation he had at that time was the medical letter dated March 14, 2003. S1 states that he did not recall Complainant specifically asking to modify his telework agreement on March 15 or 18, 2013, and asserts that no "formal request" for situational telework was made prior to March 27, 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S2 also asserts that Complainant never "officially" requested to telework on a situational basis. According to S2, there were several informal discussions and e-mails between S1 and Complainant but not an "actual" request to work a situational work schedule. S2 further testified that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I believe that [S1] did not deny [Complainant's] request for a different telework schedule, but informed [Complainant] that he needed medical documentation stating what weather conditions warranted [Complainant] working from home. I also believe that [S1] wanted to establish some tangible bad weather conditions that the doctor said would make it hard for [Complainant] to come to work because of his physical disabilities, not because of the condition of [Complainant's] equipment. I believe [S1] relayed this to [Complainant] in late 2012/early 2013. [Complainant] did not comply with his request and did not bring in any documentation from the doctor that described what actual weather conditions would make it difficult for [Complainant] to come to work because of his physical disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an individual decides to request accommodation, the individual or his/her representative must let the employer know that s/he needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. To request accommodation, an individual may use 'plain English' and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase "reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">See</span> Accommodation Guidance, Question 1. Complainant did not need to "officially" request an accommodation, it was enough that he asked for a modification to his usual schedule due to the hazardous conditions and the risk to his health.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence in the record supports the finding that Complainant, in fact, requested an accommodation to telework on a situational basis during inclement weather (which he had defined as any temperature below -20 degrees). We find S1 and S2's explanations for not granting Complainant's request lack credibility. First, we find it unlikely that after years of teleworking during inclement weather that Complainant would not have raised it with his new supervisor when he called him on that first below-twenty-degree day in January 2013 when Complainant stayed at home. Based upon the evidence in the record, it seems likely that this discussion was the reason S1 felt the need to create a written telework agreement shortly thereafter. The record shows that on February 7, 2013, shortly after January 29, 2013 (i.e. the first event/denial at issue), a written telework agreement was created and executed by both S1 and Complainant officially permitting Complainant to work at home on Tuesdays and Thursdays on a recurring basis. However, the telework agreement did not address the issue of situational telecommuting options, and Complainant objected to this omission in an email to S1 on February 13, 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1's testimony is unclear as to when he asserts that Complainant requested a situational telework arrangement. However, based upon the totality of the evidence, it is not credible that Complainant failed to request an accommodation in late January 2013 or early February 2013. In addition, assuming S2's testimony is accurate that S1 requested a clearer definition of the type of inclement weather that would trigger the option to work from home, we find that Complainant provided a workable definition. Complainant consistently affirmed that he requested flexibility when the temperatures were below negative 20 degrees. In addition, the documentary evidence shows that S1 acknowledged the weather conditions in which Complainant was seeking more flexibility as being "below -20 degrees." Based on this evidence and various inconsistencies in S1's testimony, we find that it is unlikely that S1 required additional medical documentation to support Complainant's need for the requested accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of the interactive process, an employer may ask an individual for reasonable documentation about that person's disability and functional limitations when the disability or need for accommodation is not obvious. Accommodation Guidance pp. 12-13 (October 17, 2002). While the record is devoid of documentary evidence that S1, in fact, requested medical documentation, such a request would have been improper as the need for the accommodation in this case was obvious. <span class="Italic">See Iliana S. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120081848 (Oct. 13, 2015) (finding that the complainant's need to use the elevator during a fire drill was obvious since her disability made it difficult to walk). We find that the 2003 letter from Complainant's physician establishes that Complainant faced difficult challenges in commuting because of his disability and was the basis for establishing the need to telecommute on a regular basis. Since the record supports the fact that Complainant's disability causes significant difficulty in commuting during the best of circumstances, it is certainly obvious that extreme weather would increase the level of difficulty in Complainant's commute, which Complainant explained to S1. Specifically, the record supports the finding that Complainant explained to S1 that the lift on his motor vehicle freezes in temperatures below -20 degrees. When this occurs, Complainant is unable to get into his vehicle. Complainant also explained to S1 that there is a substantial risk of frostbite in having to commute in such extreme cold temperatures, since he is unable to detect the warning signs of frostbite (e.g., extreme cold, prickling, and/or numbness in extremities).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The undisputed record shows that the situational telework accommodation was an effective accommodation and that such an accommodation did not present an undue burden on the Agency as the record shows that Complainant had been provided this accommodation for years prior to the time-frame at issue herein and Complainant had been performing the duties of his position in a satisfactory manner throughout his tenure with the Agency. Finally, we remind the Agency that the federal government is charged with the goal of being a "model employer" of individuals with disabilities, which may require it to consider innovation, fresh approaches, and technology as effective methods of providing reasonable accommodations. <span class="Italic">Rowlette v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A10816 (Aug. 1, 2003); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(a). We believe that providing Complainant with this reasonable accommodation furthers this goal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the assertion that Complainant failed to provide medical documentation, the Agency argues that it accommodated Complainant by permitting him the use of his accrued leave on the dates at issue. While an employer may choose between effective accommodation, forcing an employee to take leave when another accommodation would permit an employee to continue working is not an effective accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Denese v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016) <span class="Italic">citing, Mamola v. Group Mfg. Serv., Inc.,</span> 2010 WL 1433491 (D. Ariz., Apr. 9, 2010) (unpaid leave may not be a reasonable accommodation when an employee specifically requests another accommodation that would allow him or her to perform the essential functions of the position without missing work); and <span class="Italic">Woodson v. Int'l Bus. Machines, Inc</span>., 2007 WL 4170560 at 5 (N.D. Cal., Nov. 19, 2007) (leave is sufficient as a reasonable accommodation only if other accommodations in a job would be ineffective). In this case, the Agency failed to provide Complainant with the effective accommodation that would have allowed him to continue working. Accordingly, we agree that permitting Complainant the option of using accumulated leave instead of the option of teleworking during inclement weather was not an effective accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based upon the record, we find that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it denied Complainant the option of working from home on days when the temperature is below negative twenty degrees.</p>
