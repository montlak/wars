<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-84"><span class="space">3.</span> Contumacious Conduct</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has now issued many decisions involving sanctions against complainants. Those decisions make it clear that the ultimate sanction against a complainant--dismissal of his or her complaint--may not be imposed without a showing of contumacious conduct on the part of the complainant. Such a sanction is rarely upheld on appeal, particularly if the investigative record is adequate for the agency to issue a decision on the merits of the claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brant C. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120161941 (2016). For example, in <span class="Italic">Diedre A. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120162690 (2018), the Commission reversed dismissal of the complainant's complaint where, at the hearing, the complainant stated "I want to go to a court," "I'm done," and "I can't do this no more," and proceeded to exit the hearing room before the hearing was over. This did not constitute contumacious conduct, according to the Commission, <span id="Page_617"></span>and the proper sanction was to dismiss the complainant's hearing request and remand the complaint to the agency for a final decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Alfred S. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120140900 (2017), the Commission did uphold the dismissal of a complaint for discovery related contumacious conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that Complainant has engaged in contumacious conduct. Complainant, who is an attorney, purposefully failed to respond to the Agency's discovery requests for more than a year, significantly delaying the hearing process. Moreover, Complainant had been sanctioned with the dismissal of his hearing request by the same AJ for the same conduct before. Additionally, it cannot be said that the Agency was not prejudiced by Complainant's conduct, as the Agency was forced to cancel its scheduled depositions multiple times. Most significantly, as justification for his failure to respond to the Agency's Request for Production, Complainant admitted to destroying relevant evidence by deleting emails. Not only does this explanation not justify Complainant's failure to respond to the Agency's discovery requests, this explanation demonstrates a blatant disregard for the EEO process and amounts to contumacious conduct. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion by the AJ in dismissing the complaint based on Complainant's contumacious conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jane R. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019005264 (2020), cited multiple decisions where dismissal was upheld for contumacious conduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e have consistently held in recent decisions that dismissal of a hearing request as a sanction is only appropriate in extreme circumstances. One such circumstance is when the complainant engages in contumacious conduct, not merely negligence. <span class="Italic">Cassey B. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019004838 (Sept. 24, 2020); <span class="Italic">Cecile T. v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019002373 (Sept. 22, 2020); <span class="Italic">Carolyn M. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 2019004843 (March 10, 2020). Examples of contumacious conduct warranting dismissal of hearing requests include: <span class="Italic">Charlie K. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019002293 (Sept. 22, 2020) (failure to provide investigative affidavit during agency investigation and failure to provide answers to interrogatories during discovery despite being granted multiple extensions in both phases of the proceeding, as well as failure to appear at pre-hearing conference); and <span class="Italic">Cleo S. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120181406 (Feb. 28, 2020) (failure to participate in email communications being sought by the Agency and to produce documentation ordered by AJ in a manner demonstrating disregard for administrative process and unwillingness to comply with AJ's orders despite warning of consequences). Absent a showing of contumacious conduct, hearing requests may be dismissed where the complainant fails to pursue his or her claim with due diligence. <span class="Italic">Alice S. v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 2019002475 (Sept. 22, 2020) (failure to respond to emails from AJ that included initial conference order and order to show cause due to overlooking those emails); <span class="Italic">Robert A. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120182698 (Feb. 21, 2020) (failure to respond to order to show cause despite having received order from AJ via email, and failure to provide evidence that he was incapacitated and unable to comply with the order).</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of contumacious conduct warranting dismissal of the complaint as a sanction is provided by <span class="Italic">Schoenrogge v. Attorney General</span>, 0120130893 (2013). In addition to failing to comply with discovery orders issued by the administrative judge, the complainant left some 20 voice mail messages for the administrative judge filling her voice mailbox. The messages contained "lewd and vulgar" statements as well as substantive comments about the case. Agency counsel also received some 50 minutes of similar voice mail messages from the complainant. The agency contacted Federal Protective Services about the messages and both FPS and local police became involved. In upholding dismissal with prejudice as a sanction in <span class="Italic">Schoenrogge</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An AJ has the authority to sanction either party for failure without good cause shown to fully comply with an order. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). The sanctions available to an AJ for failure to provide requested relevant information include an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information, exclusion of other evidence offered by the party refusing to provide the requested information, or issuance of a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party. <span class="Italic">See Hale v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). Sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. A sanction may be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his or her discretion to impose a harsher sanction. Dismissal of a complaint by an AJ as a sanction is only appropriate in extreme circumstances, where the complainant has engaged in contumacious conduct, not simple negligence. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01870232 (March 4, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record in this case, we find that under the circumstances presented here, it has been established that Complainant engaged in contumacious conduct as set forth in the AJ's decision. Repeatedly refusing to comply with the AJ's discovery orders despite a number of chances and warnings concerning the possibility of sanctions, as well as the numerous inappropriate voice messages to the AJ and the Agency requiring the intervention of FPS and the local police, was clearly contumacious conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Josiah M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019003865 (2020) (upholding hearing dismissal for contumacious conduct where the complainant was "disruptive, disrespectful, and threatening" during a prehearing conference).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Hooker v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120122165 (2013), the Commission noted that the administrative judge "showed admirable restraint in not dismissing Complainant's complaint outright" where the complainant repeatedly engaged in threatening and disrespectful conduct directed at both the judge and the agency representative, ignored multiple orders, requested that the judge criminally prosecute the agency representative and the complainant had also been sanction by a U.S. district court judge for similar conduct in a related civil action over his removal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Contumacious conduct has a high bar. For instance, demonstrating the height of absurdity in not dismissing a case outright was <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0210113936 (2012). Having already had a number of his cases dismissed for abuse of process, see <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec3-1">Chapter 3</a>, the complainant had a number of consolidated cases each involving numerous nonselection and other perceived wrongs. He was under previous orders by the administrative judge to stop filing frivolous and caustic motions, but persisted in filing motions calling into question the integrity of everyone from the judge assigned to his case to EEOC, MSPB and district court judges generally, as well as agency counsel. Once again, the Commission upheld the sanction of cancelation of the hearing and remand for a final agency decision. And, thus, the agency was required to expend time on the final agency decision and defending the appeal while the Commission wasted yet more time on the appeals. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Joette R. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 120171810 (2017) (declining to impose sanctions for abuse of process where the complainant filed 91 complaints in less than a month, but it appeared that her actions were based on a misunderstanding of the EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120110405 (2012), the Commission got really tough warning:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note our support for the Order of the Supervisory AJ, issued on September 8, 2010, in which she admonished Complainant for his use of inflammatory language with respect to the AJ and the Agency Counsel. Complainant has consistently flouted Orders from various AJs in the Baltimore Field Office to refrain from attacks on the Agency Counsel and on the AJs. We have previously affirmed the decisions of the AJs in their respective cases to dismiss Complainant's hearing requests, and remand for a final agency decision on the record, when he failed to use respectful language when arguing the merits of his complaints. <span class="Italic">See Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120110398, 0120110400, 0120110401, 0120110402, 0120110403, 0120110404 (Jan. 27, 2012); <span class="Italic">Y. Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0120113931-0120113936 (Oct. 11, 2012). Complainant is reminded that it is possible to be an effective advocate for his own position without disparaging the character of the other parties involved, and that he is better served by showing some restraint in that regard. Complainant is put on notice that we will not hesitate to affirm dismissals of hearing requests for any of Complainant's pending complaints if he continues to use such disrespectful language and to make unfounded accusations against Agency Counsel and Commission AJs.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Burns v. Postmaster General,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a52445.txt">01A52445</a> (2005), the Commission did uphold the sanction of dismissal based on a finding that the complainant engaged in contumacious conduct. However, the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Burns</span> gives a good idea of how far the complainant must to warrant such a sanction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that complainant did not provide an affidavit during the investigation of his complaint. Instead, he submitted a series of documents which were placed in the investigative file. Complainant requested a hearing and the case was assigned to an EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) in the Indianapolis District Office. On October 5, 2004, the AJ issued an acknowledgment and scheduling order that: (1) scheduled a pre-hearing telephone conference for November 23, 2004, at 1:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> (Indiana time); (2) scheduled the hearing for January 25, 2005; and (3) provided that the discovery period would end on December 4, 2004.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 20, 2004, the agency sent complainant a set of interrogatories and a request for the production of documents. The agency agreed to extend the 15 day response period to November 29, 2004. Also, on October 20, 2004, complainant filed a motion for sanctions against the agency. Complainant, among other things, maintained that (1) the agency processed his complainant in an untimely manner, and (2) the $21,774.67 he received from OPM as a retroactive disability retirement payment was incorrect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 25, the agency submitted a pre-hearing report which included a list of its witnesses. Complainant objected to the agency's proposed <span id="Page_618"></span>witnesses and the proposed location for the hearing. Complainant also argued that the AJ should postpone the hearing until after his pending civil action against the agency in Federal District court (civil action), was decided. According to complainant, certain witnesses could be impeached and barred from testifying in the EEO case because of their alleged improper testimony in a prior EEO case (EEO Case #1), which was now the subject of the civil action. Complainant also maintained that he would feel intimidated and disadvantaged if the hearing were held at a postal facility. On November 3, complainant was notified that the agency would take his deposition at the Bloomington, Indiana mail processing plant on November 30, 2004. Complainant notified the agency that he could not attend the deposition on that date. Therefore, the parties agreed that, on December 1, 2004, at 1:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> central time, complainant would be deposed by telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 10, complainant filed his second motion for sanctions. He accused the agency's representative of making a false statement in her pre-hearing report when she stated that she had no knowledge that complainant had any pending formal complaints. Complainant also accused the agency's representative of "consorting" with the U.S. Attorney who was assigned to his civil action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 12, complainant sent the agency a discovery request seeking, among other things, all leave records from 1999 through October 23, 2003, the names of those employees who have diabetes, heart related problems, mental related ailments, and other disabling medical situations that require clearance by a postal physician before the subject is allowed to return to work, and FMLA documentation regarding complainant held by the manager-in-charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 24, complainant filed his third motion for sanctions. He asked that the agency and its representative be sanctioned because the representative failed to abide by the scheduling order because she placed the pre-hearing conference call at 2:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, Indiana time, not 1:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 24, 2004, complainant filed a Motion for a Change of Venue, which was in effect a request for a new Administrative Judge. Complainant maintained that the AJ was biased against him because (1) she refused to approve the witnesses that he submitted; and (2) she failed to rule on any of his motions for sanctions. On November 30, the AJ, among other things, rejected nineteen (19) of complainant's proposed witnesses because their testimony was not relevant to the allegations at issue, denied his request that the hearing be held at a location other than the designated postal facility, and denied his requests that the agency be sanctioned because of the disability retirement disbursement that he received from OPM and because the agency representative's allegedly made a false statement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 2, 2004, the agency filed a motion for sanctions against complainant because he failed to make himself available for the telephonic deposition which had been scheduled for December 1, 2004, and did not respond "properly" to the agency's discovery request. According to the agency's representative, she spoke to complainant and confirmed the date and time of the deposition. She also stated that complainant's responses to the discovery request were incomplete and inappropriate, and that he failed to produce any of the documents that had been requested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his response to the agency's request for sanctions, complainant indicated that he was by his telephone at 1:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, Indiana time, but that he was not called until 2:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> He also maintained that he did not provide documentation requested by the agency because he had not yet received the documents that he requested from the agency and that he gave his best efforts in answering the interrogatories.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 15, the AJ granted the agency's motion for sanctions with modifications. The AJ found that complainant failed to set forth a credible reason for his failure to make himself available for the scheduled deposition because the agency's notice "unequivocally stated" that the deposition would be taken at 1:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, central time. The AJ noted that central time is the same regardless of the time zone that complainant resided or where the agency was located. Furthermore, the AJ found that complainant's responses to the agency's discovery requests were inadequate. The AJ noted that the failure to completely understand the discovery process did not excuse complainant from his responsibility to adhere to its standards. In that regard, the AJ encourage complainant to seek assistance from a third party who was familiar with the discovery process, if he was unclear about what constituted a sufficient response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was ordered, in pertinent part, to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[R]espond to each specific written interrogatory, request for admission, and request for the production of documents because the requests are likely to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also ordered that complainant's response had to be received by the AJ and the agency by the close of business on December 28, 2004. The AJ informed complainant that the failure to comply or to provide compelling reasons for noncompliance would result in the complaint being dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 29, 2004 at 12:29 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, complainant provided, by fax, his objections to the discovery order. Complainant accused the AJ of being biased and characterized her ruling as being "tyrannical sightless statements oozing from this administrators' [sic] baseless beliefs' [sic]." Complainant went on to accuse the AJ, who he repeatedly referred to as the "administrator," of blocking his complaint, disallowing his witnesses and favoring the agency in her rulings. Complainant also maintained that he could not provide further responses to the agency's interrogatories because it required information and names of individuals who had been deemed irrelevant. Also, complainant indicated that questions regarding his medical records were protected and could have been asked of his doctors had they been allowed to testify.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency filed a motion for the sanction of dismissal, which was granted by the AJ on December 30, 2004. The AJ found that "[n]o good cause exists for complainant's failure to comply with the order." On January 4, 2005, the agency issued a final action that implemented the AJ's decision. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An AJ has the authority to sanction a party for failing, without good cause shown, to fully comply with an order.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3). Dismissal of a complaint as a sanction, however, is only appropriate in extreme circumstances, where the complainant has engaged in contumacious conduct, not simple negligence. <span class="Italic">See Hale v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 12, 2000). Where a lesser sanction could deter the conduct and equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing her discretion to impose a harsher sanction.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the dismissal of complainant's complaint was appropriate under the specific facts of this case. The Commission has adopted the Black's Law Dictionary definition of contumacious conduct as being "willfully stubborn and disobedient conduct."<span class="Italic"> See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, 7-25 (November 9, 1999). The Commission also indicated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Contumacious behavior or disruptive conduct may include any unprofessional or disrespectful behavior; degrading, insulting or threatening verbal remarks or conduct; the use of profanity; or conduct engaged in for the purpose of improperly delaying the hearing. A finding of contumacious conduct or disruptive behavior may be based on a series of disruptive incidents, a pattern of acts, or a single sufficiently obstructive episode.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that complainant displayed the kind of disrespectful demeanor, obstinate disobedience, and willful stubbornness that justified the AJ's decision to dismiss his complaint. Complainant did not provide an affidavit setting forth the circumstances and details of his complaint; therefore, his compliance with the agency's discovery requests and the subsequent order of the AJ was essential. Complainant, however, refused to provide requested information about his case and refused to comply with the time frames established by the AJ for submitting his response. We are also cognizant of the fact that complainant, in his responses, treated the AJ in a disrespectful, degrading and insulting manner. Based on the foregoing reasons, we find that this is an extreme circumstance that warrants the sanction imposed by the AJ. Accordingly, the agency's final action is affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The sanction of cancelation of the hearing and remand for a decision on the record was found appropriate where, during at the prehearing conference, the complainant referred to the administrative judge and agency counsel as "racists, crooked and perpetrators of fraud," among other things, and the judge was forced to end the call. <span class="Italic">French v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120091256 (2009).</p>
