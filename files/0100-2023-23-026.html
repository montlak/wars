<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-27"><span class="space">3.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Toyota</span></span> and Substantial Limitation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Having eliminated consideration of mitigating medications, measures and devices in the <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> trilogy, the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams</span>, 122 S. Ct. 681 (2002), had a further significant impact on the quantum and nature of proof required to establish that an impairment was substantially limiting. Not only did the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Toyota</span> raise the bar in terms of the degree of proof that was required of an ADA plaintiff, it changed the nature of that proof. Prior to <span class="Italic">Toyota</span>, most of the evidence in disability cases focused on the impact of the complainant's impairment in the workplace. In <span class="Italic">Toyota</span>, the Supreme Court held that not only did the complainant have to present evidence of the impact of the impairment outside of the workplace, <span id="Page_1113"></span>but he or she also had to demonstrate that the impact was on "tasks that are of central importance in the daily lives of most people."</p>
<p class="noindent">With the ADAAA, Congress overruled <span class="Italic">Toyota</span>. Uncodified Findings and Purposes, Secs. 2(a)(5), (7), (b)(4) and (5). Congress rejected both the Supreme Court's view of what constituted a major life activity and a substantial limitation, but the case is discussed fully here because of the importance of understanding what Congress rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Toyota</span> involved the major life activity of performing manual tasks. Although the Court agreed with the EEOC that performing manual tasks was a major life activity, it also made clear that the limitation on manual tasks could not be considered in isolation. In order for a complainant to demonstrate that he or she was substantially limited in the major life activity of performing manual tasks, the Court held that the proper inquiry was not whether there was one manual task that the complainant was prevented or significantly restricted as to the conditions, manner, and duration in performing compared to the average person in the general population. The correct inquiry, the Court determined, was whether the complainant was prevented from performing, or significantly restricted in performing manual tasks that are central to the daily lives of most people. The effect of the <span class="Italic">Williams</span> decision was that it removed from the protections of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act several manual tasks that previously, standing alone, were considered to be a substantial limitation on a major life activity. Of particular significance in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> was the fact that the plaintiff's lifting restrictions were considered as part of the major life activity of performing manual tasks and not as a major life activity in and of themselves. Lifting has now been specifically included as a major life activity under the ADAAA. 42 USC 12102(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent">The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> worked on an engine fabrication assembly line. After several years of working with pneumatic tools, she developed carpel tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. As a result, she was prevented from lifting more than 20 pounds, frequently lifting or carrying more than 10 pounds, engaging in repetitive motion activities in her wrists and elbows, and using pneumatic tools or performing overhead work. For a couple of years, the plaintiff was on an inspection team that required that she perform almost no manual tasks. However, the duties of the team were ultimately changed so that she was required to perform manual tasks beyond her restrictions. The district court rejected the plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claims, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed that ruling on the basis that the plaintiff was substantially limited in performing manual tasks related to her work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court specifically did not rule on any claims that the plaintiff was substantially limited in working or lifting, but did hold that the Sixth Circuit had improperly analyzed the issue of her substantial limitation on the major life activity of performing manual tasks. Justice O'Connor, writing a unanimous majority opinion for the Court in <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two potential sources of guidance for interpreting the terms of this definition--the regulations interpreting the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 361, as amended, 29 USC 706(8)(B) (1988 ed.), and the EEOC regulations interpreting the ADA. Congress drew the ADA's definition of disability almost verbatim from the definition of "handicapped individual" in the Rehabilitation Act, 706(8)(B), and Congress' repetition of a well-established term generally implies that Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations<span class="Italic">. Bragdon v.</span> <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, 524 U.S. 624, 631 (1998); <span class="Italic">FDIC v.</span> <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Gear Corp</span>., 476 U.S. 426, 437-438 (1986); <span class="Italic">ICC v.</span> <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, 326 U.S. 60, 65 (1945). As we explained in <span class="Italic">Bragdon v.</span> <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 631, Congress did more in the ADA than suggest this construction; it adopted a specific statutory provision directing as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 790 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>.) or the regulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to such title." 42 USC 12201(a) (1994 ed.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The persuasive authority of the EEOC regulations is less clear. As we have previously noted, <span class="Italic">see Sutton v.</span> <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc</span>., 527 U.S. 471, 479 (1999), no agency has been given authority to issue regulations interpreting the term "disability" in the ADA. Nonetheless, the EEOC has done so. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(g)-(j) (2001). Because both parties accept the EEOC regulations as reasonable, we assume without deciding that they are, and we have no occasion to decide what level of deference, if any, they are due<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Sutton v.</span> <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc</span>., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 480; <span class="Italic">Albertson's, Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Kirkingburg</span>, 527 U.S. 555, 563, n.10 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To qualify as disabled under subsection (A) of the ADA's definition of disability, a claimant must initially prove that he or she has a physical or mental impairment<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 USC 12102(2)(A). The Rehabilitation Act regulations issued by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in 1977, which appear without change in the current regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, define "physical impairment," the type of impairment relevant to this case, to mean "any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine." 45 CFR 84.3(j)(2)(i) (2001). The HEW regulations are of particular significance because at the time they were issued, HEW was the agency responsible for coordinating the implementation and enforcement of 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC 794 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), which prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by recipients of federal financial assistance<span class="Italic">. Bragdon v.</span> <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 632 (citing <span class="Italic">Consolidated Rail Corporation v.</span> <span class="Italic">Darrone</span>, 465 U.S. 624, 634 (1984)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Merely having an impairment does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA. Claimants also need to demonstrate that the impairment limits a major life activity<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 USC 12102(2)(A) (1994 ed.). The HEW Rehabilitation Act regulations provide a list of examples of "major life activities," that includes "walking, seeing, hearing," and, as relevant here, "performing manual tasks." 45 CFR 84.3(j)(2)(ii) (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To qualify as disabled, a claimant must further show that the limitation on the major life activity is "substantia[l]." 42 USC 12102(2)(A). Unlike "physical impairment" and "major life activities," the HEW regulations do not define the term "substantially limits." <span class="Italic">See</span> Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Receiving or Benefiting from Federal Financial Assistance, 42 Fed. Reg. 22676, 22685 (1977) (stating the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's position that a definition of "substantially limits" was not possible at that time). The EEOC, therefore, has created its own definition for purposes of the ADA. According to the EEOC regulations, "substantially limit[ed]" means "[u]nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform"; or "[s]ignificantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity." 29 CFR 1630.2(j) (2001). In determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, the regulations instruct that the following factors should be considered: "[t]he nature and severity of the impairment; [t]he duration or expected duration of the impairment; and [t]he permanent or long-term impact, or the expected permanent or long-term impact of or resulting from the impairment." 1630.2(j)(2)(i)-(iii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question presented by this case is whether the Sixth Circuit properly determined that respondent was disabled under subsection (A) of the ADA's disability definition at the time that she sought an accommodation from petitioner. 42 USC 12102(2)(A). The parties do not dispute that respondent's medical conditions, which include carpal tunnel syndrome, myotendinitis, and thoracic outlet compression, amount to physical impairments. The relevant question, therefore, is whether the Sixth Circuit correctly analyzed whether these impairments substantially limited respondent in the major life activity of performing manual tasks. Answering this requires us to address an issue about which the EEOC regulations are silent: what a plaintiff must demonstrate to establish a substantial limitation in the specific major life activity of performing manual tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our consideration of this issue is guided first and foremost by the words of the disability definition itself. "[S]ubstantially" in the phrase "substantially limits" suggests "considerable" or "to a large degree." <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280 (1976) (defining "substantially" as "in a substantial manner" and "substantial" as "considerable in amount, value, or worth" and "being that specified to a large degree or in the main"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 17 Oxford English Dictionary 66-67 (2d ed. 1989) ("substantial": "[r]elating to or proceeding from the essence of a thing; essential"; "[o]f ample or considerable amount, quantity, or dimensions"). The word "substantial" thus clearly precludes impairments that interfere in only a minor way with the performance of manual tasks from qualifying as disabilities<span class="Italic">. Cf. Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg</span>, 527 U.S., at 565 (explaining that a "mere difference" does not amount to a "significant restric[tion]" and therefore does not satisfy the EEOC's interpretation of "substantially limits").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Major" in the phrase "major life activities" means important<span class="Italic">. See</span> Webster's, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1363 (defining "major" as "greater in dignity, rank, importance, or interest"). "Major life activities" thus refers to those activities that are of central importance to daily life. In order for performing manual tasks to fit into this category--a category that includes such basic abilities as walking, seeing, and hearing-the manual tasks in question must be central to daily life. If each of the tasks included in the major life activity of performing manual tasks does not independently qualify as a major life activity, then together they must do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That these terms need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled is confirmed by the first section of the ADA, which lays out the legislative findings and purposes that motivate the Act<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 USC 12101. When it enacted the ADA in 1990, Congress found that "some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or <span id="Page_1114"></span>mental disabilities." 12101(a)(1). If Congress intended everyone with a physical impairment that precluded the performance of some isolated, unimportant, or particularly difficult manual task to qualify as disabled, the number of disabled Americans would surely have been much higher<span class="Italic">. Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Sutton v.</span> <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc</span>., 527 U.S., at 487 (finding that because more than 100 million people need corrective lenses to see properly, "[h]ad Congress intended to include all persons with corrected physical limitations among those covered by the Act, it undoubtedly would have cited a much higher number [than 43 million disabled persons in the findings").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore hold that to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks, an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives. The impairment's impact must also be permanent or long-term. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(2)(ii)-(iii) (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability status under this test to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment. Instead, the ADA requires those "claiming the Act's protection...to prove a disability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation [caused by their impairment] in terms of their own experience...is substantial." <span class="Italic">Albertson's, Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Kirkingburg</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 567 (holding that monocular vision is not invariably a disability, but must be analyzed on an individual basis, taking into account the individual's ability to compensate for the impairment). That the Act defines "disability" "with respect to an individual," 42 USC 12102(2), makes clear that Congress intended the existence of a disability to be determined in such a case-by-case manner<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Sutton v.</span> <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 483; <span class="Italic">Albertson's, Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Kirkingburg</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 566; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bragdon v.</span> <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, 524 U.S., at 641-642 (relying on unchallenged testimony that the respondent's HIV infection controlled her decision not to have a child, and declining to consider whether HIV infection is a <span class="Italic">per se</span> disability under the ADA); 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. 1630.2(j) (2001) ("The determination of whether an individual has a disability is not necessarily based on the name or diagnosis of the impairment the person has, but rather on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual"); <span class="Italic">ibid</span>. ("The determination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity must be made on a case-by-case basis").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individualized assessment of the effect of an impairment is particularly necessary when the impairment is one whose symptoms vary widely from person to person. Carpal tunnel syndrome, one of respondent's impairments, is just such a condition. While cases of severe carpal tunnel syndrome are characterized by muscle atrophy and extreme sensory deficits, mild cases generally do not have either of these effects and create only intermittent symptoms of numbness and tingling. Carniero, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: The Cause Dictates the Treatment 66 Cleveland Clinic J. Medicine 159, 161-162 (1999). Studies have further shown that, even without surgical treatment, one quarter of carpal tunnel cases resolve in one month, but that in 22 percent of cases, symptoms last for eight years or longer<span class="Italic">. See</span> DeStefano, Nordstrom, &#x0026; Uierkant, Long-term Symptom Outcomes of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and its Treatment, 22A J. Hand Surgery 200, 204-205 (1997). When pregnancy is the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, in contrast, the symptoms normally resolve within two weeks of delivery<span class="Italic">. See</span> Ouellette, Nerve Compression Syndromes of the Upper Extremity in Women, 17 Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine 536 (2000). Given these large potential differences in the severity and duration of the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome, an individual's carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis, on its own, does not indicate whether the individual has a disability within the meaning of the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals' analysis of respondent's claimed disability suggested that in order to prove a substantial limitation in the major life activity of performing manual tasks, a "plaintiff must show that her manual disability involves a 'class' of manual activities," and that those activities "affec[t] the ability to perform tasks at work." <span class="Italic">See</span> 224 F.3d, at 843. Both of these ideas lack support.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals relied on our opinion in <span class="Italic">Sutton v.</span> <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc</span>., for the idea that a "class" of manual activities must be implicated for an impairment to substantially limit the major life activity of performing manual tasks. 224 F.3d, at 843. But <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> said only that "<span class="Italic">[w]hen the major life activity under consideration is that of working</span>, the statutory phrase 'substantially limits' requires...that plaintiffs allege that they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs." 527 U.S., at 491 (emphasis added). Because of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the argument that working could be a major life activity, we have been hesitant to hold as much, and we need not decide this difficult question today. In <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, we noted that even assuming that working is a major life activity, a claimant would be required to show an inability to work in a "broad range of jobs," rather than a specific job<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 492. But <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> did not suggest that a class-based analysis should be applied to any major life activity other than working. Nor do the EEOC regulations. In defining "substantially limits," the EEOC regulations only mention the "class" concept in the context of the major life activity of working. 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(3) (2001) ("With respect to the major life activity of <span class="Italic">working</span>[,] [t]he term <span class="Italic">substantially limits</span> means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities"). Nothing in the text of the Act, our previous opinions, or the regulations suggests that a class-based framework should apply outside the context of the major life activity of working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Court of Appeals in this case addressed the different major life activity of performing manual tasks, its analysis circumvented <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> by focusing on respondent's inability to perform manual tasks associated only with her job. This was error. When addressing the major life activity of performing manual tasks, the central inquiry must be whether the claimant is unable to perform the variety of tasks central to most people's daily lives, not whether the claimant is unable to perform the tasks associated with her specific job. Otherwise, <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>'s restriction on claims of disability based on a substantial limitation in working will be rendered meaningless because an inability to perform a specific job always can be recast as an inability to perform a "class" of tasks associated with that specific job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is also no support in the Act, our previous opinions, or the regulations for the Court of Appeals' idea that the question of whether an impairment constitutes a disability is to be answered only by analyzing the effect of the impairment in the workplace. Indeed, the fact that the Act's definition of "disability" applies not only to Title I of the Act, 42 USC 12111-12117 (1994 ed.), which deals with employment, but also to the other portions of the Act, which deal with subjects such as public transportation, 12141-12150, 42 USC 12161-12165 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and privately provided public accommodations, 12181-12189, demonstrates that the definition is intended to cover individuals with disabling impairments regardless of whether the individuals have any connection to a workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even more critically, the manual tasks unique to any particular job are not necessarily important parts of most people's lives. As a result, occupation-specific tasks may have only limited relevance to the manual task inquiry. In this case, "repetitive work with hands and arms extended at or above shoulder levels for extended periods of time," 224 F.3d, at 843, the manual task on which the Court of Appeals relied, is not an important part of most people's daily lives. The court, therefore, should not have considered respondent's inability to do such manual work in her specialized assembly line job as sufficient proof that she was substantially limited in performing manual tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the same time, the Court of Appeals appears to have disregarded the very type of evidence that it should have focused upon. It treated as irrelevant "[t]he fact that [respondent] can...ten[d] to her personal hygiene [and] carr[y] out personal or household chores." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Yet household chores, bathing, and brushing one's teeth are among the types of manual tasks of central importance to people's daily lives, and should have been part of the assessment of whether respondent was substantially limited in performing manual tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The District Court noted that at the time respondent sought an accommodation from petitioner, she admitted that she was able to do the manual tasks required by her oriGINAl two jobs in QCIO. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-36. In addition, according to respondent's deposition testimony, even after her condition worsened, she could still brush her teeth, wash her face, bathe, tend her flower garden, fix breakfast, do laundry, and pick up around the house. App. 32-34. The record also indicates that her medical conditions caused her to avoid sweeping, to quit dancing, to occasionally seek help dressing, and to reduce how often she plays with her children, gardens, and drives long distances<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 32, 38-39. But these changes in her life did not amount to such severe restrictions in the activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives that they establish a manual-task disability as a matter of law. On this record, it was therefore inappropriate for the Court of Appeals to grant partial summary judgment to respondent on the issue whether she was substantially limited in performing manual tasks, and its decision to do so must be reversed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, applying the <span class="Italic">Toyota</span> test, found that an arthritic thumb that prevented the complainant from pinching and gripping mail was not a substantial limitation on an activity of central importance to most people's daily lives. <span class="Italic">See Delta Gatta v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994844 (2002). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hebert v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01996432 (2002), the Commission found that injury to a nerve that impaired the complainant's use of his left hand was not a substantial limitation where the complainant's evidence concerned only the effects of the injury at work. The complainant did not submit any evidence of how the impairment limited his ability to perform activities that were not job-related and "central to most people's daily lives." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A20115 (2003) (no evidence that complainant's hand impairment affected manual tasks essential to daily life); <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Postmaster <span id="Page_1115"></span>General</span>, 01A10824 (2002) (complainant submitted no evidence that his limitations applied off the job).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when the complainant submitted evidence of the effects of an impairment off-duty, he or she had be specific in terms of the limitations imposed. In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A42275 (2005), the Commission found the complainant had not established her fibromyalgia and seizure disorder were substantially limiting where she testified she could not walk more than "short distances," could not sit for more than 20 minutes at a time, could not load the dishwasher or tie her shoes and sometimes needed help getting out of bed. The Commission found that the "complainant's description of her impairments lacks specificity as to their severity. For instance, complainant's description of her walking impairment does not provide us with enough information to determine if she is substantially limited. Although complainant cannot sit for more than 20 minutes, she did not present evidence as to how long the limitation lasts; all day, or for several hours at a time." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Holland v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A01372 (2003), the Commission determined that the complainant's obsessive-compulsive disorder was a substantial limitation on the major life activities of thinking, concentrating, and interacting with others. Although the following quote from <span class="Italic">Holland</span> is quite lengthy, it is included to make a point; namely, that both agencies and complainants in disability cases were required by <span class="Italic">Toyota</span> to broaden their views of the types of proof that are relevant to the substantial limitation issue. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Holland</span> included its review of the evidence relied upon in determining that the complainant was substantially limited:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors to be considered in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity include: the nature and severity of the impairment; the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and the permanent or long-term impact, or the expected permanent or long-term impact of or resulting from the impairment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(j)(2). The Commission also must consider any mitigating measures "both positive and negative...when judging whether [complainant] is "substantially limited." <span class="Italic">See Sutton v. United Airlines</span>, 527 U.S. 471, 482 (1999); <span class="Italic">Albertsons</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc.</span>, <span class="Italic">v. Kirkinburg</span>, 527 U.S. 555, 565-566 (1999); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. United Parcel Service</span>, 527 U.S. 516, 521-523 (1999). Moreover, an individualized assessment "is particularly necessary when the impairment is one whose symptoms vary widely from person to person." <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor Mfg.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ky</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc.</span>, <span class="Italic">v. Williams</span>, 122 S. Ct. 681, 692 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, with reference to the holdings in Sutton and Murphy, and again noting the AJ's failure to consider the effect of mitigating measures, the agency argues that complainant failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that his mental impairment substantially limited any major life activity, to include those specified by the AJ, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> the ability to "think, concentrate, and interact with others." To the contrary, the agency noted record testimony regarding complainant's ability to converse with his co-workers, his excellent knowledge and memory, and superior ability to handle callers' inquiries. With reference to 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(j)(3)(i), the agency also argues that complainant failed to produce sufficient evidence that he was substantially limited in the ability to work. Specifically, the agency argues that complainant failed to prove that he was limited in performing "either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills, and ability," as opposed to an inability to perform a single, particular job. The agency notes that five months subsequent to his retirement, complainant began work for a private company as a "computer-assisted telephone interviewer," and further averred that complainant failed to provide evidence of "jobs within his field of work that he is disqualified from."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Is complainant an individual with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find that complainant presents conclusive evidence that he suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Dysthymia since the 1970's, and Adjustment Disorder since 1993. Moreover, based on CP's psychiatric assessments, as well as a February 18, 1993 report of psychiatric examination, we find that complainant's symptoms increased greatly in 1991. Specifically, the record reflects that after approximately eight months of intensive psychotherapy, CP referred complainant to a psychiatrist on February 5, 1991, to assess whether complainant would benefit from medication. The record shows that this psychiatrist thereafter continued to treat complainant, in conjunction with CP's on-going therapy. Additionally, we note that complainant's treating psychiatrist conducted the January 1993 psychiatric examination which is the subject of the February 18, 1993 report, and that this report also includes a description of complainant's psychiatric history as well as a current assessment of his social and industrial functioning. Accordingly, we find that the February 18, 1993 report is a highly reliable assessment of complainant's psychiatric condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The report reflects that at the time of the initial referral, complainant manifested severe compulsions to include repetitive checking to see if the stove in his apartment was turned off; that the lights were turned off; that the dishes were lined up in the kitchen; that the refrigerator door was closed and that his apartment door was locked before leaving his apartment. The report further reflects that complainant was obsessively concerned about cleanliness, requiring him to minutely examine and frequently wipe off his silverware. The report indicates that these behaviors consumed a significant amount of time, and that complainant experienced considerable anxiety if he attempted to curtail his "checking" behaviors. Industrially, the report reflects that complainant frequently checked the accuracy of the information he provided to callers and entered into the computer, to include a ritual and compulsion about turning on and off the computer. In addressing complainant's Dysthymia, the report indicated that complainant reported sadness, decreased self-esteem, sleep disturbance, decreased energy and motivation, weight gain and feelings of hopelessness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The report reflects that while complainant showed a good initial therapeutic response to fluoxetine, his symptoms became worse during the course of his mother's illness, and then her death in January 1992. The report notes that during this time while complainant's symptoms at home were under "fair to good control," he had excessive absenteeism and significantly increased symptoms at work. The report indicates that a change in medication in the autumn of 1992, had a "positive effect" on his compulsive symptoms, and psychotherapy assisted him in his grief adjustment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the report reflects that upon receiving the agency's November 1992 and January 1993 memoranda, denying his requests for reasonable accommodations, coupled with management's on-going negative attitude regarding complainant's plight, complainant's symptoms greatly increased, despite continued medication and intensive psychotherapy. At the time of examination, in January 1993, complainant had poor mood with anxiety and depression, along with transient suicidal ideation. Diagnostically, the report reflects "moderate" Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Dysthymia, as well as the development of a new additional psychiatric disorder, Adjustment Disorder with mixed emotional features, assessed as "severe." Due to the effect of work environment stressors, prognosis could not be assessed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The report further indicates that complainant's psychiatric condition adversely affected his health and overall activities, to include restricted activities and risk of self-assaultive behaviors. The report also notes that complainant's general level of psychiatric functioning was substantially higher from September 1991 to October 1992, when workplace accommodations were in place. As a conclusion, the report indicated that complainant's condition was not static, and that all symptoms would remain at an increased level unless effective workplace accommodations were provided, noting that complainant's therapy had not progressed because of his workplace situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, concerning complainant's day-to-day performance in the workplace, we find that complainant's supervisors confirm the description of the nature and severity of complainant's psychiatric disorder which is reflected in these clinical assessments. A few pertinent examples follow.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her affidavit, NM testified as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When I first came to [complainant's facility], complainant's mother had died and any call he received that reminded him of his mother would put him in tears for the rest of the day. Or, complainant would get a call that because of his compulsive disorder would have him check the input screen 18 times before he would input the case. He had a hard time with the callers calling in with their problems because it made him think about his own problems or his perceived problems. These are some of the reasons his production was low...Complainant just could not handle the pressure and the stresses of the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We perhaps made a lot mistakes in complainant's case, but we tried not to come down on him hard because everything we did would upset him. We did "soft-shoe" around him because of his mental disability and did not want to upset him. Every time we had a conversation with him he was unable to work for the rest of the day or would not come to work the following day. That's just how the mental disability worked and he had to mull it over a thousand times and had to know all the angles. Sometimes I did call his doctor to alert him of the things I was going to say so that if complainant called him the doctor would be aware of what had transpired. We tried to cover all bases because we didn't want him emotionally upset and tried to be very careful in the way we handled him. On a couple of occasions complainant had threatened suicide and I didn't want to take any action that would serve as a trigger to his emotional state.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 provided the following affidavit testimony:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant would talk to me about his obsessive compulsive behavior and not being able to control re-checking things. When this happened when he was on the phones I would suggest to him to check once, check twice and when he felt he was going to check <span id="Page_1116"></span>it a third time don't just hit the input key. We had discussions like this all the time. If he really got upset about something we'd go and talk in private. I always made a point to handle him specially and talk in private because he was always conscious that other people may be listening. I dealt with it the best that I could and tried to get him to understand that he didn't have to have everything perfect. He tried, I really have to give him credit...I think after he started getting notice after notice from management the pressure began to build and was slowing him down more than the work itself because in the back of his mind he always wondered what was coming next.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Anytime I wrote anything or gave anything to him, I always sat down with him and talked about it. He was upset, I remember that. In fact, when I first wrote him up in regard to his absenteeism the meetings were very emotional on his part. And as time went on every time I had to do something a little bit stiffer he got more emotional. I had learned that it could trigger his emotions, so I learned never to hand him anything without telling him about it first. If he knew in advance this was coming, he would ask me questions because we always had on-going discussion and I would tell him that nothing was finalized at that point. Because of the talking relationship we had he had enough trust in me and I felt that he should have that trust to be able to communicate with me at any time he had a need. That helped me soften things with him because sometimes things are written rather harshly. I know as a supervisor we have to do these things but also know we do not have to be so abrupt.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">There were times that complainant would call in and I could tell that he was very, very down. One time he came close to threatening suicide to me and I became very alarmed. That is why it became more and more difficult for me because I had to push him from a supervisor and management point of view. I knew his condition and questioned why we were treating complainant different from everybody else with a handicap.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, in his own hearing testimony, complainant provides the following description of the his psychiatric disorder as it afflicts him both inside and outside of the workplace:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Well, you know, a compulsive behavior would be the repetitive--the checking and rechecking of work, the repetitiveness. Obsessions. Doubting myself, self-doubt. Contamination, but not too much on that. I'm very aware of it.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">There are calls that I can take and complete the actions while I'm on the phone and go to the next call. It's when a situation becomes complicated for me, meaning it--the matter may be complex, or there may be forms I may have to complete. All I can tell you is the way I start reacting...For example, if I'm talking to someone and, you know, it's taking a bit of time, and I hear the person kind of sighing, like I wish--in my mind, I interpret it I wish he could hurry up. I would get the basic information I needed, I would release that call, let that person go, because it would start upsetting me. In other words, I was trying to release pressure from me.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[After the sick leave restriction was issued] I was very, very upset. I couldn't understand why, I couldn't understand why I would receive a memorandum such as that, when I had actually shown improvement. One thing I was doing is, I was seeing [CP] Monday mornings at 7:30. And that was for me to be able to come to work. And it was working. I had a problem with Mondays, so I started to see him Monday mornings. So, it was real devastating. I reacted very strongly to this. Emotionally, physically.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After review of the record, we find that complainant's reports of excessive worrying, intrusive thoughts, uncontrollable and repetitive checking behavior affecting numerous daily activities, poor sleep and depressed mood (to include suicidal ideation), as confirmed by both his treating psychiatrist and psychologist, as well as his supervisors, substantially affected his ability to concentrate. In reaching this conclusion, we note in particular management testimony reflecting that complainant needed to check the screen "18 times" on a call, his compulsive need to repeatedly hit the input button (requiring the intervention of his supervisor at times to interrupt this behavior), and inability to move on to the next call without first checking and re-checking his work for fear it was not perfect. Then according to complainant, if the call were "complex," or he perceived that the caller was not satisfied with the speed of his service, he experienced even more stress, and that this slowed him down even further. To compound the impact of these compulsive behaviors, the record also shows that complainant additionally experienced mood difficulties when handling either calls that would evoke his own sad memories, or responding to management criticisms of his work, which also had the effect of disrupting his concentration such that he could not focus on his assignments. In this regard, we note that the record reflects management concerns not only about "upsetting" complainant when discussing performance problems, with the need to consult with his doctors before doing so, but also concern that complainant might harm himself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, based on our review of the record, to include the clinical evidence and pertinent affidavit and hearing testimony, we concur with the AJ's ultimate finding that complainant is an individual with a disability under the applicable legal standards referenced above. Specifically, we find that the record demonstrates that complainant was afflicted with two well recognized psychiatric disorders of a chronic nature for many years, and that as of the time he requested the reasonable accommodation in claim 2, his symptoms had increased and his prognosis was uncertain. We further determine that the record shows that even when dealing with a routine call, complainant had difficulty, to varying degrees, shifting his focus to go on to another call, because of his need to re-check his work. If the call was "complex" or emotionally troublesome, the record reflects that complainant would have to completely disengage to cope with the stress, sometimes for an entire day, demonstrating the total inability to maintain his concentration to successfully complete the current call, or to go on the next call. Additionally, we note that the record shows that complainant frequently required the intervention of his supervisor for the purpose of assurance and encouragement and/or to help him develop techniques to abort his repetitive checking so that he could shift his concentration to the next caller. However, we find that even this intervention appears to have been successful in only the case of the most simple routine calls. Moreover, we note that the record reflects that these compulsive checking behaviors afflicted complainant not only in the workplace, but at home as well, as described in the clinical reports of record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that complainant is substantially impaired in the major life activity of concentrating in light of the evidence that complainant has long suffered with two chronic psychiatric disorders, manifesting an array of debilitating symptoms which substantially interfered with his ability to shift his concentration from one task or activity to the next, or to maintain the needed concentration to go on to complete a single task or activity. In this regard, we further note that at the time complainant requested the reasonable accommodation at issue, his psychiatric symptoms were severe despite his use of the mitigating measures of daily psycho tropic medication and intensive psychotherapy, to include sessions every Monday morning, and up to three times per week. For these reasons, we conclude that complainant is "disabled" in the major life activity of concentrating within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The reversal of <span class="Italic">Toyota</span> through the ADAAA probably does not change that portion of the decision that indicates the impact of an impairment both inside and outside the workplace must be evaluated in determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. What it does do is expand the definition of major life activities by eliminating the <span class="Italic">Toyota</span> requirement that major life activity be something that is of central importance in the daily lives of most people. The reversal of <span class="Italic">Toyota</span>, as with <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> and its progeny, also eased the burden of individuals in terms of the degree of limitation that needs to be demonstrated to establish a substantial limitation.</p>
