<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-123"><span class="space">3.</span> Uncorrected Vision Standards</h4>
<p class="noindent">In making changes related to the consideration of mitigating measures in substantial limitation determinations, the ADAAA also added a provision with regard to uncorrected vision standards. Although ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses are not considered mitigating devices under the ADAAA, Congress did include a provision in the ADAAA aimed at protecting those who use ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses from discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding section 3(4)(E)(ii), a covered entity shall not use qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria based on an individual's uncorrected vision unless the standard, test, or other selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent">42 USC 12113(c). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 CFR 1630.10(b).</p>
<p class="noindent">In essence, the provision does give some protection to individuals whose vision impairments are corrected by ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses by insuring that employers cannot require uncorrected vision standards without specifically justifying those standards in light of the particular job. Conversely, it gives employers the right to impose uncorrected vision standards that do not violate the ADA when circumstances warrant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even before the ADAAA, the Commission had found that an agency could not apply an uncorrected vision standard without a demonstration that it was job-related and consistent with business necessity. In <span class="Italic">Poquiz v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720050095 (2008), the complainant was a former corrections officer who applied for a position as a detention enforcement officer. The complainant had a retina detached in an accident. It was subsequently reattached. He had some difficulty focusing one quadrant of that eye, but had learned sufficient compensating techniques to account for loss of peripheral vision and depth perception. The agency made the complainant a conditional offer of employment that it withdrew after learning of his history of vision problems. The Commission found that the complainant was an individual with a disability, not because of his present vision, but because he had a record of a substantially limiting impairment of his sight. The Commission further found that the agency had not demonstrated its uncorrected vision standards were job-related and consistent with business necessity and that the complainant was not a direct threat to himself or others. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Poquiz</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the AJ found complainant's testimony and medical records establish that he has a record of being substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing. Upon review, we find that substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that complainant had a record of being substantially limited in seeing. Complainant suffered damage to his right eye in 1989 when a piece of metal flew out of a fireplace and hit him in the eye. As part of his application for employment, complainant submitted a "Medical Examination and History Report" in which he noted that in 1989 he had "surgery to correct a partial detached retina." After receiving a tentative offer of employment, complainant underwent a medical examination on July 25, 2003. The results of the examination, completed by an examining physician on behalf of the agency, are contained on a form entitled "Comprehensive Health Services Inc." which notes complainant has a history of a detached right retina from 1989 and "some residual focusing difficulty" and lists complainant's uncorrected vision, his current corrected vision, his best corrected vision, and peripheral vision. In his September 7, 2003 Request for Review of Medical Determination, complainant stated that for the last 14 years, "I have worked tirelessly to adapt to and overcome any drawbacks specific to my visual disability." Subsequently, in a January 20, 2004 letter to the Medical Appeal Board, complainant discusses his eye injury and notes that "At first I had no depth perception, the first memory of my `blind' experience was while at the hospital I had trouble feeding myself and kept hitting my chin with a spoon." Upon review, we find complainant has shown that his eye impairment significantly restricted the duration, manner or condition under which the major life activity of seeing was performed, as compared to the average person's ability to perform the same major life activity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j). Thus, we conclude that complainant had a record of an impairment that substantially limited the major life activity of seeing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant must next show that he is a "qualified individual with a disability." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). A "qualified individual with a disability" is an individual who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals that complainant lost central vision in one quadrant of his right eye and is unable to focus in that eye, but he does have peripheral vision in that eye. Further, the record reveals that complainant employed multiple means to compensate for his vision impairment and has successfully participated in shooting and firearms training and examinations, has won martial arts and professional paintball competitions, and is a licensed motorcycle rider.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, substantial evidence supports the AJ's conclusion that complainant could perform the law enforcement duties of the position. Not only did the agency tentatively offer complainant the position of DEO, but complainant testified he had performed those duties identified as critical tasks for the DEO position, with the exception of deportation. Although we note that complainant stated that he did not specifically perform deportation, he explained that as a CO he duplicated some of those transportation duties by escorting inmates outside the confines of the institution, including to and from hospitals, work programs, and other prison institutions. Clearly, the only bar to complainant's hire was his vision impairment. Thus, we find that complainant was otherwise qualified for the position except for his failure to meet the agency's vision standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10 provides that it is unlawful for an <span id="Page_1214"></span>agency to use qualifications standards, employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out, an individual with a disability, or class of individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability, unless the standard, test or other selection criteria, as used by the agency, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. The qualifications standards, as applied in a particular case, must constitute an accurate measure of a complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of the position at issue. <span class="Italic">Pointer v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A10057 (April 24, 2003) (citing Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10). Upon review, we find the agency's distant vision policy, when applied to complainant, who had a tentative offer of employment revoked for not meeting the agency's vision standard, screens complainant out on the basis of disability, failing to provide any measure whatsoever of complainant's ability to perform the essential functions of the position to which he seeks employment. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> (citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10). Accordingly, we find that the agency should have waived its vision, standard for complainant. <span class="Italic">See School Board of Nassau County v. Arline,</span> 480 U.S. 273, 288-89.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to safety requirements that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the "direct threat" standard set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r) in order to show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity. 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.15(b) and (c). Therefore, we must analyze whether the agency has satisfied its burden of proof to establishing that complainant posed a direct threat to safety. <span class="Italic">See Spencer v. Department of Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 07A10035 (May 6, 2003), <span class="Italic">req. for recons. denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A30898 (August 29, 2005). The agency found, based upon complainant's vision impairment, that complainant posed a direct threat of future injury to himself and was therefore unsuitable for employment. In order to exclude an individual on the basis of possible future injury, the agency bears the burden of showing there is a significant risk, i.e., high probability of substantial harm. <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A20117. A speculative or remote risk is insufficient. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency must show more than that an individual with a disability seeking employment stands some slightly increased risk of harm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (<span class="Italic">citing Selix v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01970153 (March 16, 2000)). Moreover, such a finding must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual that takes into account: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Appendix to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r)). A determination of significant risk cannot be. based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation, or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Rather, the agency must gather and base its decision on substantial information regarding the individual's work and medical history. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Person A stated that he considered that complainant compensated for his vision problem and in his opinion found that there remained a substantial risk associated with those conditions and found complainant "could not safely perform the essential functions with or without accommodation." Person A stated that his concerns were that complainant could not perform "apprehension, arrest and transporting...in the general public." Person A stated that complainant's medical condition was "basically monocular vision," "without vision in his right eye," no peripheral vision, and depth perception difficulty. Person A also stated that he believed there was a serious risk that if an incident occurred on complainant's "blind side" or his "right side" that complainant could not detect it as quickly as someone who had 20/20 vision. Person A also noted that "field of vision was an issue" as well as "depth perception for following individuals" and he also had concerns about "putting a firearm in the individual's hand" when he does not have the depth perception and field of vision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Person B, 'Chief Detention Enforcement Officer, noted that a person with limited vision in his right eye would pose problems in performing the duties of the DEO position since the person would have to drive by himself and at the same time would have to be aware of the detainees in the back of the vehicle. Person B also noted that a person working on a raid or making an arrest on the street needs to be aware of his surroundings including bystanders and acknowledged that he considered that a person with limited vision in one eye would not be completely aware of his surroundings,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Person C, Chief of the Pre-employment Clearance and Scheduling Branch, stated that if someone came at complainant from his "blind side" or "right side" that "there's a possibility that not only could they overpower him but maybe take his gun away from him" and noted that in an arrest situation complainant "might not be able to completely survey the area for harm before choosing to act or not act."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we agree with the AJ's finding that the agency failed to show a significant risk, i.e., high probability of substantial harm. In the present case, the agency did not make an individualized assessment of the alleged risk posed by complainant and, instead, applied a blanket medical qualification standard without examining the specific application to complainant when it found that complainant's distant visual acuity of worse than 20/200 (in his right eye) is below the required vision standard for the job. Without such an individualized assessment, the agency failed in its burden to show that complainant would pose a direct threat. <span class="Italic">See Lovell v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A41642 (May 26, 2006) <span class="Italic">(citing Holmes v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01977073 (October 20, 2000)), <span class="Italic">req. for recons. denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A60874 (Aug. 23, 2006). Person A testified that if complainant was hit on his right side, "he would be essentially helpless" and the consequence would be the "escape" of an alien. As indicated in the record, the agency's explanations for finding complainant would be a direct threat in the DEO position were based on false assumptions since complainant can see out of his right eye and has peripheral vision in that eye. Additionally, despite the agency's hypothetical, if complainant was hit on his right eye, he could still see out of his left eye, which has "near vision" 20/20 uncorrected and he would not be helpless as asserted by the agency. Further, we find the agency has produced no evidence of the probability that potential injury would actually occur. Although Person B noted generally that hazards IEAs have faced in transporting detainees have included fights in vehicles, medical situations where a person has had a seizure or heart attack, a vehicle fire, varied weather conditions, and a car accident, we note there is no evidence indicating the frequency of these hazardous conditions. Moreover, we note that the agency provided no evidence indicating the likelihood that a DEO's corrective lenses could fail, be dislodged, or become fogged during the performance of his or her duties. Additionally, we find the agency improperly used subjective information based on Person A's own visual acuity, as to whether or not complainant was qualified and should be given a gun.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also rejected the agency's argument that the complainant should be disqualified for the position because he could not obtain a California commercial drivers' license. The Commission noted that the position standards only stated that such a license "may" be required and that only 17 of 26 detention enforcement officers working at that location had commercial drivers' licenses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 0120093256 (2015), and, in doing so, explained the relationship between a qualification standard and an essential job function:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals that Complainant met all of the Agency's job requirements for the foreman position except for its requirement that his vision conform to the requirements set forth in the DOT regulations. Complainant's supervisor, the Transmission Service Manager, and the Area Operations Manager all stated that Complainant could perform the functions of the foreman position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The key question then is whether the vision standard that the Complainant failed, or the manner in which the Agency applied the vision standard to Complainant, is consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Nathan v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070014 (July 19, 2013). If the standard itself fails to meet the "job-related and consistent with business necessity" requirement, or if the Agency failed to apply the standard in an appropriate way (for example, by failing to determine whether performance could be achieved through reasonable accommodation) the Complainant has a valid claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Is the Agency's Vision Standard Job-Related and Consistent With Business Necessity</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act prohibits a covered entity from engaging in discrimination against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in, among other things, hiring. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). Such discrimination includes "using qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability...unless the standard, test, or other selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(6); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10 (making unlawful a covered entity's use of qualification standards that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability unless such standard is job related and consistent with business necessity).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "qualification standard" is not defined in the statute. The regulations define "qualification standard" as "the personal and professional attributes, including the skill, experience, education, physical, medical, safety, and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(q). The regulations also note that vision standards based on uncorrected vision are acceptable under the Act if a covered entity can establish that such standards are job related and consistent with business necessity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1215"></span>The Commission's regulations provide that an Agency can meet the "job related and consistent with business necessity" standard by showing that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the "direct threat" analysis set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). 29 C.F.R. 1630 App. 1630.15(b) and (c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A person is a "direct threat" if he or she poses a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of him or herself or others which cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r).

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that it is bound by the vision standards in the DOT regulations. Here, the record shows that the Agency voluntarily adopted the DOT regulations. The Commission has previously held that an Agency cannot depend solely on the DOT regulations at issue in this complaint to determine that an individual is not qualified for a position, and the Agency must conduct an individualized assessment of the individual to determine if they pose a direct threat. <span class="Italic">See Surprenant v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996186 (July 27, 2001) (Finding that an individualized assessment is necessary when an Agency voluntarily adopts the DOT regulations). A federal agency is not required to comply with the DOT regulations at issue in this complaint because, under 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 390.3(f)(2), these regulations do not apply to transportation performed by the Federal government or any Agency established under a compact between States that has been approved by Congress. <span class="Italic">See Ganson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01214 (Feb. 12, 2004) (The Agency erred when it did not conduct an individualized assessment of Complainant and relied solely on DOT regulations to find that Complainant could not drive Commercial Motor Vehicles); <span class="Italic">Masteller v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal NO. 01994458 (February 12, 2004) (An Agency must conduct an individualized assessment of an employee instead of only relying on DOT regulations). Therefore, relief from the DOT regulations adopted by the Agency is solely within the Agency's authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Boots v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, the Commission found that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it did not conduct an individualized assessment and relied solely on DOT regulations (the same regulations at issue in this complaint) to remove Complainant from his Tractor Trailer Operator position because he took anti-seizure medication. <span class="Italic">Boots</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03A40060 (Dec. 13, 2004). A Special Panel of the Merit Systems Protection Board upheld the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Boots</span> and found that federal agencies, unlike private employers, are not bound by these specific DOT regulations, and the Agency did not make a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate the employee when it deferred to the DOT regulations without conducting an individualized assessment of Complainant's disability. <span class="Italic">Boots v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 500 (April 13, 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the Agency failed to conduct an individualized assessment of Complainant to determine if he is qualified for the position. There is nothing in the record that would indicate that the Agency considered whether the Complainant's impairment posed a direct threat before it decided to not allow him to serve as a foreman or it decided to not select him for the permanent foreman position. Instead, the record reflects that the Agency relied solely on the DOT regulations to determine that Complainant was not able to drive Commercial Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's supervisor stated that there was never an individualized assessment comparing Complainant's limitations with the functions of the foreman job. The record indicates that Complainant was able to drive Commercial Motor Vehicles without posing a safety risk to himself or to others because he was able to obtain a Tennessee CDL which allows him to drive Commercial Motor Vehicles intrastate. Further, Complainant's supervisor, the Transmission Service Manager, and the Area Operations Manager all stated in their sworn statements that there were no safety concerns with Complainant working as a foreman. The Commission therefore determines that the Agency failed to conduct the required individualized assessment of Complainant's impairment and did not meet its burden of proof with regard to whether Complainant posed a significant risk of substantial harm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Is Driving Commercial Vehicles Interstate an Essential Function of the Position</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that even if the Agency had shown that Complainant would have posed a direct threat if allowed to drive Commercial Motor Vehicles, it would still have been required to determine whether driving Commercial Motor Vehicles interstate is an essential function of the foreman position, or whether, as Complainant argues, the function was marGINAl and could have been removed as a reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m) and (n); <span class="Italic">Ganson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01214 (February 12, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the job description for the electrical foreman position states that having at least a Class B CDL is a qualification for the position. However, there is nothing in the record that would indicate how often, if ever, a foreman has been required to respond to an emergency situation which required the transportation of Commercial Motor Vehicles across state lines. Additionally, Complainant served as a foreman on numerous occasions and had never been required to drive a Commercial Motor Vehicle. Complainant's supervisor stated that having a CDL is not an essential function of the foreman position, and that foremen do not use the CDL on a regular basis. Therefore, the Agency failed to establish that driving a Commercial Motor Vehicle interstate is an essential function of the foreman position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the record, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to establish that Complainant is a direct threat or that providing Complainant with the accommodation of waiving the S5 medical examination or removing the driving requirement altogether would cause an undue hardship. As a result, the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to establishing that the vision standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the agency must also conduct an individualized analysis of the complainant's actual visual ability. In a pre-amendment act case, the Commission rejected the agency's contention that a complainant with monocular vision was a direct threat where the assessment was based on a study and did not take into account the complainant's abilities. In <span class="Italic">Nathan v. Attorney General</span>, 0720070014 (2013), the Commission gave a lengthy explanation of the need to establish the standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity and an individualized analysis. The decision is rare in the first instance because it was issued by the Commission instead of the Office of Federal Operations and also because it contains a rare dissent in such decisions by Commissioner Barker. The majority in <span class="Italic">Nathan</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon a finding that Complainant is an individual with a disability, the next inquiry is whether Complainant is a "qualified individual with a disability." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). A "qualified individual with a disability" is one who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals that Complainant met all the Agency's job requirements except its vision standard. Complainant passed Phases I and II of the evaluation process and was given a conditional offer of employment that reflected his achievement. Further, Complainant's medical examination report described him as in overall good health, noting only his vision impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The key question then is whether the vision standard that the Complainant failed, or the manner in which the Agency applied the vision standard to Complainant, is consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. If the standard itself fails to meet the "job-related and consistent with business necessity" requirement, or if the Agency failed to apply the standard in an appropriate way (for example, by failing to determine whether performance could be achieved through reasonable accommodation) the Complainant has a valid claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Is the Agency Vision Standard Job-Related and Consistent With Business Necessity</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act prohibits a covered entity from engaging in discrimination against a qualified individual on the basis of disability <span id="Page_1216"></span>in, among other things, hiring. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a).

<p class="noindent-1">The term "qualification standard" is not defined in the statute. The regulations define "qualification standard" as "the personal and professional attributes, including the skill, experience, education, physical, medical, safety, and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(q). The regulations also note that vision standards based on uncorrected vision are acceptable under the Act if a covered entity can establish that such standards are job related and consistent with business necessity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.10(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues on appeal that it requires that applicants for the SA position possess uncorrected vision of 20/200 in each eye, with correction to 20/20 in one eye and 20/40 in the other eye. According to the Agency, the vision standard ensures that an applicant can safely serve as a SA. In rejecting Complainant due to his inability to meet this standard, the FBI's Chief Medical Officer noted that Complainant's limited vision created a "risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the applicant and co-workers while working in critical response tasks of raids, arrests, and reactive squad duty."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, with regard to safety requirements that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that the requirement is job related and consistent with business necessity. The regulations provide that an Agency can meet this standard by showing that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the "direct threat" analysis set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). 29 C.F.R. 1630 App. 1630.15(b) and (c).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We find that substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that the Agency did not perform an individualized assessment of whether Complainant could perform the essential functions of a SA position without posing a direct threat to himself or others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its appeal, the Agency relied heavily on the testimony of the Program Manager for the FBI Training Academy's Law Enforcement Training for Safety and Survival Program to establish that Complainant would have posed a direct threat because of his vision impairment. The Program Manager testified that individuals with reduced peripheral vision and depth perception present a significantly increased safety risk in a situation where a Special Agent would have to "clear a room." Specifically, the Program Manager testified that the Agency conducted a study where it situated a target in a position which would be considered "good peripheral vision" and marked this target range on a wall in a room. As a part of the study, the Agency eliminated the use of one of the subject's eyes and marked a new target range on the same wall. The Program Manager testified that an Agency Engineer determined that an individual in these circumstances was losing approximately 35 to 38 percent of their vision. The Program Manager testified that the target range identified with the elimination of one eye represents roughly a five foot area that an individual would be unable to see.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's presentation of the evidence from the study alone is insufficient to establish that there would be a high probability of substantial harm to Complainant or others. The evaluation of an applicant's unique abilities and disabilities is the crux of an individualized assessment. At the minimum, such an assessment should take into account any special qualifications that might allow an applicant to successfully perform the essential functions of a position without posing a direct threat to himself or others. Examples of special qualifications include prior successful experience in a similar position and adaptive or learned behaviors that compensate for physical limitations imposed by a condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's study, which only looked to the range of vision lost by a typical person with monocular vision, plainly failed to examine any of the special qualifications that the Complainant allegedly possessed. Instead, the Agency summarily disqualified the Complainant based on the presumption that no individual with monocular vision can carry out the duties of an SA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An appropriate assessment would have closely evaluated the Complainant's prior experience to determine if such experience indicated an ability to safely perform as an SA or, if past experience was insufficient, provided the Complainant an opportunity to demonstrate how he could safely perform the essential functions of the job because of compensatory skills that he has developed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant has alleged that he possesses both applicable prior experience and special skills that enable him to safely perform the essential functions of the SA position. Complainant graduated from West Point in 1993 and rose to the rank of Captain in the U.S. Army, served tours as an infantry officer where he received specialized training in small unit tactics, and performed over seventy-five combat patrols in Bosnia. We note, however, that some of these activities occurred prior to Complainant's unsuccessful eye surgery and, to that extent, the simple existence of such activities is not probative evidence of the Complainant's present ability. More relevant are the special skills that, according to the Complainant, enable him to execute the essential functions of the job without posing a direct threat to himself or others. These include learned behaviors, including skills obtained prior to surgery, and compensatory techniques that assist the Complainant in overcoming his vision impairment and enable him to safely perform such essential functions as clearing a room. There is no evidence in the record that the Agency took these skills into account when assessing whether the Complainant could safely perform the essential functions of a SA. An appropriate individualized assessment would have allowed the Complainant to demonstrate how those special skills enable him to perform the essential functions of the job without significant risk to himself or others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency had a legitimate concern regarding Complainant's ability to safely perform in the SA position with his visual impairment, and the Rehabilitation Act does not require that an individual who is a direct threat to himself or others be hired for a job where he poses such a threat. However, the Commission finds that the Agency did not meet its burden under the direct threat standard as required by the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In her dissent in <span class="Italic">Nathan</span>, Commissioner Barker took issue with the majority's finding that the agency had not conducted an individualized analysis of the complainant's abilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission rests its Decision on its conclusion that the FBI did not perform "an individualized assessment of whether [Mr. Nathan] could perform the essential functions of a [Special Agent] position without posing a direct threat to himself or others." An individualized assessment is critical to ensure that an employer's concerns about safety risks are grounded in something more objective and substantial than fears, assumptions, stereotypes or generalizations. But, nothing in the EEOC's regulations or the Appendix to the regulations dictate one approach to undertaking an individualized assessment. The type of disability and the nature of the job at issue will dictate what an appropriate individualized assessment will look like.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I strongly disagree with the Commission Decision that the FBI failed to do an individualized assessment. As the Decision describes, the FBI conducted a detailed simulation to test the range of vision of a person with monocular vision when clearing a room of dangerous persons, an essential function of a Special Agent. An FBI Engineer determined that <span id="Page_1217"></span>a person with reduced peripheral vision, such as Mr. Nathan, would lose approximately 35-38% of his or her vision when entering the room and that there would be approximately a five foot area that the individual would be unable to see. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Contrary to the Commission Decision, this type of study fulfills the requirement of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r) for an individualized assessment. The FBI did not simply decide that monocular vision was incompatible with safely performing key essential functions of a Special Agent but actually created a simulation of a dangerous situation to determine precisely what the impact would be for the field of vision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission, however, dismisses the FBI simulation and study as only looking at a "typical person with monocular vision" rather than at Mr. Nathan's specific condition and special qualifications. But, for people with monocular vision there will be reduced peripheral vision and depth perception. Indeed, the Commission Decision recognizes this is true for Mr. Nathan. Furthermore, the FBI did not rely solely on its simulation in determining that Mr. Nathan poses a direct threat, but looked at Mr. Nathan's specific condition. Mr. Nathan argued that he could safely perform the essential functions of an FBI Special Agent because of applicable prior experience and "special skills," which include compensating for his blind spot by turning his head until he can see what is hidden by the blind spot. The problem with Mr. Nathan's compensation measures, as he acknowledged, is that each time he shifts his head to compensate for his blind spot, his blind spot also shifts, creating a new blind spot. Mr. Nathan's compensation measure cannot eliminate the permanent blind spot of 45 degrees out of 180.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I am not suggesting that employers may always or solely, rely on general studies to make a showing of direct threat. A general study involving simulated performance of an essential function may be inappropriate for showing direct threat in some situations for a number of reasons, including if there are too many variations in the limitations experienced by people with a particular disability or if a certain individual with a disability has specific unique qualifications. But, where, as here, the limitations of the disability do not change, then a study such as the one conducted by the FBI can produce highly relevant evidence that an applicant poses a direct threat.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission states that the FBI should have taken into account any special qualifications such as prior successful experience in a similar position and adaptive or learned behaviors that compensate for physical limitations. But, the Commission fails to point to any special qualifications that would negate the FBI's finding of direct threat. The Commission ignores Mr. Nathan's concession that he has a permanent blind spot and that turning his head only moves the location of that blind spot but does not eliminate it. The Commission places great emphasis on Mr. Nathan's testimony of graduating from West Point, rising to the rank of Captain in the U.S. Army, receiving training in small unit tactics as an infantry officer, and performing over 75 combat patrols in Bosnia. But, the evidence suggests that most, if not all, of these experiences occurred prior to Mr. Nathan's development of monocular vision. In fact, Mr. Nathan was honorably discharged about a year after his surgeries. Indeed, the Decision concedes that "some of these activities occurred prior to [Mr. Nathan's] unsuccessful eye surgery and, to that extent, the simple existence of such activities is not probative evidence of the Complainant's present ability" to perform the FBI job safely. So why does the Decision criticize the FBI for failing to take into account evidence that the Commission either acknowledges is not probative or if it contends it is probative, fails to explain how or why it is probative? The Commission fails to specify even one prior activity in Mr. Nathan's job history that would eliminate or even lessen the significant risk of substantial harm in clearing a room caused by his permanent visual limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Commission chastises the FBI for failing to take into account "special skills" that Mr. Nathan believes would have permitted him to perform the job without posing a direct threat. But, the Commission does not identify a single special skill that would enable Mr. Nathan to overcome the irrefutable fact that he cannot see a significant portion of his field of vision. Importantly, the Decision points to no compensating behavior or reasonable accommodation that would give him the ability to clear a room quickly and accurately. As the Commission Decision notes "Complainant has no visual abilities that help him overcome his visual limitations in peripheral vision and field of vision." Yet, the Commission Decision hinges on a belief that unspecified "special skills," "learned behaviors," and "compensatory techniques" would eliminate the direct threat created as a consequence of having a permanent blind spot.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor does the Commission decision point to any evidence to explain how Mr. Nathan's prior training and experience in the Army (from which he was honorably discharged about a year after his surgeries) would enable him, today, to perform the Special Agent job safely despite his disability. In some jobs, seconds count and this is one of them. It may be a rare occurrence where an FBI Special Agent must clear a room, but if called upon to do so Mr. Nathan must be able to do it quickly and accurately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Commission Decision seems to rest on the FBI's failure to permit Mr. Nathan to demonstrate whether he poses a direct threat. In many instances a demonstration is a helpful way for an employer (and applicant) to determine if a direct threat would exist. But, I disagree that the lack of such a demonstration here, or in general, fatally undermines an employer's direct threat defense. The Rehabilitation Act (and the ADA) recognizes the need for flexibility in how employers make certain decisions. It is for that reason that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA are replete with factors to consider in making decisions rather than in prescribing one particular way to reach a legal conclusion. There is nothing in the statute or regulations that require an employer to set up a simulation involving an applicant to show the existence of a direct threat, and the absence of such a demonstration does not constitute a failure to do an individualized assessment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I believe there is sufficient evidence to support the FBI's contention that Mr. Nathan poses a direct threat that cannot be eliminated or reduced with reasonable accommodation. The Commission Decision points to no evidence to the contrary. And that is another of my problems with this Decision. The Commission Decision finds that the FBI failed to show direct threat and therefore the Commission Decision concludes that the Agency discriminated against Mr. Nathan by revoking its job offer. But, the Decision does not affirmatively find Mr. Nathan to be qualified. Remarkably, despite the lack of this required finding the Commission orders the FBI to treat Mr. Nathan as if he had been found to be qualified, and to reinstate its job offer and admit him to its next New Agent training classes. However, such remedies would only be available if the Commission had found that Mr. Nathan is qualified--something this Decision conspicuously fails to do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Decision criticizes the FBI for what it did not do in making a direct threat determination and goes to great length to detail types of evidence it believes the FBI should have explored. The Decision seems to implicitly assume that if the FBI had looked at all the evidence suggested by the Commission it (the FBI) would have concluded that Mr. Nathan is qualified. However, that is only speculation and ignores that it is at least equally possible that the result of additional evidence would be a finding that Mr. Nathan is unqualified. I am at a loss as to how the Commission can order the Agency to hire an applicant that the Commission has not even determined is qualified to do the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It seems to me that if the Commission believes that there is an inadequate direct threat defense, it should have remanded the case to the Administrative Judge with instructions on what the FBI was to do to complete a satisfactory direct threat analysis. After the FBI had done whatever additional steps the Commission felt were required for the individualized assessment, then the Commission should have examined the new evidence to determine if Mr. Nathan was or was not qualified. Instead, the Commission took the highly questionable position of ignoring whether or not the individual was qualified and focused only on the adequacy of the employer's affirmative defense. In essence, the Commission simply assumed that Mr. Nathan was qualified and required him to be hired. This sets the rather disturbing precedent that the Commission need not determine if an individual is qualified under the Rehabilitation Act before finding a violation of the law and ordering remedies. I find nothing in the statute or regulations that sanction this result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is deeply regrettable that Mr. Nathan, with his history of service to this country, has developed vision problems that prohibit him from serving as an FBI Special Agent, but the fact remains that the law provides that if an applicant is unable to perform even one of the essential functions of a job he is not a qualified individual with a disability under the law. After performing an individualized assessment of Mr. Nathan, the FBI concluded that he could not perform at least one of the essential functions of an FBI Special Agent: "clearing a room" and in fact, would add significant risk to an already dangerous situation. It is important that we not forget that this is not the typical work environment we are discussing here. We are talking about life threatening situations where a delayed response of mere seconds could mean death. I believe that the facts clearly demonstrate that Mr. Nathan was unqualified. Thus, the FBI had no obligation to reinstate his offer of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Decision is particularly disturbing to me because of the implications it will have for other law enforcement agencies. There is nothing in the Decision that limits its applicability to the FBI. It is common knowledge that all federal law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service, the Marshals Service (which protects federal courthouses and the flying public), and Customs and Border Patrol, have vision standards. This Decision appears to effectively raise the requirement for individualized assessments conducted to establish direct threat. There is no reason this new heightened requirement would not apply to all law enforcement agencies--not only federal law enforcement, but also state and local law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission relied on the <span class="Italic">Nathan</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Emiko S. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 012061130 (2016), which involved an applicant for an air traffic <span id="Page_1218"></span>control specialist position. The agency made a conditional offer of employment to the complainant, but rescinded its offer after she requested a waiver of the vision requirements of the position without conducting an individualized inquiry into her disability. The complainant prevailed on her disability discrimination claim, and the administrative judge ordered the agency to conduct an individualized assessment to determine the complainant's ability to perform the duties of an air traffic control specialist. Before the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Emiko S</span>., the complainant disputed that the agency properly conducted an individualized assessment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[That the agency's] offer to send her to the training does not comport with the AJ's order of an individualized assessment. The Agency offered Complainant the opportunity to attend the thirteen week training class as the individualized assessment, stating that there was no medical exam that it could rely upon to determine if Complainant could perform the essential functions of the job. Complainant countered that she believed that an individualized assessment would be a medical assessment that would last approximately one day. Additionally, Complainant stated that the training academy goes far beyond a "mere assessment of [Complainant's] physical ability to perform ATC job duties."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it did not fail to comply with the AJ's order because it offered Complainant an individualized assessment. The Agency stated that the only way it can determine if Complainant can safely perform the essential functions of an ATC position is to have Complainant use the actual equipment the ATCs use and that Complainant will need to be taught how to use the equipment at the training academy. Additionally, the Agency explained that, once Complainant filed her appeal on February 18, 2016, it suspended its processing of the AJ's decision, in order to wait for the OFO's decision on the appeal outlining the Agency's obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we note that there is a disagreement between the parties regarding what constitutes an individualized assessment, we will not substitute our judgment regarding what an individualized assessment should entail. We do note, however, that in <span class="Italic">Nathan v. Department of Justice (Federal Bureau of Investigation)</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070014 (July 19, 2013), the Commission, in a situation similar to the instant case, found that the Agency discriminated against the complainant when it rescinded his job offer without conducting an individualized assessment to determine if he could safely perform the functions of the offered position. In Nathan, the Commission found that the more appropriate remedy, among other things, was to simply reinstate the complainant's conditional offer of employment subject only to the normal pre-employment perquisites, e.g., a background investigation in that case. Here, we find that the AJ should not have ordered the Agency to conduct an individual assessment of Complainant, but should have simply directed the Agency to reinstate Complainant's conditional offer of employment from the point that it was withdrawn. We will modify the Agency's final order below, accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission denied the agency's request for reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Emiko S. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0520160486 (2016), specifically rejecting the agency's argument that its reliance on <span class="Italic">Nathan</span> was misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request for reconsideration, the Agency argues that rather than order it to perform a proper individualized assessment, as AJ-2 did, the Commission bypassed the individualized assessment altogether and ordered it to hire Complainant as an ATC. The Agency argues that an improperly administered individualized assessment or, as occurred in this case, no individualized assessment at all cannot substitute for a finding of no direct threat to safety, and the Commission filled this evidentiary gap by ignoring it. The Agency argues that <span class="Italic">Nathan</span> is distinguishable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's argument, we find that <span class="Italic">Nathan</span> is on point here. Many of the Agency's arguments closely resemble those that were rejected by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Nathan</span>. In <span class="Italic">Nathan</span>, once the Commission determined that the Agency failed to present an adequate direct threat defense, it ordered the agency in that case to reinstate the complainant's conditional offer of employment and allow the complainant the opportunity to successfully complete the background investigation and training program required of all other new hires. This is the same remedy we ordered in the instant ease. We further find that <span class="Italic">Floyd</span> is distinguishable from this case. Unlike in this case where it has been found the Agency did not conduct an individualized assessment, in <span class="Italic">Floyd</span> we found that we were unable to determine from the record if an adequate individualized assessment was accomplished and remanded for development of the record. In sum, the Agency has not established that our prior decision in this case, by relying on <span class="Italic">Nathan</span>, where it is clear the Commission thought through the correct remedy in situation like this case, was a clearly erroneous interpretation of law.</p>
