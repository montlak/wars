<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-78"><span id="Page_396"></span><span class="space">8.</span> Time Limits</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's procedures for resolving allegations of breach of settlement agreements are set forth at 29 CFR 1614.504:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Any settlement agreement knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by the parties, reached at any stage of the complaint process, shall be binding on both parties. Final action that has not been the subject of an appeal or civil action shall be binding on the agency. If the complainant believes that the agency has failed to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement or final decision, the complainant shall notify the EEO Director, in writing, of the alleged noncompliance within 30 days of when the complainant knew or should have known of the alleged noncompliance. The complainant may request that the terms of settlement agreement be specifically implemented or, alternatively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;The agency shall resolve the matter and respond to the complainant, in writing. If the agency has not responded to the complainant, in writing, or if the complainant is not satisfied with the agency's attempt to resolve the matter, the complainant may appeal to the Commission for a determination as to whether the agency has complied with the terms of the settlement agreement or final decision. The complainant may file such an appeal 35 days after he or she has served the agency with the allegations of noncompliance, but must file an appeal within 30 days of his or her receipt of an agency's determination. The complainant must serve a copy of the appeal on the agency and the agency may submit a response to the Commission within 30 days of receiving notice of the appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Prior to rendering its determination, the Commission may request that parties submit whatever additional information or documentation it deems necessary or may direct that an investigation or hearing on the matter be conducted. If the Commission determines that the agency is not in compliance and the noncompliance is not attributable to acts or conduct of the complainant, it may order such compliance or it may order that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased. Allegations that subsequent acts of discrimination violate a settlement agreement shall be processed as separate complaints under &#x00A7; 1614.106 or &#x00A7; 1614.204, as appropriate, rather than under this section.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the Commission's regulations require that a complainant first attempt to resolve any dispute over compliance with the agency. The agency has 35 days to cure any breach or to advise the complainant that it does not believe it is in breach of the agreement. Furthermore, it is not enough for the agency to advise the complainant in a cover letter to the settlement agreement of the 30-day time limit to allege noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Abe K. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120151611 (2016). Rather, according to the Commission in <span class="Italic">Abe K</span>., such a notification should be contained in the settlement agreement itself:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a threshold matter, we note in its final decision, the Agency found that Complainant's breach claim was untimely raised because Complainant did not contact the Agency's Acting Regional Director within thirty days from when Complainant knew or should have known of the alleged noncompliance, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504(a). The Agency determined that Complainant raised his breach claim more than thirty days after the March 11, 2014 incident. Specifically, the Agency stated that on May 31, 2005, the Acting Regional Director sent Complainant a copy of the instant settlement agreement along with a cover letter. The Agency stated that in the last paragraph of her cover letter, the Acting Regional Director informed Complainant "if you felt a need to reopen your complaint, you must contact her at that field office within 30 days of the Agency's non-compliance." We note, however, the settlement agreement does not contain a provision that Complainant should contact the EEO Director within thirty days from the alleged breached. Based on these circumstances, we find that Complainant timely raised his breach claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also, the process is slightly different from the normal OFO appeals process. The complainant is given 30 days from any final agency action on compliance to file an appeal. The appeal should be accompanied by a statement as to why the complainant believes the agency is not in compliance with the agreement. This is different from the standard OFO process, which allows an additional 30 days after the filing of the notice of appeal for submission of briefs.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agency cures a breach during the 35-day period after filing of the breach claim, it will be deemed to be in compliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Caballero v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A22127 (2003). It is important that an agency act within the 35-day window provided for in 1614.504(b). Failure to respond within the 35 days essentially divests the agency of jurisdiction over the claim of breach. Once the 35 days expire, the initial election as to specific performance or reinstatement of the complaint lies solely with the complainant. Even where an agency admits that it breached a settlement and offers to cure the breach, the Commission can still order the complaint reinstated where the agency's offer comes more than 35 days after it receives the appellant's allegation of breach. For example, in <span class="Italic">Zalewski v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01964684 (1997), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, the agency acknowledged that it breached Provision 2(b) of the settlement agreement. Specifically, the agency admitted that the Human Resources Management Service failed to provide appellant with specific information regarding what was necessary to meet the qualifications for the position in question after appellant submitted her updated qualifications in February 1995. The agency then stated that it was providing appellant with the necessary information in an effort to "correct" the breach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held that, pursuant to EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504 an agency has 35 days from the receipt of an appellant's allegation of breach to resolve the matter, or to cure any breach that has occurred<span class="Italic">. See Covington v. USPS</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01913211 (September 30, 1991), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920191 (March 12, 1992). However, in the case at hand, the agency did not take any action to cure the breach until August 29, 1996, that is, more than 35 days after receiving appellant's allegation of breach. Furthermore, we find the agency's actions insufficient in this case. Appellant submitted her updated qualifications in February 1995. In addition, it appears from the record that there was a vacant Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist position available at the agency in March 1996. Had Human Resources Management Services timely advised appellant of the requirements for the position, she would have had approximately one year to meet the qualifications therefor. Finally, EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(a) provides that a complainant may request either specific implementation of the terms of the settlement agreement, or that the oriGINAl complaint be reinstated for further processing. Appellant, in this case, chose the latter option.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon a review of the record herein, the Commission finds that the agency breached Provision 2(b) of the settlement agreement when it failed to specifically notify appellant what was required to meet the qualifications for the Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist position. Accordingly, the agency's decision not to reinstate appellant's complaint is REVERSED, and the complaint is hereby REMANDED to the agency for further processing in accordance with this decision and the applicable regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, once an allegation of breach is filed, the agency has the 35-day response period to cure any breach by complying with the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Pearson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12918 (2001). If the agency implements the terms of the agreement within that 35-day period, then no breach will be found. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01975986 (1998) (the agency has 35 days from notification by the complainant to cure a breach).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency does not respond to a claim of breach, the complainant acts properly by bringing the claim directly to the Commission and providing evidence to the Commission in support of the breach claim. <span class="Italic">Ralph v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01974175 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Ralph</span>, the parties entered into a settlement agreement that provided the agency would remove several disciplinary actions from the complainant's official personnel file, provide him with a neutral reference, and not disclose any information about the disciplinary actions to prospective employers. The parties also included a provision in the settlement that addressed the event of a breach. As a remedy, the agency agreed the complainant would be reinstated to his former position. The Commission upheld that remedy in <span class="Italic">Ralph</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In letters dated October 17, 1996, and February 4, 1997, complainant alleged that the agency had breached the SA. When the agency did not respond, complainant filed an appeal with the Commission in April 1997. By letter dated May 25, 1997, the Commission requested that the agency provide a copy of complaint file as well as any statement in support of its position. This information was never provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant states that, after learning that information in his OPF had resulted in his disqualification for a position with the U.S. Marshal's Service, he obtained a copy of his OPF from the Office of Personnel Management. Complainant states that the copy he received contained two Notification of Personnel Actions (SF-50s) referencing his 1991 suspension for insubordination. In this regard, complainant has submitted copies of the two SF-50s. The first SF-50 pertains to the suspension itself, stating that it became effective on August 4, 1991, and was for "insubordination." The second SF-50 denotes complainant's return to duty on August 14, 1991, following the suspension. Complainant contends that the presence of these documents in his OPF constitutes a breach of Provision 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also contends that the agency violated the SA when it provided certain information in conjunction with a Texas Army National Guard Flight Evaluation Board (FEB) hearing in 1996. Specifically, the record reveals that, in response to a request from the FEB, the agency forwarded documents pertaining to complainant's 1993 suspension and also provided a copy of the aforementioned MSPB decision. Complainant asserts that, insofar as the provision of these documents was not "required by law," providing them to the FEB violated Provision 5. Similarly, complainant argues that the agency violated that provision when it allowed a flight instructor to testify at the FEB hearing about complainant's refusal to fly the UH-60 helicopter and his proposed <span id="Page_397"></span>removal. As relief, complainant requests that the SF-50s referencing his August 1991 suspension be removed from his OPF. Additionally, he requests that, in accordance with Provision 7, he be reinstated to his former position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ralph</span> determined that the complainant acted properly by appealing the breach allegations directly to the Commission due to the agency's nonresponsiveness and found that the complainant presented evidence sufficient to prove breach of two of the provisions of the settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as the agency never responded to the complainant's breach allegations, the Commission finds that he was within his rights to appeal directly to the Commission. Furthermore, the Commission finds that, although the agency never supplied a copy of the case file, complainant has submitted sufficient evidence for the Commission to address his allegations. Having carefully considered that evidence, the Commission finds it is sufficient to conclude that the agency breached Provisions 3 and 5 of the SA. Specifically, it is undisputed that there were references to complainant's August 1991 suspension in his OPF several years after any such references were to have been expunged. Furthermore, the Commission finds that the agency's provision of certain information to the FEB was in violation of the SA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relief, the Commission finds that, in addition to attorney's fees, complainant is entitled to have the SF-50s removed from his OPF. Further, complainant is entitled to reinstatement to his former position, in accordance with Paragraph 7 of the SA.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the failure to respond to an allegation of breach within the 35-day time period does not divest the agency of jurisdiction where the agency, in fact, immediately cures the breach. For example, in <span class="Italic">Shon v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01962324 (1997), in a settlement, the agency agreed that the complainant would be sent to certain management meetings. The agency then assigned another employee to attend the next meeting. The complainant's lawyer wrote to the agency advising it of the breach and the agency reversed its decision to send the complainant to the meeting. The Commission found the agency was oriGINAlly in breach of the agreement, but had come into substantial compliance after being notified of the breach. The fact that the agency did not officially respond to the allegation of breach until some two years later did not change the fact that, without an official response, it complied with the agreement within the 35-day window. However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Shon</span> did issue this stern warning to the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency was initially in breach of the plain language of the settlement agreement when the decision was made not to send appellant to the March 1, 1994 regional meeting, and instead to send an employee who was not a member of the FPM Planning Group. However, it is undisputed that the agency subsequently reversed its decision, after receiving a letter of protest from appellant's attorney, and allowed appellant to attend the meeting. The Commission therefore finds that the agency was in substantial compliance with the language of the settlement agreement. However, the Commission is troubled by this situation in several ways. First, the Commission notes that appellant has alleged, without specific detail, that she is being continually forced into "fighting" for her rights under the settlement agreement. To the extent that this is the case, the agency is advised that full compliance with both the letter and the spirit of the settlement agreement is required. More troubling is the fact that it took the agency nearly two years to issue a final decision on appellant's February 25, 1994 breach claim. EEOC regulations anticipate the issuance of a final decision on a breach of settlement claim within thirty-five (35) days after the complainant has served the agency with allegations of noncompliance. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.504(b). As there was nothing unusual about appellant's allegation of noncompliance in the instant matter, the enormous delay in issuance of the final decision is inexcusable. The agency is reminded of its obligation to strictly adhere to the timelines provided for in the Commission's regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission made no comment on its own ability to adhere to time limits.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01971543 (1998), the Commission seemed to extend the holding in <span class="Italic">Shon</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Although subsection (a) of the regulation states that the complainant may request either reinstatement or specific enforcement, suggesting the remedy is at the option of the complainant, subsection (c) indicates the Commission will determine the appropriate remedy. In <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> the Commission swept aside an allegation of breach where the agreement specifically provided that reinstatement of the complaint was the proper remedy for breach. There was no dispute that the agency breached the agreement in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> by not providing a training plan within the specified time. However, because the agency cured the breach upon notification by the complainant, the Commission, relying upon its authority to determine the proper remedy, declined to reinstate the complaint. The net result is that under <span class="Italic">Zalewski</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the complainant can elect the remedy of reinstatement of the complaint or specific enforcement of the agreement, but under <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, the Commission retains the right to impose the choice of remedy, regardless of the complainant's election.</p>
<p class="noindent">The time period for filing an allegation of settlement breach may be extended where the agency misleads the complainant about the right to seek enforcement of the agreement<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Gray v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05950438 (1996). Likewise, the time limit may be extended where, in response to concerns that the agency is not complying, it issues a letter stating it has fully complied. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01964818 (1997), found that the complainant timely alleged an allegation of breach:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the specific facts of this case, we find that appellant raised her concerns regarding the alleged breach of her settlement in a timely manner. We note in this regard that appellant, by letter dated November 1, 1993, informed the agency of her concerns. Although the agency's 90 day compliance period did not expire until November 21, 1993, we find that the agency was placed on notice that appellant believed that major provisions were not being implemented. By letter dated December 2, 1993, the agency informed appellant that the settlement had been implemented and that the matter was now closed. Therefore, we find the agency's December 2, 1993 letter to be, for all intents and purposes, a final agency decision. The agency should have provided appellant with appeal rights to this Commission. To require appellant to renotify the agency of her concerns, after the expiration of the compliance period, would not have been reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complainants are required to file an allegation of breach within 30 days of when they were aware or reasonably should have been aware of the breach. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ochoa v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A11063 (2002). The time limit for a complainant to file an allegation of breach of a settlement agreement is not tolled if the complainant attempts to secure compliance through other means. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ferby v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A05523 (2001), the Commission found that the complainant's allegation of breach was untimely where he had first filed a grievance over the alleged failure to comply. In <span class="Italic">McCarty v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A12481 (2002), the Commission found that email messages to the agency's EEO office requesting proof of compliance was sufficient for timely claiming a breach of the agreement. Likewise, the Commission has set aside the requirement of notifying the agency in writing of any breach allegation where the complainant has orally notified EEO officials of her claims and provided those officials with copies of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rain v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24266 (2003). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Attorney General</span>, 0120093661 (2011), the Commission found that timely notification of an EEO officer at agency headquarters of an alleged breach of settlement agreement satisfied the notification requirements. The Commission noted that the EEO officer should have notified the complainant the breach allegation should have been filed with EEO director instead of instructing the complainant to initiate EEO counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">The time limit for raising an allegation of breach will be set aside where the complainant contacts an EEO specialist who, in turn, contacts the agency attorney involved in the settlement and the attorney requests time to resolve the matter. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140949 (2014), the attorney requested additional time to attempt to resolve the matter and assured the complainant that he could file a breach claim if the matter was not resolved. The Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the breach claim as untimely finding that the agency was responsible for the delay.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's regulations do not require that a complainant be made aware of the time limits for filing an allegation of breach of a settlement agreement--an oversight that it has been corrected through case law discussed below. One court has held that neither the agency nor the Commission has any legal obligation to advise a complainant of the time limits for seeking enforcement of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Bowden v. United States</span>, 106 F.3d 433 (D.C. Cir. 1997). However, as with other Title VII time limits, the time limit for seeking enforcement is subject to tolling and waiver. Moreover, an agency itself may waive the time limit if it addresses the merits of the breach claim without raising the question of timeliness.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bowden</span>, the complainant believed the agency breached the settlement agreement when it failed to pay all the taxes on his settlement. After corresponding with the agency seeking clarification of its position, the complainant filed an allegation of breach. However, the breach allegation was not filed until nearly a year after he first became aware the taxes were not paid. The agency did not raise the timeliness question in its own final decision or before the Commission. The complainant then sought enforcement in U.S. District Court. Once in court, the Immigration and Naturalization Service argued that jurisdiction was properly in the Court of Claims. The case was then transferred to the Court of Claims where INS argued that jurisdiction was properly in the District Court. In <span class="Italic">Bowden</span>, 106 F.3d at 437-39, the D.C. Circuit found that INS waived its timeliness defense by failing to assert it and giving the complainant the run-around:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16 (1994), gives the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission broad authority to enforce the Act's antidiscrimination mandate within the federal government, including responsibility for issuing regulations to control federal agencies' processing of discrimination complaints. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b). Pursuant to that authority, the EEOC has established detailed procedures for the administrative resolution of discrimination complaints, including a series of time limits for seeking informal <span id="Page_398"></span>adjustment of complaints, filing formal charges, and appealing agency decisions to the Commission. 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1613.201-283 (1991) (recodified at 29 CFR part 1614 (1996)). Complainants must timely exhaust these administrative remedies before bringing their claims to court. <span class="Italic">Brown v. GSA</span>, 425 U.S. 820, 832-33, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 1967-68, 48 L. Ed.2d 402 (1976); <span class="Italic">Bayer v. United States Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 956 F.2d 330, 332 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Like the suit-filing time limits contained in the Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c) (1994), the administrative time limits created by the EEOC erect no jurisdictional bars to bringing suit. Rather, functioning like statutes of limitations, these time limits are subject to equitable tolling, estoppel, and waiver. <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457-58, 112 L. Ed.2d 435 (1990) (statutory time limit); <span class="Italic">Jarrell v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 753 F.2d 1088, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (administrative time limit); <span class="Italic">see also Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 1132, 71 L. Ed.2d 234 (1982) (establishing same equitable principles apply to Title VII complaints against employers other than federal government).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court dismissed Count One because Bowden, by failing to comply with the thirty-day complaint-filing requirement contained in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.217(b) (1991), had not timely exhausted his administrative remedies. Because untimely exhaustion of administrative remedies is an affirmative defense, the defendant bears the burden of pleading and proving it<span class="Italic">. Brown v. Marsh</span>, 777 F.2d 8, 13 (D.C. Cir. 1985). If the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff then bears the burden of pleading and proving facts supporting equitable avoidance of the defense. <span class="Italic">Bayer</span>, 956 F.2d at 333; <span class="Italic">Jarrell</span>, 753 F.2d at 1091-92; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.214(a)(4) (1991) (recodified as amended at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.204(c)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the pleadings and undisputed documents in the record establish that Bowden failed to meet the thirty-day notification requirement. As his brief concedes, Bowden did not write to the INS about its alleged failure to pay all the required taxes on the settlement award until December 1991, nearly a year after Bowden received payment from the Government and, as his complaint acknowledges, eight months after notices from the IRS and the Maryland Tax Department alerted him that he owed tax on the settlement award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Bowden argues, as he did in his August 24, 1992, letter, that because he could not know that the INS had failed to comply with the settlement agreement until the agency clearly denied his allegations, the thirty-day clock did not begin to run until the INS first responded to his allegations of noncompliance on July 24, 1992. In some cases, notably where a complainant's knowledge of agency noncompliance depends on information in the government's possession, action by the agency may indeed be the appropriate trigger for the running of the thirty-day clock. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Aiken v. Reilly</span>, No. 90-0987-LFO, 1991 WL 126000, at *3 (D.D.C. June 26, 1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Aiken v. Browner</span>, No. 92-5151, 1993 WL 267511 (D.C. Cir. July 7, 1993); <span class="Italic">cf. Loe v. Heckler</span>, 768 F.2d 409, 418-19 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that when, because of information withheld by the government, a complainant neither knew nor reasonably could have known that the government had made a discriminatory employment decision, the limitations period for filing a discrimination complaint is tolled); <span class="Italic">Stoller v. Marsh</span>, 682 F.2d 971, 974 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (same). But this is not such a case. As both Bowden's pleading in the district court and brief on appeal admit, the documents that clearly notified him that the agency had failed to pay taxes he believed it had agreed to pay--tax bills from the IRS and the Maryland Tax Department--were in his possession, not the INS's. Because Bowden's receipt of those tax bills in April 1991 marked the beginning of the thirty-day limitations period, his December 1991 letter to the INS was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Attempting to escape the consequences of his failure to comply with the thirty-day complaint-filing requirement, Bowden relies on two equitable doctrines: tolling and waiver. In Title VII cases, equitable tolling of statutes of limitations can occur in several circumstances. For example, courts have excused parties, particularly those acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, who make diligent but technically defective efforts to act within a limitations period. <span class="Italic">Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96, 111 S. Ct. at 457-58. Like other courts, we have excused parties who were misled about the running of a limitations period, whether by an adversary's actions,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Gray v. Phillips Petroleum Co.</span>, 858 F.2d 610, 616 (10th Cir. 1988), by a government official's advice upon which they reasonably relied, <span class="Italic">Jarrell</span>, 753 F.2d at 1092, or by inaccurate or ineffective notice from a government agency required to provide notice of the limitations period, <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 79 F.3d at 162; <span class="Italic">Williams v. Hidalgo</span>, 663 F.2d 183, 187-88 (D.C. Cir. 1980). More generally, and in accord with EEOC regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.214(a)(4) (1991) (recodified as amended at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) (1996)), we have tolled time limits in Title VII cases when complainants neither knew nor had reason to know about the limit. <span class="Italic">Bayer</span>, 956 F.2d at 334.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Bowden advances several arguments for equitable tolling in his case, only one of which--that the INS failed to give him notice of the thirty-day charge-filing time limit--requires discussion. An agency's failure to give notice does not excuse the untimeliness of a complaint, unless the absence of notice misled the complainant about the time limit's operation. Yet Bowden makes no allegation that the INS's failure to give notice misled him. Moreover, we think the agency had no responsibility to notify him in the first place. Although either the Act or EEOC regulations require employing agencies or the Commission to give complainants notice of virtually every other time limit in the Title VII complaint process, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b)-(c) (1994); 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1613.214(a)(1), 1613.217(d), 1613.233(a), 1613.235(b) (1991), they do not require notice of the time limit on allegations of noncompliance with settlement agreements. While giving such notice would have been both sensible and simple--for example, when the INS negotiated the agreement or when it sent Bowden his settlement payment--the agency had no duty to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Bowden's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies in a timely fashion, however, does not end this matter. As in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Marsh</span>, 777 F.2d at 18, for a combination of equitable considerations, we think the INS waived this defense. To begin with, the agency never raised the thirty-day time limit during the administrative proceedings. Although agencies do not waive a defense of untimely exhaustion merely by accepting and investigating a discrimination complaint,<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 15; <span class="Italic">see also Boyd v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 752 F.2d 410, 414 (9th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Oaxaca v. Roscoe</span>, 641 F.2d 386, 390 (5th Cir. 1981), we have suggested that if they not only accept and investigate a complaint, but also decide it on the merits--all without mentioning timeliness--their failure to raise the issue in the administrative process may lead to waiver of the defense when the complainant files suit. <span class="Italic">See Saltz v. Lehman</span>, 672 F.2d 207, 208 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see also Brown</span>, 777 F.2d at 18 &#x0026; n.2 (Starr, J., dissenting); <span class="Italic">cf. Boyd</span>, 752 F.2d at 414; <span class="Italic">Scott v. Claytor</span>, 469 F. Supp. 22, 24 &#x0026; n.7 (D.D.C. 1978); Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(2) (allowing raising of properly preserved statute of limitations defense through trial). Because the INS responded to the merits of Bowden's complaint without ever questioning its timeliness, we think the agency now has no legitimate reason to complain about a judicial decision on the merits. Had it been concerned that information needed to resolve Bowden's complaint was stale or that deciding his case would upset settled expectations--traditional objectives of statutes of limitations--it could easily have raised the thirty-day limitation during the administrative process. What we have repeatedly stated regarding Title VII exhaustion requirements applies here as well: They are "'practical and pragmatic'...and should not be invoked when [they] serve [ ] no practical purpose." <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 79 F.3d at 165 (quoting <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 777 F.2d at 14 (quoting <span class="Italic">President v. Vance</span>, 627 F.2d 353, 363 (D.C. Cir. 1980))).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not only did the INS fail to question Bowden's timeliness during the administrative process, but it did not raise the issue either in response to Bowden's initial suit in district court or later when Bowden took his case to the Court of Claims. Moreover, the government's plainly contradictory responses to those two complaints--asserting before each court that the other had exclusive jurisdiction over Bowden's suit, arguments the Court of Claims denounced as creating a "jurisdictional merry-go-round"--prolonged Bowden's quest for resolution of his complaint by three years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, we do not intend to create a sweeping principle concerning waiver of administrative time limits under Title VII. Also as in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, however, a balancing of equities in this case--where the agency definitively responded to the merits of an employee's complaint without mentioning untimeliness, failed to raise untimeliness until the third round in court, and prolonged the litigation for years by shifting legal positions--leads us to conclude that the INS waived its defense of untimely exhaustion. The time has come for the Government's procedural run-around of Bowden to end and for a court to address his claim on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent">One effective way to eliminate such ordeals is to include, as a provision of the settlement agreement, the Commission's regulations on enforcement of settlement agreements. In that way, an agency can ensure that a complainant is advised of both the time limit and the procedures for pursuing a breach allegation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Bowden</span> case aside, in <span class="Italic">Mitchem-Baker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12025 (2001), the Commission found that failure to include the 30-day time limit in an agreement, along with the failure to inform the complainant that breach allegations are properly filed with the EEO office, warranted an extension of the time limit for filing a breach claim. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Mitchem-Baker</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the record, we find that [the] circumstances surrounding complainant's failure to timely raise the breach allegation with the agency's EEO office justify extending the time limit for doing so<span class="Italic">. Haggard v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960262 (November 25, 1997). Commission regulations specify that if a complainant believes that the agency breached a settlement agreement, she should contact the EEO Director within 30 days of when she knew or should have known of the alleged noncompliance. 29 CFR 1614.504(a). However, the time limits set forth in part 1614 are subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling. 29 CFR 1614.604. In the case before us, the settlement agreement fails to set forth the 30-day time limit for contacting the EEO office in the event of a breach. In fact, the agreement does not even advise complainant to <span id="Page_399"></span>contact the EEO Director should she suspect noncompliance. The file does not contain any documentation indicating that complainant had reason to be aware that she had 30 days to raise noncompliance allegations with the EEO complaints processing manager. Under the circumstances of this case, we will waive the time limit and examine the terms of the settlement agreement. We also suggest that the agency review its standard forms covering EEO settlement agreements, and consider adding language specifying all of the time limits set forth in 29 CFR 1614.504.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed its decision by denying the agency's request for reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Mitchem-Baker v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A10840 (2002). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A02946 (2002) (waiving the time limit for filing a claim of breach where neither the time limit nor the proper official to contact with a breach allegation was included in the agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission regulations require that an allegation of breach be filed with the agency's EEO director, in <span class="Italic">Hottle v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120130135 (2013), the Commission rejected an agency argument that the breach appeal was improperly before the EEOC because the complainant sent his allegations of breach to the agency representative who negotiated the agreement. The Commission further noted that the agency representative had responded to the allegations contending the agency was in full compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cherry v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 01A50370 (2005), the Commission rejected an agency argument that it lacked jurisdiction to enforce an agreement because the agreement was entered after the time period for requesting reconsideration expired and, thus, the Commission's appellate decision was a final resolution of the case. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserts that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the instant appeal because the time period for complainant to have filed a request for reconsideration with the Commission, regarding her underlying complaint, had expired at the time the parties entered into the settlement agreement. We disagree. Commission regulations provide that "[a]ny settlement agreement knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by the parties, reached at any stage of the complaint process, shall be binding on both parties." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504(a) (emphasis added). We note that the Commission encourages the settlement of EEO complaints and has a strong policy of preserving complainant's EEO rights. Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO MD-110), 12-1,5-17, (November 9,1999). In addition, provision (3) makes reference to complainant's underlying EEO complaint. Specifically, provision (3) provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[complainant] agrees to waive, release, and abandon, and also not to initiate or pursue, any claims, grievances, other administrative procedures, or lawsuits against the United States, the [agency],...for any issues already raised or that could have been raised by [complainant] as a result of the events giving rise to her allegations in FCC-EEO-97-3, EEOC Appeal No. 01990569.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the record is devoid of evidence that complainant filed a civil action with respect to her underlying EEO complaint. Based on these circumstances, we find that the parties executed the settlement agreement during the administrative process; therefore, the Commission has jurisdiction over complainant's appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further noted that the complainant's time period for filing a civil action had not expired at the time the parties entered into the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The agency may not raise the complainant's failure to timely file a breach allegation for the first time on appeal. <span class="Italic">Casa v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A52738 (2006), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span> 05A60698 (2006).</p>
