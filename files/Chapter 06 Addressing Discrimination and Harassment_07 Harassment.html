<h2 class="h2">HARASSMENT</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Harassment and bullying at work can be stressful and annoying for the employees it impacts. It can also be unlawful if it violates merit systems principles or equal employment opportunity laws. Harassment that violates EEO laws is unwelcome verbal or physical conduct that is:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Based on an employee's race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability, genetic information, or prior EEO activity.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> So severe or pervasive that it unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">The negative impact of workplace harassment can be costly in terms of lost productively, low morale, and loss of diversity. Add the possibility of legal expenses, and an agency that tolerates harassment could be asking for big trouble.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Your role.</b> Although it would be ideal for federal agencies to prevent harassment from occurring altogether, this isn't always realistic with such a large and diverse workforce. More realistic goals are to create an environment where harassment is strongly discouraged and to properly respond to harassment claims when they arise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">These goals are reflected in EEO law, which provides that an agency can avoid responsibility for harassment, or at least minimize the scope of its responsibility, when managers do all they can to stop it and make sure it doesn't happen again.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>The front line.</b> You may be the first person an employee contacts to complain about perceived harassment, or you may actually witness harassing conduct. Whether or not EEO principles apply, you can use your position to make positive changes, if needed. Your awareness of the issues involved and how to respond to claims of harassment will help your agency steer clear of hot water.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You play a crucial role in addressing harassment, but remember to consult your HR office if you need advice on whether certain conduct is actually prohibited or on how to handle situations involving harassment.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Recognizing hostile work environment harassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Claims of harassment are relatively common in the federal workplace. With a large workforce and varied work environments, there is bound to be a certain amount of conflict about what constitutes appropriate behavior. A comment that is a joke to one employee may be offensive to another. Managers carry a good deal of responsibility for keeping on top of employee activity and recognizing potential problems.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Two types of harassment are recognized:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Harassment that leads to an adverse employment action.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Harassment that creates a hostile work environment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Hostile work environment harassment is much more common and will be the focus here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Hostile work environment</b> is unwelcome verbal or physical conduct based on an employee's race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability, genetic information, or prior EEO activity that is so severe or pervasive that it unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In assessing whether a hostile work environment exists, all of the circumstances must be considered, including:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The frequency of the conduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The severity of the conduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether physical contact was involved.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether the conduct was hostile or clearly offensive.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">A few relatively mild comments or actions usually are not enough to create a hostile work environment, but if such conduct occurs frequently over a period of time, it could add up to create a hostile work environment. Further, a single incident that is particularly offensive, such as the use of a racial slur or an intimate touching, may be severe enough to create a hostile work environment all by itself. Here are some examples to help you discern between the two:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A male supervisor leaned close to a female employee on two occasions. It was not enough to create a hostile work environment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A manager used Christmas decorations in a main office. This was not so offensive that it created a hostile work environment for a Jewish employee who occasionally passed through the office. The decorations -- a Christmas tree, wreath, icicle lights, garland, and Santa Claus -- were not religious.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was subjected to a hostile work environment when a coworker stuck his tongue in her ear.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A coworker created a hostile work environment for a lesbian employee when she regularly expressed her disapproval of same-sex marriage and made disparaging comments related to sexual orientation even after being told that her remarks were offensive.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> After an employee rejected a coworker's request for a date, the coworker created a hostile work environment over a period of four years by making negative comments about the employee to coworkers and clients, disrupting her work, following her, and physically bumping her several times a week.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A coworker created a religiously hostile work environment for an employee when she routinely quoted scripture, made religious comments, initiated religious discussions, and loudly sang religious hymns in the employee's presence.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> Don't assume that inappropriate conduct is OK just because employees aren't complaining. Employees may not complain for any number of reasons. You are not fulfilling your duty as a manager if you fail to recognize and address a potential hostile work environment, regardless of whether employees are complaining or not. If you wait until an EEO complaint is filed, you could be faulted for failing to take proper action in a timely manner.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Responding to unwelcome conduct that is not discriminatory</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">You're bound to have employees approaching you about the behavior of coworkers. When deciding how to respond to the complaint, you have to take into account the nature of the complaint, the nature of the complainer, and the culture of your workplace.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the harassment is motivated by any of the bases protected by EEO laws, such as race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability, genetic information, or prior EEO activity, you'll need to take action, which we will outline later. If not, you still need to assess whether the conduct should be addressed in order to prevent it from becoming a problem.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not only can harassment violate merit system principles, but allowing any type of harassment or bullying to continue unchecked can lead to poor workplace morale and have an impact on employee productivity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Your assessment of potentially harassing conduct could include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>The atmosphere of your workplace.</b> If your workplace is generally relaxed and casual, an occasional joke or a little teasing may be normal, but take into account the nature of the joking when you assess the situation. There is a difference between a casual work environment and a lack of leadership that allows for bullying. If your workplace requires more formal conduct, it might make sense to stop the reported conduct immediately to maintain an appropriate atmosphere.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>The nature of the work.</b> If the work you do is so serious or stressful that teasing or joking relieves the pressure, you might want to think twice before clamping down on good-natured conduct. On the other hand, if joking and teasing gets in the way of employees doing their jobs, it needs to be stopped right away.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Whether ignoring the behavior would encourage misconduct.</b> Some employees have a sense of where to stop when it comes to workplace banter, but others don't. Overlooking pranks, hostile behavior, or questionable comments may encourage some employees to take their conduct to a level that creates a discriminatory hostile work environment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Employee objections.</b> Although some employees are the grown-up equivalent of school yard tattletales, complaints about teasing and joking shouldn't be ignored. If employees are complaining about conduct that seems like good-natured fun to you, it could be a signal that you need to reassess how you view employee interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">If you have any concerns about how to react to employee conduct that seems inappropriate, check with your manager or your HR office for guidance.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Responding to claims of coworker harassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">It's likely that you will be called upon to handle claims of harassment raised by employees against their coworkers. As with any claim of harassment, whether or not you think discrimination occurred, you should take five critical steps:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Listen.</b> Listen to the employee's claim.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Investigate.</b> Immediately conduct an investigation that is sufficient under the circumstances to determine if the employee's claims could be true.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Take action, if warranted.</b> If you think harassment has occurred, take the action necessary to stop it and ensure that it doesn't happen again.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Follow up.</b> Once you have responded to the initial complaint, check back promptly with the employees involved to make sure the situation is resolved. It may take more than one intervention to adequately address the problem. If you feel you need support, call your HR or EEO office.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Document.</b> Make a timely record of your discussions, your investigation, and the outcome of any action you took as a result of the complaint.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee has been subjected to discriminatory harassment, your action will make all the difference in whether the agency will be found responsible. If an immediate investigation is taken and any harassment is conclusively stopped, your agency generally will not be held liable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the other hand, if you know or should have known about coworker harassment, but fail to take appropriate action, your agency could be held responsible for the harassment and any mental or physical harm the victim suffers as a result. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An agency was found responsible for the harassing conduct of a coworker because it essentially ignored the victim's claims that the coworker was intimidating him with verbal abuse based on his national origin. Although the agency reassigned the offending coworker to another unit, it didn't take any further disciplinary actions when the coworker's misconduct continued.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A female employee subjected a male employee to sexual harassment by making unwelcome vulgar comments, propositioning him, displaying sexually explicit material, and exposing herself during a three-month period. The employee reported the coworker's conduct to management but was forced to continue working in the same area with her. The agency's response, a verbal admonishment, didn't stop the harassment. Because the agency failed to immediately conduct an investigation and take the steps necessary to stop the coworker's harassment, it was responsible for the hostile work environment she created.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee complained to supervisors about three coworkers who had pictures of scantily clad women in their offices. She was initially told to ignore the pictures, even though they were in places she couldn't avoid. After one of the coworkers was told to remove the pictures, the employee began finding similar pictures on her desk and around her cubicle. Catalogs for undergarments and sex toys also appeared on her desk. A supervisor held a meeting to address the situation, but the incidents continued. Because management didn't take the actions necessary to stop the harassment, the agency was found responsible for creating a hostile work environment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Coworkers created a hostile work environment for an employee when they made numerous disparaging comments and otherwise ostracized him because of his disability. The agency could not avoid responsibility for the harassment because management clearly was aware of the coworkers' inappropriate treatment but did nothing beyond distributing pamphlets about his medical condition.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>An appropriate response.</b> A response to harassment that is prompt and appropriate will depend on:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The facts of the case.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The severity and persistence of the harassment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Whether your initial response proves effective.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Essentially, whatever the facts of the case, you and your agency are required to do whatever is necessary to stop harassing behavior and keep the harassment from recurring. In the case of persistent harassment, you may have to take stronger action against the perpetrators if more moderate measures do not stop the harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Perpetrators of harassment could be subject to:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Oral or written warning or reprimand.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Transfer or reassignment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Demotion.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reduction of wages.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Suspension.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Discharge.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Training or counseling.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Monitoring by supervisors to ensure the harassment stops.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Document.</b> Make sure to document your response to harassment. Recording your actions and the reasons for them will help establish that you took appropriate action and also provide support for any further disciplinary actions you may need to take.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you need guidance with regard to appropriate discipline for discriminatory harassment, check with your chain of command or your HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> You cannot penalize an employee for reporting that they are the victim of discriminatory harassment. Don't force the employee to take an unwanted reassignment or move to an undesirable location in order to separate them from the harasser. If a separation is needed, the employee accused of harassment must be the one who moves or is reassigned unless the employee who raised the claim volunteers to make a change.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Romantic relationships.</b> Although your instinct may be to avoid becoming involved in affairs of the heart, you may need to step in if a workplace romance goes bad and one employee accuses the other of sexual or sex-based harassment. As with any claim of discriminatory harassment, you will need to conduct an immediate investigation and take the action needed to stop any unlawful harassment found.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Responding to harassment of employee by another supervisor</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">You can play a significant role in recognizing potential discriminatory harassment by another supervisor and helping your agency take action to stop it. If you notice a manager harassing subordinates, you may not have the authority to address it yourself, but you can respond appropriately by immediately notifying upper-level management. Your willingness to take action could make a big difference in your agency's responsibility for the harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You are obligated to respond to harassment when you see it. Harassment can violate EEO laws, but it can also violate merit system principles. You have a duty to ensure that all employees have a fair workplace. It's the law, and it's simply good management. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A supervisor subjected an employee to a hostile work environment because of her pregnancy. The agency was faulted because other supervisors and employees witnessed the frequent harassment, but no one took any action to stop it.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An agency claimed that it was unaware of a supervisor's sexual harassment because the employee victim didn't report it. However, the agency was found responsible because the supervisor's many lewd comments and actions were seen by managers and other employees, but no one took action to stop the supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">As with coworker harassment, an agency's response to an employee's claims of supervisory harassment cannot penalize the employee:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee complained he was being subjected to sexual harassment by a female supervisor who flirted with him and repeatedly exposed him to lewd behavior. In response, the agency reassigned him away from the supervisor. The agency was found responsible for failing to properly respond because it penalized the employee by reassigning him to an undesirable shift, leaving him no other option to avoid the offending supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Responding to harassment by an outside individual</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Managers may not feel they have much control over the actions of individuals outside the agency, including contractors, clients, vendors, and customers. However, because employees are entitled to a workplace free of discriminatory harassment, managers must take the actions necessary to protect their employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The proper response will depend on the specific circumstances involved, but it must be aimed at stopping the harassment and making sure it doesn't recur. Here are a couple more examples:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee claimed he was harassed because he was Native American when an agency client repeatedly referred to him in a racially derogatory manner. A management official met with the client on one occasion and told him his conduct would not be tolerated, but this action didn't stop the client's misconduct. The agency was found responsible for the harassment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee who worked in a prison was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment by an inmate who repeatedly exposed himself to her and ultimately assaulted her. The agency was responsible for the inmate's misconduct because it took no action after the employee complained on several occasions about the lewd conduct. He was sent to another housing unit and then to another prison facility only after he sexually assaulted the employee.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">If you aren't sure how to respond to harassment of an employee by outside individuals or groups, check with your manager or your HR office.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Responding when you, as a supervisor, are accused of harassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">It is understandable that your initial reaction to a discriminatory harassment claim naming you as the perpetrator would be feelings of hurt or anger. You need to control those feelings. If you react badly to an employee's EEO complaint -- or to any EEO activity by an employee, whether or not it is directed at you -- you may make things worse for your agency by providing a new basis for a complaint: reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Reprisal for raising a harassment claim.</b> Reprisal, also known as retaliation, occurs when a manager, supervisor, or sometimes even a coworker, takes action against an employee because that person raised a claim of discriminatory harassment or another EEO claim or was somehow involved in EEO matters.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprisal, which is prohibited by EEO laws, can take many forms. A manager may take an adverse employment action against an employee, such as an unwanted reassignment, a demotion or even a termination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A manager might also subtly threaten the employee by making comments or remarks that make the employee think twice about engaging in EEO activity. This is called chilling conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Finally, and most significant here, a manager might subject the employee to harassment because of that employee's EEO activity. A manager who is unable to control the strong feelings caused by an EEO complaint might make negative comments, take actions, or ostracize the employee in a manner that creates a hostile work environment for the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Don't let emotions rule your actions.</b> The worst thing about retaliation complaints, from an agency's point of view, is that they may succeed even when an employee's original EEO activity fails. This suggests you should take extra care with your behavior whenever you become aware that an employee has engaged in EEO activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an employee who files an EEO complaint isn't immune from discipline or other agency actions, you should be very careful to take only those actions that are merited, supported, and consistent with actions you would take against other employees under the same circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many EEO complaints are based on simple misunderstandings. If you stay calm and professional, avoid retaliation, and cooperate in good faith with the EEO process and the attempts to achieve resolution, the complaint may be resolved or dismissed early in the process. Here are a couple examples:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was subjected to retaliation after she filed a sexual harassment complaint against her supervisor. The supervisor referred her to the agency's Employee Assistance Program, issued her a letter of warning, and refused to accept her medical documentation in support of sick leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee was subjected to retaliation by upper-level management when his supervisory duties were removed, and he was harassed after he tried to stop workers in an office from harassing another employee based on her race.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Subordinate harassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">What if you find yourself in a situation where you believe you are being harassed or bullied by one of your subordinate employees and you haven't been able to resolve the problem? This can impact your work performance by reducing your effectiveness as a supervisor and undermining your authority in the eyes of other subordinates or coworkers. Obviously, this puts you in a very difficult and awkward position, especially if you don't feel you have sufficient authority to effectively stop the subordinate's misconduct, discriminatory or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you feel comfortable doing so, you should first contact your supervisor and let them know what's going on. Ideally, your supervisor will listen to you, treat the situation the same as any other allegation of harassment, and investigate. Then, if your supervisor finds harassment has occurred, they can take the action necessary to stop it and ensure that it doesn't happen again.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, your supervisor may not take your claim of subordinate harassment seriously. Your supervisor may hold the opinion that "management controls the workplace," and therefore you cannot become a victim of harassment. Or your supervisor may not want to interject themselves into the situation. Also, your supervisor may investigate and determine no action is necessary on their part, or the measures taken may not resolve the situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you feel upper-level management has not been supportive, you have every right to file an EEO complaint like any other federal employee. If you raise a claim of harassment, your complaint is more likely to succeed under these circumstances if you are prepared to provide specific evidence of the harassing conduct, establish a discriminatory motive, and explain why you are unable to address it yourself.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Bystander intervention</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">To effectively prevent and address harassment, managers must lead by example and show a sustained commitment that ingrains bystander intervention into the agency culture. Simply ensuring employees attend harassment training and follow antiharassment policies is not enough to stop harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The term "bystander intervention" encompasses situations where a witness somehow disrupts the harassing conduct and later reports the conduct through appropriate channels as necessary. Bystander intervention can come in a variety of forms, such as distracting or addressing the harasser, interrupting the inappropriate conduct, or somehow getting the target out of the situation. Investing in bystander intervention has many benefits for the workforce, but two of the most prominent are:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> It dissuades individuals from engaging in harassment because they know that others will hold to the "see something, say something" philosophy.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> It increases productivity by making employees feel they are valued and respected.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">Some employees might fear they will be subjected to retaliation for speaking up when they see harassment. To create an environment where individuals feel safe enough to raise concerns about harassment, you should work with HR to institute a framework for action that educates employees to intervene effectively, disciplines harassers, and helps targets of harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Consider the following best practices to make bystander intervention efforts successful.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Provide multiple ways to intervene.</b> Giving your employees specific scenarios and examples of what to say or how to respond when they see harassment will help them know what to do should they see someone being harassed. Work with HR to tailor any such training to reflect the situations that could occur within your workforce. Make sure the training covers safety considerations for both the intervenor and the target, particularly when trying to diffuse hostile situations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Going over specific scenarios and providing options on how to respond will empower bystanders to intervene. Once people start to speak up and step in to stop the inappropriate behaviors, others will see that putting a stop to bad behavior is acceptable and encouraged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When seeing harassment, bystanders can intervene in numerous ways, depending on their comfort level, such as by:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Interrupting the interaction between the harasser and the target.</b> They can ask to speak to one of them privately or pretend to need one of them for a work-related reason. This type of a mild interruption would alert the harasser that someone else is watching, which may often, but not always, help stop the conduct at least temporarily.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Telling the harasser the conduct is inappropriate in a respectful but direct way.</b> Speak to the individual in private rather than providing a public reprimand. Consider bringing a witness into the conversation when explaining why the witnessed behavior was inappropriate.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Raising a new topic or question.</b> This serves to de-escalate a situation that involves an individual berating another employee.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Protect individuals from retaliation.</b> If an intervenor tells you about an employee's harassing conduct, you must listen to them and take appropriate action. This includes ensuring that neither the intervenor nor the target will be subjected to retaliation. Even if the intervenor points out something you may have said or done that could have been considered harassment, you must listen and address the situation in a non-retaliatory manner.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also, consider providing counseling resources for both victims and the harassers, whose poor behavior could have been related to unknown troubles or challenges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Instill responsibility and accountability.</b> If harassment occurs, employees must follow the agency's antiharassment policy for reporting it. Just like the "see something, say something" mantra echoed throughout mass transportation systems to prevent terrorism, reporting harassment should be an integral part of each employee's duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once notified, managers must take appropriate action to stop the harassment and hold the harasser accountable if an inquiry or investigation concludes harassment occurred. Taking appropriate disciplinary action sends harassers the message that their misconduct will have consequences. If no action is taken, employees engaging in harassment will become emboldened, which will likely lead to lower staff morale and decreased productivity, as well as successful EEO complaints.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Cyberharassment</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Workplace harassment is no longer limited to the traditional four walls of the workplace. The wide use of social media allows employees additional opportunities for engaging in harassment. Inappropriate electronic communication that creates a hostile work environment for an employee is no different than in-person communication. If a remark would be inappropriate in the conference room, then an employee should not be making a similar comment in the "virtual conference room" via social media.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The challenge, however, is that employees may be more likely to say inappropriate things on Facebook or other social media platforms than when they are face-to-face with others. To avoid having to discipline employees for cyberharassment (also called online harassment), managers should work with HR to ensure employees are reminded of their responsibilities periodically and understand that antiharassment policies still apply when employees are working from home or when using their personal devices. Even if your agency has not updated its antiharassment policy to cover social media, the prohibition against cyberharassment still applies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Examples of cyberharassment include actions such as:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Posting mean or hateful comments or content about any race, religion, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics online.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Sending unwanted suggestive or lewd emails, shared social media posts, or blogs.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Having a sexual image as a screensaver.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Making comments on appearance, clothing, or anatomy.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Doxing, which refers to online harassment used to destroy people's privacy by publicizing their social security number, phone number, address, or credit card information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Red flags for potential virtual harassment.</b> Watch out for red flags indicating an employee may be engaging in harassing behavior or may have been targeted by a harasser. For example, if an employee becomes quieter or withdrawn during virtual meetings or reluctant to be on camera during video calls, you should talk to the person to make sure everything is alright.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Red flags indicating someone may be the harasser can include inappropriate dress, posting inappropriate comments in chats, signs of alcohol or substance abuse combined with other behavior, or offensive photos, signs, or home decor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Take steps to prevent cyberharassment.</b> You can decrease the likelihood of harassment occurring in virtual settings by:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Requiring employees to have a standard virtual meeting background.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reducing or limiting one-on-one meetings. Ensuring Zoom calls have at least three people can help prevent misconduct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Not having or discouraging work-related virtual events with alcohol, which reduces social inhibitions and impairs judgment, and therefore provides a greater opportunity for harassment. Instead of virtual happy hours, consider non-alcohol related coffee breaks or something similar.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Prohibiting employees from screensharing or recording meetings unrelated to work to avoid inappropriate use of such content.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Setting clear conduct rules for when and how to use digital messaging apps and chats, For example, you should discourage late night messages and private one-on-one workgroups where people think they have the privacy to be inappropriate.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Educating workers on inappropriate use of emojis in digital messages. Although messages may start with seemingly innocuous wink and heart emojis, employees can escalate to flirtation by sending lip, kiss, or sexualized emojis, all of which should be avoided. In addition, emojis can often be misunderstood on misinterpreted. For example, many people use the open palm waving hands emoji to convey applause -- a hand motion which is commonly known as applause in the United States because of the parallel American Sign Language motions for applause. However, in Chinese culture, flapping hands means an invitation for sexual activity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Reporting harassment.</b> As a manager, you are obligated to act if you know or should have known about any cyberharassment. Bystanders should be encouraged to report any online harassment by coworkers that they witness. To limit any potential liability, if an employee reports any online harassment to you or you see such posts yourself, you must take appropriate steps to stop the harassing conduct using your antiharassment policy. If no action is taken, the target of the harassment has a stronger basis for an EEO complaint because the agency should have known about the harassment and taken steps to stop the conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Discipline.</b> Similar to on-duty harassment, managers can hold employees accountable for off-duty online harassment. Antiharassment policies apply to social media and prohibit any form of cyberharassment of employees even when posted from a personal device at home. If an investigation finds that someone under your purview engaged in harassment, work with HR to determine the appropriate course of discipline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Off-duty conduct.</b> As noted, the law does not limit the prohibition of harassment to the workplace. Agencies are liable for off-duty or off-premises cyberharassment when the conduct has a nexus -- or connection -- to the workplace and would be intimidating to a reasonable person. Generally, showing a connection to the workplace requires more than simply showing two individuals have an employment relationship, such as being coworkers. However, if the harassment is egregious enough, you have an argument that the misconduct affects the efficiency of the service and the employee's ability to perform the job. As a manager, when pursuing discipline for harassment, work with the appropriate HR or employee/labor relations specialist.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Monitoring private email and posts using agency resources.</b> Employees also should be aware that the law allows agencies to monitor employee email and technology use because courts generally agree that they do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when using government technology. This includes work email, any private emails stored on the work computer, and internet usage history, such as accessing private email or visiting social media sites.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to investigate a claim of harassment.</b> The intensity of your investigation depends on the circumstances, but you should follow up on any claim of harassment.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Refuse to respond to a claim that involves a romantic relationship</b>. Although it may be your instinct to avoid matters that involve romantic entanglements between employees, agencies are responsible for preventing workplace harassment that results from a relationship gone sour.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Assume inappropriate comments or jokes are welcome if employees don't complain.</b> Workplaces vary with regard to the jokes and comments that are considered acceptable, but jokes and comments that are demeaning to a protected group may add up over time to create a hostile work environment for an employee who is afraid to speak up.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Fail to act because the harassment isn't based on a protected EEO basis</b>. Harassment and bullying of any employee, even on a nondiscriminatory basis, must be addressed.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Take an EEO complaint personally.</b> It is tough to keep your cool when you or your colleagues are charged with discrimination, but it is in your and your agency's interest to remain calm and professional.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Treat employees who raise claims of harassment unprofessionally.</b> Although harassment claims may be difficult to address, don't take your frustrations out on the employee who makes the claim. You risk making things worse with a claim of retaliation.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Disparage or retaliate against any participant.</b> If you express your displeasure at the participation of employees in an investigation, whether as employees, witnesses, or representatives, or take any action against them not otherwise justified, you open yourself up to a separate EEO complaint of retaliation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What can I do to prevent a claim of harassment?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You can't really do anything to prevent this or any other EEO complaint because employees are free to file EEO complaints as they wish. However, you can take actions that will help ensure harassment claims are minimized and the ones that are filed aren't successful. You can also set the proper tone for your workplace by treating all of your employees and colleagues with respect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How do I know if certain conduct is unlawful harassment?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> This often depends on the specific circumstances involved, but unlawful harassment is generally conduct that is focused on a protected basis, such as race, national origin, disability, color, religion, sex, age, genetic information, or prior EEO activity and unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. If you are concerned that harassment may be occurring, you should investigate further or contact your HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Everyone in my workplace seems fine with crude jokes and name-calling. It's just the way we are. Why should I have to play the heavy by stopping it?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> As the manager, you are responsible for ensuring that you provide your employees with a fair workplace that is free from discriminatory harassment. Even if no one complains, when employee comments and conduct create a hostile working environment, you must take action. You may have employees who are uncomfortable complaining or who have decided the jokes are going too far. You don't want to wait until an EEO complaint tells you that things have gotten out of hand.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Two of my employees were dating. After they broke up, one employee accused the other of harassment at work, including stalking and crude comments. Do I have to do anything about this?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Although your instinct may be to avoid involvement in a romance gone bad, you are responsible for maintaining a workplace free of discriminatory harassment. Therefore, you must immediately investigate the harassment claims and take the action necessary to stop any unlawful harassment you discover.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What should I do if I'm uncertain about the proper course of action in a situation potentially involving harassment or retaliation?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Check with your HR or EEO office. The staff working in these offices will be able to advise you on how to proceed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What are my responsibilities for off-duty harassment that occurs on Facebook or a similar social media platform?</b></p>
