<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-91"><span class="space">d.</span> Prompt Action and Investigations</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Commission envisions that the agency will promptly investigate claims of harassment and promptly take effective corrective action. Whether those actions are prompt will be determined based on the difficulty and complexity of the investigation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120130342 (2015). In general, investigations should begin, however, within days, not weeks. When the agency promptly investigates an allegation of sexual harassment and finds no evidence in support of the allegation, it is not required to take action against the alleged offender in order to avoid liability. <span class="Italic">Flores v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52072 (2005). When an agency initially fails to take prompt and effective corrective action, liability for harassment will attach even where the agency subsequently acts. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123232 (2015)</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of the complexity of the investigation, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120130342 (2015), the Commission found that the agency took prompt and effective correction action even where the investigation itself took some two years:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant complaint, we observe that Complainant received on May 6, 2008, a letter allegedly from an entity that stated he had contacted the entity for purposes of defending him against charges being brought by the Agency. The charges pertained to engaging in sexual activity with child prostitutes overseas, violating government ethics involving his personal business, and conspiring with foreign nationals to break currency, ethics and conspiracy laws. It is clear that the nature of the letters at issue was sufficiently severe to constitute harassment. The letters were not sent within Complainant's workplace, but they were related to his work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant informed the Agency on May 14, 2008, that he and his neighbors received letters containing malicious and slanderous content. The Agency promptly assigned a Special Agent on May 14, 2008, to investigate the situation. Within three and a half months, the Special Agent learned that the letters had been mailed in the Northern Virginia area, he had received from another Special Agent anonymous letters mailed between October and December 2007, that targeted the Director of Facilities Management for Overseas Building Operations, he submitted the letters to the Forensic Document Laboratory for analysis, he learned that the Forensic Document Laboratory had determined that the letters targeting Complainant and the Director were from the same printer, a Lexmark C912, and he became aware that the printer had been shipped in 2004 to a Richmond-based company. The Special Agent was told by a former employee of that company that the coworker had visited the company between 2002 and 2005 and received a printer from the company's President, and he was also informed by the company's former Comptroller that the coworker had visited the company on numerous occasions. In November 2008, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's computer forensics division discovered the coworker's declaration in an EEO complaint from his computer had been printed by a Lexmark C912 printer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In January 2009, the Special Agent interviewed the company's president and in June 2009, the Special Agent interviewed the coworker. In August 2009, the Special Agent obtained documents from the coworker's complaints and submitted them to Homeland Security's Forensic Document Laboratory. Thereafter, the Forensic Document Laboratory coordinated with the Secret Service Forensics Laboratory to secure information necessary to connect particular printed pages to its printer of origin. On May 14, 2010, the Special Agent was informed that the analysis results disclosed that a single printer had printed five pages from the coworker's affidavit addendum in February 2006, the anonymous letters received by Complainant and his neighbors, and the anonymous letters to the Director.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 16, 2010, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security installed security cameras in front of Complainant's residence. The coworker was placed on administrative leave, effective immediately, on June 22, 2010. The Agency issued a proposal to remove the coworker on September 30, 2010, and the coworker was officially separated from the Agency on December 1, 2010, subsequent to his retirement. It is evident from the steps undertaken by the Agency, given the unique circumstances of this case, that it promptly reacted to Complainant's concerns involving the coworker and that it conducted a thorough and effective investigation that resulted in the coworker being identified as the culprit responsible for the May 2008 letters. We find that the Agency exercised reasonable care to promptly investigate and stop the alleged harassing behavior. Therefore, the Agency is not liable. The Agency's final action is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Isidro A. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120182263 (2018), the Commission found that a delay of three weeks to begin an investigation did not satisfy the agency's duty of prompt action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is clear that Complainant and the Union Steward reported the incident to management within days of its occurrence, and the Agency began its investigation of it on August 9, 2017. The August 21, 2017 report of the investigation reflected interviews with 13 individuals. The Manager admitted using of the racial epithet. On November 21, 2017, the Manager was issued the Proposed LOW. The Proposed LOW indicated that it was issued in lieu of a fourteen-day suspension. The Proposed LOW noted that the negative impact the comments made in the workplace, but determined that the Manager should only be disciplined with the LOW and not a suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the Agency's actions do not satisfy the affirmative defense. The Agency investigation did not begin until three weeks after the incident was reported, and in the meantime, the Supervisor only advised the Manager to "lay low." The report, in which the Manager admitting to making the offensive remarks, was not issued until <span id="Page_875"></span>August 21, 2017, five weeks after the incident. Moreover, the only action taken against the Manager was a letter of warning, a woefully inadequate response to a management official making racially charged comments in a meeting with all the CCAs. As such, we conclude the Agency failed to take prompt and effective action after learning of the harassment. Because the Agency failed to meet its affirmative defense burden, we find that it is liable for the Manager's actions, and reverse the Agency's determination of no discrimination as to Complainant's claim of race-based harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Juanita W. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019004892 (2020) (three months was too long to address complainant's (black) allegations that supervisors changed her password to "naughty monkey" and told her that a visitor was her "master.")</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency initially fails to take prompt and effective corrective action, liability for harassment will attach even where the agency subsequently acts. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123232 (2015), the complainant was subjected to sexual comments and, ultimately, physical contact that was sexual in nature by an employee in another part of the agency. When the complainant brought the matter to the attention of her supervisor, he told her that she would have to approach the other employee's supervisor about having him transferred. Subsequently, an investigation affirmed the complainant's allegations and recommended appropriate discipline for the employee. The supervisor was also given a letter of reprimand for failing to take action. However, the Commission found these later actions did not absolve the agency of liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that The Agency, in its final decision (FAD), conceded that the first four elements of the harassment claim were met by Complainant. Therefore, the only matter at issue is element (5), i.e., whether there is a basis for imputing liability to the employer. Upon review of the record, we find that the Agency failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action in this case and therefore, the Agency is liable for H1's conduct. Although the matter of S1's inaction was acknowledged and addressed by Agency management, we find that initial inaction by S1 to be the reason that liability attaches to the Agency. The Agency cannot argue that it took immediate corrective action to end the harassment when its own investigation shows that S1 failed to follow the Agency's established sexual harassment protocol. Although the Agency subsequently responded in an appropriate manner, this response was not immediate. Complainant was left on her own to seek relief from the harassment. The Agency may not remove the effect of this initial inaction, i.e., avoiding liability, by its subsequent actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Phyllis F. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120150799 (2021), the complainant complained of harassment based on her sexual orientation on three separate occasions over the course of three months. During this time, management sent an email advising employees to be respectful of each other and held "daily shift briefings on hostile work environments" but did not discuss preventative or corrective actions. The complainant's concerns were not directly addressed for six months, during which time management and coworkers retaliated against the complainant for reporting the harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The most troubling piece of this record is management's utter disregard of its responsibilities to appropriately address the co-worker harassment. The record reveals Complainant complained to her first-level supervisor (STSO) in March, her second-level supervisor (TSM) in April and then to her third-level supervisor (AFSD) in August 2013. At each stage, management's responses were inadequate. STSO spoke with TSO1 in a public place, which was not an effective or appropriate remedial measure. TSM did not provide immediate action because he conducted an investigation in July 2013, months after the initial incidents occurred. By this time, however, TSM said that he found insufficient corroboration. There is no information in the record as to the reason for this delayed investigation, and upon review, we find this inquiry did in fact reveal credible support for Complainant's claim that she was subjected to harassment. ROI at 392, 590.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While management may have spoken to the TSOs about their inappropriate conduct, their action failed to end the harassment. Rather, retaliation from co-workers, and ultimately from management, continued unaddressed. The record reveals that management identified Complainant's behaviors as the source of the problem, rather than the conduct of her coworkers. The failure of the local management to deal with the harassment was so evident that even AFSD acknowledged in an email to TSM on August 16, 2013, that he was not responding to the situation appropriately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, Complainant presented the following email from AFSD to TSM:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I read over the file here at RDU regarding [Complainant's] complaint. However, I did not see anything related to your final resolution. Also, I would hope that [TSO1] was issued at least a LOC for her inappropriate comments to [Complainant]. In her written statement, she admits to making the statements reference to gay marriage, not having a man and the dog. [TSO1's] statements are totally inappropriate and should have been addressed in writing, not verbally as it appears.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Question: did you respond to [Complainant] in writing?</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> Complainant's Appeal Brief at Exhibit 1.5</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It was not until August 22, 2013, soon after this email, that TSM finally sent Complainant the results of her March 2013 allegations. After a review of the record, we find the Agency is liable for the harassment because it failed to take immediate and appropriate remedial actions to end the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is under an obligation to do "whatever is necessary" to end harassment, to make a victim whole, and to prevent the misconduct from recurring. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Dep't of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120091345 (February 1, 2012); <span class="Italic">see also Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors, supra</span> (stating that "remedial measures should be designed to stop the harassment, correct its effects on the employee, and ensure that the harassment does not recur"). Taking only a stop-gap remedial action does not absolve the Agency of liability where that action is ineffective. <span class="Italic">See Logsdon v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40120 (Feb. 28, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Agency could not separate the individuals due to the nature of the facility, it should have disciplined or transferred TSO1. Furthermore, Complainant repeatedly requested a transfer to escape the harassment, but this request was repeatedly denied because the CBA allegedly prohibited such a transfer. While we are skeptical that this explanation would suffice under the circumstances, we are unable to examine the CBA because it was not placed into the record. We also note the absence of any sexual harassment policy from the record, which further supports our finding that the Agency failed to establish that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action after it learned of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where harassment is confirmed, agency action should not be delayed for fear that it might appear to be retaliatory against the harasser. Bad HR advice in that regard led to agency liability in <span class="Italic">Roman G. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019005894 (2020). In <span class="Italic">Roman G</span>., HR recommended that the alleged harasser not be removed because doing so might appear to be in retaliation for his whistleblower activity. It wasn't until the complainant contacted an EEO counselor, a month after disclosing the harassment, that HR advised action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Complainant was subjected to sexual harassment by Team Leader for approximately four years. Following the death of his father, Complainant reported the harassment to the Executive Director during his April 2018 visit to the cemetery. The Executive Director, in turn, informed Complainant's first-line supervisor ("Supervisor") "to handle" the situation. Supervisor contacted Human Resources, who suggested that he interview Complainant's coworkers. According Supervisor, when he asked the HR official if Team Leader could be removed, HR raised concerns regarding the appearance of retaliation against Team Leader since Team Leader was the subject of an Administrative Investigations Board (AIB) investigation that predated the alleged harassment. While "it was obvious" to Supervisor that Team Leader should have been moved, he lacked the authority to transfer or move employees. The Supervisor attested that all he was able to do was to provide some separation by moving Complainant to another assignment. According to Supervisor, "[a]s more allegations came in, I also moved those employees as far away from [Team Leader] as I could."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that, aside from Supervisor's efforts, no action was taken by management in the weeks that followed Complainant's reporting. It was not until Complainant met with an EEO Counselor and the Counselor contacted management, on May 17, 2018, that any actions were taken. Those actions were inadequate. HR simply advised "moving Complainant, EEO training for the facility, and advising on situational awareness." One upper-management official attested that Team Leader was never disciplined, "never sent home or anything. Nothing has happened to him." We find that management did not take appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This occurred despite the fact that during Executive Director's April 2018 visit, he met with managers and it was discussed that three employees (two males and one female) had alleged sexual harassment by Team Leader. The HR official acknowledged that during the AIB investigation of Team Leader he was "inundated with claims against [Team Leader] from numerous parties,," but disregarded them as possible reprisal for Team Leader's whistle-blower activity in the AIB. Moreover, the HR official attested that the alleged actions were "commonplace for years as guy pranks or what guys do." This "boys will be boys" attitude, expressed by an HR official, demonstrates a hostile work environment that was easily discernable and should have been recognized and acted upon by management. Likewise, given the severity, frequency, and duration of Team Leader's conduct, not only toward Complainant, but others as well, the Agency should have known of the sexual harassment and taken swift, appropriate, and effective action. It did not, resulting in further harm to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that there is no corroborating evidence, however, does not excuse an agency from failing to take prompt action to stop the harassment and prevent further harassment. In <span class="Italic">Trevizo v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10003 (2001), <span id="Page_876"></span>the Commission found the agency was liable for coworker harassment where the complainant reported an exposure incident to her supervisor but he did not take prompt action. Instead, he took the next two days off and the complainant brought the matter to another supervisor, who immediately suspended the offender. When the complainant's supervisor returned to work, he took no further action because no other employees corroborated the complainant's version of events. Noting that the administrative judge found the complainant's testimony on the incident to be credible, the Commission found the agency was liable for failing to take prompt action to prevent further harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the very least, when faced with an allegation of harassment that cannot be immediately substantiated, the agency has an obligation to take preventive measures, such as training and monitoring. In <span class="Italic">Gray v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A53424 (2006), the complainant alleged that her supervisor rubbed her shoulders, made sexual inquiries of the complainant, and made sexual comments to other female employees. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gray</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, since the supervisor took no "tangible employment action" related to the harassment, an "affirmative defense" may be available to the agency. The record indicates that management detailed complainant to another office under a different supervisor and conducted an investigation. The investigation was done by the United States Investigative Service, which was unable to factually confirm the complainant's allegations. "If no determination can be made because the evidence is inconclusive, the employer should still take further preventive measures, such as training and monitoring." Vicarious Liability Guidance, at 24. However, there is no evidence contained in the record that complainant's supervisor ever received training on sexual harassment after the investigation. Further, on April 23, 2003, the National Treasury Employees' Union (NTEU) filed a grievance that, among other things, alleged that the supervisor had been subjecting complainant to sexual gestures. But management did not order an investigation until June 11, 2003, which was more than six weeks later. "If a fact-finding investigation is necessary it should be launched immediately" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 21; <span class="Italic">see also Nash v. Electrospace Systems, Inc.,</span> 9 F.3d 401, 404 (5th Cir. 1993) (prompt investigation completed within one week). Based on the foregoing, liability is imputed to the agency.</p>
