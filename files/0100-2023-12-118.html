<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-116"><span class="space">4.</span> EEO and Other Internal Agency Investigations</h4>
<p class="noindent">Being placed under surveillance does not sufficiently aggrieve an individual for purposes of stating a claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Muhammad v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996888 (2001) (supervisor's placement of a complainant under surveillance, to see if he was discarding mail does not state a claim). Likewise, being the subject of an Office of Inspector General investigation does not aggrieve an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ivan V. v. National Security Agency</span>, 2021003773 (2021), for instance, the complainant claimed that agency retaliated against him for his wife's EEO activity when it launched an investigation against him to determine whether he improperly used "work and safety" administrative leave. The agency dismissed the complainant as a collateral attack on an agency investigation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ivan V</span>. upheld the dismissal, not because the claim was a collateral attack, but because it failed to state a viable claim of discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the regulations set forth at 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, an agency shall accept a complaint from an aggrieved employee or applicant for employment who believes that he or she has been discriminated against by that agency because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disabling condition. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.103, .106(a). The Commission's federal sector case precedent has long defined an "aggrieved employee" as one who suffers a present harm or loss with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment for which there is a remedy. <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931049 (April 21, 1994). If a complainant cannot establish that s/he is aggrieved, the agency shall dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Commission has held that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(1) should be interpreted to, among other things, prevent an employee from using the EEO complaint process to lodge a collateral attack on another adjudicatory proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Wills v. Dep't of Def</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970596 (July 30, 1998); <span class="Italic">Kleinman v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05940585 (Sept. 22, 1994); <span class="Italic">Lingad v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05930106 (June 25, 1993). A claim that can be characterized as a collateral attack, by definition, involves a direct challenge to another forum's adjudicatory proceeding, such as the negotiated grievance process, the workers' compensation process, or state or federal litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant is alleging he was subjected to unlawful retaliation for his wife's EEO activity when an OIG investigation was initiated against him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that the Commission has long held that employees who are subject to alleged retaliation for the EEO activities of their spouses have standing to bring a reprisal complaint. <span class="Italic">See Fiene v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930560 (February 25, 1994); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A46150 (April 6, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency erred in dismissing Complainant's complaint as an impermissible "collateral attack" on another proceeding because the OIG investigation was not adjudicatory proceeding, but rather an information-gathering process that could lead to later management action. Nonetheless, we conclude that the complaint should be dismissed, albeit for a different reason than that proffered by the Agency. The Commission has previously held that, in most circumstances, merely conducting an internal investigation into purported misconduct does not, without more, such as resulting disciplinary action, cause injury sufficient to render the subject of the investigation aggrieved. <span class="Italic">See Shelly v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996655 (Oct. 27, 2000); <span class="Italic">Sorrell v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A14314 (January 24, 2002), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A20454 (May 2, 2002). This rule has been applied in instances where the alleged discriminatory act is the initiation of an internal investigation. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A32934 (Sept. 17, 2003); <span class="Italic">Heard v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120092680 (Aug. 27, 2009); <span class="Italic">Erika H. v. Dep't of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120181326 (May 11, 2018). Here, Complainant has not alleged that he was subjected to disciplinary action or any other adverse <span id="Page_220"></span>action as a result of the OIG investigation. Without more, the claim that he was the subject of an OIG investigation does not present an allegation of a present harm or loss for which there is a remedy. Under the particular circumstances presented by this case, we conclude Complainant has failed to state a viable claim even considering our more liberal view of what states a claim of unlawful retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Coleman-Stephens v. Postmaster General</span>, 01980255 (2001), the Commission found the complainant failed to state a claim where she alleged that she was ordered to come into work for a predisciplinary interview on a day when she was on sick leave. The Commission noted that the complainant did not appear for the interview, but that no disciplinary action was taken. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">De Yore v. Attorney General</span>, 0120101223 (2010), where the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency considered claim (3) as an impermissible collateral attack upon the Agency's internal investigation process. However, Complainant clearly expresses that he is not challenging the execution or the results of the investigation, but rather the determination to initiate the investigation. Complainant believes that racial animus motivated the Warden's decision to launch an investigation of him. The Commission finds that Complainant has stated a loss or harm to a term, condition or privilege of his employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an investigation, standing alone, does not aggrieve an employee, if other consequences accompany the investigation, they may be sufficient to constitute an injury. In <span class="Italic">Anvari v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 05A20546 (2002), the Commission found the complainant was aggrieved by an investigation into patient abuse, where gossip about the allegations spread throughout the facility and the complainant's registration with the state licensing board was affected. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ramzy v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A40984 (2004), the Commission upheld the agency's dismissal of a claim that the complainant was subjected to an Inspector General investigation, but reversed the agency's dismissal of claims that based on the ongoing investigation the agency limited the complainant's access to buildings and equipment and reassigned his duties to other employees. In <span class="Italic">Harper v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A53385 (2005), the Commission upheld the agency's decision to dismiss a complaint that an OIG investigation was discriminatory, but did find that an allegation that the agency wrongfully instigated suspicions about criminal conduct by the complainant that led to the investigation did state a claim. Likewise, an allegation that the complainant was subjected by Postal Inspectors to a strip search in front of customers states a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">Falu v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A53408 (2006). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lloyd v. Attorney General</span>, 01A61144 (2006), the Commission found that the complainant was not aggrieved by an OIG investigation, but was aggrieved by the fact that he alleged he was passed over for promotions because selecting officials were told of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, there remains inconsistency in the Commission's treatment of these cases. For example, in <span class="Italic">St. Romain v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120102569 (2010), the Commission reversed dismissal of a complaint alleging that the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment based on sex when she was subject to an Army Regulation 15-6 investigation into charges of adultery and inappropriate conduct with a noncommissioned officer. The agency dismissed the complaint on the basis that it was a collateral attack on the investigation, but the Commission, in <span class="Italic">St. Romain</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency supports its dismissal decision by asserting the Complainant is solely challenging the 15-6 investigation process and, therefore, is collaterally attacking that proceeding. However, a fair reading of the complaint and related EEO counseling materials indicates that the Agency is not properly characterizing the complaint. The EEO Counselor's Report stated that Complainant "believes that that she has been discriminated against because she is a female, and if she were a male employee this investigation would not have been initiated." Therefore, it appears that the gist of the complaint is that Complainant is alleging that she was targeted for the investigation on these particular charges because she was female, and that similar charges under similar circumstances would not have been lodged against a male employee.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Gretchen M. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120160516 (2016) (affirming agency FAD dismissing complaint as a collateral attack; distinguishing <span class="Italic">St. Romain</span> where complainant was subjected to an agency-controlled investigation whereas, in <span class="Italic">Gretchen M.</span>, an independent IG conducted the investigation against that complainant).</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether placement on administrative leave pending an investigation into possible misconduct is a sufficient injury to state a claim depends, in part, on the length of the leave, as well as how similarly situated individuals are treated. For example, in <span class="Italic">McGuire v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120070930 (2007), the agency dismissed for failure to state a claim an allegation that the complainant was placed on administrative leave while the agency investigated a charge that he had threatened another employee with a knife. The Commission reversed the dismissal in <span class="Italic">McGuire</span> finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission acknowledges that the agency asserts that complainant was paid while on leave, and that, under certain circumstances, placement on paid administrative leave for brief periods may not result in harm sufficient to state a justiciable claim. Nevertheless, given the specific circumstances of this case, the Commission determines that in complainant's assertion of an extended absence from the work site while being placed on administrative leave status, and the allegation of disparate treatment with regard to the Caucasian employee who was purportedly not placed on a paid non-duty status for assaulting an African-American employee, complainant has alleged a personal loss or harm to a term, condition or privilege of his employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Being subjected to an EEO investigation as a possible responsible management official does not aggrieve an employee for purposes of stating a claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A12771 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Edmond F. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120152528 (2016), the Commission rejected, as failing to state a claim, an alleged responsible management official's claim of harassment regarding an EEO investigation he was forced to participate in by the agency. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Edmond F</span>., noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has failed to state a claim of harassment. Over the course of a year, Complainant was asked to participate in the EEO process as a responsible management official on several occasions, was asked to provide a report of contact one time, and was asked to remain in his office on one occasion. These alleged instances of harassment are unaccompanied by concrete agency actions and are neither frequent, nor severe, nor pervasive. Therefore, these allegations are insufficient to state a claim of harassment, and claims 1-5 were properly dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wills v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05970596 (2001), the Commission, on reconsideration, upheld its earlier decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim where the complainant alleged that he was aggrieved by a criminal investigation by the Army's Criminal Investigation Division into his travel vouchers. The Commission found the complainant was not aggrieved, even though the investigation resulted in a debt collection and subsequent garnishment of his pay, because it constituted a collateral attack on the investigation. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wells v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996813 (2001) (dismissing a complaint over an investigation by the Postal Inspection Service as a collateral attack).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case that would seem at variance with <span class="Italic">Wills</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission found an allegation that the complainant was subjected to an "intense investigation" that resulted in a suspension stated a claim for relief. <span class="Italic">McNaught v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01993140 (2002). The summary reversal of the agency's dismissal decision in <span class="Italic">McNaught</span> contains no real analysis. However, it is clearly premised on the fact that the complainant was harmed by the suspension. The Commission's failure to consider the complainant in <span class="Italic">Wills</span> as being similarly harmed by the debt collection action and subsequent garnishment of his pay is less clear.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although not citing <span class="Italic">McNaught</span>, the analysis was much clearer in <span class="Italic">Bruno v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A22584 (2002), where the complainant alleged that he was removed from his position because an investigation into a charge of harassment was initiated against him. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bruno</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result of a harassment investigation initiated by Manager, complainant asserts that he was "removed from his position despite the lack of a formal conclusion of the investigation." Since complainant was removed from his position, he constitutes an aggrieved employee that has suffered a harm with respect to the terms and conditions of his employment. Moreover, complainant claims that he was discriminated against because he is male and 55 years old. Complainant further asserts that the Manager has filed investigations against other employees at the agency that were male and over the age of 40, and who had otherwise unblemished records. Complainant's claim that he was discriminated because his sex and age are both bases covered by the EEO statutes. Moreover, the agency has not provided any evidence showing that complainant was not removed from his position and did not suffer a harm with respect to his employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A33926 (2004), the Commission rejected an agency argument that the complainant's attack on an investigation that led to an adverse action was a collateral attack:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that contrary to the agency's conclusion that complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination, complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case because the managers who were involved in complainant's current claim were the named parties in complainant's most recent prior complaint. Also, the record establishes that both managers admit knowledge of complainant's prior EEO activity. (IE 69; 72;76). The record reflects that complainant made numerous complaints about his co-workers alleged acts of racial harassment, including that of the co-worker he was accused of threatening, which were contemporaneous to the incidents in this complaint. (IE 60). On March 25, 1998, complainant requested administrative time to file an EEO complaint. We find sufficient evidence in the record to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find, contrary to the agency's conclusion, that complainant met his burden of proof that the agency's proffered legitimate non-discriminatory reasons were a pretext for discriminatory animus toward complainant's prior EEO activity. The agency states that the security guard acted on his own to contact Federal Police and that the security guard had no knowledge of complainant's prior EEO activity. The record reflects that the management officials who contacted the guard on <span id="Page_221"></span>duty may have requested that the guard contact Federal Police. (IE 34; 35; 73). The agency insists that complainant was not the reason Federal Police were contacted and that management did not direct the guard to contact Federal Police. (IE 71; 73). We find sufficient evidence to conclude management officials either directed the guard to, or heavily influenced the guard's decision to call Federal Police.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also contains affidavit testimony from a team leader who states that although the employee stated she was threatened by complaint, management would not have had complainant escorted from the building without developing the facts further. The record, however, reflects otherwise. The record shows that the decision was made by management officials and the guard on duty to call Federal Police without speaking to complainant "because they saw no need to," nor did they speak to any of the other employees who witnessed the altercation. (IE 69; 73). Although an interview of witnesses to the incident at issue would have likely revealed that the alleged victim made racial comments to complainant which were the impetus of the verbal disagreement, both managers admit little to no investigation of the altercation occurred before Federal Police were called. (IE 70; 73; 76). The record reflects that the alleged victim oriGINAlly stated that complainant allegedly threatened to file an EEO complaint against her, which caused her to become upset and begin crying and seeking the manager's assistance. (IE 151; 153). Management officials stated that Federal Police were contacted because the employee said she felt "threatened," which she never said before. (IE 73). The Federal Police Officers state, however, that at the time they arrived on the scene, management said that no verbal threats had been made by either party. (IE 149). Additionally, the record shows that the employee in question, one month later, claimed that complainant told her to "watch her back," however no statements to that effect were reported to management or the Federal Police before or during the incident involving complainant. (IE 64, 149).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserts that complainant has no right to criticize how an agency conducts an investigation and that this claim is a collateral attack. (Agency's Brief in Response to Appeal 10-11) We find, however, that where it appears that an adverse action is taken against an employee for discriminatory reasons, complainant has a right to question the acting authorities motives, which in this case includes the investigatory facts surrounding the Federal Police's involvement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the employee who accused complainant of "threatening" her was known to be emotionally unstable and prone to hysteria. (IE 67; 81). This employee was also involved in several very loud verbal confrontations with other employees, yet the record does not reflect that Federal Police were called in for any of those incidents. (IE 77). Management officials state that they would have contacted Federal Police any time such circumstances were involved, yet the record shows Federal Police were never previously called in for any loud verbal altercations, except for the one at issue. (IE 73; 81; 83). We also find that even if the co-worker's allegations were accurate, the threat of filing an EEO complaint is not a threat to a co-worker's safety. The record does not show that any threat was communicated to management, or if there was a threat made, that it was of the magnitude or type that would compel management to involve Federal Police when they had never called them in similar situations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A42477 (2004), the Commission gives some good examples of the difference between investigations that do not result in personal harm for complaint purposes and investigations combined with actions that do constitute personal harm:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency asserts that complainant cannot establish that he was aggrieved as to claims 2(a), 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We disagree that the first part of claim 2(a), invoking complainant's investigative interviews, fails to state a claim. Investigative interviews alone, do not sufficiently render an employee aggrieved unless they result in some concrete action. <span class="Italic">See Keller v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 01923077 (August 26, 1992). Upon close review of the record, we find that the LOW was issued as a result of the investigative interviews. The two matters are therefore inextricably intertwined and should be considered as a whole Dismissal of part (a) was thus inappropriate. In claim 3, complainant refers to two occurrences that must be looked at separately. First, the supervisors request in 3(a) that complainant return to his case following a discussion with a coworker does not state a claim of discrimination and was appropriately dismissed. Complainant neither suffered any adverse employment action, nor any harm to a term or condition of his employment. Nevertheless, claim 3(b) refers to an investigative interview which eventually resulted in the 7-day no time off suspension enumerated in claim 6. Therefore, claims 3(b) and 6 must be looked at together. As 3(b) led to a suspension, this claim was inappropriately dismissed for failure to state a claim The investigative interviews mentioned in claims 5 and 8(b), stem from the same March 19, 2001 incident and should also be looked at together There is no evidence in the record that any tangible action was taken following these investigative interviews, so there was no effect on a term or condition of complainant's employment. The agency properly dismissed claims 5 and 8(b). Claim 7 fails to state a claim because complainant did not suffer any tangible employment action, for he was able to procure alternate documentation. The agency dismissed claim 8(a) in that complainant was not denied sick leave on the dates in question. However, this goes to the merits of the claim and therefore, claim 8(a) should not have been dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an investigation into performance or conduct is combined with other actions, such as reassignment to another post and change in work hours, this sufficiently aggrieves an employee to state a claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120141843 (2014).</p>
