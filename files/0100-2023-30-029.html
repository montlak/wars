<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-30"><span class="space">b.</span> Period of Back Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">In most cases, the period to which the complainant is entitled to back pay will be obvious. For example, in a removal case the period of back pay generally will run from the time the employee was removed to the time of his or her reinstatement. When an employee retires prior to the time relief is granted, back pay runs from the date of discrimination through to the date of retirement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Green v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/04A30028.txt">04A30028</a> (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">In other cases, the period of entitlement to back pay will not be as obvious, and agencies exercise a fair degree of creativity in constructing arguments to limit their liability. "For computation purposes, the period of entitlement to back pay runs from the time appellant was denied the promotion by the agency until she began receiving an equivalent or greater compensation from the agency." <span class="Italic">In re USPS</span>, 05870349 (1988). The Commission determined that it was not relevant that the promotion of the selectee had been canceled and he had been replaced with a substitute selectee. The Commission found that the cancelation of the promotion did not terminate the agency's liability for back pay. Of course, if the promotion was to a temporary position and the appointment expired during the course of the complaint, back pay liability would expire with the appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the amount of back pay cannot be precisely calculated, the "'risk of lack of certainty...must be borne by the wrongdoer, not the victim.'" <span class="Italic">Barszcz v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01881708 (1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">Gross v. Exxon Office Systems, Co.</span>, 747 F.2d 885, 889 (3d Cir. 1984)). In <span class="Italic">Barszcz</span>, the agency was found to have discriminated against the complainant by denying her a career conditional appointment. The agency argued that back pay should be awarded on the basis of the number of hours other career conditional employees worked during the period of liability. In <span class="Italic">Barszcz</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Commission's Remedies Policy mandates that an individual, subjected to unlawful discrimination, must receive "make whole" relief; this includes backpay. In order to establish a claim for backpay, appellant must show that she suffered an economic loss and that there is a causal relationship between the discrimination and the economic loss. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Philips Industries</span>, 593 F.2d 783, 787 (7th Cir. 1979). Once appellant has established a basic case for backpay, the burden of proof and persuasion falls to the agency to establish by "clear and convincing evidence" that the award should not be made<span class="Italic">. Marks v. Prattco</span>, 633 F.2d 112, 1125 (5th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Day v. Matthews</span>, 530 F.2d 1083, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Mallard v. Claytor</span>, 471 F. Supp. 16, 22 (D.D.C. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find appellant has established a case for backpay in her argument that the hours she worked in 1979 should be the benchmark for measuring the agency's liability. It was in 1979 when appellant first worked as a career conditional [appointee]. We find that evidence of the hours that she worked in 1979 as a career conditional [appointee] is a sound and reliable measure to use in determining the hours that appellant would have worked beginning in August 1977 and continuing through December 1978, but for the discriminatory denial in August 1977 of appointment as a career conditional....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize the possible utility of the agency's argument that the measure of liability may be shown by the hours worked by comparative employees during the period of liability. However, based upon our review of the record, we are not persuaded, in this case, that such a benchmark is an accurate indicator of the extent of the agency's liability. Also, we note that the extent of liability for discrimination may be established by a number of ways and that information showing what occurred to similarly situated persons who were not discriminated against is not the sole method. We also find that, in analyzing the evidence proffered by the agency in support of its argument concerning liability, the agency has failed to persuade us, by clear and convincing evidence, that the award of backpay should not be made. We note that while the agency asserts work was assigned based upon roster lists, we found no persuasive evidence showing an increase in the number of hours worked by employees based on whether the employees were on Lists 1, 2, or 3. However, we did find persuasive evidence that employees of List 4 generally worked fewer hours than employees on Lists 1, 2 and 3. We also find that the agency failed to proffer evidence showing the hours worked by the putative comparative employees during a five month time frame of the liability period, August 1977 through December 1977. The omission was significant in that the record shows in other post tax filing seasons, a wide range of hours worked by employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find another significant omission by the agency. The appellant specifically identified an employee who received an appointment in August 1977 as a career conditional [employee] when she was discriminatorily denied an appointment. According to appellant, this other employee's subsequent work history would have probably mirrored appellant's but for the discrimination.... Although the agency could have used this comparison employee's work history as a measure of its liability, the agency failed to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the circumstances of the case, the Commission used the hours worked by the complainant after her appointment as the best measure of the agency's back pay liability.</p>
<p class="noindent">In appropriate cases, when the Commission cannot determine the amount of back pay to award, it may remand the case for a supplemental investigation of that issue. For example, in <span class="Italic">Adesanya v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933395 (1994), the Commission found the record was not clear on how many hours of light-duty assignments the complainant was denied because of her pregnancy. The Commission remanded the case with specific instructions for the agency to determine, to the best of its ability, how many of the light-duty assignments the complainant would have received, had she been treated the same as other employees with a lifting restriction.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the complainant is unable to work due to an agency's discrimination, the complainant is entitled to back pay for the period she was unable to work. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hendley v. Attorney General</span>, 01A20977 (2003), the complainant was on leave without pay as the result of several incidents of sexual harassment. During that period of time, the agency suspended the complainant. The administrative judge found that the suspension was the result of discrimination based on sex and/or reprisal and ordered the agency to cancel the action and award back pay. On appeal, the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the suspension did not cause the complainant to lose pay because she was already on leave without pay, finding that the "complainant's and agency physicians reported that complainant was unable to work due to the psychological effects of the suspension." However, the Commission denied the complainant's claim that she was entitled to back pay after the suspension ended as not supported by sufficient evidence noting that, in a disability retirement application, the complainant contended that a back injury contributed to her inability to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Back pay computations can be complicated if an employee is denied a promotion and, prior to receiving relief, is granted within-grade increases and other employment benefits for the position currently held. The situation can be further complicated when the employee subsequently receives a promotion independent of the EEO complaint. A good explanation of both the difficulties and rules for computing back pay awards was provided in <span class="Italic">Negrete v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 05880515 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission directs that an agency correct an unlawful personnel action that resulted in the denial of monetary and employment benefits to an employee, the employee shall be deemed to have performed service for the agency during the period covered by the corrective action, and it is for that period that the agency shall compute the monetary and employment benefits due the employee. 5 CFR 550.803, 550.805. An employee shall not be granted more monetary and employment benefits that she would have been entitled to receive if the unlawful personnel action had not occurred<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>; 550.805(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agency that if appellant had been promoted to the GS-7 level in February 1984, she would not have received the step increase she received at the GS-6 level in June 1984. Consequently, in computing the monetary and employment benefits to which appellant is entitled as a result of the discrimination practiced against her, the agency must, in effect, regard the June 1984 step increase as not having occurred, except for the purposes of calculating any offset.... We do not agree, however, that appellant's merit promotion of November 1984 may be "canceled" as a consequence of appellant's retroactive promotion made to remedy the agency's discriminatory act of February 1984.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The period of corrective action, the period governed by 550.805(b), ended when appellant received her merit promotion to the GS-7 level. On that date appellant was promoted to the very grade she had been denied through the agency's discriminatory act of February 1984 and to an in-grade level higher than that to which she would have acceded but <span id="Page_1718"></span>for that discriminatory act. She overcame in November 1984 the effects of the Agency's failure to promote her in February 1984. The period for appellant's relief in terms of 550.805(a), or "the period covered by the corrective action," extends from the date she was denied a promotion to GS-7 because of the agency's discrimination up to the time she overcame the effects of that discrimination, and no longer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "period covered by the corrective action" is a construct, used in fashioning relief where, as here, an agency's unlawful personnel action has resulted in a denial of monetary and employment benefits over time. During this period, pursuant to 550.805(b), in computing the monetary and employment benefits due a victim of the agency's discrimination, the agency shall not grant more monetary and employment benefits than the victim would have been entitled to had the discrimination not occurred, and, accordingly, must offset step and certain other increases the victim would not have been awarded had she not been discriminated against. It is <span class="Italic">only</span> during this constructive period, however, that 550.805(b) is operative, and the period, itself, has a rationally determinable duration. It does not necessarily extend to the date corrective action is implemented, although this may ordinarily be the case....</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases involving forced retirement where the Commission orders reinstatement, the appropriate remedy is the back pay based on the difference between the complainant's retirement benefits and the salary he would have received but for his resignation. <span class="Italic">See In re USPS</span>, 05870365 (1987). The agency's liability for back pay expires on the date the complainant either accepts or rejects the offer of reinstatement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30112.txt">07A30112</a> (2004), the Commission found that a casual employee was entitled to continuous back pay from the time of his removal in June 2001 until the time of his reinstatement in April 2003. The Commission rejected an argument by the agency that the complainant was not entitled to continuous back pay for the entire period, noting that the complainant has worked as a casual employee on a continual, year-round basis for 12 years.</p>
<p class="noindent">Back pay is terminated by an unconditional offer of reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880040 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1982677458us2191672">458 U.S. 219</a> (1982)). However, the offer must be completely unconditional. "Usually, settlement offers require that the complainant lose his or her right to pursue the complaint in exchange for reinstatement. Such an offer is not an unconditional one." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Back pay also is terminated if the complainant becomes unwilling to work. For example, in <span class="Italic">Vavrek v. Attorney General</span>, 07A40068 (2007), the Commission found that the complainant's entitlement to back pay was terminated during the hearing when he testified that he no longer wanted to work for the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The entitlement to back pay also is terminated where the agency establishes the position was legitimately abolished. In <span class="Italic">Simas v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0420060045 (2008), the Commission determined that the complainant was entitled to back pay for the 2002 fire season where the agency discriminatorily refused to rehire her as a seasonal fire technician. The Commission found that the complainant was not entitled to back pay after that season where a Fuels crew she worked on was abolished and replaced for the 2003 season by a Fire crew. The Commission rejected the complainant's contention that she was highly qualified for the Fire crew noting that even if that was true she would have had to reapply for the position and did not.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an employee earns more at his subsequent job than he otherwise would have earned working for the agency, the proper period of pay is from the date of the employee's constructive discharge until he started earning more than he would have otherwise earned at the agency. <span class="Italic">Vaughn C. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120123332 (2016).
