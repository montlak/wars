<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-56"><span class="space">1.</span> Bad Faith Negotiations</h4>
<p class="noindent">Separate and apart from the exercise of good faith in executing the terms of an agreement is the issue of negotiating a settlement in bad faith. If an agency consummates a deal that it has negotiated in bad faith, that may be grounds for voiding the subsequent settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The obligation to bargain in good faith bars an agency from taking advantage of facts that are within its knowledge but not within the knowledge of the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Brionez v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01944100 (1996), the Commission declared a class action settlement void where the agency had agreed to increase its Hispanic representation through increased recruitment, hiring, promotion and training. At the time the agency entered the settlement agreement, the agency knew that it would be undergoing a significant reduction and could not fulfill the objectives. "Therefore, the Commission finds that the agency's downsizing effort resulted in such an inadequacy of consideration as to render it inequitable to allow the settlement agreement to stand." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">However, on a cross-request for reconsideration by both parties, the Commission reversed itself and held that there was adequate consideration to support an agreement. In <span class="Italic">Brionez v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05960492 (1999), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed the record, including the parties' requests for reconsideration and respective replies thereto, the Commission concludes that the previous decision erred in vacating the SA and ordering the complaint reinstated for lack of consideration. In any appeal alleging breach of a settlement agreement, the Commission's initial inquiry is, of necessity, whether there exists a valid settlement agreement to enforce<span class="Italic">. See Jacobsohn v. Dept. of Health and Human Services (Social Security Administration)</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930689 (June 2, 1994). But the Commission generally does not concern itself with adequacy or fairness of consideration, so long as some legal detriment is incurred as part of the bargain<span class="Italic">. See Terracina v. Dept. of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910888 (March 11, 1992). Provided that the parties to the agreement incur some legal detriment--that is, commit themselves to do something they were not already obligated to do--the settlement agreement will not be set aside for lack of consideration<span class="Italic">. See Morita v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960450 (December 12, 1997). Here, appellant agreed to withdraw the informal class complaint. In return, the agency agreed, in addition to recruitment and hiring, to undertake new obligations regarding career development, training, promotion, transfer, selection, retention, and evaluation, thereby incurring a legal detriment as part of the bargain Accordingly, is was error for the previous decision to set aside the settlement agreement, and the parties' requests for reconsideration therefore are GRANTED.</p>
<p class="noindent">On reconsideration, the agency submitted evidence that at the time it entered the agreement, its work force was expanding and subsequent events brought about the reductions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A62160 (2006), the Commission found that the agency acted in bad faith when it failed to present any evidence that it was unaware that an organizational entity would be eliminated at the time it agreed to reassign the complainant to that entity. The burden is squarely on the agency to provide evidence to support its final decisions, including that it negotiated an agreement in good faith. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the absence of evidence of good faith, the Commission concluded that the agency acted in bad faith. In <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>, the Commission ordered compliance with the agreement through reassignment of the complainant to a comparable position outside his work unit with a permanent change in his rating official.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01955008 (1996), the Commission set aside a settlement agreement where the agency agreed to give the complainant the next available group manager's position in a certain division. However, at the time the agreement was entered, the agency knew that it would be downsizing and the manager position might be eliminated entirely. Under the circumstances, the Commission found the agreement gave the complainant only an illusory promise and that the agreement lacked consideration for complainant withdrawing her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 0120133264 (2014), where the manager involved in negotiating the agreement removed the complainant, a probationary employee, for poor performance within two weeks of signing the agreement. The Commission found that it was more likely than not that the manager knew he was going to remove the complainant at the time of the negotiations. The Commission voided the agreement and remanded the complaint for processing.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966185 (1997), the Commission found that the appellant's complaint of agency bad faith in settlement negotiations failed to state a claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, appellant alleged that the agency negotiated in bad faith through the grievance process when its representative made a settlement agreement contingent upon whether appellant would withdraw his EEO complaint. The Commission notes that settlement negotiations, including any statements or proposals, are to be treated as confidential and privileged to facilitate a candid interchange to settle disputes informally<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05941002 (March 23, 1995). We have held that to allow a new complaint based on a settlement offer would defeat this purpose<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Montague v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920231 (May 2, 1992). Appellant was not aggrieved by virtue of the offer; <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it did not adversely affect a term, condition, or privilege of appellant's employment. The fact that the offer made on March 1, 1996 was not as attractive to appellant as an earlier offer does not render appellant aggrieved. Appellant had the option to accept or reject the offer. After accepting the offer, he cannot then turn around and use it as the grounds for a new complaint. Accordingly, the agency's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint for failure to state a claim was proper and is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Epstein v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05970671 (1998), the Commission imposed an award of attorney fees on the agency as a sanction for bad faith in settlement negotiations where the agency indicated that it had no intention of complying with the agreement. The agency's attorney in <span class="Italic">Epstein</span> agreed to an agency-issued letter of apology without authorization from the agency. The Commission found that such a promise constituted bad faith.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that there was no bad faith in the negotiations does not affect the complainant's right to a remedy when the agency subsequently fails to comply with the terms of the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Cook v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A11144 (2002), the Commission ordered that the complaint be reinstated for breach even though it found the agency had not engaged in bad faith negotiations. In <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, the agency and the complainant entered a settlement agreement that provided for the complainant's voluntary downgrade on a certain date. A second provision of the agreement required the agency to process a classification appeal of the complainant's present position if he requested it prior to the downgrade. When the complainant timely requested reclassification, the agency refused. In finding there were no bad faith negotiations in <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By letter to the agency dated September 7, 2000, complainant claimed breach of the settlement agreement, and requested that the agency implement its terms. Specifically, complainant alleged that the agency denied his request to initiate a position classification appeal because of his pending reassignment in provision 2, informing him that agency personnel regulations require cancellation of such appeals upon the incumbent leaving the position. Furthermore, complainant argued that the agency engaged in bad faith, averring that the settlement agreement was signed under duress. Complainant noted that the agency's <span id="Page_380"></span>representative directly contacted complainant, knowing his attorney was not available, and told him that the offer would not "remain on the table forever." Complainant also claimed that the agency engaged in bad faith by proposing provision 1, although knowing that agency regulations precluded its implementation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its October 17, 2000 decision, the agency concluded that it did not breach the settlement agreement. The agency stated that provision 1 states that only the terms of the settlement agreement itself would not operate to preclude a classification appeal, and that in this case, the agency's personnel regulations, not the settlement agreement provisions, precluded the appeal. The agency further argues that provision 1 does not insure that the appeal could be pursued to completion, and denies all allegations of bad faith. The agency instead allocated blame to complainant's attorney based on her purported failure to fully assess the feasibility of provision 1, in light of provision 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant again asserts that the agency acted in bad faith, claiming that the agency proposed the language in both provisions at issue with full knowledge that provision 2 would invalidate provision 1. Complainant again claims that he signed the settlement under duress, and requests that the underlying EEO complaint be reinstated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the agency acknowledges drafting and proposing the provisions at issue, but argues that the responsible agency official declared his lack of knowledge about the position classification appeal process, and that complainant's attorney at that point offered to obtain this information to ascertain whether operation of both provisions would be feasible. Therefore, the agency avers that the provisions were not proposed in bad faith. Furthermore, the agency denies that its representative pressured complainant into signing the agreement. The agency notes that he merely told complainant that the offer would not be on the table "forever." In this regard, the agency further asserts that the agreement was not effectively executed until complainant's attorney signed it, and that this took place several days later, at a time when the attorney could have declined to execute it until she ascertained the feasibility of the provisions at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1614.504(a) provides that any settlement agreement knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by the parties, reached at any stage of the complaint process, shall be binding on both parties. The Commission has held that a settlement agreement constitutes a contract between the employee and the agency, to which ordinary rules of contract construction apply<span class="Italic">. See Herrington v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960032 (December 9, 1996). The Commission has further held that it is the intent of the parties as expressed in the contract, not some unexpressed intention, that controls the contract's construction<span class="Italic">. Eggleston v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900795 (August 23, 1990). In ascertaining the intent of the parties with regard to the terms of a settlement agreement, the Commission has generally relied on the plain meaning rule<span class="Italic">. See Hyon v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910787 (December 2, 1991). This rule states that if the writing appears to be plain and unambiguous on its face, its meaning must be determined from the four corners of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence of any nature<span class="Italic">. See Montgomery Elevator Co. v. Building Eng'g Servs. Co.,</span> 730 F.2d 377 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find no bad faith in the negotiation or execution of the settlement agreement. According to the record, the agency's representative declared no knowledge of the classification appeal process at the time he proposed the two provisions, and complainant's attorney declared her intent to obtain information about this process to ascertain the feasibility of the offer. Therefore, we find that there was no attempt to mislead complainant as to the feasibility of having both provisions. Furthermore, we find no duress, because the agency representative's statement to complainant that the offer would not last "forever" is not coercive, and because complainant's attorney did not sign the agreement until several days later.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding a lack of bad faith, we find that the agency breached provision 1 when it declined to initiate the position classification appeal process upon complainant's request. Specifically, we find that the plain meaning of this provision is that the agency agrees to process complainant's classification appeal of his Bearing Worker position if complainant initiates that process prior to the effective date of the reassignment to the Supply Technician position referenced in provision 2. While we have carefully considered the agency's many arguments disputing this interpretation, we find that the above meaning clearly reflects the intent of the complainant, the understanding of his attorney, and the "offer" of the agency as portrayed by its representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reflects that the agency representative drafted provisions 1 and 2 as the agency's offer to settle complainant's EEO complaint, but initially disclaimed knowledge of the position classification appeal process referenced in provision 1. However, this same representative, after a period of some days, contacted complainant and repeated the agency's "offer," apparently without the previous disclaimer. By doing so, we find that the agency, as the drafter of the two provisions, avowed to undertake both of these actions in spite of any possible conflicts with its personnel regulations. Furthermore, when another agency representative presented the settlement agreement to complainant's attorney for her signature, and effective legal execution, complainant's attorney indicated that she believed that the agency had made this offer in good faith and was agreeing to perform the actions in the provisions at issue. Therefore, because the agency itself drafted the two provisions, and made a second "unqualified" offer to perform the terms of each, creating a reasonable belief that both provisions could be performed, we find that this is the proper interpretation of the provisions at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Review of the record reflects that complainant made a request for a position classification appeal on August 8, 2000, which the agency declined to initiate on August 9, 2000, and that each act was prior to the effective date of complainant's reassignment on August 12, 2000. Therefore, because complainant initiated his request for a position classification appeal prior to the effective date of his reassignment, we find that the agency breached provision 1.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that in the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> decision, the Commission did not construe the agency's admonition to the complainant that the offer would not remain open forever to be either bad faith or coercion. Such tactics are usually within the parameters of good faith negotiations, provided the complainant is given a reasonable opportunity to consider the offer. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roane v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A20045 (2002) (finding no coercion where the complainant asked for the opportunity to speak to her representative before signing the agreement, was then given permission and did speak to her representative).</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Todd v. Social Security Administration</span>, 05950169 (1997), the Commission found that the agency acted in bad faith where it delayed signing a settlement agreement until three months after the appellant signed it, and the agency proposed appellant's removal in the interim. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Todd,</span> noting that the appellant never received any of the benefits of the agreement, stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that we agree with the specific findings of the previous decision that: the agency did not breach the agreement by removing appellant and that the agreement did not provide for the expunction of any information or documentation from appellant's files or from any other place records are kept.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, after a careful review of the record, we find that the agreement should be set aside. Although appellant signed on January 29, 1993, the agreement was not signed on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner of Human Resources until May 6, 1993, over three months after appellant's signature was obtained. Consequently, we find that the agency acted in bad faith in this case due to its delay in signing the agreement. Furthermore, we note that the agency waited until it had already issued a letter dated April 23, 1993 proposing appellant's removal. Therefore, it appears that the agency's May 6, 1993 signing was merely an attempt to dispose of appellant's prior complaints before his removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the record contains no evidence that appellant, prior to the agency's signing of the agreement, received any of the benefits that he was promised pursuant to the agreement. We note in this regard that the SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action, which promoted appellant to GS-7 was not approved until June 3, 1993. Appellant had already been removed on May 28, 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously found that an agency's bad faith in implementing a settlement agreement constituted a breach of the agreement<span class="Italic">. See Wong v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931097 (April 29, 1994); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910632 (September 9, 1991). Given the vastly changed circumstances between the date appellant signed the agreement and the agency's endorsement, we find it inequitable to hold appellant to an agreement he now argues he would not have signed onto in light of the change in his employment situation. Based on the foregoing, we will remand this case back to the agency. The agency will be directed to reinstate Complaint Nos. SSA-469-91, SSA-625-91, and SSA-230-93.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Isaac v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120092445 (2009), where it held that the agency erred in dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim where the complainant alleged that the agency reneged on a settlement agreement and proposed his removal as retaliation for protected EEO activity. The agency and the complainant in that case had reached an "agreement in principle" where the complainant was to receive a retroactive promotion with a promise to retire when he became eligible. Because of problems in working out the details, the parties had not yet signed an agreement when the agency proposed his removal. The removal was later mitigated to a verbal warning. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Isaac</span>, found that the complainant stated a viable claim of retaliation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that at the time his removal was proposed, complainant was actively engaged in the EEO process as part of a group of ten IT specialists in the IRM section of the VA Medical Center in Washington, D.C., who began the process of filing EEO complaints in July 2006 claiming the agency had failed to promote them because of their <span id="Page_381"></span>race. In December 2007 and January 2008, complainant participated in mediation of these complaints with an EEOC Administrative Judge. The parties reached an agreement in principle with terms that included a three-year retroactive promotion for complainant to the GS-12 level, and an agreement by complainant that he would retire in August 2009, when he became eligible for immediate retirement under the FERS plan. The record further indicates that there were considerable delays caused by disputes over how to implement the various details of this agreement, and at the time complainant's removal was proposed, the final settlement agreement had not yet been formally executed. Complainant alleges his removal was proposed in order to renege on the EEO settlement agreement. Under these facts, as well as an examination of the circumstances that led to the proposed removal and subsequent verbal counseling, the Commission finds that complainant has alleged a viable claim of unlawful retaliation that requires further investigation and processing. Therefore, the agency' s dismissal of claims 1 and 2 is reversed and the claims are remanded to the agency for further processing in accordance with the Order set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's claim of bad faith negotiations was unsuccessful in <span class="Italic">Chong v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120100155 (2010), where the agency alleged that the complainant had misled the agency as to the reason for denial of an OWCP claim. In that case, the complainant's supervisor wrote a letter to OWCP challenging the claim. In settlement of the complainant's subsequent EEO claim, the supervisor was required to write a letter to OWCP indicating that there was no validity to several facts he previously disputed. The agency further agreed that if OWCP did not accept the complainant's claim, it would restore 720 hours of LWOP and 89 hours of annual leave. When OWCP did not accept the claim, the agency alleged that the complainant had engaged in bad faith negotiations because he knew the reason for denial of the claim was not the supervisor's letter but the lack of medical evidence in support of the claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Chong</span>, rejected the agency's contention explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency agreed that if OWCP did not compensate complainant for 720 hours of leave without pay (LWOP) and 89 hour of annual leave, the agency would do so. When OWCP denied complainant this compensation, the agency did not compensate complainant, as agreed. The agency argues, in essence, that it should be excused from complying with the settlement agreement because complainant acted in bad faith. The record does not show that complainant acted in bad faith. He may have well believed that the MDO's challenge letter was behind OWCP's denial of compensation. Also, complainant did submit additional medical documentation in support of his claim to OWCP, but it did not find it persuasive. Filing an appeal with OWCP was not required by the settlement agreement, and not doing so did not show bad faith. The agency breached the settlement agreement.</p>
