<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-20"><span class="space">F.</span> ELEMENT OF INTENT</h3>
<p class="noindent">As suggested by the very title of this chapter, there must be some indication that any discrimination was intentional in order for an employee to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case based on disparate treatment. <span class="Italic">Warren v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01842192 (1986). Because the burden of presenting a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is a light one, a personal belief that the treatment is based on discriminatory reasons is sufficient. Where the appellant clearly states his belief that the action was taken as the result of a personality conflict, that burden is not met.</p>
<p class="noindent">While a mere belief may support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the ultimate burden of proof is on the complainant to present evidence of intent. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Jenna P. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120131048 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission cannot second-guess an Agency's actions involving personnel unless there is evidence of a discriminatory motivation on the part of the officials responsible for those actions. <span class="Italic">See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 259 (1981). Consequently, regardless of whether she is alleging disparate treatment or harassment, Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the two Coaches, SM, AM, or the Director were motivated by unlawful considerations of her disability or previous EEO activity when they took the actions described in her complaint. <span class="Italic">See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</span> 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000); <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 22 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant must do more to satisfy her burden than merely express her belief about the motives of Coach 1, Coach 2, SM, AM, and the Director. Complainant must present actual, specific evidence of those motives. Such evidence can take the form of discriminatory statements or past personal treatment attributable to those individuals, comparative or statistical data showing differences in treatment across disability lines, unequal application of Agency policy, deviations from standard procedures without explanation or justification, or inadequately explained inconsistencies in the evidentiary record. If Complainant fails to establish the existence of discriminatory intent on the part of at least one of the responding management officials, the Commission would not need to inquire as to whether the incidents complained of constitute acts of harassment or separate acts of discrimination under disparate treatment theory.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission elaborated on this point in <span class="Italic">Lupe M. v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0120142975 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When asked by the investigator why he believed that his race, color, sex, religion, and age were factors in his not receiving training and mentoring opportunities, and in his being terminated, Complainant responded that he was a member of a protected race. IR 68, 71-72. When asked why he believed that the management officials he identified had discriminated against him, he replied that he did not know. IR 70, 73. Complainant's responses seem to reflect an assumption on his part that an official's bad acts in and of themselves are sufficient to establish motive. This is simply not true. The statutes that the Commission enforces cannot protect Complainant from S1 or S2's actions toward him unless those actions are rooted in a motivation based upon his race, color, sex, religion, or age. And on this crucial issue, Complainant did not present evidence of any of the indicators of discriminatory motive described above. He has not submitted any sworn statements from other witnesses or documents that contradict the explanations provided by S1 and S2, or which call their veracity into question, which is crucial to establish the existence of an unlawful motive in a case based on circumstantial evidence, such as this one. We therefore agree with the Agency that Complainant failed to prove that he had been discriminated against with respect to any of the incidents comprising his claim of disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Booker B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120142871 (2016) (bad acts, standing alone, do not establish intent); <span class="Italic">Emerita G. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120142806 (2016) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">In evaluating the element of intent, it is necessary to make a distinction between an intent to violate the antidiscrimination laws and the intentional use of a protected characteristic in making an employment decision. It is the latter that controls. The complainant is not required to make a showing, either as part of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case or in order to prevail, that the employer knew the actions it took violated the law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Demonstrating that the agency acted upon incorrect information is not sufficient to demonstrate discrimination. As the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01942331 (1995), the focus in a disparate treatment claim properly is on the agency's motivation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he weakness in this argument is that it does not matter whether the information acted upon by the SOT Specialist in fact was correct. An employer may act for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all, provided the employer is not motivated by discriminatory reason<span class="Italic">. Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall</span>, 738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir. 1984). There is no evidence that the SOT Specialist was aware, at the time she issued the counseling statements, that the information upon which she based those statements was inaccurate. Accordingly, such circumstance does not establish that the SOT Specialist more likely than not was motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985008 (2001) (complainant's contention that the other employee involved in a fight was the aggressor was not demonstrative of pretext because the agency's belief that complainant was the aggressor was supported by substantial evidence).</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example is provided by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120132641 (2014), where the complainant contended he made a hand gesture to indicate that he believed the supervisor had a "shoot from the hip" style, but the manager interpreted the gesture as involving a gun and threat to "go postal." In upholding summary judgment for the agency, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful review, we find that the record was adequately developed during the investigation, and Complainant has failed to persuasively identify issues of material fact that can only be resolved through a hearing. First, we note that Complainant, on appeal, argued that the AJ did not acknowledge his opposition to the Agency's Motion for a Summary Judgment.' However, we find that the AJ references Complainant's opposition in her decision that determined that the instant matter was suitable for summary judgment. The most significant issue Complainant points to as a material fact in dispute is the event of September 27 involving the gun gesture. Complainant asserts that he did not make a "trigger" gesture and states that he only made a gun gesture to demonstrate the "shoot from the hip" style of the investigation against him over the August 22 incident. However, we find that no hearing is needed as Complainant has essentially admitted to the gesture and words that resulted in his termination, although not to the intent of the action. But Complainant's intent is not material to proving discrimination. Rather, management's intent is the issue here, and management witnesses have provided clear and unrebutted testimony as to why they were fearful of the gun gesture and the reference to the postal service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency adequately explains its decision to investigate the August 22 incident involving Complainant and the coworker that was witnessed by the supervisor. The investigator concluded that while no physical contact occurred, Complainant displayed anger and hostility towards the coworker, behavior he had previously been warned against in a letter of reprimand. The actual decision to terminate him occurred after the September 27 meeting with the third-level supervisor to discuss Complainant's anger with his supervisors about the investigation and possible disciplinary action, and the third-level supervisor was disturbed by Complainant gestured shooting a gun with his finger and implied he might go "postal." The termination notice also referenced earlier incidents of anger and rude behavior.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden is on Complainant to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation for its actions were a pretext for unlawful discrimination. Complainant argues that the investigation of the August 22 incident subjected him to race discrimination because the investigator was a racist, who did not like white people. In support of this claim, Complainant, at his deposition, stated that the investigator was an ex-cop with the Washington, D.C. police department, which he asserted was known for its racism. He also asserted that the investigator walks with a swagger, tried to get him discipline before and badgered him at a meeting. Complainant asserts that because the investigation was tainted by race discrimination, so too was the ultimate decision to terminate him. We find, however, that Complainant has failed to prove race discrimination. He admits that the investigator never made any racist statements to him and that he has no evidence beyond what was already described.</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic rule is that "an employer is entitled to make its own business judgments. The reasonableness of the employer's decision may of course be probative of whether it is pretext. The trier of fact must understand that the focus is to be on the employer's motivation, not its business judgment." <span class="Italic">Mellerson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01981404 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">Merely showing disparate treatment, however, generally will not be enough for the appellant to prevail. The appellant bears the burden of proving that he was the victim of intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Navy</span>, 01822305 (1983). The appellant may satisfy <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> requirements by demonstrating that his performance was of sufficient quality to merit continued employment, thereby raising the inference that some other factor was involved in the employment decision. However, once the agency carries its burden of articulating a legitimate reason for its decision, the appellant must produce further evidence of intentional discrimination in order to prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency officials involved in a personnel action display animus toward the complainant, an agency is well advised to have those officials explain the reasons for the animus. For example, in <span class="Italic">Watson v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A10496 (2002), the Commission found there was no discrimination, even where the acting officials admitted animus toward the complainant, where <span id="Page_698"></span>the officials explained that animus was the result of past conduct problems, including the use of profanity and intoxication at work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Leaving aside <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> affirmative action plans, there is no such thing as beneficent discrimination. The Commission examines agency actions for discriminatory motive. It is no defense, where such motive is found, that the agency was engaged in certain activities that it considered to be for the complainant's "own good."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kellus v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933281 (1994), the Commission found it was discriminatory for an agency to give a complainant, who suffered from morbid obesity, an ultimatum about losing weight:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to this complaint, appellant alleges that he was discriminated against based upon his disabilities when he was informed on August 15, 1990, that he had until November 15, 1990 to lose weight or face a fitness-for-duty examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's allegation of discrimination concerning the ultimatum he was given by the agency's Director of Human Resources involves direct evidence of intentional disability discrimination. Specifically, the Director of Human Resources admitted that based upon information she had received concerning appellant's morbid obesity and his degenerative arthritis, she subjected him to a three-month period of assessment in which she postponed sending him for a fitness for duty examination in order for him to demonstrate "a sincere commitment" to lose weight. No other individual, disabled or otherwise, was shown to have been afforded this form of blatant and unjustified disparate treatment. No legitimate workplace safety concerns that could have served as the basis for the Director's action in affording appellant the ultimatum to lose weight or face a fitness-for-duty examination were articulated by the Director. In fact, the Director's willingness to indefinitely postpone appellant's fitness-for-duty examination on the condition that appellant continue his progress on the diet program he joined as a direct result of her ultimatum clearly undermines the validity of any such professed concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Director's stated intention to help appellant "improve his health" may appear superficially beneficent, such an attitude toward appellant's disabling condition, when examined more closely, clearly demonstrates discriminatory animus towards appellant's morbid obesity. This is evidenced by an assumption in the absence of conclusive medical evidence that appellant's condition is a totally voluntary one that can be cured by him and by the belief that the agency has a legitimate place in forcing appellant to attempt such a cure. However, under the Rehabilitation Act, appellant is entitled to equal treatment with regard to the terms and conditions of his employment regardless of whether he chooses to pursue a particular form of treatment for his disabling condition(s). The agency's actions in imposing the subject ultimatum violated the Rehabilitation Act by unlawfully altering the terms and conditions of appellant's employment in a discriminatory manner not similarly imposed upon other employees with or without disabilities. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">An appellant cannot demonstrate intent if it is clear that the RMOs were not aware of his race and religion. A contention that the RMOs would have been aware of his race and religion because of appellant's name (Ahmad) was rejected as speculative. <span class="Italic">Ahmad v. USPS</span>, 01871714 (1987). A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Johns, et al. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a43133.txt">01A43133</a> (2005). In that case, 16 black employees claimed they were subject to race discrimination when an open vacancy announcement was canceled. At the time, the employees all were enrolled in a training program that would have made the eligible for the positions in question. The Commission found that the administrative judge properly granted summary judgment where there was no evidence that the officials who canceled the vacancy had any knowledge of those enrolled in the program or their race. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a52779.txt">01A52779</a> (2005) ("Specifically, we find that complainant cannot show that either the recommending or selecting official was aware of complainant's race or color at the time the subject selection was made and accordingly, complainant cannot establish any nexus between her race or color and her non-selection."); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A52622 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant's subjective believe that he or she has been the victim of discrimination is not evidence of discriminatory intent and is not sufficient to survive summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McCoy v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A53873 (2005).</p>
