<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-21"><span class="space">1.</span> Knowledge of Protected Group</h4>
<p class="noindent">In some ways, it is surprising that as of June 2015, the issue of whether knowledge was a required element of the theory of intentional discrimination was unsettled. Perhaps that it because in the vast majority of cases, it is undisputed that the employer has knowledge of the complainant's protected group. <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch Stores, Inc</span>., <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20150601c53">135 S. Ct. 2028</a> (2015), changed that.</p>
<p class="noindent">In fact, as late as 2012, the EEOC itself had held that because the complainant must prove intentional discrimination, the complainant must demonstrate that an agency official involved in the personnel decision had knowledge of the complainant's protected group or groups. In <span class="Italic">Hobson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720110027 (2012), the Commission reversed an order granting summary judgment to a complainant in a race discrimination case finding that whether anyone involved in the selection process knew of the complainant's race was a disputed issue of fact that precluded summary judgment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, we find that the AJ erred when she concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact in this case. In its motion for summary judgment, the Agency argued that the people involved in making the decision not to hire Complainant were not aware of his race. The AJ did not disagree with this. Rather, she found such knowledge was not necessary to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination. We find the AJ made an error of law in finding that race discrimination in this case could be proven regardless of whether the officials involved in not hiring Complainant were aware of his race. Complainant is claiming race discrimination under the theory of disparate treatment. The ultimate factual issue in such a Title VII case is whether the Agency intentionally discriminated against him. <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993) (<span class="Italic">citing Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 103 S. Ct. 1478, at 1481 (1983). Referring to the shifting burdens of proof, the Court wrote that the methodology was never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If a complainant is unable to prove that a selecting official was aware of his race, a fortiori, he cannot succeed in proving intentional race discrimination by the Agency. <span class="Italic">See Bush v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973243 (June 21, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant did not work for the Agency when he applied for employment. His applications were date stamped received by the Agency, but the record does not show how he provided them to the Agency. HR 1, who erroneously found Complainant was not eligible for the Housekeeping Aid position, stated during the investigation that she was not aware of Complainant's race when she made her eligibility determination, and his race was not indicated anywhere on his application. HR 2, who made the eligibility determination on Complainant's Food Service Worker application, stated during the investigation that Complainant did not indicate his race in his application. Because there was no evidence in the record that the people involved in decision not to hire Complainant were aware of his race, the AJ improperly made a summary judgment decision finding race discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Drinks v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01996751 (Dec. 20, 2000) (affirming AJ's finding after a hearing that complainant did not prove race and color discrimination because there was no evidence that those involved in not hiring him were aware of his race or color).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, when the AJ issued a decision without a hearing finding race discrimination there was a genuine issue of material fact on whether the Agency officials who were involved in not hiring Complainant were aware of his race when they took their actions. For this reason, the AJ's action of making a decision without a hearing on race discrimination is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the AJ made a decision without a hearing, the parties added to the evidence on whether the officials involved in the decision were aware of Complainant's race when they took their actions. HR 2 and the selecting official on the Food Service Worker position both stated they were not aware of Complainant's race when they took their actions, and Complainant stated that his application included a separate optional sheet on demographics which included his race. There is still a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of responsible officials' knowledge of Complainant's race.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch Stores, Inc</span>., <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20150601c53">135 S. Ct. 2028</a> (2015), Samantha Elauf, who was a practicing Muslim who wore headscarf, applied for a job at the company. The company has a "Look Policy" governing employee dress that prohibits "caps" as being too informal for the Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch image. Elauf did not tell the store manager that she was Muslim or wore the headscarf for religious reasons and did not ask for accommodation. However, the manager believed she wore the headscarf for religious reasons and informed the district manager of that belief. The district manager instructed the manager not to hire Elauf because the headscarf would violate the Look Policy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC sued on behalf of Elauf and the district court granted the company's motion for summary judgment finding that in order to be liable for a failure to accommodate a religious practice under Title VII, the employer had to have actual knowledge of the need for accommodation. The Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court decision and the Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an 8-1 decision, with Justice Thomas filing an opinion that agreed in part and dissented in par, the Court found that actual knowledge of a protected category was not a required element of an intentional discrimination claim under Title VII. Justice Scalia issued the majority opinion writing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 78 Stat. 253, as amended, prohibits two categories of employment practices. It is unlawful for an employer:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <span id="Page_699"></span>because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These two proscriptions, often referred to as the "disparate treatment" (or "intentional discrimination") provision and the "disparate impact" provision, are the only causes of action under Title VII. The word "religion" is defined to "includ[e] all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to" a "religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business." &#x00A7; 2000e(j).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Abercrombie's primary argument is that an applicant cannot show disparate treatment without first showing that an employer has "actual knowledge" of the applicant's need for an accommodation. We disagree. Instead, an applicant need only show that his need for an accommodation was a motivating factor in the employer's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disparate-treatment provision forbids employers to: (1) "fail. . .to hire" an applicant (2) "because of" (3) "such individual's. . .religion" (which includes his religious practice). Here, of course, Abercrombie (1) failed to hire Elauf. The parties concede that (if Elauf sincerely believes that her religion so requires) Elauf's wearing of a headscarf is (3) a "religious practice." All that remains is whether she was not hired (2) "because of" her religious practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "because of" appears frequently in antidiscrimination laws. It typically imports, at a minimum, the traditional standard of but-for causation. <span class="Italic">University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</span>, 570 U.S. ___ (2013). Title VII relaxes this standard, however, to prohibit even making a protected characteristic a "motivating factor" in an employment decision. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m). "Because of" in &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1) links the forbidden consideration to each of the verbs preceding it; an individual's actual religious practice may not be a motivating factor in failing to hire, in refusing to hire, and so on.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is significant that &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1) does not impose a knowledge requirement. As Abercrombie acknowledges, some antidiscrimination statutes do. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 defines discrimination to include an employer's failure to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations" of an applicant. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). Title VII contains no such limitation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, the intentional discrimination provision prohibits certain motives, regardless of the state of the actor's knowledge. Motive and knowledge are separate concepts. An employer who has actual knowledge of the need for an accommodation does not violate Title VII by refusing to hire an applicant if avoiding that accommodation is not his motive. Conversely, an employer who acts with the motive of avoiding accommodation may violate Title VII even if he has no more than an unsubstantiated suspicion that accommodation would be needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the rule for disparate-treatment claims based on a failure to accommodate a religious practice is straightforward: An employer may not make an applicant's religious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions. For example, suppose that an employer thinks (though he does not know for certain) that a job applicant may be an orthodox Jew who will observe the Sabbath, and thus be unable to work on Saturdays. If the applicant actually requires an accommodation of that religious practice, and the employer's desire to avoid the prospective accommodation is a motivating factor in his decision, the employer violates Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Abercrombie urges this Court to adopt the Tenth Circuit's rule "allocat[ing] the burden of raising a religious conflict." Brief for Respondent 46. This would require the employer to have actual knowledge of a conflict between an applicant's religious practice and a work rule. The problem with this approach is the one that inheres in most incorrect interpretations of statutes: It asks us to add words to the law to produce what is thought to be a desirable result. That is Congress's province. We construe Title VII's silence as exactly that: silence. Its disparate-treatment provision prohibits actions taken with the motive of avoiding the need for accommodating a religious practice. A request for accommodation, or the employer's certainty that the practice exists, may make it easier to infer motive, but is not a necessary condition of liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Abercrombie argues in the alternative that a claim based on a failure to accommodate an applicant's religious practice must be raised as a disparate-impact claim, not a disparate-treatment claim. We think not. That might have been true if Congress had limited the meaning of "religion" in Title VII to religious <span class="Italic">belief</span>--so that discriminating against a particular religious practice would not be disparate treatment though it might have disparate impact. In fact, however, Congress defined "religion," for Title VII's purposes, as "includ[ing] all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e(j). Thus, religious practice is one of the protected characteristics that cannot be accorded disparate treatment and must be accommodated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor does the statute limit disparate-treatment claims to only those employer policies that treat religious practices less favorably than similar secular practices. Abercrombie's argument that a neutral policy cannot constitute "intentional discrimination" may make sense in other contexts. But Title VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices--that they be treated no worse than other practices. Rather, it gives them favored treatment, affirmatively obligating employers not "to fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual. . .because of such individual's" "religious observance and practice." An employer is surely entitled to have, for example, a no-headwear policy as an ordinary matter. But when an applicant requires an accommodation as an "aspec[t] of religious. . .practice," it is no response that the subsequent "fail[ure]. . .to hire" was due to an otherwise-neutral policy. Title VII requires otherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Tenth Circuit misinterpreted Title VII's requirements in granting summary judgment. We reverse its judgment and remand the case for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>
