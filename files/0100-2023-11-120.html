<h2 class="h2" id="sec2-120"><span class="space">VIII.</span> NOTICE OF FINAL INTERVIEW</h2>
<p class="noindent">The precomplaint stage of the EEO process concludes with a notice of final interview. This notice must be in writing and must inform the employee of the right to file a formal complaint and the time limit for doing so. It must further advise the complainant of the appropriate official with whom to file a complaint and of the complainant's duty to immediately inform the agency if counsel or other representation is retained. 29 CFR 1614.105(d) and (f).</p>
<p class="noindent">The final interview is the conclusion of the precomplaint process. Although the EEOC envisions that an actual interview between the counselor and the complainant will take place, this is not required. However, the complainant must be advised of his or her rights and the procedures for pursuing those rights. There is no requirement that the final interview be conducted face-to-face with the complainant and his or her representative. <span class="Italic">Emerald v. Postmaster General</span>, 01923130 (1992). Written notice of the final interview is sufficient. However, in order to be effective in starting the 15-day time period for filing a formal complaint, the notice of final interview must be legible. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Timmons v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A23538 (2003). In the <span class="Italic">Timmons</span> case, the complainant contended that the original notice of final interview, sent by telefax, was not legible and the Commission found the time limit for filing a formal complaint did not begin running until she subsequently received a legible copy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The counselor's obligations during the final interview are set forth in MD-110, at 2-17 to 2-20:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the final interview with the aggrieved person, the EEO Counselor should discuss what occurred during the EEO counseling process in terms of attempts at resolution. The EEO Counselor should provide the aggrieved with information to move the matter forward and answer any questions the aggrieved may have. The EEO Counselor must not indicate whether s/he believes the discrimination complaint has merit. Since EEO counseling inquiries are conducted informally and do not involve sworn testimony or extensive documentation, the EEO Counselor (1) cannot make findings on the claim of discrimination, and (2) should not imply to the aggrieved person that his/her interpretation of the claims of the case constitutes an official finding of the agency on the claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appendix G for a sample Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the EEO Counselor must provide the aggrieved person with the following information:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Right to Pursue the Claim through the Formal Process</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the dispute has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the aggrieved person, the EEO Counselor must tell the aggrieved person that s/he has the right to pursue the claim further through the formal complaint procedure. It is the aggrieved person, and not the EEO Counselor, who must decide whether to file a formal complaint of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Requirements of the Formal Complaint</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The EEO Counselor must inform the aggrieved person that the complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">1.&#x2003;Must be in writing;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2.&#x2003;Must be specific with regard to the claim(s) that the aggrieved person raised in EEO counseling and that the person wishes to pursue;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">3.&#x2003;Must be signed by the complainant or complainant's attorney; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">4.&#x2003;Must be filed within <span class="Italic">fifteen (15) calendar days</span> from the date s/he receives the Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint. Written complaints filed by facsimile, electronic communication, hand delivery during business hours, U.S. mail (confirmation services recommended), or other third-party commercial carrier must meet the regulatory time frames. The date of the postmark, facsimile, electronic communication, hand delivery, delivery to a third-party commercial carrier or in person filing at the agency's EEO office is considered the date filed and must be within the requisite 15 days.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time Frames to Complete the Final Interview</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The EEO Counselor must conduct the final interview and issue the Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint within 30 days of the date the aggrieved person brought the dispute to the EEO Counselor's attention. If, however, the aggrieved person consented to a written extension of time, the extension cannot exceed 60 days for counseling. If the aggrieved agreed to participate in EEO ADR, the counseling period may not exceed 90 days. If the dispute is not resolved at the end of the extended time period, the EEO Counselor must advise the aggrieved party in writing of his/her right to file a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The 30-day EEO counseling period (or as extended by agreement of the aggrieved party) commences when the aggrieved person (1) first initiates contact with any agency official logically connected with the EEO process and (2) exhibits an intent to begin the EEO process. The unavailability of an EEO Counselor to meet with the aggrieved person for a period of time after such initial contact does not toll the 30-day counseling period. Absent agreement from the aggrieved person to extend the time period, the EEO Counselor must conduct the final interview and issue the Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint at the end of the 30-day period.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Name(s) of Person(s) Authorized to Receive Complaints</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The EEO Counselor shall provide the aggrieved person with the names of persons authorized to receive complaints of discrimination. The EEO Counselor shall inform the aggrieved person (or his/her representative) that the complaint must be delivered to one of the authorized persons.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">E.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Loss of Confidentiality during Formal Process</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">In accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(b)(2)(g), the EEO Counselor should explain that unless the aggrieved authorizes or files a formal EEO complaint, the EEO Counselor will not reveal their identity. Once the complaint is filed, the complaint file, or part of it, may be shared only with those who are involved and need access to it. This includes the EEO Director, agency EEO officials, and possibly persons whom the aggrieved person has identified as being responsible for the actions that gave rise to the complaint. The complaint file is not a public document to be released outside the EEO complaint process. The identity of the aggrieved person does not remain confidential in the formal complaint process.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">F.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Written Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">After the final interview and not more than 30 days after the aggrieved contacted the EEO office, the written Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint must be issued. The Notice must specify that an aggrieved person has 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint to file a formal complaint (including a class complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The notice must also advise the aggrieved person of the appropriate official with whom to file a complaint and of complainant's duty to inform the agency immediately when the complainant retains counsel or a representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The EEO Counselor must advise the aggrieved individual of his/her duty to inform the agency of a change of address if s/he should move during the pendency of the EEO process and the possible consequences for not doing so.</p>
<p class="noindent">Part 1613 contained language to the effect that precomplaint counseling, if practical, should be concluded within 21 days of contacting an EEO counselor. 29 CFR 1613.213. Very seldom did the precomplaint stage move that quickly. However, the counselor was required to provide the employee with a written notice that the 21-day period had expired and that the employee had the right to file a formal complaint within 15 calendar days or to continue to precomplaint counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is now a requirement that counseling be concluded within 30 days, unless the complainant and agency agree in writing to extend the time period. An extension of up to 60 days can be mutually agreed upon by the parties. 29 CFR 1614.105(d) and (e). If the parties agree to ADR, it must be completed within 90 days and there is no provision for any extension. 29 CFR 1614.105(f).</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure of an EEO counselor to document contact with a complainant may result in reinstatement of a complaint dismissed as untimely. <span class="Italic">Malloy v. Veterans Administration</span>, 01830791 (1983). In that case, the agency's assertion that the precomplaint complaint was untimely was rejected where the counselor made no notation of the date of contact and could only recall that it had been sometime in the past year. The appellant testified that he contacted the counselor within the prescribed period and further presented the affidavit of a friend verifying that the employee told him of his contact of a counselor within the 30-day time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the counselor orally told appellant that a meeting was her final <span id="Page_127"></span>interview, the time for filing a formal complaint does not commence until the employee receives a written notice of final interview. <span class="Italic">Qualls v. USPS</span>, 01840767 (1985). The failure to conduct a face-to-face final interview does not toll the time frame for filing where the employee is provided with a written notice of final interview and otherwise fails to appear for an actual interview. <span class="Italic">Bushnell v. Department of Navy</span>, 018442399 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">EEOC regulations are silent on whether a notice of final interview can be sent to the complainant by email. In <span class="Italic">Burns v. Attorney General</span>, 0120112104 (2011), without specifically ruling that the notice cannot be sent by email, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency, relying upon electronic records, determined that Complainant received the notice of right to file a formal complaint by electronic mail on September 23, 2010. Although the notice indicated that Complainant had to file a formal complaint within fifteen (15) calendar days of its receipt, Complainant did not file his formal complaint until October 20, 2010, beyond the limitation period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is not persuaded by the Agency's determination that the instant formal complaint was not timely filed. Where, as here, there is an issue of timeliness, "[a]n agency always bears the burden of obtaining sufficient information to support a reasoned determination as to timeliness." <span class="Italic">Guy v. Department of Energy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05930703 (January 4, 1994) <span class="Italic">(quoting Williams v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920506 (August 25, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that it sent the Notice by electronic mail. However, the EEO complaint processing regulations at 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 do not expressly address or define service by electronic mail. As such, the Commission finds that the agency has not met its burden of establishing when Complainant received the Notice. <span class="Italic">See Fletcher v. Department of Commerce,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120100071 (March 30, 2011); <span class="Italic">Bolt v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 020102899 (September 29, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, <span class="Italic">Franchesca V. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0520140147 (2016), is the first case in which the Commission expressly noted that email is an "unapproved method of delivery." In that case, the Commission denied a request for reconsideration where the administrative judge reversed the agency's dismissal of the complainant's formal complaint for untimely filing. The timeliness dispute arose out of the agency's new complaint processing procedures. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Franchesca V</span>. explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further contends that in an effort to enhance the sufficiency and security of the EEO complaint process, and as a significant cost-saving measure, the Agency offered complainants the option to receive complaint-related correspondence via email. If the underlying decision is allowed to stand, the Agency maintains that its policy of allowing complainants to elect to receive complaint-related correspondence via email will automatically break down with respect to its ability to account for timeliness calculations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected the agency's concerns, intimating that, at least with respect to correspondence containing information related to deadlines, agencies are not at liberty to adopt email only procedures without the Commission's expressed approval:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The process the Agency describes here of allowing complainants to elect the manner in which they receive complaint-related correspondence can best be defined as a "variance" from the complaint prom sing procedures prescribed in the regulations. The Commission, in its discretion and for good cause shown, may grant agencies variances from the complaint processing procedures prescribed in the regulations, permitting them to conduct pilot projects concerning proposed changes to the complaint processing requirements that may later become permanent through regulatory change. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies desiring to request variances from the complaint processing procedures prescribed in the regulations must: (1) address these requests to the Director of the Office of Federal Operations; (2) identify the specific section(s) of the regulations from which they wish to deviate and exactly what they propose to do instead; (3) explain the expected benefit and expected effect on the process as a result of the proposed variance; (4) indicate the proposed duration of the pilot variance; (5) and discuss the method by which they intend to evaluate the success of the pilot variance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence in the record to show that the Agency followed these steps to implement a pilot variance in the instant matter. As a result, we do not find that the previous decision clearly erred in finding that the Agency did not meet its threshold obligation of establishing when Complainant received the notice because it utilized an unapproved method of delivery, i.e., service by electronic mail.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agency EEO offices interested in corresponding with complainants via email would do well to also send a hardcopy of the notice of right to file a formal complaint by mail. Any dispute as to the timeliness of a formal complaint will most likely depend on receipt of the mailed, rather than the emailed, notice.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant is represented by an attorney, the time frame to file a formal complaint will not begin to run until the attorney receives the notice of final interview. The date the complainant receives the notice is irrelevant when the complainant's representative is an attorney. 29 CFR 1614.605(d). In <span class="Italic">Littlejohn v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A11419 (2001), the Commission held that actual receipt by the attorney, and not simply delivery of the notice to the attorney's address, was what triggered the time to file a formal complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that complainant's complaint was improperly dismissed pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(2). The record discloses that complainant received the notice of right to file a formal complaint on August 5, 2000. The record further discloses that the notice of right to file a formal complaint was signed for by a building manager at complainant's counsel's official address on August 23, 2000. However, complainant's counsel did not actually receive the notice until it was faxed to her on October 6, 2000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, complainant's counsel states that the procedure in her building is for the mail delivery person to present certified mail to the building manager for signature. Once signed, the certified mail is returned to the mail delivery person who places it in the mailbox. Complainant's counsel states that she never received the certified mail. There is no evidence in the record indicating that complainant's counsel statement is not worthy of belief. When complainant designates an attorney as representative, service of all official correspondence shall be made on the attorney and the complainant, but timeframes for receipt of materials shall be computed from the time of receipt by the attorney. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.605(d). Accordingly, we find that complainant had fifteen days from October 6, 2000 to timely file his compliant. The complaint was formally filed on October 16, 2000, within fifteen calendar days of its receipt by counsel. Therefore the agency's dismissal is reversed and the complaint is remanded for processing in accordance with the ORDER below.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted). The fact that the complainant changes counsel after issuance of the notice of final interview does not excuse the late filing of the formal complaint. In <span class="Italic">Kovitch v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A54281 (2005), the complainant notified the agency of a change in counsel after the issuance of the notice. The Commission found the change in counsel did not warrant an extension of the 15-day period for filing the formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although 29 CR 1614.605(d) requires that a complainant advise the agency in writing that counsel has been retained, the Commission does employ a constructive notice doctrine. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wade K. v. Secretary of Air Force,</span> 0120120184 (2016), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the formal complaint was untimely where the complainant had not provided written notice, but had informed the counselor of representation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that Complainant should have provided the Agency with his attorney's address and phone number in writing, pursuant to C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.605(d). However, the Agency's argument that it was not on notice of Complainant's attorney is disingenuous. On appeal, the Agency asks how could the EEO Counselor "possibly know" she should send the Notice to Complainant's attorney. Yet the Agency acknowledges that Complainant twice informed the EEO Counselor that he had retained legal counsel over a week before she sent the Notice of Right to File. The record contains no evidence that the EEO Counselor asked Complainant for his attorney's mailing address in order to send the Notice. Considering the ease with which the Agency could have, but decided not to, obtain the information (particularly given Complainant "cc'd" his attorney's firm on one of the emails), the Agency's argument that it was not on notice is not sufficient to discount the date of Complainant's attorney's receipt of the notice.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, when the complainant's representative is not an attorney the time limit does not begin to run until the complainant receives the notice of final interview. Service on the nonattorney representative does not start the time limit. In <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A43088 (2005), the Commission found the formal complaint was not untimely filed because the notice of final interview had never been served on the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case indicates that the agency mailed the Notice to complainant's representative, who received it on December 18, 2003, but did not mail the Notice to complainant. Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.605(d), unless a complainant states otherwise in writing, the agency must provide complainant with copies of all official correspondence, notwithstanding any instructions from complainant to the contrary. There is no evidence supporting a finding that complainant provided a written statement from her that she was not to receive official correspondence. Furthermore, where, as here, the complainant's representative is not an attorney, the time for filing the formal complaint is computed from the day the complainant receives the Notice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05990558 (November 20, 2001). Therefore, because the agency failed to provide complainant with a copy of the Notice, we find that the agency improperly dismissed the instant complaint for untimely filing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to provide the full notice of final interview to the complainant will not extend the time limit for filing a formal complaint where the portion of the notice provided clearly sets forth the formal complaint filing deadline. <span id="Page_128"></span>In <span class="Italic">Baker v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01970526 (1997), the Commission found that the complainant's complaint was untimely, despite the fact that she did not receive a copy of the form on which to file a complaint with her notice of right to file. Of importance to the Commission in <span class="Italic">Baker</span> was that the complainant received information regarding the time limits to file a complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that the final interview was conducted on August 28, 1996, and that appellant filed her formal complaint 16 days later on September 13, 1996. According to appellant, on August 28, 1996, she received an incomplete copy of the notice of right to file, with page two missing, and she was not furnished a copy of the complaint form, Form 2590-R at that time. Appellant states that she contacted the EEO office on August 30, 1996, regarding the discrepancy, and she was faxed the missing materials on September 4, 1996. According to appellant, she regarded September 4, 1996, as the date of receipt of the notice of right to file, and therefore, the deadline for filing her formal complaint was September 19, 1996.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1614.106(b) requires that a complaint be filed within 15 days of receipt of the notice of right to file. Here, the record indicates that appellant signed for receipt of the notice of right to file on August 28, 1996. While appellant contends that she did not receive the second page of the notice of right to file during the final interview, the first page clearly indicated that she was required to file her complaint within 15 days of receipt of the notice. EEO Counselor A acknowledged that appellant did not receive a complete copy of the complaint form on August 28, 1996, but EEO Counselor A stated that she specifically informed appellant that she would fax appellant a complete copy of the complaint form, and that the deadline for filing the complaint was within 15 days of the final interview. We note that the first page of the notice of right to file indicated that the use of Form 2590-R was merely preferable, and was not required. Based on the foregoing, we find that appellant's filing of her formal complaint on September 13, 1996, was untimely, and therefore, the agency's dismissal was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">The notice of final interview must specifically inform the complainant of the right to file a formal complaint within 15 days of receipt. Advising a complainant that if she does not respond within 15 days the precomplaint complaint will be closed does not trigger the 15-day time limit for filing a complaint. <span class="Italic">Christian v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966686 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">But, a typographical error in the case number on the notice of final interview will not toll the time limit for filing a formal complaint where the dates of counseling were accurately set forth and there were no other circumstances present that should have created confusion for the complainant. <span class="Italic">Manning v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972383 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">Normally, a signed certified mail receipt is conclusive evidence of when the complainant received the notice of right to file. In <span class="Italic">Gaydos v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A00100 (2001), however, there was a dispute about who wrote the date on the receipt, and the matter could have been cleared up easily by the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Gaydos</span> therefore found that dismissal on timeliness grounds was improper:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that the certified mail receipt in the complaint file (P 620 874 466) showed that the complainant received the notice on July 16, 1999. Complainant in her appeal submitted a copy of the certified mail envelope (P 620 874 466) that contained the notice of final interview, which was stamped by the Post Office showing that a 1st Notice card (Form 3894) was left in her mailbox on July 17, 1999, the day after the agency states the letter was delivered. Complainant maintained that she did not receive the notice of right to file until July 19, 1999, when she went to the Midwest City Branch of the Oklahoma City Post Office and signed for certified mail letter P 620 874 466. Complainant argues that while she did sign the certified receipt in question, she did not enter a date in block 7 for the date of delivery.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An issue arises then in determining exactly when complainant received the certified letter. Complainant asserts that the post office would be able to establish that she actually signed for the letter on July 19, 1999, and that they would be willing to provide the agency with a copy of the yellow notice card (Form 3894) that she signed for the certified mail. Further, complainant indicated that she sought to get a copy of this form for her appeal, but was told that since the agency paid for the certified mail receipt, they were the only party that could request a copy of Form 3894. The agency provided no response to the complainant's assertions on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under normal circumstances, the Commission would accept the signed and dated certified mail receipt as conclusive evidence of the date that the notice was received. However, the complainant has submitted evidence that validly raises a question as to who entered the date in block 7, and further, offers a way for the agency to confirm when she actually received the notice at issue. In the absence of a response by the agency addressing these issues on appeal the Commission is unable to affirm the agency's dismissal of the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course there are those cases where the complainant can submit too much evidence on the issue of receipt of the notice of final interview. For example, in <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A53625 (2005), the Commission found that the agency failed to prove the date of receipt, but that the complainant's own evidence demonstrated that he was untruthful about when he mailed his formal complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the record in this case, the complainant met his initial burden of presenting evidence and making an argument adequate to justify equitable tolling of the applicable time limit. Complainant has consistently asserted that he timely mailed the formal complaint on June 28, 2004, and he has provided a copy of the complaint dated "6-28-04" to support his assertion. The fact that the agency has no record of receiving his complaint before March 17, 2005, would not be sufficient, standing alone, to rebut complainant's assertion. The agency indicates, however, that there is documentary evidence which demonstrates the falsity of complainant's assertion that he mailed the complaint on June 28, 2004. As explained in the FAD, "The Certified Return Receipt Card and a tracking slip from the United States Postal Service indicates that [the complainant] received [his] NRFDC/4939 on July 2, 2004. Therefore, if [he] did not receive the 4939 until July 2, 2004, [he] would not have had the appropriate documentation to file [his] 4939 on June 28, 2004[, as complainant asserts]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The problem with the agency's assertion is that neither the "Certified Return Receipt Card" nor the "tracking slip from the United States Postal Service" is part of the record on appeal in this case. In the absence of adequate proof, the Commission will not dismiss discrimination complaints based solely on an agency's statements that it was untimely filed.<span class="Italic"> Espinoza v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A52555 (May 19, 2005) ("The Commission finds that the evidence is insufficient to show that the complaint was untimely filed[; t]he agency failed to identify any documents in the record proving that the notice was properly received on November 18,2004, or that complainant's formal complaint was filed on December 31, 2004"). This does not necessarily mean that the Commission must reverse the FAD and remand this case for further proceedings on the timeliness issue. The record here contains a copy of the U.S. Postal Service Certified Mail Receipt (# 7001 0320 0002 7748 2034), provided to the Commission by the complainant, which shows that the agency mailed the "Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint" to complainant on June 25, 2004. The Commission checked this receipt via the U.S. Postal Service's internet website: <a href="http://www.usps.com/shipping/trackandconfirm.htm?from=home&page=0035trackandconfirm&gt;">//www.usps.com/shipping/trackandconfirm.htm?from=home&page=0035trackandconfirm</a>. The Commission was thus able to confirm the agency's statement that the complainant received the requisite notice on July 2, 2004, and thus could not have mailed his complaint on June 28, 2004.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the Commission concludes that the agency has met its burden of establishing that the complainant failed to file his formal complaint in a timely manner, and the complaint has failed to offer an adequate justification to warrant an extension of the time limit for filing the complaint. <span class="Italic">Throop v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A45511 (Sept. 22, 2005); <span class="Italic">Suchorski v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A52816 (June 17,2005). Accordingly, the agency's dismissal of the complaint is AFFIRMED for the reasons set forth therein.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency makes two attempts to deliver the notice of final interview and, in response to the second attempt, is advised the complainant's post office box has been closed because the box rent was not paid, this is a sufficient effort and the 15-day time period was deemed to have started running on the date of the first attempted delivery. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vong v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A25081 (2003). In so holding, the Commission noted that it is the complainant's responsibility to keep the agency informed of her current mailing address. When the complainant does keep the agency informed of her current mailing address and the notice of final interview is sent to an incorrect address, the 15-day time limit will be set aside. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephenson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A53330 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">"The Commission has held that receipt of a document at a complainant's correct address, i.e., address of record, by a member of the complainant's family or household of suitable age and discretion creates a rebuttable presumption of constructive receipt." <span class="Italic">Dollander v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A55737 (2006), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Fontanella v. General Services Administration</span>, 05940131 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not clear whether an unsigned copy of the notice of final interview is sufficient to trigger the time period for filing a formal complaint. However, in <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A22377 (2002), the Commission held that a telefaxed notice of final interview did not start the running of the time period where the notice was unsigned, the complainant requested a signed copy and the agency subsequently issued a signed copy. Because of the brevity of the decision, it is not clear whether <span class="Italic">Dorsey</span> requires the agency to issue a signed copy or whether it was the reissuance of the notice that stopped the time period from running.</p>
