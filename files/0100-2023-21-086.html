<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-93"><span class="space">f.</span> Corrective Action</h5>
<p class="noindent">To avoid liability, agencies must exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassing behavior. "Reasonable care generally requires an employer to establish, disseminate, and enforce an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure, and to take reasonable steps to prevent and correct harassment. <span class="Italic">See Rosamaria F. v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120181068 (Feb. 14, 2020)." <span class="Italic">Felix R. v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 2019002240 (2021).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sharon M. v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120180192 (2019), for instance, the complainant received an offensive email from a coworker on November 11, 2016. She reported the email to union officials the same day and initiated contact with an EEO counselor 11 days later. The complainant's manger was notified on November 28, 2016. An internal investigation was launched on the same day. The alleged harasser was not disciplined until May of 2017. Six months was not prompt corrective action according to the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sharon M</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Agency, considering the record as a whole. The Agency asserted that it took immediate and appropriate action once it learned of the alleged harassment. Complainant received the email from CW on November 11, 2016. She reported the incident to regional union officials on November 11, 2016. The Union Officials indicated that they would remove CW from his union position. However, CW remained as Complainant's coworker.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant initiated contact with an EEO Counselor on November 22, 2016, and an intake interview was conducted on November 25, 2016. ROI, Exhibit B1. The Director of National Complaints Service Team notified the Air Traffic Manager of the allegation on November 28, 2016. ROI, Exhibit F2. It appears that the Agency engaged in an internal investigation. We note however, that the Agency failed to produce the report of the internal investigation within the ROI.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Agency's internal investigation, the April 14, 2017 affidavit of the Air Traffic Manager reveals that he and the Rochester Air Traffic Manager conducted an investigation. ROI, Exhibit F2. The two conducted interviews and follow-up interviews with Complainant and CW. Although the record does not contain a copy of the Agency's report of the internal investigation, it appears that Complainant was first interviewed on December 7, 2016, and that she signed her interview statement on December 12, 2016. ROI, Exhibit F11. In his April 21, 2017 affidavit, a Labor and Employee Relations Specialist (Specialist) stated that the investigation was completed. The Specialist also noted that there were discussions in Labor Relations with the Legal Department and that a draft of a notice of proposed action regarding CW's conduct was provided to the Air Traffic Manager, his manager, and the District Manager's office. ROI, Exhibit F4. The record included a copy of the proposed 30-day suspension. There was no copy of the final determination regarding the disciplinary action and no indication within the record that CW was actually disciplined for the harassment. The Agency asserted that the corrective action was effective because no similar incident has occurred since.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Agency is responsible for the hostile work environment unless it shows it took immediate and effective corrective action. Although the Agency took effective corrective action, upon review, we find that the Agency's action was not prompt. We note that the record clearly indicated that the investigation occurred in early December 2016. The harassment at hand involved a written email sent from CW to Complainant. Complainant indicated that she emailed CW from the original email asking him, "Who sent this to you?" CW replied, "I sent this to you?" He initially lied about the email but later attempted to apologize to Complainant within a week of the exchange. However, based on the acknowledgment of the email by CW and the Union Officials who were aware of the email, an investigation reasonably should not have taken longer than a month to obtain all the relevant information. The Agency did not state how long the internal investigation took and failed to provide a copy of the internal investigation in the ROI for the Commission to determine how long the Agency investigated the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Specialist averred that the investigation had been completed by April 21, 2017 and that management had drafted a disciplinary action. The proposed 30-day suspension was not received by CW until May 16, 2017, nearly a month after it was allegedly drafted. There is no reason given for the delay. In addition, it appears that the Agency took over six months to issue the proposed disciplinary action. Based on the events of this case, we find that six months is not prompt. <span class="Italic">See Isidro A. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120182263 (Oct. 16, 2018) (finding that the Agency failed to take prompt and effective action when it investigated a single utterance of the word "nigger" in the workplace on July 15, 2017 and issued disciplinary action on November 21, 2017). As such, we conclude the Agency failed to take prompt action after learning of the harassment. Because the Agency failed to meet its affirmative defense burden, we find that it is liable for CW's actions and reverse the Agency's determination of no discrimination as to Complainant's claim of harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whatever corrective action the agency chooses it must work to prevent the harassing behavior from continuing. In <span class="Italic">Felix R. v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 2019002240 (2021), for instance, the Commission found that a letter to the harassing supervisor was not enough to avoid liability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, we conclude that Complainant was subjected to harassment based on his sex and race. Complainant clearly established that he is a member of the protected classes based on his sex and that he was subjected to unwelcome conduct. Regarding his sex, we find that Complainant was subjected to severe or pervasive comments which were premised on his sex and included sex-based preferences, assumptions, expectations, stereotypes or norms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, we note that S1 made multiple comments that were based on Complainant's sexual orientation. With respect to the "Barry Manilow" comment, the incident occurred at an office-wide retreat and S1 singled out Complainant specifically regarding his sexual orientation. When going around the room, S1 made professional comments about everyone except Complainant. With Complainant, S1 chose to publicly disclose that Complainant "came out" to her. We further note that S1's "gay mafia" comments, especially in her capacity as a supervisor, perpetuate an environment in which slights based on sexual orientation are normalized. Witness testimony corroborates Complainant's allegations and indicates that the term travelled through the office rumor mill. Furthermore, multiple witnesses affirmed that they heard S1's comments related to Complainant's sexual orientation and race and the treatment directed at Complainant, which witnesses described as more contentious than S1's treatment of others. Accordingly, we find that the nature of S1's remarks were of such magnitude that it created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment for Complainant. We, therefore, find that Complainant has established the fourth prong of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the fifth prong of a harassment claim, an agency is subject to vicarious liability for harassment when it is created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742 (1998); <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775 (1998); <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has met his burden of establishing that the Agency was liable for the harassment because it was committed by his supervisor. When the harassment does not result in a tangible employment action being taken against the employee, the employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability. The Agency can meet this defense, which is subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, by demonstrating: (a) that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior; and (b) that Complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the Agency or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="Italic">Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 2270; <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 118 S. Ct. at 2293; <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). This defense is not available when the harassment results in a tangible employment action being taken against the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_878"></span>Here, the harassing conduct did not coincide with a tangible employment action. However, the Agency has not raised an affirmative defense, either in its final decision or on appeal. Therefore, we find that the Agency is liable for S1's harassment and any compensatory damages that Complainant may be entitled to for that harassment. Even if the Agency had raised an affirmative defense, we find that the Agency failed to demonstrate that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct S1's behavior. Reasonable care generally requires an employer to establish, disseminate, and enforce an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure, and to take reasonable steps to prevent and correct harassment. <span class="Italic">See Rosamaria F. v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120181068 (Feb. 14, 2020).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency issued a Policy Statement on Anti-Harassment on May 1, 2014, outlining its obligation to prevent harassment, the record lacks evidence of the most recent dissemination of the policy or when Complainant received the policy. Further, the Agency failed to promptly correct S1's behavior when Complainant complained about the harassment. S1 provided an email response during an investigation into Complainant's allegations, which did not deny her actions. Rather, S1 alleged that Complainant "initiated conversations, laughed, responded and was otherwise fully engaged in the joking back and forth" and pointed out deficiencies that she felt Complainant demonstrated in his work. Following the investigation, S1's behavior was addressed with a letter simply stating, "as we discussed at the conclusion of the interview process, certain statements you made could be taken the wrong way by your subordinates." Complainant was issued a vague notice that management was concerned about the allegations and was working with senior management to address them without providing any further details. The record does not indicate that any additional action or follow-up occurred. S1 was not disciplined or warned that discipline would result from additional comments. Contrary to management officials' assertions, we find that S1's statements were inappropriate regardless of whether they could be "taken the wrong way." Furthermore, when Complainant informed management officials of S1's conduct, the Agency officials failed to take the appropriate action. Therefore, we find that Complainant has established that he was subjected to a hostile work environment and that the Agency is liable for the harassment by S1.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission ruled in the agency's favor, in <span class="italic">Elaine P. v. Secretary of Defense,</span> 2021001101 (2022), where the agency followed up its failed initial attempts at corrective action with stricter action. In that case, the agency avoided liability where it "consistently took immediate and appropriate corrective action":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleges that she was subjected to harassment based on her sex by her Coworker (C1). Here, even if Complainant established a prima facie case of harassment, we find that the Agency consistently took immediate and appropriate corrective action. Thus, there is no basis for imputing liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence shows that Complainant and C1 were both managers in the CAGE Program. The CAGE Program had two branches. Complainant oversaw a branch located in Michigan. C1 oversaw a branch located in Pennsylvania. Both Complainant and C1 have the same first line supervisor (S1). Although Complainant and C1 were located in different states, the nature of their responsibilities required regular virtual contact, and they occasionally interacted in person.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant and C1 first met in August 2019, in Ohio during supervisor training. In October 22, 2019, both Complainant and C1 were at the Agency's Michigan facility for a meeting. Complainant asserts that C1 arrived late to the meeting, kissed the back of her head, and whispered "hey baby" in her ear in front of her colleagues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 30, 2019 at about 4:00 pm, Complainant reported the incident to S1. She also reported that C1 had called her inappropriate nicknames in their email and messenger correspondence including "a peach," "girlfriend," and "Bay-bee." At 8:00 AM on October 31, 2019, S1 contacted the human resource specialist (HR1) and the Agency's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Team (SAPR) to address Complainant's allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 4, 2019, S1 issued C1 a no contact order stating that effective immediately, C1 was to have no direct or indirect contact with Complainant due to Complainant's allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. The letter further stated that failure to adhere to the no contact order could result in disciplinary action, including termination. The letter also noted that if C1 had a business reason necessitating contact with Complainant, he was to notify S1, and she would facilitate the communication.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 15, 2019, Complainant's allegation was forwarded to Federal Protective Services (FPS), Department of Homeland Security for a criminal investigation. Once the investigation was completed, the Western District of Michigan Assistant U.S. Attorney declined to prosecute the case. FPS returned the case back to the Agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG) for investigation.2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 20 and 21, 2019, Complainant contacted HR1 and complained she received indirect contact from C1. HR1 consulted with Complainant's second line supervisor (S2) and it was decided that C1 would be detailed to the Portfolio Team and would be supervised by the team’s Portfolio Program Analyst (PA1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 29, 2019, S1 removed C1 from all CAGE email groups, meeting invites, system access, and took over supervision of C1's staff. C1 was no longer a member of CAGE. On December 2, 2019, C1 was officially detailed to PA1's team.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claims 1 and 2, the evidence shows that within one day of Complainant reporting the incidents to management, S1 and HR1 took measures to eliminate all direct and indirect contact between Complainant and C1. The Agency contacted HR the morning after being made aware of the alleged incidents the evening before. Then, after two business days implemented the no contact order. There is no indication there was any contact in that short time period between Complainant and C1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 3a, the record shows that Complainant attended a Portfolio Team meeting while acting on behalf of S1 in her absence. S1 stated that Complainant was instructed not to attend Portfolio Team meetings. When Complainant contacted HR1 on November 20, 2019 and November 21, 2019, alleging that she was still receiving indirect contact from C1, HR1 contacted S2 who determined the best way to mitigate the risk of any future contact between Complainant and C1 was to detail C1 to a set of duties outside the CAGE program and have him report directly to the PA1. PA1 stated that during the call-in meeting at issue, C1 was in attendance to provide an update to the program managers on an item of interest. However, C1 did not have any updates and did not speak directly or indirectly to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 3b, C1 stated that he reached out to a senior CAGE employee to inquire about Complainant's health because she had been out sick. C1 stated that the employee's decision to tell Complainant about the conversation was the employee's decision and not solicited by C1. C1 stated that both S1 and PA1 provided guidance to him to ensure the required separation was in place pursuant to the no contact order. C1 further noted that he did not interact with Complainant during the Portfolio Team meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 stated that Complainant told her that C1 contacted one of her employees but did not provide specific details. S1 then contacted C1 via email and phone and told him to cease communication with anyone other than his own team.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claims 3c and 3d, S1 reported that Complainant did not inform her of any concerns regarding employees' perceptions or concerns regarding C1's return to his position. Thus, management did not have an opportunity to take formal action with regard to these issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 4, S1 noted that acting on S2's behalf in her absence was a normal responsibility for her role as a supervisor in the CAGE program. In addition, Complainant served as acting manager from February 20-28, 2020, and not March or April 2020. S1 also told C1 that she was available by phone for any emergencies. S1 stated that Complainant never reported that she had elevated stress, and noted Complainant had an entire team to assist her in her responsibilities. When S1 returned, Complainant informed her that the entire team performed well while she was away.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that with respect to all claims, once Complainant reported her concerns to management, the Agency took immediate, appropriate and effective actions to stop the unwanted behavior and address Complainant's allegations. Accordingly, there is no basis for imputing liability for sexual harassment to the Agency.</p>
