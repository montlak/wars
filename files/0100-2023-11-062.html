<h3 class="h3" id="sec2-62"><span class="space">E.</span> HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CASES</h3>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan</span>, 122 S. Ct. 2061 (2002), the Supreme Court held that a hostile environment claim comprised of a series of discriminatory actions constitutes a single unlawful employment practice. As a result, the Court held that a claim can be timely brought at any time during the existence of that environment, provided at least one act of alleged harassment occurred within the charge-filing period. In federal sector cases, this means that at least one act of alleged harassment must have occurred within 45 days of the initial request for a counselor. <span class="Italic">See e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Vance v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120114292 (2013) (last incident of alleged harassment occurred within 45 days of initiation of counseling); <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A60148 (2006) (complainant sought counseling within 45 days of latest incident of alleged harassment thus rendering entire claim, spanning some 30 months, timely); <span class="Italic">Hill v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A60228 (2006) (same in cases with 28 incidents over 10 month period). To be considered "a single unlawful employment practice," the series of discriminatory actions must, of course, be related in some way. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Lashawna C. v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0720160020 (2017), however, rejected the notion that a "pattern of conduct" or relatedness among incidents could not be established where the same alleged harasser was not involved in each incident. In that case, the complainant alleged several incidents of harassment based on her religion (Jewish) that were outside the 45-day time period, including that the agency denied her religious leave and the complainant's supervisor referred to himself in an email to the complainant as working like a "Hebrew slave." Timely raised incidents included that she was notified that a Christmas movie would be shown at a fundraising event and, when she requested an alternative movie, she was badgered and harassed regarding her faith; that she was forced to view religious items at an auction; and she was subjected to a continuation of pay audit. The agency dismissed the "Hebrew slave" claim has untimely and unrelated to other claims. The Commission disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that the AJ erred in finding that claim 3 was initiated by timely EEO Counselor contact. Upon review, we determine that claim 3 cannot be viewed in an isolated or piecemeal manner. Instead, Complainant's complaint consists of Complainant's overall, interrelated claim that she was subjected to various incidents of religious harassment. The fact that S1 was not the alleged actor in every incident does not undermine the pattern aspect of Complainant's overall claim. The unifying theme of each claim is that within a relatively short period of time, Complainant was subjected to incidents of harassment and discrimination because she is Jewish. <span class="Italic">See Meaney v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940169 (Nov. 3, 1994) (the "pattern aspect" of a complainant's allegations should not be ignored and defined in a piecemeal manner where an analogous theme unites the matter complained of). The alleged incidents in Complainant's claim collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice, a hostile work environment based on religion. <span class="Italic">See National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan. Jr</span>., 536 U.S. 101, 117 (2002). As such, Complainant's ongoing harassment claim contains matters (claims 5, 6, and 7) that occurred within 45 days of Complainant's initial EEO Counselor contact. Consequently, we find that claim 3 was initiated by timely EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">In general, <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> holds that an employer is liable for all acts contributing to the hostile environment, even those that fall well outside the statute of limitations. However, the Court in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> also noted that employers may have equitable defenses that could limit recovery, where the plaintiff has unreasonably delayed in filing suit and the employer is prejudiced by that delay.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ornelas v. Attorney General</span>, 01995301 (2002), the Commission explained the effect of <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> on hostile environment and discrete action claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that the Supreme Court of the United States (Court) recently held that a complainant alleging a hostile work <span id="Page_85"></span>environment will not be time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period<span class="Italic">. See National</span> <span class="Italic">Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</span> 122 S. Ct. 2061 (June 10, 2002). The Court further held, however, that "discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The Court defined such "discrete discriminatory acts" to include acts such as termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire, acts that constitute separate actionable unlawful employment practices<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Finally, the Court held that such untimely discrete acts may be used as background evidence in support of a timely claim<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, given that complainant contacted an EEO Counselor on February 25, 1994, we find the February 4, 1994 three day suspension and RMO's February 14, 1994 alteration of complainant's two hours of sick leave to AWOL to constitute "discrete acts" that were timely filed. We find the following acts, however, to constitute discrete acts that fall outside the filing period and were thus untimely: the January 20, 1993 memorandum placing complainant on leave restrictions; the April 1993 failure to promote; and the July 21, 1993, Official Reprimand for AWOL.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The remaining incidents include complainant being issued memoranda and warnings that merely chastised her but did not result in any disciplinary action, such as the two memoranda issued on February 9, 1993, as well as the two memoranda issued on June 15, 1993. Additional incidents include RMO's actions in tape-recording their meetings, including the February 5, 1993 progress review, giving her the "silent treatment," and RMO's practice of standing by complainant, staring at her, and directing her co-workers to watch her. We find that such acts are related because they all allegedly involved the same individual, namely RMO. Given that such acts are not "discrete acts," we find that complainant initiated timely EEO Counselor contact because at least one of the acts, RMO's "silent treatment" of complainant, continued during the forty-five days prior to her initial EEO contact, and indeed beyond such contact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the Court recently held that discrete acts that are untimely filed may nevertheless be used as background evidence in support of a timely claim of hostile work environment<span class="Italic">. See Morgan</span>, 122 S. Ct. 2061. Thus the January 20, 1993 memorandum placing complainant on leave restrictions, the April 1993 failure to promote, and the July 21, 1993 Official Reprimand for AWOL, may all be considered as relevant background evidence of a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Wegener v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A03847 (2003), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the record reflects that complainant timely contacted an EEO counselor and filed complaints on the October 19, 1994 Notice of Reprimand (issue a), the agency's failure to provide complainant oral assignments like the male employees (issue b), S-1's statement that complainant would work as a parts runner (issue c), the work leader's intimidating actions with respect to complainant driving the truck (issue h), a coworker's statement that complainant did not have a future with the NPS (issue k), and the agency allegedly coercing complainant to quit (issue o). We find that the October 19, 1994 Notice of Reprimand (issue a) and the agency allegedly coercing complainant to quit (issue o) constitute "discrete acts," which were timely filed. We further find that the agency's failure to provide complainant oral assignments like the male employees (issue b), S-1's statement that complainant would work as a parts runner (issue c), the work leader's intimidating actions with respect to complainant driving the truck (issue h), and a coworker's statement that complainant did not have a future with the NPS (issue k) constitute evidence to support a claim of a hostile work environment, which was also timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency dismissed the following incidents because complainant's EEO counselor contact was untimely: coworker-1's urination off the side of the boat and harassment of complainant (issue d), coworker-2's request for sex and derogatory comments about African Americans (issue e), coworker-2's intentional incorrect demonstration on how to shift a heavy duty truck (issue f), male employees taking tools from complainant (issue g), the work leader yelling at complainant and entering the restroom (issue i), the District Ranger's sexually suggestive comments (issue j), the agency's request for medical documentation (issue l), and complainant's suspension, dated November 6, 1991 (issue n). We note that complainant stated in both of her complaints that she had been subjected to a "pattern of harassment due to sex and disability over a number of years." She further stated that she was subjected to "abuse, differential treatment, and vicious mockery." By separately listing each incident alleged in complainant's separate complaints, the issues identified by the agency represent an erroneous piecemeal method for addressing the underlying claim of a pattern of ongoing harassment. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970705 (April 22, 1999). Although the record reflects that complainant did not seek timely EEO counselor contact as to these issues, the Commission cannot say with certainty that these incidents are not part of the same actionable hostile work environment claim. With the exception of complainant's suspension, dated November 6, 1991 (issue n), we find that issues d, e, f, g, i, j, and l do not represent "discrete acts," but rather, serve as examples of complainant's overall claim of hostile work environment. These issues cannot be dismissed for untimely EEO counselor contact, because the incidents constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice, and complainant timely initiated contact with respect to the agency's failure to provide complainant oral assignments like the male employees (issue b), S-1's statement that complainant would work as a parts runner (issue c), the work leader's intimidating actions with respect to complainant driving the truck (issue h), and a coworker's statement that complainant did not have a future with the NPS (issue k). Therefore, the Commission finds that coworker-1's urination off the side of the boat and harassment of complainant (issue d), coworker-2's request for sex and derogatory comments about African Americans (issue e), coworker-2's intentional incorrect demonstration on how to shift a heavy duty truck (issue f), male employees taking tools from complainant (issue g), the work leader yelling at complainant and entering the restroom (issue i), the District Ranger's sexually suggestive comments (issue j), and the agency's request for medical documentation (issue l) are timely and shall be presented as support to complainant's claim of hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that complainant and the agency entered into a settlement, an Informal Resolution Agreement, signed by complainant on September 23, 1992, to resolve the proposed five-day suspension (issue m). We find that issue m states the same claim that has been decided by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.107(a)(1). Finally, complainant alleged that she was suspended, effective November 6, 1991, due to discrimination. We find that issue n constitutes a "discrete act," and therefore, complainant failed to timely initiate EEO counselor contact. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.105(a)(1). Accordingly, issues n and m are dismissed, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.105(a)(1) and 1614.107(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wright-Outlaw v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A20214 (2003) (complainant's claim over temporary promotion was discrete act and counselor contact was untimely, but could be used as background evidence in hostile environment claim); <span class="Italic">Cole v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A03203 (2003) (claims involving leave restriction, 14-day suspension and failure to receive proper pay were discrete acts and not timely).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, when the last act of alleged harassment occurs more than 45 days prior to the initiation of counseling, the complaint is untimely. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Winters v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52822 (2005) (complainant admitted that last incident of alleged harassment occurred well before July, but did not initiate contact until September). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Goga v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A14721 (2003); <span class="Italic">Dobbins v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A15248 (2003) (holding that the initiation of counseling was timely where the most recent act of harassment occurred within 45 days of counselor contact).</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, those situations are subject to the doctrines of waiver, tolling and estoppel as with other complaints. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120151153 (2015), the Commission set aside the 45-day timeframe in a hostile environment case noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the unique facts of this case, we determine that it is appropriate to reverse the Agency's dismissal and remand the complaint for further processing. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) provides that the time limitations provided for in the EEO complaint processing regulations are subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling. Under this authority, we find that this is an appropriate case to excuse Complainant's failure to contact the appropriate EEO counselor within the regulatory 45-day period. In reaching this decision, we have considered that the complaint at issue concerns an allegation of ongoing sexual harassment over a long period of time by one individual, who may have other complaints made against him. Complainant alleged that she twice reported the harassment to two different supervisors and nothing was done. In addition, FB made it clear that "everything went through him," which we view as a means of intimidating Complainant, especially since FB confronted her when she contacted the union about another matter. Finally it was only when Complainant learned that another female employee used the EEO complaint process to complain about FB's behavior--apparently without FB's intervention--that Complainant contacted an EEO counselor as well. Under these facts, we find it appropriate to require the Agency to continue processing of the complaint, despite Complainant's delay in seeking EEO counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though complaints over discrete personnel actions are time-barred, they can be considered as background evidence in determining whether a hostile environment existed. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 01A52160 (2005), held that even when time-barred acts were considered with other allegations of hostile environment harassment, it did not rise to the level of being sufficiently severe or pervasive to state a claim. However, the discrete personnel action must be sufficiently connected to the claim of hostile environment harassment to be considered as evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Parrilla v. <span id="Page_86"></span>Attorney General</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a45482.txt">01A45482</a> (2005) (holding that the 1998 denial of a cash award was not sufficiently connected to the hostile environment claim and was appropriately time-barred).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission gave a succinct explanation of the connection between untimely raised discrete acts and hostile environment claims in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120132568 (2015);</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In asserting that untimely discrete acts raised by Complainant should not be a part of this hostile work environment claim, the Agency misapplies the Supreme Court's decision in Morgan. <span class="Italic">See James v. Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520120488 (May 17, 2013). It is true that under <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, a discrete act is independently actionable only if it occurred with the applicable time limitation period. A discrete act that occurred before the relevant time limitation period is untimely even if it is related to other actions that are timely. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But what the Agency crucially misses is that even untimely discrete acts can be used as background evidence in support of timely actions. <span class="Italic">James, supra</span>. Generally for hostile work environment claims, all of the incidents that make up the same hostile work environment claim are actionable as long as at least one incident occurred within the time limitation period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This includes any incidents that an employee suspected were discriminatory before the time limitation period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A discrete act that occurred outside the time limitation period may be part of a hostile work environment claim, in that the discrete act may be considered in determining whether the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to be actionable, and the appropriate relief for the hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. What is not available to the complainant is relief for the discrete act itself because the untimely discrete act is not separately actionable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) requires that complaints of discrimination should be brought to the attention of the Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor within forty-five (45) days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within forty-five (45) days of the effective date of the action. Here. Complainant contacted an EEO Counselor on April 9, 2012, which makes only her claim 8 timely. However, because the incidents that make up Complainant's hostile work environment claim "collectively constitute one 'unlawful employment practice,'" the entire hostile work environment claim is actionable because at least one incident that is part of the claim occurred within 45 days of EEO counselor contact. <span class="Italic">James, supra</span>. As a result, we find that the Agency erred when it dismissed Complainant's hostile work environment claim because at least one claim was timely filed, and the untimely discreet acts can be used as background evidence in the overall hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, the Commission has muddled, rather than clarified, the proper scope of the remedies when a hostile environment claim is based, in part, on discrete acts that are time--barred. For example, in <span class="Italic">Casteel v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A50425 (2006), the Commission held that the agency erred in dismissing claims involving discrete acts to the extent they were part of a hostile environment claim. The Commission, noting that individual claims involving those discrete acts were untimely, stated in <span class="Italic">Casteel:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency decision determined that incidents (2)-(5) constituted discrete acts and dismissed these allegations for untimely EEO Counselor contact because complainant had not initiated EEO counseling until July 30, 2004. However, upon review, we find that the agency improperly dismissed incidents (2)-(5) because the incidents constitute part of complainant's overall hostile work environment claim and cannot be individually dismissed as discrete acts for untimely EEO Counselor contact. In making this determination, we find that the agency correctly characterized incidents (2)-(4) as discrete acts, which are not independently actionable because they are individually untimely. However, we also find that the agency erred in failing to recognize that discrete acts which occur outside the filing period, such as incidents (2)-(4), may be considered in assessing whether complainant was subject to a hostile work environment and in determining the appropriate remedy for a violation when the discrete acts are related to abusive conduct or language, i.e. a pattern of discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 116 (Title VII is violated where workplace is "permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult'" that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an abusive working environment). We further find that the agency improperly characterized incident (5) as a discrete act, and it is our determination that incident (5) must be viewed as a non-discrete act which is part of complainant's overall hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that complainant's hostile work environment claim is timely since at least one act constituting complainant's harassment claim occurred within the filing period, namely incident (1) which allegedly occurred in July 2004. Therefore, the Commission finds that incidents (2)-(5) were improperly dismissed as untimely insofar as they should be considered in assessing whether complainant was subject to a hostile work environment and in determining the appropriate remedy for a violation if the discrete acts are related to abusive conduct or language, i.e. a pattern of discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.</p>
<p class="noindent">Thus, the Commission's position remained unclear as to whether the remedies in such a case can include a restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> by reversing the effects of any discrete acts, such as canceling a suspension and ordering back pay, or whether the remedy is limited to compensatory damages from any emotional distress caused by those acts.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's position was clarified in <span class="Italic">Sorg v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 0720060065 (2008), where it found that the administrative judge erred in reinstating an untimely nonselection claim as part of a hostile environment claim and granting specific relief on the nonselection. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Sorg</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the agency's contention that the AJ erred in reinstating claim (5), we note that the Supreme Court has held that where complainant is alleging they were subjected to a hostile work environment, the complaint will not be time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period. <span class="Italic">See National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</span> 536 U.S. 101 (2002). The Court further held that "discrete acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 113. However, although they are not separately actionable and no recovery is available for them, untimely discrete acts may be used as background evidence in support of a timely claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, we find that although complainant's non-selection for the position of Senior Field Representative is not separately actionable, the AJ properly relied upon his finding that complainant was subjected to unlawful sex discrimination as support of complainant's hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, however, that the AJ appears to have gone further and found that complainant's nonselection was discriminatory and ordered her retroactive placement in the position with appropriate back pay. As stated above, complainant's claim of discriminatory nonselection was not raised in a timely manner. While this claim could be used as background evidence to support complainant's timely harassment claim, there is no separate remedial relief available to complainant on this untimely claim. Therefore, to the extent that the AJ ordered separate relief on this claim, we hereby modify the ordered remedial relief as indicated in the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission is not above confusing the timeliness analysis either. For example, in <span class="Italic">Guvenir v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a52672.txt">01A52672</a> (2005), the Commission applied the reasonable suspicion standard to determine that a hostile environment claim was timely:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the allegations in the complaint comprise the same unlawful practice, a claim of harassment. Complainant's allegations implicate the same five supervisors who allegedly falsified forms, changed complainant's hours so that he would miss his night classes, stopped complainant from attending doctor visits and conducted disciplinary investigatory interviews. In a statement incorporated by reference in the complaint, complainant avers:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I have uncovered several illegal activities and other harassing events which other employees do not have to deal with. The fact that I am the only person of Middle Eastern descent working in the Oregon City Post Office, and the fact that these events become greater around the 9-11 Anniversary show a direct relation to the harassment being based on my nationality. The more I looked into the events of the past, the more I realized a pattern of harassment from these five supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From the record, it seems clear that there is a common theme of national origin discrimination. Specifically, the complainant contends that the alleged violations began around the anniversary of September 11, 2001, because they perceived him to be of Middle Eastern descent. Complainant has also clearly alleged that the discrimination recurred on several occasions, most recently September 30, 2004--the last of his four investigatory interviews. As such, the Commission determines that the agency improperly dismissed complainant's claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the agency erred in dismissing complainant's claims for untimeliness. Complainant contacted the EEO Counselor on September 20, 2004, and he alleges that he did not discover the pattern of harassment until September 8, 2004, after the first of four investigatory interviews. Thus, he contacted the EEO Counselor within the 45 time period required by &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(l).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly in <span class="Italic">Allegra P. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120152911 (2016), the Commission applied an analysis to determine timeliness that seemed to be a hybrid between a hostile work environment and a continuing violation theory--two mutually exclusive analyses. Even though the Commission got the end result right, it confuses the analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) requires that an aggrieved person must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action. However, this <span id="Page_87"></span>time requirement may be waived as to certain allegations within a complaint when the complainant alleges a continuing violation, i.e., a series of related discriminatory acts. If one of the related acts complained of falls within the 45-day period for contacting a counselor, the complaint is timely with respect to all of the acts which constitute the continuing violation. <span class="Italic">See Valentino v. United States Postal Service</span>, 674 F.2d 56 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Olinkraft, Inc</span>., 556 F.2d 1219 (5th Cir. 1977), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 434 U.S. 1069 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that where there is an issue of timeliness, "[a]n agency always bears the burden of obtaining sufficient information to support a reasoned determination as to timeliness." <span class="Italic">Homer Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920506 (August 25, 1992). Moreover, where, a complainant alleges a pattern and practice of discrimination against him, an agency is obligated to initiate an inquiry into whether any allegations untimely raised fall within the ambit of the continuing violation theory. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we determine that the matter of the subject complaint was not simply the claim as identified by the Agency in its final decision. We have extensively detailed the matters that were the subject of EEO counseling, as noted above. When considering those matters in conjunction with the formal complaint, as reinforced by Complainant's appellate arguments, we determine that Complainant alleged that she had been harassed to such a point that the harassment culminated in her separation from Agency employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, a review of the record discloses two critical EEO contact dates in question in the instant matter. In response to Complainant's appeal, the Agency submitted a brief restating its position that Complainant failed to contact an EEO Counselor in a timely manner. The Agency asserts that Complainant sought EEO counseling in <span class="Italic">June 2015</span>, concerning her poor performance appraisal. However, the Agency also acknowledges in its brief to the Commission that <span class="Italic">during her initial EEO contact on February 25, 2015</span> "Complainant stated that she was being forced out of her job because of her disability and she ultimately resigned on January 23, 2015 because she was unable to do her job." (emphasis added). The EEO Counselor's report states that Complainant contacted the Agency's EEO Complaints Manager on February 25, 2015 indicating that she wanted to file a complaint or participate in Alternate Dispute Resolution. According to the EEO Counselor's report, "the aggrieved agreed to an exit interview...as relief for her issues." However, in its final decision, the Agency contends that Complainant elected not to pursue the complaint process further, reasoning instead that Complainant again initiated counselor contacted in June of 2015. Upon review, we find that the record discloses that Complainant first contacted the Agency regarding her concerns in February 2015. Moreover, we find that the record does not support a determination that Complainant affirmatively withdrew or abandoned her February 2015 contact, and we will therefore construed the initial EEO contact as indeed, having occurred on February 25, 2015.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, a review of the instant record further reflects that Complainant based her EEO contact and subsequent EEO complaint on a series of events and actions directly and indirectly related to work conditions and/or her job performance. Complainant claimed numerous incidents as outlined in the report of the EEO Counselor, which allegedly occurred between October 2013 and January 23, 2015 when she resigned from the Agency. Complainant alleged that the incidents were of a similar nature, which purportedly resulted in the Agency's failure to accommodate her disability and, subsequently, a constructive discharge. Upon review, we find that the alleged discriminatory incidents, regarding Complainant's work conditions and/or her job performance occurring from October 2013 to January 23, 2015, are related to the issue of her constructive discharge in January 2015 for which she sought EEO counseling in February 2015. We therefore determine that because some of the events occurred well within forty-five days of Complainant's job separation, all of the alleged harassment claims will be construed as timely pursued with an EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent">Though the Commission uses phrases like "actions directly and indirectly related to work conditions" and "incidents similar in nature," which suggest a nexus determination as is required under a continuing violation analysis, <span class="Italic">Allegra</span> is not a continuing violation case. It is a hostile work environment claim with a discrete act alleged, ie., the WIGI denial, among other acts that would not in and of themselves be actionable, but collectively could be if they rose to the level of being sufficiently severe or pervasive to state a hostile environment claim. In that case, per <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, the entire complaint is timely as one "unlawful employment practice," if any of the acts alleged in furtherance of the hostile environment occurred within the 45 days prior to counselor contact. The WIGI denial, because it is a discrete act, would have been included in the hostile environment claim as evidence to establish complainant's case, but any claim over the denial would have been time barred. Note that the cases cited in the opening paragraph dealing with continuing violations predate <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> and rely on a rationale the Supreme Court has specifically rejected. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Greer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60132 (2006) (agency erred in dismissing harassment claims as untimely where complainant developed a reasonable suspicion of discrimination only after twice complaining to management with no corrective action).</p>
<p class="noindent">In contrast is <span class="Italic">Jaroszynski v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52487 (2005), where the Commission found that several claimed incidents of harassment, such as a schedule change, reassignment, and the denial of holiday work, were discrete personnel actions and time-barred, but could be considered as background evidence to the hostile environment claim without reference to the reasonable suspicion standard. As the Commission reiterated in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0520140235 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Even if the discrete acts that are part of this hostile work environment claim are not independently actionable because they were not timely raised, the only consequence is that Complainant cannot receive relief for the discrete acts themselves. But those discrete acts are still part of the timely raised hostile work environment claim and can be considered as background evidence in determining whether the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive and the appropriate remedy for the hostile work environment." <span class="Italic">Chan v. Dept of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520130257 (June 18, 2013); <span class="Italic">James v. Dept of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520120488 (May 17, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">While the outcome in <span class="Italic">Guvenir</span> is correct, because a hostile environment claim is an allegation of one unlawful employment practice under <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, there is no need to apply the reasonable suspicion standard. The only proper question is whether one act in furtherance of the claim allegedly occurred within 45 days of counseling. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sinkhorn v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 020081331 (2008) (properly analyzing issue of timeliness in hostile environment claim and holding entire claim is timely if any act in furtherance of the alleged hostile environment occurred within 45 days of counselor contact).</p>
<p class="noindent">This latter point was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120053612 (2007), where the complainant was subjected to egregious verbal harassment that included continual sexually explicit comments and suggestions of an affair by a team leader. After she filed an EEO complaint, the unit supervisor eliminated her role in hiring new employees, stopped inviting her to staff meetings, impeded her access to agency benefit programs, such as leave donation, charged her with improperly taking government documents and required her to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination. The agency dismissed most of the supervisor's actions as discrete acts where counselor contact was untimely. In reversing the agency in <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court recognized that allegations of harassment and the existence of a hostile work environment involve, by their nature, a series of incidents linked by a pattern of conduct. This is contrasted with claims involving discrete acts such as a promotion or termination which are clearly defined. In those instances, the Court held that "discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Untimely discrete acts may be used as background evidence in support of a timely claim, however. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> decision, the Commission again finds that the agency improperly dismissed several allegations from complainant's claims for untimely EEO counselor contact. As previously stated, the Commission finds that complainant's complaints concern matters that comprise a claim of harassment. The Commission has held that an agency should not ignore the pattern aspect of a claim and define the issues in a piecemeal manner where an analogous theme unites the matters contained therein. Here, we find that all the claims in Complaint 1 address alleged discriminatory harassment by TL. Likewise, we find that all the claims in Complaint 2 address alleged discriminatory harassment and reprisal by S1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the incidents in complainant's allegation (1) are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act fell within the filing period, and thus the EEO counselor contact is timely with regard to all the allegations raised in that claim. The FAD found that allegations 13, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30 and 31 in the first claim, and allegations 6, 7, 9-14, 16 and 18 of the second claim constituted discrete acts which fell outside the 45-day window for making EEO counselor contact and thus would be dismissed under Morgan. Based on the findings in our prior decision, we find it was an error for the agency's FAD to dismiss the various allegations raised in complainant's allegation (1) and (2) for untimely counselor contact. As stated in our prior decision, we found that EEO counselor contact was timely with regard to all the matters raised within Complaint 1. Further, we found that should a fact-finder determine that complainant initiated counselor contact in May 1996, her second complaint was also timely. As the FAD found that it was reasonable to find that complainant made EEO counselor contact with regard to her second claim on or around May 2, 1996, we find the allegations in that complaint are also timely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the above, we find that, unlike the agency, the allegations which were dismissed by the agency as discrete acts of discrimination were in fact within the relevant time period and are evidence, if proven, of harassment by TL and S1, not discrete acts of discrimination. These dismissed allegations were in fact connected to timely raised incidents, as part of the allegations of sexual harassment, hostile work environment <span id="Page_88"></span>and retaliation by TL and S1 between the years 1993-1996. Further, we note that complainant alleged that there was a continuation of similar kinds of sex-based comments and conduct, most of which TL conceded in his first affidavit, from the time she began working for TL until she was separated from the agency. We find that simply because several of complainant's allegations involved issues such as performance ratings, deployment to various positions, proposed termination, leave donation and breast feeding, these matters should not have been considered clearly defined, discrete acts which warrant dismissal. As the dismissed allegations were not considered by the agency in finding that complainant failed to establish that she was the victim of sexual harassment and/or retaliation by TL or S1, we must vacate both of the FADs and remand this matter for further consideration of all complainant's allegations in both Complaint 1 and Complaint 2.</p>
<p class="noindent">A question that <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> did not answer because it was not posed by the facts of the case is whether there is a period of time between incidents alleged to constitute a hostile environment that would break the chain of events in a way that at least some portion of the claim would be untimely. Although there still is no definitive answer to that question, in <span class="Italic">James v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120102361 (2012), the Commission found that a little over three years between events did not break that chain. In <span class="Italic">James</span>, the complainant alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a coworker after a night of heavy drinking while at an off-site conference. The complainant alleged that she went back to her room with the coworker and, at some point, realized they were both naked and told the coworker to stop. He left the room, but the complainant did not report what she believed to a sexual assault due to feelings of shame, confusion and fright. After that, she attempted to avoid the coworker.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some three years later, she was reassigned to a position in another branch and, by this time, the coworker was now a deputy chief in that branch. She alleged that from the start of her reassignment, the former coworker treated her in a hostile manner, continually made sexually suggestive remarks and gestures toward her, commented about her breast size and demanded hugs on a daily basis. Eventually, in response to a rumor that the former coworker might become branch chief, she reported the conduct to management and, thereafter, filed an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">James v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120072143 (2007), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of the complaint and remanded the case for further processing. An administrative judge then granted summary judgment for the agency based, in part, on a ruling that the 2002 incident was too remote in time from the other incidents and dismissing that part of the claim. The Commission, in its 2012 decision in <span class="Italic">James</span>, reversed that ruling holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, in concluding no discrimination had occurred, the AJ found that the 2002 incident (alleged sexual assault) was too remote in time from the other evidence of harassment and, therefore dismissed it as untimely raised. Complainant argued that the AJ ignored the earlier decision in EEOC Appeal No. 0120072143, finding that the events alleged by Complainant that occurred between 2002 and 2006 constituted a single claim of harassment. We find that the 2002 sexual encounter with CW is inextricably intertwined with the events that occurred in 2005-2006 when he returned to the workplace. As stated in our earlier decision which overturned the Agency's attempt to dismiss this complaint as untimely, Complainant has a single claim of sexual harassment involving CW. All evidence relevant to that claim, including the 2002 incident which, according to Complainant, precipitated the entire matter, needs to be considered. As such, we find that the AJ erred in dismissing the event from 2002.</p>
<p class="noindent">Further complicating the timeliness analysis in hostile environment cases is the fact that there must be a basis for imputing liability to the agency. In most cases, liability attaches only where the agency is aware, or should have been aware, of the harassment and failed to take prompt and effective corrective action. See <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a>. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120150029 (2015), the Commission found that counselor contact was timely where the last incident of alleged harassment occurred in January 2014, but the complainant did not contact a counselor until late July. The Commission found that the complainant had advised management of her allegations and it was not until July that she learned management would take no action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has reasoned that the last incident of alleged sexual harassment occurred in January 2014, but Complainant did not initiate contact with an EEO counselor until July 29. 2014, beyond the 45-day limitation period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in order to prevail in a sexual harassment claim, there must be a basis for imputing liability to the employer. In a case such as this, the Agency will be held responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace where management knew or should have known of the conduct, unless it can be shown that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). An agency can raise an affirmative defense when it shows that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. What is appropriate remedial action will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case, such as the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that Complainant was not informed that management would not be addressing her concerns about the alleged harassment until it issued the July 9, 2014 letter, and she contacted an EEO counselor less than three weeks later. Thus, under the facts of this case, we find that Complainant did not reasonably suspect that she could charge the Agency with liability for the alleged sexual harassment until management refused to act on her report of the perpetrator's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, the Commission's treatment of hostile environment cases was both confused and confusing, at best. In part, the confusion was generated by the Commission's treatment of hostile environment claims as continuing or recurring violations, rather than a single claim of an unlawful employment practice. For example, in a case where the employee alleged that a discriminatory environment existed, the Commission held that it was no defense that the employee could have filed a complaint earlier. In <span class="Italic">Thurston v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01934312 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Thurston</span>, the agency dismissed a complaint over a display of offensive pictures on the basis that the pictures had been on display for over two years prior to the complaint. The agency reasoned that the complainant had ample time to contact an EEO counselor prior to her initial contact. The Commission rejected that argument, noting that the complainant had previously objected to the pictures, but they still were on display on the date counseling was initiated. The Commission held the "picture display was a recurring violation which occurred each and every day until its removal." Because the pictures were on display as of the time the complainant initiated counseling, that was well within the 45-day period and the complaint was timely. This, however, is different from saying that the display of the pictures over a two-year period constituted a hostile environment. The difference is that under the hostile environment theory, the oriGINAl posting of the pictures would be actionable. However, under the <span class="Italic">Thurston</span> rationale, the conduct of the agency before the 45-day time period was not actionable because the Commission treated it as a recurring violation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Querney v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01951242 (1996), the Commission emphasized that a distinction must be made between hostile environment claims and claims involving distinct acts, but still mistakenly utilized a continuing violation theory:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts have held that in determining whether a claim for continuing violation is stated, it is important to consider whether appellant had prior knowledge or suspicion of discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Sabree v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Local No. 33</span>, 921 F. 2d 396 (1st Cir. 1990). Moreover, it is necessary to distinguish between an appellant who believed he had been subject to discrimination, and therefore had the obligation to file promptly or lose his claim, versus a plaintiff who is unable to appreciate that he is being discriminated against until he has lived through a series of acts and is thereby able to perceive the overall discriminatory pattern<span class="Italic">. Hagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920709 (January 7, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the agency considered the question of whether allegation (17) constituted a continuing violation and determined that appellant had failed to establish the existence of a continuing violation. We disagree. A review of appellant's formal complaint shows that he alleged numerous incidents which allegedly occurred in 1993 and 1994. A review of the incident described by appellant in allegation (17) as well as the remaining allegations in his complaint, shows that he basically alleged that he had been the victim of harassment and had been subject to a hostile working environment. Based on the foregoing, we find that the incident claimed in allegation (17) is part of a continuing violation and as such, was improperly dismissed by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01953183 (1996), the Commission so muddled the distinctions between continuing violations and allegations that harassment created a hostile environment that any meaningful analysis of the Commission's position on the subjects was nearly impossible. In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Commission regarded acts, including details and performance evaluations, that it almost always views as distinct personnel acts, as part of a pattern of harassment under a continuing violation theory. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Smith, explained</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In viewing appellant's allegations as one complaint of harassment, we find that allegations (1) through (8) state the incidents of harassment arising out of appellant's employment and these allegations should be included in the further processing of appellant's complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Untimely EEO Counselor Contact</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) requires that an aggrieved person must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that the time requirements for initiating EEO counseling could be waived as to certain allegations within a complaint when the complainant alleged a continuing violation; that is, a series of related discriminatory acts, one of which fell within the time period for contacting an EEO Counselor<span class="Italic">. See McGivern v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC <span id="Page_89"></span>Request No. 05901150 (December 28, 1990); <span class="Italic">Starr v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01890412 (April 6, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A determination of whether a series of discrete acts constitutes a continuing violation depends on the interrelatedness of the past and present acts<span class="Italic">. Berry v. Board of Supervisors</span>, 715 F.2d 971, 981 (5th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 868 (1986). It is necessary to determine whether the acts are interrelated by a common nexus or theme<span class="Italic">. See Vissing v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890308 (June 13, 1989); <span class="Italic">Verkennes v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900700 (September 21, 1990); <span class="Italic">Maldonado v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900937 (October 31, 1990). Should such a nexus exist, appellant will have established a continuing violation and the agency would be obligated to "overlook the untimeliness of the complaint with respect to some of the acts" challenged by appellant<span class="Italic">. Scott v. Claytor</span>, 469 F. Supp. 22, 26 (D.D.C. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that where, as here, there is an issue of timeliness, "[a]agency always bears the burden of obtaining sufficient information to support a reasoned determination as to timeliness." <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920506 (August 25, 1992). Moreover, where, as here, a complainant alleges recurring incidents of discrimination, "an agency is obligated to initiate an inquiry into whether any allegations untimely raised fall within the ambit of the continuing violation theory." <span class="Italic">Guy v. Department of Energy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930703 (December 16, 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Williams</span>). As the Commission further held in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, where an agency's final decision fails to address the issue of continuing violation, the complaint "must be remanded for consideration of this question and issuance of a new final agency decision making a specific determination under the continuing violation theory."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency failed to consider the question of a continuing violation in its final decision, we find that it is unnecessary to remand the allegations for consideration of this issue, given the unique nature of the subject complaint, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, recurring incidents of harassment. A review of the complaint reflects that appellant based his complaint on a series of events and actions directly and indirectly related to harassment which purportedly created a hostile work environment from 1991 to 1994. Since appellant's EEO Counselor contact regarding allegation (9), which was accepted by the agency for further processing, was timely, we find that the agency is obligated "to overlook the untimeliness of the complaint with respect to some of the acts" challenged by appellant<span class="Italic">. See Scott v. Claytor</span>, 469 F. Supp. 22, 26 (D.D.C. 1978). Thus, we find that the agency's dismissal of allegations (1) through (8) was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cobb-Leonard v. Postmaster General</span>, 01955496 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">One unique problem in determining the timeliness of hostile environment cases involves the fact that a hostile environment, except in the most egregious circumstances, is cumulative in nature. A hostile environment does not become actionable until the harassing conduct is so severe or pervasive that it effects a term, condition or privilege of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993). The time at which harassment crosses the line from being merely annoying to being legally actionable cannot be determined with precision. Even if such a time could be pinpointed, there still remains the question of when it is reasonable to charge a layperson subjected to harassing conduct with knowledge that the conduct has risen to a legally actionable level.</p>
<p class="noindent">A good example of how the continuing violation muddles the hostile environment analysis is provided by <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01932967 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, the employee charged that after she brought the alleged sexual harassment to the attention of the agency by initiating EEO counseling, the agency retaliated against a potential witness to discourage him from testifying. The employee elected not to file a formal complaint after receiving her notice of final interview and subsequently filed a formal complaint two years later. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, found the complainant set forth a claim for a continuing violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) provides on its face and is construed as requiring, that an employee must contact an EEO Counselor within forty-five (45) days of the alleged discriminatory event or the effective date of the discriminatory action. Nonetheless, when a continuing violation is alleged, the normal time limit is suspended. If at least one of the acts complained of falls within the limitations period, a complaint filed at any time within this period is timely filed with respect to all acts which are part of the continuing violation<span class="Italic">. Clark v. Olinkraft, Inc.</span>, 556 F.2d 1219, 1221-22 (5th Cir. 1977), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 434 U.S. 1069 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A continuing violation may properly be defined as an ongoing series of related acts directed against an employee. In <span class="Italic">Tarvesian v. Carr Division of TRW, Inc.</span>, 407 F. Supp. 336, 339-340 (D. Mass. 1976), the court stressed that an essential ingredient of a continuing violation is an analogous theme uniting the alleged discriminatory acts of the employer into a continuous pattern. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Claytor</span>, 469 F. Supp. 22 (D.D.C. 1978), the court determined that an interrelatedness between the past and present acts complained of was essential to establish a continuing violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency contends that appellant has not presented a continuing violation because she failed to state a timely incident or act. However, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2) permits the Commission to extend the forty-five (45) day time limit to contact an EEO Counselor for reasons considered sufficient by the Commission. The Commission finds such reasons to be present in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is uncontested that appellant contacted an EEO Counselor in January 1993, and complained that she was subjected to harassment and retaliation on a continuing basis since January 1991. According to the EEO Counselor's report from January 1993, appellant complained of harassment and retaliation by a Special Agent from the Dallas Field Division. The dates of this alleged harassment are not contained in the record. Appellant also complained of retaliation taken by the DADLE against her fiance, and specifically stated that this retaliation stemmed from the fact that her fiance was a witness to the retaliatory "interrogation" that she endured in April 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that in July 1992, the agency began an IA investigation into appellant's fiance. During that same month, appellant filed a complaint with the IA Office, but the record reflects that it was never processed. Appellant then contacted the IG's Office to report that the investigation of her fiance was initiated in an attempt to silence him. The evidence establishes that the IG's Office informed appellant that they would "look into" the matter. It appears that an investigation was begun; however, in January 1993, the IG's Office referred the matter to the OSC and to this Commission. The agency never informed appellant that she should contact an EEO Counselor. In fact, appellant had to obtain outside counsel to receive this essential advice. Given that: (1) appellant timely contacted the IA's Office and then contacted the IG's Office when no action was taken by the IA's Office; (2) it was not improper or unreasonable for appellant to contact the IG's Office to report the retaliation; and (3) appellant was never clearly informed that she was required to contact an EEO Counselor after the IG's Office decided to discontinue its investigation, the Commission deems appellant's contact with the EEO Counselor in January 1993 to be timely with respect to the July 1992 allegation of retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that this allegation fails to state a claim because appellant has not shown that she was the aggrieved party. The Commission disagrees. While it is true that appellant's fiance has suffered harm from the investigation, a close reading of appellant's allegation also sets forth harm personal to appellant. Appellant states that the DADLE ordered a biased investigation against appellant's fiance in an effort to deter him from testifying as a witness in her case. She claims that the action taken against her fiance could have a chilling effect on the processing of her case. She argues that it is possible that the DADLE, given his position of authority within the agency, will take such action against all of appellant's potential witnesses. Thus, we disagree with the agency that this allegation fails to state a claim<span class="Italic">. See Watlington v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920080 (March 6, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that appellant has presented a timely allegation to the EEO Counselor we must now determine whether or not the requisite interrelatedness exists between the timely allegation and the prior allegations of harassment and retaliation made by appellant. Relevant to this determination is whether the acts involve the same type of discrimination; whether they recurred, or were more isolated incidents; and whether the same persons were involved<span class="Italic">. See Scott v. Claytor, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the record that an analogous theme, harassment and retaliation, is evident in this case. Specifically, appellant has alleged that she was sexually harassed, and since reporting this harassment, she has been retaliated against by several coworkers and management officials. Appellant has also clearly alleged that the harassment and retaliation has recurred on numerous occasions, and that the same persons were involved. She stated that the sexual harassment began in January 1990 and continued until January 1991. From this point on appellant argued that she was retaliated against. Specifically, in January 1991 by her supervisor, in April and June 1991 by the DADLE, and finally in July 1992, once again by the DADLE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents a unique set of circumstances, inasmuch as it contains allegations and evidence that the agency breached appellant's confidentiality and maintained an inadequate system of processing sexual harassment and related claims. The Commission finds that under the unique circumstances presented in this case, appellant was understandably hesitant to pursue her complaint through the agency's EEO process. As noted in the Senate testimony provided by GAO, employee concerns about confidentiality, objectivity, and independence were evident. Moreover, GAO determined that the roles that BATF's internal offices played in addressing sexual harassment and related claims were not fully developed, implemented, or communicated to employees. Although GAO acknowledged that EEOC policies provide that employees should have the right to complain of harassment with the security of confidentiality and without fear of reprisal, a number of complaints about a perceived lack of objectivity were received.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_90"></span>It is the mission of the Commission to ensure that discrimination is eliminated from the workplace. As part of this mission, the Commission must ensure that complaints of discrimination are properly processed within the agencies. We find that under the facts of this case, the agency failed to respond appropriately to appellant's allegations, and thus further processing is warranted. In this regard, the Commission also finds that the agency improperly determined that appellant abandoned her complaint of sexual harassment in February of 1991 when she did not file a formal complaint. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Snyder v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05901061 (November 1, 1990). Given appellant's perception that the EEO process was tainted and biased, in large part due to the DADLE's role in the process, and given that appellant attempted to diligently pursue her complaint in other avenues amidst the confusion, we find that the agency improperly rejected appellant's complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission resolved its dilemma in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> by relying on the continuing violation line of cases and focusing on the fact that the acts of harassment and retaliation were interrelated. The problem with applying the continuing violation theory in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> is that the complainant clearly knew of the discrimination at least two years before filing the complaint. As a result, the continuing violation theory, at least as expressed by the Commission at the time of the decision in that case, did not provide a basis for tolling the time limit for filing a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent"> In <span class="Italic">Galloway v. General Motors Serv. Parts Oper.</span>, 78 F.3d 1164 (7th Cir. 1996), the court analyzed how the theory of hostile environment discrimination--a substantive doctrine--and the theory of a continuing violation--a timeliness doctrine--come into conflict and suggested a resolution. Although the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 122 S. Ct., at 2074, n.11, rejected the approach of the <span class="Italic">Galloway</span> court, the case is still instructive on the nature of the problems confronting the employer, the employee and the adjudicator in hostile environment harassment cases. In <span class="Italic">Galloway</span>, the plaintiff alleged that, following the end of a consensual relationship with a coworker, she was subjected to crude remarks from the coworker for the next few years. The district court held that any acts of alleged harassment more than 300 days prior (the applicable statute of limitations) to her complaint were time-barred. On appeal, the EEOC filed an <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> brief urging that the court treat the case as a continuing violation. Indeed, during oral argument, as noted above, the EEOC took the position that a complainant could allow a hostile environment to exist for 20 years and then file a complaint that could hold the employer liable for all of the conduct. The Seventh Circuit ultimately upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment to the employer because it found the comments were not gender-based. Nonetheless the court's discussion of the timeliness question in <span class="Italic">Galloway</span>, 78 F.3d at 1165-67, is worth considering:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC's brief takes aim at the judge's ruling with respect to the statute of limitations, arguing that in the case of a continuing violation, conduct outside the statute of limitations but related in some way to conduct within it is nevertheless actionable. The question when conduct occurring outside the statute of limitations may, by virtue of its link with recent conduct, be made a basis for a legal claim is a vexing one, and not only in cases of sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman</span>, 455 U.S. 363, 380-81, 102 S. Ct. 1114, 1125-26, 71 L. Ed.2d 214 (1982); <span class="Italic">United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans</span>, 431 U.S. 553, 558-59, 97 S.

<p class="noindent-1">We begin by reminding that the Supreme Court has told us not to interpret statutes of limitations in a grudging, hostile fashion. <span class="Italic">E.g., Board of Regents v. Tomanio</span>, 446 U.S. 478, 487-88, 100 S. Ct. 1790, 1796-97, 64 L. Ed.2d 440 (1980);<span class="Italic"> United States v. Kubrick</span>, 444 U.S. 111, 117, 100 S. Ct. 352, 356-57, 62 L. Ed.2d 259 (1979). They serve the important purpose of encouraging the prompt filing of claims and by doing so of enhancing the likelihood of accurate determinations and removing debilitating uncertainty about legal liabilities<span class="Italic">. Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.</span>, 920 F.2d 446, 452-53 (7th Cir. 1990). At argument the EEOC's lawyer told us that if Bullock's campaign of harassment against the plaintiff had begun twenty years ago, the plaintiff would be entitled to seek redress for acts that had occurred that long ago, notwithstanding the difficulty that a trier of fact would encounter in trying to make accurate, credible factual determinations concerning events that had occurred so far in the past<span class="Italic">. Krist v. Eli Lilly &#x0026; Co.</span>, 897 F.2d 293 (7th Cir. 1990). We do not think that the Commission's position can be right. It gives too little weight to the social interest in the prompt filing especially of suits charging employment discrimination. The statute of limitations for filing a Title VII charge with the EEOC (a prerequisite to suit) is 300 days at the outside, and in some states only 180 days. These periods are shorter than the usual statute of limitations and doctrines that would elongate the limitations period by as many as forty times (20 years / 180 days = 40) are suspect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What is true is that standard principles of limitations law, notably the discovery doctrine and the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling, excuse the claimant from having to file before it is feasible for him to do so, and these principles apply to cases brought under Title VII. The Supreme Court so held in <span class="Italic">Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 1132-33, 71 L. Ed.2d 234 (1982), and while some decisions seem not to heed this holding, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Chapman v. Homco, Inc.</span>, 886 F.2d 756, 758 (5th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>); <span class="Italic">Merrill v. Southern Methodist University</span>, 806 F.2d 600, 605 (5th Cir. 1986), ours do. <span class="Italic">White v. Bentsen</span>, 31 F.3d 474, 475 (7th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Selan v. Kiley, supra</span>, 969 F.2d at 564; <span class="Italic">Artis v. Hitachi Zosen Clearing, Inc.</span>, 967 F.2d 1132, 1143-44 (7th Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Daley</span>, 929 F.2d 346, 349 (7th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., supra</span>, 920 F.2d at 452-53<span class="Italic">. See also Hamilton v. 1st Source Bank</span>, 895 F.2d 159, 163-64 (4th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have not recognized an exception to these ameliorative doctrines for sexual harassment<span class="Italic">. Doe v. R.R. Donnelley &#x0026; Sons Co.</span>, 42 F.3d 439, 446 (7th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">cf. Jones v. Merchants National Bank &#x0026; Trust Co.</span>, 42 F.3d 1054, 1058 (7th Cir. 1994). Sexual harassment serious enough to constitute unlawful discrimination on grounds of sex is often a cumulative process rather than a one-time event. In its early stages it may not be diagnosable as sex discrimination, or may not cross the threshold that separates the nonactionable from the actionable, <span class="Italic">Baskerville v. Culligan International Co.</span>, 50 F.3d 428, 431 (7th Cir. 1995), or may not cause sufficient distress to be worth making a federal case out of, or may not have gone on long enough to charge the employer with knowledge and a negligent failure to take effective remedial measures. (And such knowledge and such failure normally are prerequisites to the employer's being made liable for the harassment<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 431; <span class="Italic">Carr v. Allison Gas Turbine Division</span>, 32 F.3d 1007, 1012 (7th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Saxton v. American Tel. &#x0026; Tel. Co., supra</span>, 10 F.3d at 535; <span class="Italic">Guess v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.</span>, 913 F.2d 463, 465 (7th Cir. 1990).) We do not want to encourage premature or precipitate litigation. If the victim of sexual harassment sues as soon as the harassment becomes sufficiently palpable that a reasonable person would realize she had a substantial claim under Title VII, then she sues in time and can allege as unlawful conduct the entire course of conduct that in its cumulative effect has made her working conditions unbearable. We emphasize the bearing on this principle of the safe harbor that we created in <span class="Italic">Baskerville</span> for employers accused of failing to prevent low-level harassment. The effect of that decision is that victims of harassment will often be required to wait and see whether the harassment persists or escalates to a level at which the ship leaves the harbor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The concept of cumulation suggests a critical limiting principle. Acts of sexual harassment so discrete in time or circumstances that they do not reinforce each other cannot reasonably be linked together into a single chain, a single course of conduct, to defeat the statute of limitations<span class="Italic">. Koelsch v. Beltone Electronics Corp.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 46 F.3d at 707. If in Year 1 an employee is obnoxiously solicited for sexual favors by Coworker X and in Year 20 she is subjected to repulsive sexual innuendoes by Coworker Y she cannot base a claim of sexual harassment on X's act, for no reasonable person in the victim's position would suppose that she could not have recognized that she was a victim of sexual harassment in Year 1 until Y's act in Year 20 or that it is only the addition of Y's act to X's act that puts her across the threshold that separates the merely vulgar, sporadic, and annoying and therefore not actionable from the seriously harassing (perhaps through dint of repetition) and therefore actionable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The most difficult case arises when a long-continued series of harassing acts definitely are a series, a pattern, and not merely a set of discrete events, yet it was evident long before the plaintiff finally sued that she was the victim of actionable harassment. It seems to us that in such a case, while she can still sue provided that the last act of harassment occurred within the statute of limitations, she cannot reach back and base her suit also on conduct that occurred outside the statute of limitations; for she had no excuse for waiting that long<span class="Italic">. Doe v. R.R. Donnelley &#x0026; Sons Co.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 42 F.3d at 446; <span class="Italic">Selan v. Kiley, supra</span>, 969 F.2d at 565-66. An additional consideration is that the bringing of the suit is almost certain to stop the harassment, so that unlike certain cases of nuisance the plaintiff will not be put to the expense of bringing successive suits. What is more, she can always seek injunctive relief against a continuation of the unlawful conduct<span class="Italic">. Dombeck v. Milwaukee Valve Co.</span>, 40 F.3d 230, 238 (7th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Townsend v. Indiana University</span>, 995 F.2d 691, 692-93 (7th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 641 F.2d 934, 946 (D.C. Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The principle that we extract from this discussion and that we think organizes the complex and diffuse case law on continuing violations under Title VII is that the plaintiff may not base her (in some cases his) suit on conduct that occurred outside the statute of limitations unless it would have been unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to sue before the statute ran on that conduct, as in a case in which the conduct could constitute, or be recognized, as actionable harassment only in the light of events that occurred later, within the period of the statute of limitations. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. R.R. Donnelley &#x0026; Sons Co., supra</span>, 42 F.3d at 446; <span class="Italic">Selan v. Kiley, supra</span>, 969 F.2d at 565-66; <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Daley, supra</span>, 929 F.2d at 349; <span class="Italic">Martin <span id="Page_91"></span>v. Nannie &#x0026; Newborns, Inc.</span>, 3 F.3d 1410, 1415 n.6 (10th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Sabree v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters</span>, 921 F.2d 396, 402 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The repeated "sick bitch" comment seems to us just the kind of verbal conduct that it would not be reasonable to expect an employee to base suit on the first time it occurred. It is obvious that a single, isolated such comment could not reasonably be thought to constitute sexual harassment or to cause a harm sufficiently great to repay the expense of suit. But if the comment were repeated daily over a period of years its cumulative effect would be much greater, though whether it would constitute actionable sexual harassment would still be in doubt, as we shall shortly see.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">So we find ourselves in respectful disagreement with the district judge's decision to cut off of the evidence in 1991--and also with the suggestion that the plaintiff's use of dirty language shows that she was not harmed by her coworker's use of such language....</p>
<p class="noindent">Certainly, the approach of the Seventh Circuit was far more balanced than that of the EEOC. It attempted to strike the balance fairly between protecting the interests of an employee subjected to illegal harassment and the legitimate interest of an employer in not being sued for wrongs long past.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rush v. Scott Specialty Gases</span>, 113 F.3d 476 (3d Cir. 1997), the court cited <span class="Italic">Galloway</span> with approval. The court found credible the plaintiff's explanation that the harassment intensified over time and that she did not realize until later the effects of the earlier incidents of harassment. The <span class="Italic">Rush</span> court, 113 F.3d at 482-83, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Scott argues that Rush should have filed her sexual harassment claim earlier than November 1, 1993, and that she therefore should not have been permitted to sue on or present evidence of sexual harassment occurring prior to the start of the 300-day limitations period. Rush responds that she was not aware in 1991 when she filed her initial EEOC complaint that she had been subjected to sexual harassment, and she also contends that the harassment she experienced constituted a continuing violation so that all of the harassment, even that occurring before January 5, 1993, was actionable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we explained in <span class="Italic">West</span>, there is "a natural affinity" between the theory underlying hostile environment claims and the continuing violation theory<span class="Italic">. West</span>, 45 F.3d at 755. A sexually hostile work environment often "results from acts of sexual...harassment which are pervasive and continue over time, whereas isolated or single incidents of harassment are insufficient to constitute a hostile environment."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Galloway v. General Motors Serv. Parts Operations</span>, 78 F.3d 1164, 1166 (7th Cir. 1996). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <span class="Italic">Galloway</span> expressed its desire to encourage plaintiffs to commence litigation when they become aware of conduct that would support a viable claim without forcing them to do so prematurely<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1166. Thus, the court concluded that a plaintiff "may not base her...suit on conduct that occurred outside the statute of limitations unless it would have been unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to sue before the statute ran on that conduct, as in a case in which the conduct could constitute, or be recognized, as actionable harassment only in the light of events that occurred later, within the period of the statute of limitations."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1167 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rush testified that when she filed her oriGINAl EEOC complaint in 1991 she did not include claims for sexual harassment because "it was not really as frequently [sic], it later intensified but at that time it was a lot less frequent. I'm not sure I recognized it at that time. And, whereas the discrimination was more obvious to me. I also felt that at that time I was friendly with Rene, which he was the biggest problem and maybe I was not clear enough, maybe I didn't turn around and yell at him, I didn't I figured it wouldn't be fair...to complain."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">App. at 376-77.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rush testified that at the beginning of her employment, Rene Bedoya, her co-worker and primary harasser, treated her nicely, and, although perhaps overly attentive, his behavior was not problematic. App. at 412-13. On redirect examination, Rush read into the record part of her diary where she noted that the harassment began after she filed the EEOC charge. App. at 661.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rush also testified that she was harassed by male coworkers on a daily basis. App. at 402. This harassment included disparaging remarks and criticism of her work. App. at 403-04. Rush testified that Bedoya's behavior changed and that he began to touch her inappropriately and sexually at work, to make sexual comments to her, and to be rude to her. App. at 416-19, 421. Rush also testified that her co-worker Tom Richards made inappropriate comments to her and about her. She stated that she partly overheard, and another co-worker told her, that Richards had said he "wanted to fuck [Rush] in his van, and then shoot [Rush] in the head so that no one would ever know." App. at 421-22.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court correctly concluded that Rush's sexual harassment claim constituted a continuing violation. She properly was permitted to sue on this continuing violation and to present evidence of incidents occurring prior to the limitations period. First, the 300-day period began to run on January 5, 1993, and it is clear that there were episodes of alleged harassment after that point, including the meeting that occurred on her last day of employment, as well as the continual comments by Bedoya and Rush's other co-workers. Second, the evidence supports a finding that Rush suffered continuous sexual harassment, at least from the time she filed the oriGINAl EEOC charge. The harassment did not consist of unrelated, isolated incidents, but constituted a continuous pattern of derogatory remarks, rude behavior, and discriminatory conduct. Her failure to claim harassment in the 1991 EEOC charge does not destroy her claim, because the evidence shows that the harassment intensified after the charge was filed, and, moreover, she did not realize early on how pervasive or severe the harassment was.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Slate v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954937 (1996), the Commission, in reviewing a claim that an employee was subject to ongoing retaliation for testifying against a supervisor in a sexual harassment case, used an analysis like that of the Seventh Circuit. The Commission noted that the complainant reasonably may not have been aware that the environment was hostile until she had "lived through a series of acts and [was] thereby able to perceive the overall discriminatory pattern." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01986072 (1999). But, in <span class="Italic">Sztukowski v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01960956 (1997), the Commission applied the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> rule in a case alleging hostile environment harassment and declared several allegations untimely. It was clear from the evidence in <span class="Italic">Szutkowski</span> that the complainant had suspected sex was the motivating factor in the harassment for at least six months before contacting a counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Blackburn v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01966350 (1997), the Commission specifically passed up a chance to shed any light on whether there is some standard for determining that a sexual harassment claimant should have complained earlier and was therefore barred from bringing a hostile environment claim. In <span class="Italic">Blackburn</span>, the complainant charged that he had been subject to harassment by his supervisor including advances and fondling for a period of five years. The agency specifically raised the argument that the complainant should have been aware that the conduct created a hostile environment long before filing his complaint. In holding the complaint was timely under a continuing violation theory, the Commission failed to address the agency's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Yaccarino v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05735 (2001), the Commission analyzed a hostile environment claim as a continuing violation claim without any reference to the reasonable suspicion standard. In light of its subsequent decision in <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, the Commission's position appeared to be that hostile environment claims should be treated as continuing violation claims without regard to the reasonable suspicion standard. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Pettit v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996500 (2001) (dismissing a claim as untimely because the complainant had previously filed a sexual harassment complaint and knew of the time limits).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A21606 (2002), the Commission held that reporting hostile environment harassment through internal agency reporting procedures does not toll the time limit for counselor contact. Although the facts of the case as set forth in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> are sketchy, it appears that there were no further acts of alleged harassment after the complainant reported it to an agency official designated in the agency's procedures for reporting sexual harassment. As a result, the contact with the counselor was untimely because it was more than 45 days after the one incident of reported harassment.</p>
