<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-61"><span class="space">5.</span> Nonselection</h4>
<p class="noindent">Merely asserting that the "best qualified candidate" was chosen for a position without articulating why that candidate was best qualified does not sustain the agency's burden. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Yee v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120061381 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission is cognizant that the agency's burden to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions is not an onerous one. Nevertheless, the Commission finds that the agency has failed to set forth, with sufficient clarity, reasons for complainant's nonselection such that she has been given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that those reasons are pretext. <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 258 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Parker v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900110 (April 30, 1990): <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950931 (November 6, 1997). We find that in the instant case, the SO merely stated that she selected the best qualified candidates who could be trained. However, the record contains no further clarification as to what specific qualities made those individuals better qualified or more trainable than complainant. We note that while an agency can choose the selectee it wishes from any properly constituted certificate, it must clearly set forth its reasons in order to afford complainant the opportunity to demonstrate that its articulated reasons for choosing that selectee was a pretext for discrimination. We find that in this case, the agency failed to do so. Therefore, we find the lack of specificity as to why the SO chose selectee 1 or selectee 2 makes it impossible for complainant to prove the reasons for not selecting her were a pretext for discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission found pretext where the agency's sole assertion for using a preemployment test was that it had produced "good results" in the past in <span class="Italic">Marine V., et al., v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720170001 (2017):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency used the ACWA exam as way to screen out internal employees and recruit external hires for CR positions. In so finding, we note that the record shows that the ACWA exam was specifically designed for the recruitment of external hires and was never intended for employees who already worked for the Agency. The record reflects that the ACWA exam contained questions geared towards recent college graduates, and it was generally known that the test was easier for college students, who received study guides at their schools particularly related to the exam. Hr'g Trans., at 135. This finding is supported by the fact that the testing sites for the ACWA exam were primarily held at outside external Agency locations, including Rutgers University in New Jersey. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 230. In addition, the ACWA exam did not take into account any specific experience or performance with the Agency, and the ACWA exam score was the sole method by which the Agency hired. We note that the Agency does not rebut Complainants' statements that the ACWA exam was not meant for current Agency employees and that no internal candidates were hired for the CR vacancies at issue. ROI, 1, Ex. 6, at 11-12; ROI 2, Ex. 11, at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Agency argues that, although external candidates were favored, being an Agency employee versus a non-Agency employee is not a protected basis under Commission regulations. We find, however, that the Agency was clearly aware, and it was reasonable to think, that Agency internal employees with years of experience generally were older than newly-hired external employees. In so finding, we note that almost of all the selectees were in their 20s and 30s, while all Complainants were at age 40 or above. ROI 1 at 25-26 ROI 2, at 15-17. Further, testimony reflects that the Agency chose the ACWA exam as the sole criterion for hiring in order to recruit and hire a younger workforce. Specifically, we note that the Supervisory Human Resources (HR) Specialist testified that management decided to use the ACWA exam because management found that it produced selectees who were "bright," "eager," and "energetic." Hr'g Trans., at 252. The Supervisory HR Specialist also testified that "external recruitment brings in new blood, new people coming into the Agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 210. Although these comments and words do not directly address age, under the circumstances presented herein, they appear to be code words that strongly imply derogatory age-based stereotyping in favor of hiring younger external employees over older internal employees for selection. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120052546 (Dec. 6, 2006) (management's language that experienced employees had no desire to "grow," "improve" and "advance" were code words that imply age bias and stereotyping).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as the AJ noted, the Supervisory HR Specialist further testified that, after all the hiring for the CR positions was complete, there were still some vacant CR positions available later that fiscal year. Hr'g Trans, at 254. However, instead of using the ACWA exam to fill the positions, the Agency used the FCIP to non-competitively hire from local colleges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While not dispositive, this fact nonetheless supports a finding that the Agency was motivated by discriminatory animus based on age when it screened out Complainants for the CR positions by using the ACWA exam. Further, the record reflects that the Agency had other avenues available to it beside the ACWA exam by which to select internal employees, including the ACWA questionnaire rather than the exam. As the Supervisory HR Specialist testified, the ACWA questionnaire took into account work experience while the ACWA exam did not. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255. Complainants averred that the Agency stopped using the ACWA questionnaire in 2009 because too many internal candidates were receiving positions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 74.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency's explanations are dubious, especially given that the Agency never took into account Complainants' experience and work history with the Agency in making its selections. In addition, the record reflects that the Agency also had stopped using the CREDO process, which it previously had used to promote internal candidates to CR positions. ROI 2, Ex. 8, at 5. Based on the totality of circumstances, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's determination that the Agency's explanation for Complainants' nonselection was pretext for discrimination based on age.</p>
<p class="noindent">Vague assertions that an employee was unqualified for a particular position may be sufficient to sustain the agency's burden of articulating her nonselection for a position, but may be found pretextual when the employee presents specific evidence of her training and qualifications and the agency does nothing to further clarify how or why the employee was unqualified. In <span class="Italic">Float v. USPS</span>, 01841674 (1986), the agency asserted that special "internal problems" at a particular mail facility made her unqualified for the position in question. The agency made no effort to explain these "internal problems" or relate them to the appellant's qualifications. The employee demonstrated that the RMO previously had recommended her for any promotion at the grade level of the denied position, that she had been trained with the "internal problems" of the particular facility in mind, and that she had considerable experience and training in the field of mail handling. The Commission found this was sufficient evidence of pretext, in light of the agency's assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent"></p>
<p class="noindent">When arguing pretext, complainants sometimes maintain that discrimination is the only possible reason for the agency’s actions. Such arguments rarely win the day. That is what happened in Harry E. v. Secretary of Homeland Security, 2021004786 (2022)—a nonselection case: </p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission’s regulations allow an AJ to grant summary judgment when he or she finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). An issue of fact is “genuine” if the evidence is such that a reasonable fact finder could find in favor of the non-moving party. Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322–23 (1986); Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1988). A fact is “material” if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the case. In rendering this appellate decision, we must scrutinize the AJ’s legal and factual conclusions, and the Agency’s final order adopting them, de novo. See 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(a)(stating that a “decision on an appeal from an Agency’s final action shall be based on a de novo review…”); see also Equal Employment Opportunity <span id="Page_738"></span>Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110), at Chap. 9, &#x00A7; VI.B. (as revised, August 5, 2015) (providing that an administrative judge’s determination to issue a decision without a hearing, and the decision itself, will both be reviewed de novo).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to successfully oppose a decision by summary judgment, a complainant must identify, with specificity, facts in dispute either within the record or by producing further supporting evidence and must further establish that such facts are material under applicable law. Such a dispute would indicate that a hearing is necessary to produce evidence to support a finding that the agency was motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To warrant a hearing on his disparate treatment claim, Complainant must raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the three-part evidentiary scheme fashioned by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). His first step would generally be to establish a prima facie case by demonstrating that he was subjected to an adverse employment action under circumstances that would support an inference of discrimination. Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978). The prima facie inquiry may be dispensed in this case, however, since the selecting official (SO) articulated a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting Complainant. See U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 713–17 (1983). The SO averred that although Complainant had met the minimum qualifications under both vacancy announcements, his application package indicated that he did not possess the expert-level experience in performing audits and quality reviews of human capital programs that she was looking for. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">To move forward with a hearing, Complainant must also raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the SO’s explanation for not selecting Complainant is a pretext for discrimination. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000); St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993); Tex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981). Questions of pretext can be raised by showing such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the Agency’s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence. Opare-Addo v. U.S. Postal Serv., EEOC Appeal No. 0120060802 (Nov. 20, 2007), req. for reconsid. den’d EEOC Request No. 0520080211 (May 30, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In non-selection cases, Complainant could demonstrate pretext by showing that his qualifications for the position were plainly superior to those of the two selectees. Hung P. v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141721 (Dec. 3, 2015). We note that agencies have broad discretion to choose among equally qualified candidates as long as the selection is not based on unlawful considerations. Lashawna L. v. Evtl. Prot. Agency, EEOC Appeal No. 2019000124 (Mar. 8, 2019). They may select candidates with fewer years of experience if they believe that such candidates are best qualified to meet the needs of the organization. Barney G. v. Dep’t of Agric., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172111 (Nov. 29, 2018). They may even preselect a candidate as long as the preselection is not premised upon a prohibited basis. Michael R. v. Dep’t of Agric., EEOC Appeal No. 0120172112 (Nov. 29, 2018). The Commission cannot second-guess such personnel decisions unless there is evidence of a discriminatory motivation on the part of the officials responsible for making those decisions. Burdine, supra, 450 U.S. at 259.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter, the application is a self-assessment for which an applicant can receive a maximum score of 100. Although Complainant scored 93 and 98 on the self-assessments for the two vacancies, the SO, a Human Resources Supervisor and a Human Resources Specialist who were involved with the process all affirmed that Complainant’s application package did not support his self-assessment. We therefore find, as did the AJ, that Complainant has not shown that his qualifications were plainly superior to those of the selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other indicators of pretext include discriminatory statements or past personal treatment attributable to those responsible for the personnel action that led to the filing of the complaint, comparative or statistical data revealing differences in treatment across various protected-group lines, unequal application of Agency policy, deviations from standard procedures without explanation or justification, or inadequately explained inconsistencies in the evidentiary record. Mellissa F. v. U.S. Postal Serv., EEOC Appeal No. 0120141697 (Nov. 12, 2015). When asked by the EEO investigator to explain why his race, national origin, or age were factors in the SO’s decision not to select him for either vacancy, Complainant replied that he did not see any other reason for the SO’s decisions, that there were no Asian Americans in his work unit, and he was older than the two selectees. Complainant has presented neither affidavits, declarations, or unsworn statements from witness other than himself nor documents which contradict or undercut the SO’s explanation for not selecting him or which cast doubt upon the SO’s truthfulness as a witness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, we agree with the AJ that Complainant failed to establish the existence of an evidentiary dispute sufficient to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact. Even construing any inferences raised by the undisputed facts in favor of Complainant, a reasonable fact-finder could not find in Complainant’s favor. Therefore, upon careful review of the AJ’s decision and the evidence of record, as well as the parties’ arguments on appeal, we conclude that the AJ correctly determined that the preponderance of the evidence did not establish that Complainant was discriminated against by the Agency as alleged. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the Agency’s final order adopting the AJ’s decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McClendon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01880409 (1988), the Commission found that an RMO's determination that a complainant was medically unfit for duty was not worthy of credence where no medical examination was conducted. The RMO testified that his sole basis for making the determination was a statement by the complainant that working in present conditions made her sick.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency advances a sporadic past employment record as the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, the employee does not demonstrate pretext by showing there are <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reasons for his sporadic employment. In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921934 (1992), the employee focused his proof on showing that the two gaps in his past employment were due to a relocation of his wife's job and a return to Texas to manage some property he owned. The Commission found the employee's past employment record was a legitimate factor to consider in its hiring decision and noted that the employee had not made the selecting officials aware of the reasons for his absences from employment. In short, the Commission determined the employee had not shown the reasons advanced by the agency were either pretext for prohibited discrimination or otherwise unworthy of credence.</p>
<p class="noindent">An indicia of pretext is present where the supervisor questions the complainant's writing ability in a performance appraisal just prior to competition for a promotion, yet never questioned that ability on the three previous performance appraisals where the complainant received ratings of "highly successful." <span class="Italic">Daniels v. National Aeronautics and Space Administrator</span>, 01931352 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Cartwright v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01934668 (1994), modifying the requirements of a position to the advantage of the selected candidate can be a strong indicia of pretext, particularly where the other selection criteria are highly subjective:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant has established pretext with regard to his nonselection. The record reflects that in selecting the selectees, the SO apparently modified the stated position requirement of civilian or any military experience to require Army experience. In addition, the SO posited his subjective assessment of appellant's persona as "lethargic" and "laid back," despite the fact that he had previously signed two performance appraisals in which appellant was found to be an exceptional employee. With respect to promotions to managerial, professional, and specialized positions, the use of subjective criteria is generally acceptable, although subject to scrutiny<span class="Italic">. See Casillas v. U.S. Navy</span>, 735 F. 2d 338, 345 (9th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see also Page v. U.S. Industries</span>, 726 F.2d 1038, 1053 (5th Cir. 1984) (subjective criteria not discriminatory<span class="Italic"> per se</span>). In this case, considering the totality of the circumstances, the Commission is not persuaded that the SO acted legitimately in relying on a subjective assessment of appellant's behavior that was greatly at odds with previous assessments, and relying upon a modified experience requirement which operated to exclude appellant from selection while operating to include at least one non-Black person who was not otherwise demonstrably better-qualified than appellant. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the record establishes pretext, and appellant is entitled to the relief set out in the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Cates v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01942773 (1994) (altering selection criteria so the selectee could meet the minimum qualifications of a position was considered a strong indication of pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency asserts that specific past experience of the selectee that fulfilled a selection criterion was the reason for nonselection, a complainant can prevail not by attacking the actual qualifications of the selectee but the recency and relevancy of that experience to the current job. For example, in <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A20043 (2003), the Commission found the agency's use of private sector experience by the selectee, combined other factors, demonstrated pretext:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Judge found that the reasons articulated by the agency were pretexts for discrimination. First, the Administrative Judge determined that the agency manufactured the "private sector experience" qualification in order to mask discriminatory animus. In this regard, the Administrative Judge found that private sector experience did not appear on the position description, and that hearing testimony revealed a vast difference between the operations of a private sector bank, where selectee worked, and the operations of a federal government agency. The Administrative Judge further indicated that the selectee's private sector experience was too remote and minimal, gained in the first three years of his career (1981-84), to have been the real basis of the selection. Second, the Administrative Judge credited testimony from a former agency employee who testified that the agency had a practice of hiring <span id="Page_739"></span>males who were unknown to them, as opposed to incumbent females. Third, the Administrative Judge credited testimony that male managers made disparaging remarks about complainant and other senior women referring to them as "difficult to deal with."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Predictably, the agency disagrees with the credibility determinations which underlie these factual conclusions. However, the Administrative Judge's credibility determinations are entitled to deference due to the judge's first-hand observation of the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses at the hearing<span class="Italic">. Willis v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900589 (July 26, 1990); <span class="Italic">Esquer v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960096 (Sept. 6, 1996). The agency has not provided argument or evidence sufficient to challenge the Administrative Judge's credibility findings. On appeal, the agency places extreme emphasis on the selectee's qualifications and encourages us to <span class="Italic">compare</span> the selectee's qualifications with complainant's qualifications. We reject this approach because the Administrative Judge's finding of discrimination is predicated upon the rejection of the agency's articulated reasons and not solely on evidence of complainant's superior qualifications<span class="Italic">. Compare Deines v. Texas Protective Serv.</span>, 164 F. 3d 277, 280-81 (5th Cir. 1999) (where plaintiff's superior qualifications were the sole evidence of pretext, those qualifications must be so substantial as to "jump off the page and slap [you] in the face" before a factfinder can find pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the strength of complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the probative value of the evidence that the agency's explanation is false, the Administrative Judge concluded that complainant established sex discrimination by preponderant evidence<span class="Italic">. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod.</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc.,</span> 530 U.S. 133, 147 (2000) (the factfinder's disbelief of the of the reasons put forward by the employer may, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.) On appeal, we have not been presented with evidence or argument indicating that the Administrative Judge made an error of law or that his factual findings are against the substantial weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we reverse the agency's notice of final action and now turn to the issue of damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the inclusion of selection criteria not mentioned in the vacancy announcement can be an indication of pretext, "the fact that a certain factor used in the selection process is not listed in the vacancy announcement does not preclude its consideration in the selection process, provided it is applied uniformly to all the candidates without a prohibited discriminatory intent." <span class="Italic">Berg v. USPS</span>, 05930600 (1994); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Swopes v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01941107 (1994) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Berg</span>,;<span class="Italic"> also</span> <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05910048 (1991)).</p>
<p class="noindent">"Although the Commission, along with a number of courts, has recognized that subjective considerations such as 'motivation,' 'initiative,' and 'enthusiasm' can provide a convenient cover for discrimination, we also note that there is nothing innately unlawful about relying on such criteria." <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01941425 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Burrus v. United Tel. Co. of Kansas, Inc.</span>, 683 F.2d 339, 342 (10th Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 459 U.S. 1071 (1982)). Likewise, comments that selectees appear "poised," "articulate" and "confident" are not innately unlawful. <span class="Italic">Gruschow v. Secretary of Defense, DLA</span>, 01941519 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Fortune v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01955769 (1996), the Commission found that the selection procedure, which was highly subjective, was evidence of pretext for discrimination. In combination with evidence that the selecting official destroyed the documentation that would have given an explanation of the process, this was sufficient to support a finding of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In evaluating the issue of pretext, it is appropriate to consider the relative qualifications of other unsuccessful applicants, particularly when the other applicants share the same characteristics as the complainant. <span class="Italic">Rocha v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01934018 (1994). Such evidence can be a strong indicia of pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a vacancy announcement produces a sufficient number of qualified applicants, the selecting official's decision to readvertise the position can be evidence of pretext. Even though agency regulations permitted such action, the readvertisement, when considered with other evidence of discrimination, was sufficient to establish pretext. In <span class="Italic">Turner v. Postmaster General</span>, 01933875 (1994), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found the testimony of the witness credible in light of other evidence. A credibility determination of an administrative judge is entitled to deference due to the judge's first-hand knowledge through personal observation of the demeanor and conduct of the witness at the hearing. This deference, however, is not automatic, and if there is sufficient evidence which suggests that the credibility determination is erroneous, deference will not be given<span class="Italic">. Willis v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900282 (July 26, 1990). The AJ found it significant that the SO failed to make a selection even though he had three qualified candidates from the initial posting of the position and chose instead to re-post the position. Even though this action may have been consistent with agency policy and procedure, when taken in conjunction with other evidence, particularly the unrebutted allegations of racist and/or derogatory statements made by the SO, there is an indication of the establishment of pretext. The AJ also found that the SO's advising one of the selectees to apply for the position when the employee was not a procurement and supply employee as required by the vacancy announcement was an indication of pretext. A further indication of pretext found by the AJ was the fact that none of the review committee members could recall specifics about the interviews of the candidates or retained their notes about their observations after being advised that there had been an EEO complaint filed regarding the selection. Additionally, the AJ found that the qualifications of one of the successful candidates were questionable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, based on the evidence of record, including the evidence adduced at the hearing, that the agency's stated reason for its selection was pretextual. Accordingly, the Commission finds, as did the AJ, that the agency discriminated against appellant on the bases of race and sex. While there is evidence of age motivated discrimination, appellant failed to carry her burden of persuasion.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a selecting official indicates that he "considered" the agency's affirmative action plan in making a selection, the Commission must determine whether the plan is valid. In <span class="Italic">Dobson v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01933095 (1994), the Commission remanded the case for further investigation when a personnel specialist testified that the affirmative action plan was used to expand the oriGINAl pool of applicants and the selecting official testified that he used the plan as a "secondary" consideration in making his selection:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the selection decision in this case was made primarily based on the qualifications, there is testimony by the concurring official that when making his decision, he gave some consideration the agency's affirmative action outreach plan. In addition, a Personnel Management Specialist stated that the oriGINAl applicant pool was expanded slightly in order to include more qualified minorities. For these reasons, the affirmative action guidelines in effect at the time become relevant to the selection decision, as discussed in more detail, below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin with, when a federal agency considers its affirmative action goals in selecting a candidate for a job, the Commission must determine whether the plan was valid under the criteria developed by the United States Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Transportation Agency</span>, 480 U.S. 616 (1987)<span class="Italic">. See Bragdon v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890700 (April 25, 1990); <span class="Italic">Berteau v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01931781 (April 29, 1994); <span class="Italic">Flannery v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924655 (February 25, 1994); <span class="Italic">Price v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01901538 (October 12, 1990). The burden of proving the affirmative action plan invalid rests with the complainant<span class="Italic">. See Bragdon</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890700, at 13; <span class="Italic">Price</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01901538, at 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Transportation Agency</span>, the following criteria were set forth in order that an affirmative action plan not violate Title VII:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;the purpose of the [plan] must be to break down old patterns of segregation and hierarchy and open up employment opportunities for protected groups;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;the [plan] must not create an absolute bar to the advancement of nonminority employees, or otherwise trammel the interests of those employees; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;the [plan] must be temporary in the sense that it is designed to attain, not to maintain a balance among affected classes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">480 U.S. at 627-30<span class="Italic">. See also United States Steel Workers v. Weber</span>, 443 U.S. 193, 208-09 (1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the use of rigid selection quotas in affirmative action plans--providing for selections which ignore the experience or qualifications applicants possess--is prohibited<span class="Italic">. See Johnson v. Transportation Agency</span>, 480 U.S. at 635; <span class="Italic">Bragdon</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890700 at 13; <span class="Italic">Beckett v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880086 (July 25, 1988); <span class="Italic">Price</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01901538 at 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, however, the record does not contain a copy of the agency's affirmative action plan for the time period at issue, as referred to by the concurring official. Nor does the concurring official's testimony specify precisely how he considered, analyzed, and applied the affirmative action plan as a "secondary or tertiary consideration" in approving the selection decision here. Without more, then, we cannot make the proper determination under <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Transportation Agency</span>, and, as we have done previously, must remand appellant's complaint for an appropriate supplemental investigation<span class="Italic">. See Berteau</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01931781; <span class="Italic">Flannery</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01924655. We will thus remand this matter for a supplemental investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to properly document the selection process, when combined with disparaging comments about females, in general, and the complainant, in particular, can be sufficient to sustain a finding of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01956351 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general matter, the performance of the selectee in the position subsequent to selection is not considered relevant evidence of pretext. To the extent that it is relevant, it cannot, standing alone, establish pretext. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Navas v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A02224 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_740"></span>Evidence that the selecting official appointed the selectee or failed to select the complainant based, at least in part, on a mistake of fact may not be enough to establish pretext. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Cythia Q. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120141321 (2016), applied, but was not selected, for two positions. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Cythia O</span>., affirmed the agency's FAD:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To ultimately prevail, Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation is a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc</span>., 530 U.S. 133 (2000); <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993); <span class="Italic">Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981); <span class="Italic">Holley, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Pavelka v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950351 (Dec. 14, 1995). In a selection case, a complainant can attempt to prove pretext by showing that her qualifications are "plainly superior" to those of the selectee. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950156. A mistake made by the agency is not evidence of pretext unless there is evidence that the mistake was based on a complainant's protected classes. <span class="Italic">See Vickey S. v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112893 (Nov. 17, 2015); <span class="Italic">Hsieh v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120980 (June 4, 2012); <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A20985 (Jan. 21, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to position 1, Complainant has not established that the Agency's explanation, which was that S1 was more qualified than she was, was pretext. Although Complainant asserts that S1 was ineligible for position 1, the record does not support this assertion. Furthermore, Complainant has not established that she was plainly more qualified than S1 for position 1. Although Complainant has 25 years of experience as a Contract Administrator, SO1 determined that S1 was more qualified than Complainant because of her experience performing cost/price analysis and other tasks directly related to the position and because of her educational background. Although SO1 was mistaken that S1 had already completed a Master's Degree, S1 still had more education than Complainant because she had completed a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting, while Complainant had completed an Associate's Degree. Furthermore, there is no evidence that SO1 made this mistake because of Complainant's race, age, or prior protected activity. Therefore, the evidence in the record does not establish that the Agency's stated reason was pretext for unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also has not established that the Agency's explanation as to why she was not selected for position 2, which was that SO1 believed that Complainant was ineligible to be hired for the EHA position, was pretext for unlawful discrimination. SO1's testimony that she believed that Complainant was ineligible to be hired into an EHA position was corroborated by another employee's testimony (El) that, in or around January 2013, SO1 consulted him about EHA eligibility and that he told SO1 that employees who held Agency acquisition positions prior to January 28, 2008, were not eligible to be hired into EHA positions Complainant has held her Contract Administrator position for 25 years, so, based on E1's erroneous explanation, SO1 reasonably concluded that Complainant held an acquisition position with the Agency prior to January 28, 2008, and was therefore ineligible for position 2. Although SO1's interpretation of EHA eligibility was ultimately incorrect, Complainant offers no evidence to show that this stated reason was pretext. Complainant's argument that she was more qualified than S2 does not address the Agency's stated legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation and is therefore not evidence of pretext for unlawful discrimination. The preponderance of the evidence in the record does not establish pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mistakes, however, may be probative of discriminatory intent, where for example, they are routinely made in selection processes involving the same person. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01850031 (2016) ("a mistake or misjudgment as to an applicant's qualifications may be probative of whether the stated reasons for action are pretext for discrimination.").</p>
