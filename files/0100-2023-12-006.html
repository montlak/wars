<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-7"><span class="space">1.</span> Avoiding Fragmentation</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the main goals of the 1999 amendments to Part 1614 was to eliminate fragmentation of discrimination claims. The Commission has continued to place an emphasis on avoiding fragmentation in its 2012 regulatory amendments and 2015 revisions to MD-110.</p>
<p class="noindent">Fragmentation occurs in two ways. One way fragmentation occurs is when some claims raised in a complaint are accepted for processing and others are dismissed. Obviously, there is no problem when the claims are properly dismissed. The problem arises when the claims are improperly dismissed--a common occurrence--and the result is an extremely inefficient processing of complaints. The Commission has taken some specific measures to eliminate this type fragmentation, including changing the process for partial dismissal of complaints and allowing for amendment of complaints. Each of these measures is discussed later in the chapter under the subheadings "<a href="0100-2023-10-051.html#sec1-51">Partial Dismissals</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-12-263.html#sec3-249">Substantive Amendments</a>." The second way fragmentation occurs is when a claim involving a series of events, such as a hostile environment claim, is viewed instead as a collection of independent claims where each event represents a separate claim. When this occurs, all events that occurred more than 45 days prior to counselor contact are dismissed as untimely and each event is also deemed not to rise to the level of stating sufficient personal harm to state a claim. This section focuses on defining fragmentation and illustrating the ways that claims become improperly fragmented.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's case law over the past several years has been increasingly critical of agencies that ignore the "pattern aspect" of a claim. Agencies frequently break down an overall claim of discrimination into separate allegations, and then analyze each allegation in isolation to determine whether it alleges harm sufficient to state a claim for relief. The Commission noted the impropriety of this approach in its notice of final rulemaking at 64 Fed. Reg. 37,648 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC believes that agencies are not properly distinguishing between factual allegations in support of a legal claim and the legal claim itself, resulting in the fragmentation of some claims that involve a number of different allegations. Certain kinds of cases are especially susceptible to fragmentation, for example, harassment claims and continuing violation claims. Fragmentation is undesirable because it unnecessarily multiplies complaints and can improperly render non-meritorious otherwise valid and cognizable claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Blount v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0520110480 (2011), the Commission described the effects of fragmentation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fragmentation, or breaking up, of a complainant's legal claim during EEO complaint processing has been a significant problem in the federal sector. For complainants, fragmented processing can compromise their ability to present an integrated and coherent claim of an unlawful employment practice for which there is a remedy under the federal equal employment statutes. For agencies and the Commission, fragmented processing substantially increases case inventories and workloads when it results in the processing of related matters as separate complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an effort to curb fragmentation, the Commission replaced the term "matter," used under its former regulations, and adopted the term "claim" to describe an overall complaint of discrimination. The Commission expressed its intent, at 64 Fed. Reg. 37,648 (1999), for the term "claim" to be interpreted broadly:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has revised the regulation in several places to address the fragmentation problem. Section 1614.108(b) has been amended to replace the phrase "matter alleged to be discriminatory" with the word "claim." The Commission believes that agencies may be interpreting "matter" to mean something less than a claim. Where a complainant raises a claim of retaliation or a claim involving terms and conditions of employment, subsequent events or instances involving the same claim should not be filed as separate complaints, but should be treated as part of the first claim. For the same reasons, the Commission has revised section 1614.603 to remove the word "allegations" and replace it with "claims."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission stressed the importance of avoiding fragmentation in the introduction to Chapter 5 of MD-110 at 5-5 to 5-6:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fragmentation, or breaking up, of a complainant's legal claim during EEO complaint processing has been a significant problem in the federal sector. For complainants, fragmented processing can compromise their ability to present an integrated and coherent claim of an unlawful employment practice for which there is a remedy under the federal equal employment statutes. For agencies and the Commission, fragmented processing substantially increases case inventories and workloads when it results in the processing of related matters as separate complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fragmentation of EEO claims must be prevented at all levels of the complaint process, including pre-complaint EEO counseling. This section is designed to promote understanding of the concept of fragmentation and to provide guidance on avoiding fragmented complaint processing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Note that because the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to hear non-appealable matters, complaints not containing those matters should be processed by the agency under the 1614 process and not mixed with matters that are appealable to the MSPB through amendment, consolidation or held in abeyance. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Inter-American Foundation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132968, (Jan. 8, 2014) (wherein the Commission essentially overturned the doctrine of inextricably intertwined). We note, however, that a proposed action merges with the decision on an appealable matter--for example, a proposed removal merges into the decision to remove. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120122103 (September 10, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This section is not designed to address claims that include both a mixed and non-mixed matters. Where the complainant has or brings an amendment which contains a mixed issue (one that can be appealed directly to the MSPB), fragmentation does not occur where the agency assigns a second complaint number and processes the non-mixed matters under the 29 C.F.R. 1614 process and the mixed matters under the 5 C.F.R. 1201 process.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has put forth substantial and specific guidance for agencies to help them distinguish between the claim of discrimination and the individual allegations that comprise the claim. MD-110 at 5-6 to 5-10 provides some illustrations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Fragmentation often occurs at the point where the agency identifies and defines the complainant's claim, most commonly during the counseling and investigative stages. A claim refers to an assertion of an unlawful employment practice or policy for which, if proven, there is a remedy under the federal equal employment statutes. Fragmentation often results from a failure to distinguish between the claim the complainant is raising and the evidence (factual information) s/he is offering in support of that claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example&#x2003;1</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">An African-American employee complains to the EEO Counselor that his supervisor is more strict about his time and attendance than with the unit's Caucasian employees. This is a legal claim of race-based disparate treatment in the terms and conditions of the complainant's employment with regard to time and attendance. In support of this claim, the complainant tells the counselor about a number of different occasions when the supervisor denied his request for annual leave or required him to use leave because he was tardy, while treating similarly situated Caucasian employees more favorably. These specific incidents should be considered the evidence supporting the complainant's claim that the supervisor is treating him differently because of his race with regard to his time and attendance. Fragmentation would occur if each of these incidents were considered a separate claim and processed as a separate complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example&#x2003;2</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A female employee complains to the EEO Counselor that she is being subjected to a hostile work environment due to the ongoing sexual harassment by her male coworkers. This is the complainant's legal claim. In support of this claim, the complainant tells the counselor of specific incidents of a sexual advance, a sexual joke and a comment of a sexual nature. These individual incidents are evidence in support of the complainant's claim and should not be considered as separate claims in and of themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Often, when an agency identifies each piece of factual evidence (usually comprising a single incident) offered by the complainant as a separate and distinct legal claim, it ignores the complainant's real underlying claim of a pattern of ongoing discrimination. In contrast, fragmentation rarely occurs when the complainant presents a legal claim based on a single incident (such as a particular selection decision or a termination decision) rather than a series of events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In defining a legal claim, the agency must exercise care where a series of incidents offered by a complainant initially seem different from one another.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Example&#x2003;3</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A complainant tells the counselor that she believes that the agency discriminated against her when she was not selected for a GS-14 Engineer position, when she was not detailed to serve in a similar position, and when she was denied access to a particular training <span id="Page_144"></span>program. All of these seemingly different incidents are part of the same claim of a discriminatory nonselection, as the complainant has alleged that the detail and the training would have enhanced her qualifications for the GS-14 Engineer position and, therefore, are relevant to the agency's failure to select her for that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Practice Tip</span>: When defining a claim, two components must be identified. First, the claim must contain a factual statement of the employment practice or policy being challenged. As already discussed, it is critical that EEO Counselors, investigators, and other EEO staff members ensure that they understand the exact nature of the complainant's concerns so that the employment practice is defined broadly enough to reflect any allegation of a pattern of ongoing discrimination. Particular attention should be given to claims involving terms and conditions of employment. In Example 1 above, the employment practice being challenged is: disparate treatment in terms and conditions of employment with regard to time and attendance polices. In Example 2 above, the employment practice is: the creation of a hostile work environment because of sexual harassment. In Example 3 above, the employment practice might be defined as: management's failure to advance the complainant's career to a GS-14 position. The second component of a legal claim is the identification of the basis (because of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, reprisal, age, disability or genetic information) for a violation of an equal employment statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Timeliness Issue</span>: One of the reasons the distinction between legal claims and supporting evidence is important is because complainants frequently raise factual incidents that occur outside of the 45-day time period for contacting an EEO Counselor. In general, for a legal claim to be timely raised, at least one of the incidents the complainant cites as evidence in support of his/her claim must have occurred within the 45-day time period for contacting an EEO Counselor. (The usual exceptions should still be made. See Section IV of this Chapter on dismissals.) If the claim itself is timely raised, the question remains as to how the agency is to treat those factual incidents that the complainant cited as evidence in support of his/her claim that occurred outside the 45-day time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The answer is that an agency must consider, at least as background, all relevant evidence offered in support of a timely raised legal claim, even if the evidence involves incidents that occurred outside the 45-day time limit. This is true of supporting evidence that the complainant offered during EEO counseling as well as later in the investigative stage. During the investigation, the degree to which a certain piece of proffered evidence is relevant to the legal claim will determine what sort of investigation is necessary of that particular piece of evidence. For example, in a nonselection case, a selection decision made long before the one at issue, involving different agency officials, may have little relevance to the current claim. On the other hand, if the selecting official in the most recent nonselection also failed to select the complainant for a similar position six months before, that piece of evidence may be very relevant to the complainant's claim. Investigators should not simply disregard relevant information the complainant provided in support of his/her claim as untimely raised; nor should they send the complainant back to counseling as if the supporting evidence was a new claim to be processed as a separate complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the timeliness of a claim of harassment, because the incidents that make up a harassment claim collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice, the claim is actionable, as long as at least one incident that is part of the claim occurred within the filing period. Such a claim can include incidents that occurred outside the filing period that the complainant knew or should have known were actionable at the time of their occurrence. <span class="Italic">See Bulluck v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120114276 (Mar. 14, 2012); <span class="Italic">Richardson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120111122 (Feb. 1, 2012). However, the Supreme Court has held that no recovery is available for discrete acts such as hiring, firing, and promotions that fall outside the filing period, even if they are arguably related to other discriminatory acts that occur within the filing period. <span class="Italic">National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. 101 (2002). <span class="Italic">See also</span> EEOC Compliance Manual 915.003, Section 2: "Threshold Issues,"(rev. July 21, 2005). However, as the Court recognized, an employee may use the prior discrete acts as background evidence in support of a timely harassment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Practice Tip</span>: It is critical that agencies document their actions and the reasons for those actions in the record for Administrative Judge and Commission consideration later in the process. For example, if the agency's investigator decides that a certain factual incident raised by the complainant is of little relevance to his/her claim and, therefore, decides that an "appropriate" investigation of that incident is very minimal, the investigator should document that decision and the reasons for it in the investigative report.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the 1999 regulation amendments, the Commission began to address some of the problems through its case law by requiring that, at the counseling stage, claims be developed and defined in consultation with the complainant. This case law is discussed in <a href="0100-2023-11-001.html#sec2-1">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency did improperly fragment a claim and investigated some allegations but not others, it was not always possible to correct the problem by simply remanding the dismissed claims to be processed with the accepted claims. In many cases, by the time OFO reached a decision reversing the agency, the accepted claims had been investigated. When this occurred, the Commission could order the agency to investigate the rejected claims and use the completed investigations on the accepted claims as background evidence in the new investigation. <span class="Italic">Skrypka v. Postmaster General</span>, 05970800 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0520080074 (2007), the Commission explained how fragmentation effects the evaluation of the merits of complaints. In remanding the case back to the agency to consolidate the complaints, conduct a supplemental investigation and issue a decision on the merits of the consolidated complaints that considered all of the evidence, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted in our prior decision, the Commission has long voiced its concerns that agencies, when confronted with a complaint involving multiple claims or multiple complaints with multiple claims, may possibly fail to recognize the "pattern aspect" of the complainant's claims and define the issues in a piecemeal manner, ignoring the underlying analogous theme and claim of harassment that unites them. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970558 (September 15, 2000); <span class="Italic">Drakev. Department of the Air Force,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970689 (March 29, 1999). In the Preamble to the 1614 Regulations, effective November 9, 1999, the Commission identified fragmentation of EEO complaints as a problem in processing federal 05970689 (March 29, 1999). In the Preamble to the 1614 Regulations, effective November 9, 1999, the Commission identified fragmentation of EEO complaints as a problem in processing federal sector complaints and initiated certain reforms, including changes to the EEO Management Directive-110 (November 9, 1999). Final Rule, 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (July 12, 1999). In that statement, the Commission declared it's" concern that fragmentation "can improperly render non-meritorious otherwise valid and cognizable claims." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our previous decision clearly stated that the agency failed to comply with all of the Commission's initial order. In the first instance, the Commission directed the agency to combine the two complaints and re-adjudicate them "as a consolidated claim." The Order defined the remanded matter as "all of the claims raised" in the two complaints plus two issues that were ignored by the agency, i.e., the "RIF claim" and the 1996 performance rating claim. The agency, however, issued separate decisions, failed to "re-adjudicate" the complaints as a consolidated complaint, and did not complete its processes within 180 days. In fact, the agency repeated the earlier improper fragmentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition we previously noted that although the cover page of the Supplemental Report of Investigation (SROI) identified both complaints, review of the SROI revealed that no attempt was made to combine the two complaints and investigate them as a consolidated claim of harassment, i.e., no new witnesses, such as complainant's former co-workers, other supervisors, higher-level managers, or personnel specialists, were interviewed; no new medical evidence was sought to show the progress of complainant's cognitive abilities; no attempt to intermingle the events identified in both complaints was made; and, as for the two issues ignored by the agency, only limited historical documentation was included. The only "new" material in the SROI was a statement from S1, who largely reiterated her previous statements, and a statement from an agency witness addressing the RIF process in general terms. Complainant submitted briefs and statements to the record, including her rebuttal statements in the SROI, and neither the investigator nor the agency investigated or answered any of the matters she raised. We note that despite the prior orders of the Commission to consolidate complainant's complaints for an individual investigation, the agency has failed to comply. In order to avoid additional fragmentation of complainant's complaints, we have no option other than to remand the complaints to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of improper fragmentation is provided by <span class="Italic">Srinivas v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 012010355 (2011), where the complainant alleged several instances in which a subordinate employee and another section leader harassed her based on her national origin and religion after she was promoted to the position of section leader. The complainant submitted a narrative statement in support of her complaint that detailed incidents where the subordinate employee called her a "backstabbling bitch," and made comments about her culture such as suggesting that Indian food did not smell good. The other section leader encouraged employees under her supervision to defy her authority by filing grievances and commented that the complainant came from a "caste culture" and could not for that reason be a good supervisor. She also detailed several other incidents involving these two individuals. The agency treated each incident as a separate claim and dismissed each claim as failing to state a claim. The Commission reversed finding that the complainant "has painted a larger picture of an alleged pervasive atmosphere of significant <span id="Page_145"></span>ongoing harassment based on her national origin and religion that has continued for a three-year period."</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission has repeatedly emphasized many of the problems surrounding fragmentation of claims comes from the failure to properly distinguish between the claim itself and evidence of the claim. For example, in <span class="Italic">Buckner v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120103052 (2011), the complainant alleged that a series of "town hall meetings" called by an area director shortly before her scheduled EEO hearing constituted harassment on the basis of retaliation. The complainant alleged the meetings were intended to embarrass and harass her after she refused to settle her complaint. The agency, treating each meeting as a separate claim of discrimination, dismissed the allegations for failure to state a claim and on the basis of untimely counselor contact. In reversing the agency, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Buckner</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the EEO complaint at issue in this case, we first note that the Agency fragmented Complainant's claim in its opposition brief by failing to distinguish between the claim raised and the evidence (factual information) she offered in support of that claim. EEO MD-110, at 5-5. The legal claim here is retaliatory harassment in trying to require that Complainant meet with her alleged harasser through town hall meetings. In support of this claim, Complainant references the February 10, 2010 notification that attendance was mandatory and the March 5, 2010 notification that she would not be excused from the meeting. These two incidents are evidence in support of Complainant's claim and should not be considered as separate claims in and of themselves, which the Agency appears to do in its opposition brief when it considers the February 10, 2010 notification to be the relevant incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One of the reasons the distinction between legal claims and supporting evidence is important is because complainants frequently raise factual incidents that occur outside of the 45-day time period for contacting an EEO Counselor. EEO MD-110, at 5-7. In general, for a legal claim to be timely raised, at least one of the incidents the Complainant cites as evidence in support of her claim must have occurred within the 45-day time period for contacting an EEO Counselor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the claim itself is timely raised, the Agency must consider, at least as background, all relevant evidence offered in support of a timely raised legal claim, even if the evidence involves incidents that occurred outside the 45-day time limit. EEO MD-110, at 5-8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the claim was timely raised because at least one of the incidents Complainant cites as evidence in support of her claim, the March 5, 2010 denial of her request to not attend the town hall meeting, occurred within the 45-day time period for contacting an EEO counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent">Fragmentation can even occur in complaints that might otherwise appear to involve discrete personnel actions. For example, in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120092043 (2011), the Commission found that its administrative judge improperly fragmented a claim where after the complainant disclosed she had Parkinson's Disease she was denied a detail, denied permission to serve in a back-up role, denied training and ultimately removed. In explaining in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>, that the claim was one of hostile work environment based on disability, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that the AJ improperly fragmented Complainant's harassment claim. The Agency accepted Complainant's complaint as challenging three adverse actions: the denial of the detail, the denial of her request to serve in a back-up role, and the denial of training. Although Complainant's removal was not an accepted issue, we note that the EEO Investigator obtained supplemental statements from management officials regarding the removal. The AJ treated all of the adverse actions as separate claims, rather than considering them as part of an ongoing harassment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, we find that Complainant's complaint should be viewed as alleging one ongoing unlawful employment practice claim, that is, that the Agency allegedly subjected her to a hostile work environment based on disability when, after learning about her Parkinson's disease, management officials repeatedly denied her career development opportunities. We find that the AJ erred by failing to recognize that Complainant was raising a claim of harassment that began with her removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that Complainant explicitly raised a harassment claim. In her August 23, 2007 request to amend her complaint, Complainant specifically stated that she wanted to include "hostile work environment/harassment as a basis." She also maintained that she was being subjected to harassment and cited the matter of her removal, the denial of her request to serve in a back-up role, and the denial of training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's affidavit also indicates that she was alleging an ongoing claim of harassment, beginning with her removal. This consisted of management continually denying her career development opportunities based on disability (and reprisal). Specifically, Complainant attested, "From the time management became aware of my disability and my subsequent EEO complaint, they have repeatedly denied me opportunities to further my development or to experience different duties and assignments...there's [sic] appears to be no end to the disparate treatment and reprisal." In addition, Complainant attested, "Once I notified [PM] of my Parkinson's the disparate treatment began and started with the removal from my position as [QRM]." Further, Complainant attested, "If management continues to remove my name from lists or not consider me for assignments because of my Parkinson's, I will forever be denied the opportunity to advance in the Agency." Finally, Complainant attested, "Since I made management aware of my Parkinson's disease, it appears that every time I'm offered a developmental or other assignment, management slams the door. Now that I have filed an EEO complaint, I believe that the door has been slammed shut for all future opportunities." Complainant also testified at the hearing that her removal was related to her disability and that management began thinking, around the time of her removal, that she was "incapable of working."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's factual claims describe the means the Agency allegedly used to effectuate the hostile work environment: (1) her removal from a temporary promotional position; (2) her non-selection for a detail; (3) her non-selection as a back-up; and (4) the denial of training.<span class="Italic"> See</span> EEO MD-110, at Ch.5, III.A.2. (it is critical to understand the exact nature of the complainant's concerns so that the employment practice is defined broadly enough to reflect any allegation of a pattern of ongoing discrimination). The Commission has previously held that an Agency should not ignore the "pattern aspect" of a complainant's claims and define the issues in a piecemeal manner where an analogous theme unites the matters complained of. <span class="Italic">Meaney v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940169 (Nov. 3, 1994). Once an AJ is appointed, the AJ has full responsibility for the adjudication of the complaint. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(a). Accordingly, based on the factual allegations set forth by Complainant in the record, we find that the AJ erred by fragmenting Complainant's claim of harassment. We note that Complainant's hostile work environment claim includes her 2005 QRM removal, in addition to the incidents involving her non-selection for a detail, non-selection as a back-up, and denial of training.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wade K. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2022000215 (2021), the complainant alleged disability discrimination where the agency sent him home for not wearing a face mask and denied his request for a reasonable accommodation. The agency dismissed untimely contact the claim related to his being sent home for refusing to wear a mask. The complainant appealed arguing that he told the agency that an underlying medical condition prevented him from wearing a mask and that dismissal was improper because the claim alleged an ongoing denial of reasonable accommodation. The Commission agreed finding that the agency fragmented the mask incident from the agency's failure to accommodate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency improperly dismissed Complainant's complaint for failure to state a claim. A fair reading of the complaint shows Complainant is alleging an ongoing denial of a reasonable accommodation claim when he was initially sent home on December 28, 2020, when he informed management he could not wear a face covering due to a medical condition. Complainant further asserted that he returned to the facility on January 4, 2021, with medical documentation that he could not wear a face covering and was again sent home by management and told that he would receive paperwork regarding the District Reasonable Accommodation Committee (DRAC) process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that Complainant requested to be returned to his position and alleges that he has not earned income since December 28, 2020. While the Agency, in its final decision, asserts that Complainant abandoned his denial of a reasonable accommodation claim by not raising it in his formal complaint, we disagree. The matters which the Agency separated and identified as two distinct claims both relate to Complainant's singular ongoing denial of a reasonable accommodation in which he alleged he was sent home for not wearing a face covering and did not receive pay. In his formal complaint, Complainant clearly stated that he had not received an income since December 28, 2020. Complainant also states that management sent him home for not wearing a face covering after he informed them that he had a medical condition. Based on the foregoing, we find that Complainant raised the issue of an ongoing denial of a reasonable accommodation claim in his formal complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the Agency improperly dismissed Complainant's complaint for untimely EEO Counselor contact. As set forth above, we find that Complainant is alleging an ongoing denial of a reasonable accommodation claim. EEOC's Compliance Manual, Section 2, "Threshold Issues," p. 2-73, EEOC Notice 915.003 (July 21, 2005), provides that "because an employer has an ongoing obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation, failure to provide such accommodation constitutes a violation each time the employee needs it."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEO Counselor's Report reflects that Complainant alleged that management sent him home from work for not wearing a face covering and that he had not been paid since December 28, 2020. Complainant requested to be returned to his position. Thus, we find that Complainant alleged that the Agency's denial of his reasonable accommodation <span id="Page_146"></span>request continued during the 45 days preceding his initial EEO contact on May 13, 2021. Based on the foregoing, we find that Complainant timely initiated EEO contact with respect to his ongoing denial of a reasonable accommodation claim.</p>
