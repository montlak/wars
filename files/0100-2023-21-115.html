<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-86"><span class="space">G.</span> HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT HARASSMENT--SUBORDINATE EMPLOYEES TO SUPERVISORS</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is possible for a subordinate to create a hostile work environment for a supervisor. "A claim that subordinate employees created a hostile work environment may be actionable if the complainant's supervisors or agency management "condoned" or "tolerated" the subordinate's harassing conduct, the agency exhibited a history or culture of tolerance at the complainant's work site and/or the complainant's supervisors or agency management ineffectively responded when they were made aware of the subordinate's harassing conduct." <span class="italic">Colene M. v. Veterans Affairs,</span> 2023000066 (2023) In such situations, the most appropriate liability analysis is the one employed to <span id="Page_909"></span>determine liability in cases where one worker harasses a coworker. That analysis was implicitly adopted by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01953977 (1998). In that case, a female manager was subjected to a long period of harassment by a male subordinate that was both sexually demeaning and physically threatening. Because the agency accepted the recommended decision of the administrative judge as to the existence of a hostile environment, as well as the agency's liability for that environment, the Commission did not focus on the findings on the merits. The case focused primarily on remedies. However, in its decision, the Commission noted that the administrative judge premised the finding of agency liability on the fact that the agency knew of the harassment and failed to take prompt and effective corrective action. Certainly, this is the correct analysis to apply, unless the supervisor or manager in question has sufficient independent authority to discipline the offender, including removal, if necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission more recently again acknowledged that a subordinate's behavior, under the right circumstances, could rise to the level of harassment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Norbert K. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2021001898 (2021). In <span class="Italic">Norbert K</span>., the Commission wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant may demonstrate the necessary severity or pervasiveness to state a harassment claim by alleging that the harassing actions unreasonably interfered with his or her work performance. In cases involving subordinate harassment, the impact on work performance typically manifests itself by reducing the complainant's effectiveness as a supervisor or undermining the complainant's credibility or authority in the eyes of other subordinates or coworkers. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Opal</span>; <span class="Italic">Gilberto S. v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120151198 (Mar. 11, 2016). Here, Complainant alleged that the subordinate continually undermined his authority as a supervisor, including with other employees witnessing his conduct. Taking Complainant's allegations together and assuming them to be true, we determine that the subordinate essentially refused to recognize Complainant as his supervisor, which unreasonably and directly interfered with Complainant's work performance. For example, Complainant alleged that the subordinate continually reported to Complainant's supervisors instead of Complainant, rarely acknowledged Complainant's emails or satisfactorily completed assignments, attended only four out of 40 meetings Complainant hosted or co-hosted during the relevant time frame, and completed only two out of 10 assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, assuming that the complaining supervisor can establish that the harassment was based on a protected basis, what is the framework to establish liability? The crux of the supervisor-to-subordinate liability analysis centers on the supervisor's authority over the subordinate. The assumption is that the same "abuse of authority" component is not present in subordinate-to-supervisor relationship. And, isn't it the job of a supervisor to manage the misbehaviors of a subordinate? The crux of coworker-to-coworker liability is that management had to or should have known of the harassment, but failed to act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without directly answering the question, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Colene M. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2020002054 (2020), affirmed an AJ's imposition of liability where the agency had knowledge of a subordinate's harassing behavior and failed to take effective action. The complainant in that case claimed a hostile work environment by a subordinate who exhibited "volatile behavior, misconduct and had several DWI arrests." She expressed her fear to management and requested a transfer. Seeming to apply the coworker-to-coworker liability analysis with an emphasis on the agency's knowledge and failure to act, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Colene M</span>. wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding claim 2, Complainant alleged that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on her race, color, and in reprisal for her protected EEO activity and that management did not respond appropriately to her allegations of harassment/safety issues. Complainant stated that the Postmaster and Person D denied her request to transfer to another station. The record reveals that the Postmaster and Person D were aware of Complainant's race and color prior to the allegations at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that Complainant was subjected to a hostile work environment and that the Agency failed to take appropriate action when it was informed of Complainant's allegations. Specifically, we find that the record showed Person [ ] exhibited volatile behavior, misconduct, and had several DWI arrests. Complainant clearly expressed her fear to management, which was based in part on the meeting held by a Supervisor (Person C) in which the clerks were advised to monitor Complainant for her well-being as a result of the actions by Person X. Person X's behavior and personality were well-known to management. The record reveals that previously Complainant had been moved around in different positions, serving at least five details prior to the incidents at issue. However, when Complainant asked to transfer to another station for her safety beginning May 1, 2015, management took no action to move her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency failed to conduct an appropriate investigation into Complainant's allegations. We note on May 1, 2015, the Postmaster spoke with Clerk 1 and Clerk 2 who signed the statement confirming that Person C asked Clerk 1 and Clerk 2 to be on the lookout for Person X. However, no formal investigation occurred. The Agency noted that no investigation was conducted because Person [ ] left work on April 30, 2015, and Complainant left work on May 4, 2015.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While neither party returned to work, we note that there is no claim by the Agency that either Complainant or Person [ ] were contacted for an investigation and refused to participate. Moreover, the record reveals that after Complainant left work on May 4, 2015, she continued to seek a transfer to another station and participated in the Agency's reasonable accommodation process as another means of securing a position at a different location. Ultimately, Complainant resigned from the Agency on September 16, 2015. However, we find the Agency still had not taken appropriate action into investigating Complainant's claim of a hostile work environment by the time Complainant resigned or gave notice of her resignation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission again, in <span class="Italic">Foster B. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 2019005682 (2021), adopted the coworker to coworker standard for imputing liability where a supervisor alleged that a subordinate made intimating comments related to the supervisor's sexual orientation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency's FAD does not challenge the fact that the incidents occurred as alleged. Moreover, there is abundant evidence in the record that E1 subjected Complainant to unwelcome harassment consisting of comments based on Complainant's sexual orientation2 between August 2016 and July 2018, in and out of Complainant's presence, to Complainant's subordinates and superiors. For example, multiple witnesses reported that E1 routinely referred to Complainant as a "faggot." ROI at 74, 86, 100-101, 114, 134, 140. In fact, E1's comments were often made or relayed to management officials, who rather than acting to discontinue the behavior, encouraged Complainant to file an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously observed that that the words "fag" and "faggot" have been historically used in the United States as highly offensive, insulting, and degrading sex-based epithets against gay men. <span class="Italic">See Couch v. Dep't of Energy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120131136 (Aug. 13, 2013). Additionally, the words "fag" and "faggot" are offensive, insulting, and degrading sex-based epithets historically used when a person is displaying the belief that a male is not as masculine or as manly as the person is. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc</span>., 256 F.3d 864, 870, 875 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that verbal abuse, including the use of the epithet "faggot," occurred because of sex). We find that Complainant has established that he was subjected to a hostile work environment based on sex and sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we must determine if there is a basis for imputing liability on the Agency. In the case of co-worker harassment, an agency is responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace where the agency (or its agents) knew or should have known of the conduct, unless it can be shown that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors</span>, No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999). An agency can raise an affirmative defense when it shows that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> What is appropriate remedial action will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case, such as the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial remedial steps. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dep't Of Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 8, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the Agency knew of the conduct at issue. We further find that management officials did not take prompt and effective action once they became aware of E1's conduct, as they placed the onus on Complainant to discipline E1 or file an EEO complaint. The Deputy Director denied knowledge of the incidents. However, the record indicates that Complainant reported his concerns to the Deputy Director verbally and in writing. ROI at 77. Additionally, the record is clear that the Agency had constructive knowledge of the harassment that Complainant endured, as E1 referred to Complainant by the offensive terms openly to others in the office. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920194 (July 9, 1992) (employers will generally be deemed to have constructive knowledge of harassment that is openly practiced in the workplace or is well-known among employees). The record further shows that leadership had knowledge of the conduct because the CEO was within Complainant's chain of command and the CEO affirmed that she made Complainant aware of E1's comments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 86. The CEO stated that she admonished E1 for the comments when she made them in her presence and encouraged Complainant to file an EEO complaint, but stated that she did not feel that it would be appropriate to interject herself without Complainant's request because Complainant was E1's first-line supervisor, and took no further action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We remind the Agency that the EEO process is not a substitute for the Agency's internal process. Moreover, we find that the inadequate responses from Complainant's chain of command likely emboldened E1 to continue harassing Complainant, diminished his authority as her supervisor, and <span id="Page_910"></span>heightened the severity of the alleged incidents. <span class="Italic">Debbra R. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120161305 (Jul6 26, 2016) (finding that when harassment is repeated, a supervisor's failure to respond to instances of alleged harassment heightens the severity of the alleged act). As such, we find that E1's actions unreasonably interfered with Complainant's work environment and management officials failed to take prompt and effective action.</p>
<p class="noindent">It's worth noting that the DC District Court applied a modified version of the coworker-to-coworker standard in subordinate-to-supervisor harassment cases, holding that "[a]n employer may be held liable for the harassment of a supervisor by a subordinate if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate action; but an employer will not be liable for the sexual harassment of a supervisor by a subordinate where the supervisor-plaintiff had the ability to stop the harassment and failed to do so." <span class="Italic">Lyles v. District of Columbia</span>, 17 F. Supp.3d 59 (2014).</p>
