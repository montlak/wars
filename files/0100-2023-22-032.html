<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-32"><span class="space">1.</span> Burdens of Proof</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Young v. United Parcel Service</span>, 135 S. Ct. 1338 (2015), the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision adopted the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> formulation for analyzing cases of failure to accommodate pregnancy-related job restriction in cases where there is no direct evidence that the employer intended to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy. In doing so, however, the Court rejected a portion of the EEOC's 2014 guidance cited above that required an employer to accommodate the restrictions of a pregnant employee if it accommodated the restrictions of any other employee. But the Court also rejected an interpretation of the Statute advanced by UPS that the cause relating to limitations simply clarified that pregnancy discrimination was a form of sex discrimination. That interpretation, the Court said, would have rendered the limitations clause superfluous because the first clause of the Act already said that.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Young</span>, the Commission had held that an allegation of discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is properly treated as a complaint of discrimination based on sex and not discrimination based on a physical disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 01842361 (1986). Note that temporary medical conditions, such as pregnancy, have not subject to protection under the Rehabilitation Act, see Chapter 14, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-23-036.html#sec14-37">Transitory and Minor Impairments</a>," though it is not clear if the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act changed that. The issue is not whether the agency treats employees with temporary disabilities different from employees without disabilities. The proper scope of inquiry is whether the pregnant employee has been treated differently than other temporarily disabled employees. Cases are analyzed on the basis of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Herbers v. USPS</span>, 01831172 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The allocation of burdens of proof under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is the same as for other disparate treatment cases following the guidance of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. But, because pregnancy is a condition peculiar to females, there is no rigid adherence to requiring the complainant to show similarly situated males were treated more favorably. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. USPS</span>, 01850845 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">As part of her burden of proof, a complainant must demonstrate that the employer knew of her pregnancy prior to taking or failing to take an employment action. As the Commission explained in its <span class="Italic">PDA Enforcement Guidance</span>, Sec. IA1:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The most familiar form of pregnancy discrimination is discrimination against an employee based on her current pregnancy. Such discrimination occurs when an employer refuses to hire, fires, or takes any other adverse action against a woman because she is pregnant, without regard to her ability to perform the duties of the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Employer's Knowledge of Pregnancy</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If those responsible for taking the adverse action did not know the employee was pregnant, there can be no finding of intentional pregnancy discrimination. However, even if the employee did not inform the decision makers about her pregnancy before they undertook the adverse action, they nevertheless might have been aware of it through, for example, office gossip or because the pregnancy was obvious. Since the obviousness of pregnancy "varies, both temporally and as between different affected individuals," an issue may arise as to whether the employer knew of the pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">EXAMPLE 1--Knowledge of Pregnancy</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When Germaine learned she was pregnant, she decided not to inform management at that time because of concern that such an announcement would affect her chances of receiving a bonus at the upcoming anniversary of her employment. When she was three months pregnant, Germaine's supervisor told her that she would not receive a bonus. Because the pregnancy was not obvious and the evidence indicated that the decision makers did not know of Germaine's pregnancy at the time of the bonus decision, there is no reasonable cause to believe that Germaine was subjected to pregnancy discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Young</span>, Justice Breyer, writing for a majority joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, vacated a grant of summary judgment to UPS by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and remanded the case for trial. In 2006, Young, a driver for UPS, after several miscarriages became pregnant and her physician placed her on restrictions of lifting no more than 20 pounds a week for the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy and 10 pounds a week thereafter. UPS drivers are required to be able to lift up to 70 pounds and assist in lifting up to 150 pounds. By contrast, UPS does grant accommodations to workers injured on the job, workers who have disabilities under the ADA, and drivers who have lost their DOT certification.</p>
<p class="noindent">Young sought accommodation for her pregnancy-related restrictions, and she was refused. She spent several months on leave without pay and returned to work a few months after her baby was born. She filed suit against UPS under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The district court granted summary judgment to UPS and the Fourth Circuit affirmed finding, in part, that the workers who were accommodated were not similarly situated to Young.</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting that the facts of the case arose prior to the passage of the ADAAA and that the Court was passing no judgment on the effect of that Act, the majority wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties disagree about the interpretation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act's second clause. As we have said, <span class="Italic">see</span> Part I-B, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Act's first clause specifies that discrimination "'because of sex'" includes discrimination "because of...pregnancy." But the meaning of the second clause is less clear; it adds: "[W]omen affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes...as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e(k) (emphasis added). Does this clause mean that courts must compare workers only in respect to the work limitations that they suffer? Does it mean that courts must ignore all other similarities or differences between pregnant and nonpregnant workers? Or does it mean that courts, when deciding who the relevant "other persons" are, may consider other similarities and differences as well? If so, which ones?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The differences between these possible interpretations come to the fore when a court, as here, must consider a workplace policy that distinguishes between pregnant and nonpregnant workers in light of characteristics not related to pregnancy. Young poses the problem directly in her reply brief when she says that the Act requires giving "the same accommodations to an employee with a pregnancy-related work limitation as it would give that employee if her work limitation stemmed <span id="Page_1005"></span>from a different cause but had a similar effect on her inability to work." Suppose the employer would not give "that [pregnant] employee" the "same accommodations" as another employee, but the employer's reason for the difference in treatment is that the pregnant worker falls within a facially neutral category (for example, individuals with off-the-job injuries). What is a court then to do?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties propose very different answers to this question. Young and the United States believe that the second clause of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act "requires an employer to provide the same accommodations to workplace disabilities caused by pregnancy that it provides to workplace disabilities that have other causes but have a similar effect on the ability to work." In other words, Young contends that the second clause means that whenever "an employer accommodates only a subset of workers with disabling conditions," a court should find a Title VII violation if "pregnant workers who are similar in the ability to work" do not "receive the same [accommodation] even if still other nonpregnant workers do not receive accommodations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">UPS takes an almost polar opposite view. It contends that the second clause does no more than define sex discrimination to include pregnancy discrimination. Under this view, courts would compare the accommodations an employer provides to pregnant women with the accommodations it provides to others within a facially neutral category (such as those with off-the-job injuries) to determine whether the employer has violated Title VII. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. post, at 4 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (hereinafter the dissent) (the clause "does not prohibit denying pregnant women accommodations...on the basis of an evenhanded policy").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot accept either of these interpretations. Young asks us to interpret the second clause broadly and, in her view, literally. As just noted, she argues that, as long as "an employer accommodates only a subset of workers with disabling conditions," "pregnant workers who are similar in the ability to work [must] receive the same treatment even if still other nonpregnant workers do not receive accommodations." She adds that, because the record here contains "evidence that pregnant and nonpregnant workers were not treated the same," that is the end of the matter, she must win; there is no need to refer to <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The problem with Young's approach is that it proves too much. It seems to say that the statute grants pregnant workers a "most-favored-nation" status. As long as an employer provides one or two workers with an accommodation--say, those with particularly hazardous jobs, or those whose workplace presence is particularly needed, or those who have worked at the company for many years, or those who are over the age of 55--then it must provide similar accommodations to all pregnant workers (with comparable physical limitations), irrespective of the nature of their jobs, the employer's need to keep them working, their ages, or any other criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lower courts have concluded that this could not have been Congress' intent in passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Urbano</span>, 138 F. 3d, at 206-208; <span class="Italic">Reeves</span>, 466 F. 3d, at 641; <span class="Italic">Serednyj</span>, 656 F. 3d, at 548-549; <span class="Italic">Spivey</span>, 196 F. 3d, at 1312-1313. And Young partially agrees, for she writes that "the statute does not require employers to give" to "pregnant workers all of the benefits and privileges it extends to other" similarly disabled "employees when those benefits and privileges are...based on the employee's tenure or position within the company." ("[S]eniority, full-time work, different job classifications, all of those things would be permissible distinctions for an employer to make to differentiate among who gets benefits").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Young's last-mentioned concession works well with respect to seniority, for Title VII itself contains a seniority defense, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(h). Hence, seniority is not part of the problem. But otherwise the most-favored-nation problem remains, and Young's concession does not solve it. How, for example, should a court treat special benefits attached to injuries arising out of, say, extra-hazardous duty? If Congress intended to allow differences in treatment arising out of special duties, special service, or special needs, why would it not also have wanted courts to take account of differences arising out of special "causes"--for example, benefits for those who drive (and are injured) in extra-hazardous conditions?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with UPS to this extent: We doubt that Congress intended to grant pregnant workers an unconditional most-favored-nation status. The language of the statute does not require that unqualified reading. The second clause, when referring to nonpregnant persons with similar disabilities, uses the open-ended term "other persons." It does not say that the employer must treat pregnant employees the "same" as "any other persons" (who are similar in their ability or inability to work), nor does it otherwise specify which other persons Congress had in mind.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, disparate-treatment law normally permits an employer to implement policies that are not intended to harm members of a protected class, even if their implementation sometimes harms those members, as long as the employer has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual reason for doing so. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Raytheon,</span> 540 U.S., at 51-55; <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S., at 252-258; <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S., at 802. There is no reason to believe Congress intended its language in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to embody a significant deviation from this approach. Indeed, the relevant House Report specifies that the Act "reflect[s] no new legislative mandate." H. R. Rep. No. 95-948, pp. 3-4 (1978) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). And the Senate Report states that the Act was designed to "reestablis[h] the law as it was understood prior to" this Court's decision in <span class="Italic">General Electric Co. v. Gilbert</span>, 429 U.S. 125 (1976). S. Rep. No. 95-331, p. 8 (1978) (hereinafter S. Rep.). <span class="Italic">See Gilbert, supra</span>, at 147 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (lower courts had held that a disability plan that compensates employees for temporary disabilities but not pregnancy violates Title VII); <span class="Italic">see also AT&#x0026;T Corp. v. Hulteen</span>, 556 U.S. 701, 717, n.2 (2009) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the EEOC issued guidance stating that "[d]isabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy...are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities" and that "the availability of...benefits and privileges...shall be applied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary disabilities." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.10(b) (1975). Indeed, as early as 1972, EEOC guidelines provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy...are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and should be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment." 37 Fed. Reg. 6837 (1972) (codified in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.10(b) (1973)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Soon after the Act was passed, the EEOC issued guidance consistent with its pre-Act statements. The EEOC explained: "Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy...for all job-related purposes, shall be treated the same as disabilities caused or contributed to by other medical conditions." <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 1604.10(b) (1979). Moreover, the EEOC stated that "[i]f other employees temporarily unable to lift are relieved of these functions, pregnant employees also unable to lift must be temporarily relieved of the function." 29 CFR pt. 1604, App., p. 918.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This post-Act guidance, however, does not resolve the ambiguity of the term "other persons" in the Act's second clause. Rather, it simply tells employers to treat pregnancy-related disabilities like nonpregnancy-related disabilities, without clarifying how that instruction should be implemented when an employer does not treat all nonpregnancy-related disabilities alike.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More recently--in July 2014--the EEOC promulgated an additional guideline apparently designed to address this ambiguity. That guideline says that "[a]n employer may not refuse to treat a pregnant worker the same as other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work by relying on a policy that makes distinctions based on the source of an employee's limitations (e.g., a policy of providing light duty only to workers injured on the job)." 2 EEOC Compliance Manual &#x00A7; 626-I(A)(5), p. 626:0009 (July 2014). The EEOC also provided an example of disparate treatment that would violate the Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"An employer has a policy or practice of providing light duty, subject to availability, for any employee who cannot perform one or more job duties for up to 90 days due to injury, illness, or a condition that would be a disability under the ADA. An employee requests a light duty assignment for a 20-pound lifting restriction related to her pregnancy. The employer denies the light duty request." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 626:0013, Example 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The EEOC further added that "an employer may not deny light duty to a pregnant employee based on a policy that limits light duty to employees with on-the-job injuries." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 626:0028.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Solicitor General argues that we should give special, if not controlling, weight to this guideline. He points out that we have long held that "the rulings, interpretations and opinions" of an agency charged with the mission of enforcing a particular statute, "while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance." <span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Co</span>., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944). <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 26.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But we have also held that the "weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors that give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control." <span class="Italic">Skidmore, supra</span>, at 140. These qualifications are relevant here and severely limit the EEOC's July 2014 guidance's special power to persuade.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We come to this conclusion not because of any agency lack of "experience" or "informed judgment." Rather, the difficulties are those of timing, "consistency," and "thoroughness" of "consideration." The EEOC promulgated its 2014 guidelines only recently, after this Court had granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in this case. In these circumstances, it is fair to say that <span id="Page_1006"></span>the EEOC's current guidelines take a position about which the EEOC's previous guidelines were silent. And that position is inconsistent with positions for which the Government has long advocated. <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief for Defendant-Appellee in <span class="Italic">Ensley-Gaines v. Runyon</span>, No. 95-1038 (CA6 1996), pp. 26-27 (explaining that a reading of the Act like Young's was "simply incorrect" and "runs counter" to this Court's precedents). <span class="Italic">See also</span> Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 16, n.2 ("The Department of Justice, on behalf of the United States Postal Service, has previously taken the position that pregnant employees with work limitations are not similarly situated to employees with similar limitations caused by on-the-job injuries"). Nor does the EEOC explain the basis of its latest guidance. Does it read the statute, for example, as embodying a most-favored-nation status? Why has it now taken a position contrary to the litigation position the Government previously took? Without further explanation, we cannot rely significantly on the EEOC's determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find it similarly difficult to accept the opposite interpretation of the Act's second clause. UPS says that the second clause simply defines sex discrimination to include pregnancy discrimination. But that cannot be so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first clause accomplishes that objective when it expressly amends Title VII's definitional provision to make clear that Title VII's words "because of sex" and "on the basis of sex" "include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e(k). We have long held that "'a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause'" is rendered "'superfluous, void, or insignificant.'" <span class="Italic">TRW Inc. v. Andrews</span>, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Walker</span>, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001)). But that is what UPS' interpretation of the second clause would do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent, basically accepting UPS' interpretation, says that the second clause is not "superfluous" because it adds "clarity." Post, at 4-5 (internal quotation marks omitted). It makes "plain," the dissent adds, that unlawful discrimination "includes disfavoring pregnant women relative to other workers of similar inability to work." Post, at 5. Perhaps we fail to understand. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> itself makes clear that courts normally consider how a plaintiff was treated relative to other "persons of [the plaintiff 's] qualifications" (which here include disabilities). 411 U.S., at 802. If the second clause of the Act did not exist, we would still say that an employer who disfavored pregnant women relative to other workers of similar ability or inability to work had engaged in pregnancy discrimination. In a word, there is no need for the "clarification" that the dissent suggests the second sentence provides.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the interpretation espoused by UPS and the dissent would fail to carry out an important congressional objective. As we have noted, Congress' "unambiguou[s]" intent in passing the Act was to overturn "both the holding and the reasoning of the Court in the <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> decision." <span class="Italic">Newport News Shipbuilding &#x0026; Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC</span>, 462 U.S. 669, 678 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also</span> post, at 6 (recognizing that "the object of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is to displace this Court's conclusion in [<span class="Italic">Gilbert</span>]"). In <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span>, the Court considered a company plan that provided "nonoccupational sickness and accident benefits to all employees" without providing "disability-benefit payments for any absence due to pregnancy." 429 U.S., at 128, 129. The Court held that the plan did not violate Title VII; it did not discriminate on the basis of sex because there was "no risk from which men are protected and women are not." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 138 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although pregnancy is "confined to women," the majority believed it was not "comparable in all other respects to [the] diseases or disabilities" that the plan covered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 136. Specifically, the majority explained that pregnancy "is not a 'disease' at all," nor is it necessarily a result of accident. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Neither did the majority see the distinction the plan drew as "a subterfuge" or a "pretext" for engaging in gender-based discrimination. <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> In short, the <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> majority reasoned in part just as the dissent reasons here. The employer did "not distinguish between pregnant women and others of similar ability or inability because of pregnancy." Post, at 2. It distinguished between them on a neutral ground--i.e., it accommodated only sicknesses and accidents, and pregnancy was neither of those. <span class="Italic">See</span> 429 U.S., at 136.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Simply including pregnancy among Title VII's protected traits (i.e., accepting UPS' interpretation) would not overturn <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> in full--in particular, it would not respond to <span class="Italic">Gilbert's</span> determination that an employer can treat pregnancy less favorably than diseases or disabilities resulting in a similar inability to work. As we explained in <span class="Italic">California Fed. Sav. &#x0026; Loan Assn. v. Guerra</span>, 479 U.S. 272 (1987), "the first clause of the [Act] reflects Congress' disapproval of the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span>" by "adding pregnancy to the definition of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 284. But the second clause was intended to do more than that--it "was intended to overrule the holding in Gilbert and to illustrate how discrimination against pregnancy is to be remedied." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 285. The dissent's view, like that of UPS, ignores this precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute lends itself to an interpretation other than those that the parties advocate and that the dissent sets forth. Our interpretation minimizes the problems we have discussed, responds directly to <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span>, and is consistent with longstanding interpretations of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, an individual pregnant worker who seeks to show disparate treatment through indirect evidence may do so through application of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework. That framework requires a plaintiff to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. But it is "not intended to be an inflexible rule." <span class="Italic">Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 575 (1978). Rather, an individual plaintiff may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by "showing actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a discriminatory criterion illegal under" Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 576 (internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of making this showing is "not onerous." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S., at 253. In particular, making this showing is not as burdensome as succeeding on "an ultimate finding of fact as to" a discriminatory employment action. <span class="Italic">Furnco, supra,</span> at 576. Neither does it require the plaintiff to show that those whom the employer favored and those whom the employer disfavored were similar in all but the protected ways. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S., at 802 (burden met where plaintiff showed that employer hired other "qualified" individuals outside the protected class); <span class="Italic">Furnco, supra,</span> at 575-577 (same); <span class="Italic">Burdine, supra</span>, at 253 (same). <span class="Italic">Cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc</span>., 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000) (similar).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, a plaintiff alleging that the denial of an accommodation constituted disparate treatment under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act's second clause may make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing, as in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, that she belongs to the protected class, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not accommodate her, and that the employer did accommodate others "similar in their ability or inability to work." The employer may then seek to justify its refusal to accommodate the plaintiff by relying on "legitimate, non-discriminatory" reasons for denying her accommodation. 411 U.S., at 802. But, consistent with the Act's basic objective, that reason normally cannot consist simply of a claim that it is more expensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the category of those ("similar in their ability or inability to work") whom the employer accommodates. After all, the employer in <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> could in all likelihood have made just such a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the employer offers an apparently "legitimate, nondiscriminatory" reason for its actions, the plaintiff may in turn show that the employer's proffered reasons are in fact pretextual. We believe that the plaintiff may reach a jury on this issue by providing sufficient evidence that the employer's policies impose a significant burden on pregnant workers, and that the employer's "legitimate, nondiscriminatory" reasons are not sufficiently strong to justify the burden, but rather--when considered along with the burden imposed--give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiff can create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a significant burden exists by providing evidence that the employer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers. Here, for example, if the facts are as Young says they are, she can show that UPS accommodates most nonpregnant employees with lifting limitations while categorically failing to accommodate pregnant employees with lifting limitations. Young might also add that the fact that UPS has multiple policies that accommodate nonpregnant employees with lifting restrictions suggests that its reasons for failing to accommodate pregnant employees with lifting restrictions are not sufficiently strong--to the point that a jury could find that its reasons for failing to accommodate pregnant employees give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This approach, though limited to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act context, is consistent with our longstanding rule that a plaintiff can use circumstantial proof to rebut an employer's apparently legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for treating individuals within a protected class differently than those outside the protected class. <span class="Italic">See Burdine, supra</span>, at 255, n.10. In particular, it is hardly anomalous (as the dissent makes it out to be, <span class="Italic">see</span> post, at 8-9) that a plaintiff may rebut an employer's proffered justifications by showing how a policy operates in practice. In <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> itself, we noted that an employer's "general policy and practice with respect to minority employment"--including "statistics as to" that policy and practice--could be evidence of pretext. 411 U.S., at 804-805. Moreover, the continued focus on whether the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence to give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination avoids confusing the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact doctrines, <span class="Italic">cf</span>. post, at 8-10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our interpretation of the Act is also, unlike the dissent's, consistent with Congress' intent to overrule <span class="Italic">Gilbert's</span> reasoning and result. The dissent says that "[i]f a pregnant woman is denied an accommodation under a policy that does not discriminate against pregnancy, she has been <span id="Page_1007"></span>'treated the same' as everyone else." Post, at 2. This logic would have found no problem with the employer plan in <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span>, which "denied an accommodation" to pregnant women on the same basis as it denied accommodations to other employees--i.e., it accommodated only sicknesses and accidents, and pregnancy was neither of those. <span class="Italic">See</span> Part II-C, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In arguing to the contrary, the dissent's discussion of <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> relies exclusively on the opinions of the dissenting Justices in that case. <span class="Italic">See</span> post, at 6-7. But Congress' intent in passing the Act was to overrule the <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> majority opinion, which viewed the employer's disability plan as denying coverage to pregnant employees on a neutral basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this interpretation of the Act, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit must be vacated. A party is entitled to summary judgment if there is "no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). We have already outlined the evidence Young introduced. <span class="Italic">See</span> Part I-C, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Young, there is a genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Young's. In other words, Young created a genuine dispute of material fact as to the fourth prong of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Young also introduced evidence that UPS had three separate accommodation policies (on-the-job, ADA, DOT). Taken together, Young argued, these policies significantly burdened pregnant women. <span class="Italic">See</span> App. 504 (shop steward's testimony that "the only light duty requested [due to physical] restrictions that became an issue" at UPS "were with women who were pregnant"). The Fourth Circuit did not consider the combined effects of these policies, nor did it consider the strength of UPS' justifications for each when combined. That is, why, when the employer accommodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant women as well?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not determine whether Young created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether UPS' reasons for having treated Young less favorably than it treated these other nonpregnant employees were pretextual. We leave a final determination of that question for the Fourth Circuit to make on remand, in light of the interpretation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that we have set out above.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Elease S. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140731 (2017), involved a very similar factual scenario to <span class="Italic">Young</span>. The complainant, a letter carrier, advised the agency that she was pregnant and requested a light-duty accommodation. The agency denied the complainant's request, citing its policy that reserved light-duty assignments only to employees injured on the job. The complainant alleged sex and disability discrimination and identified injured on the job employees who were allowed light-duty accommodations as comparators. The administrative judge granted summary judgment in favor of the agency, concluding that employees identified by the complainant were not proper comparators because the complainant was not injured on the job. The Commission reversed that decision in <span class="Italic">Elease S.</span> in keeping with the <span class="Italic">Young</span> decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has offered proof of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case here. She demonstrated that she belongs to a protected class by virtue of being a pregnant female, she sought accommodation by requesting light duty, and the Agency does not dispute that it did not accommodate her with light duty, resulting in her taking a combination of LWOP, sick leave, and annual leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also shows that at least four Letter Carriers injured on the job were given light-duty assignments. The Agency does not dispute that these Letter Carriers were given light-duty assignments; rather, it argues that it had no legal obligation to accommodate Complainant as it did those workers because pregnancy is not an on the job injury. To the contrary, how or where the employee's limitation arose is irrelevant under the PDA and Young. The only relevant comparison is whether the pregnant worker and nonpregnant worker are similar in their ability or inability to work. <span class="Italic">Young</span>, 575 U.S. at _____, 135 S. Ct. at 1347-48, 1355. Moreover, this inquiry is satisfied if the employer has a practice or policy that indicates some class of workers are entitled to accommodations, like light duty, when pregnant workers are not provided such a benefit and are similar in their ability or inability to work. Viewed in the light most favorable to Complainant, we find there is a genuine dispute as to whether the Agency provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Complainant's.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has proffered as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reason that it did not have an obligation to accommodate Complainant with light duty because she did not sustain an on-the-job injury and, further, that there were no light-duty positions available that could have accommodated her. The Agency will need to further articulate a justification for its stated policy of not having to accommodate pregnant workers while accommodating other categories of workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the AJ should facilitate developing the record to determine whether Complainant can show pretext by demonstrating that such a policy imposes a significant burden on pregnant workers, and that the Agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is not sufficiently strong to justify the burden imposed. Complainant has pointed to the fact that the Agency accommodates Letter Carriers and other employees injured on the job, yet her request for light duty was denied. The record needs to be developed on this issue to determine whether the Agency's justifications to accommodate others but not a pregnant worker are sufficiently strong to avoid liability under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer's statement, policy, or practice that it will accommodate those injured on the job with light duty, but not those with medical restrictions arising from pregnancy, must be examined further as possible pretext for discrimination. Narrow accommodation policies that exclude employees who need accommodation because of pregnancy may constitute disparate impact discrimination, as well as disparate treatment discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, a decision without a hearing was not appropriate because genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the Agency provided more favorable treatment to some employees; further, the record needs further development for an analysis consistent with <span class="Italic">Young</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also relying on <span class="Italic">Young</span>, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Andera P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120152639 (2016), remanded the case for further investigation, finding that the record was not sufficiently developed. <span class="Italic">Andera P.</span> involved a probationary employee who received a satisfactory rating during her first month of employment with the agency. Thereafter, she disclosed her pregnancy and advised management that she would need accommodation, including time off. She took off a total of 45 hours due to illness, as indicated by leave forms. The agency terminated her for poor attendance. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Andera P.</span> provided instructive commentary on what should be included in the record in order to apply the requirements of <span class="Italic">Young</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[R]egarding the Agency's contention that Complainant was terminated in part because of her attendance, the record requires further development on whether other employees, similar in their ability or inability to work, were allowed use of leave without being terminated. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Pregnancy Discrimination and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.003, at EEOM 626:15 ("[Employer] must allow women with physical limitations resulting from pregnancy to take leave on the same terms and conditions as others who are similar in their ability or inability to work"). It is also not clear whether Complainant used leave within the guidelines of the Agency's sick leave policy because if so, she would not need to show comparative employees. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Pregnancy Discrimination and Related Issues</span>, No. 915.003, at EEOM 626:15 ("an employer could not fire a pregnant employee for being absent if her absence fell within the provisions of the employer's sick leave policy") (citing, <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Lakeshore Hosp</span>., 30 F.3d 1330, 1333 (11th Cir. 1994) ("rejecting employer's argument that plaintiff, who was discharged partly due to her use of accumulated sick leave for pregnancy-related reasons, additionally was required to show that non-pregnant employees with similar records of medical absences were treated more favorably; the court noted that an employer is presumed to customarily follow its own sick leave policy and, if the employer commonly violates the policy, it would have the burden of proving the unusual scenario"). Therefore, further development of the record and analysis is required for Complainant's pregnancy discrimination allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days of receipt of this order, the Agency shall conduct a supplemental investigation which includes the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Information probative of whether Complainant was denied accommodation for her pregnancy-related restrictions in violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Identification of comparative employees who were similar in their ability or inability to work who were provided with light duty and other accommodations;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Identification of the various categories of employees receiving accommodations, such as those receiving reasonable accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act and accommodations suffering from work-related injuries;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Information probative of whether Complainant was subjected to sex discrimination because of her pregnancy in violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in being terminated for her use of sick leave, specifically including information on what the Agency's sick leave policy is and the terms under which employees similar in their ability or inability to work were allowed to utilize leave;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Information probative of whether Complainant was denied a reasonable accommodation pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Waneta F. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120151508 (2017) (reversing and remanding for further development of the record in keeping with <span class="Italic">Young</span> with <span id="Page_1008"></span>instructive discussion of what should be included in the record and advising the complainant that she may also have a disability claim).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission similarly remanded <span class="Italic">Roxane C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120131635 (2016), for a hearing in the wake of <span class="Italic">Young</span> where the agency refused to accommodate the complainant's restrictions related to her pregnancy because there was "no light duty work available within her medical restrictions." The agency further maintained that it was not legally obligated to accommodate the complainant because pregnancy is not an on-the-job injury. The Commission found that, in light of the <span class="Italic">Young</span> decision, the administrative judge erred in the agency's motion without a hearing in <span class="Italic">Roxane C.,</span> explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The framework for analyzing a pregnancy discrimination denial of accommodation claim was solidified in <span class="Italic">Young</span> while Complainant's case was pending; therefore, a hearing is appropriate for Complainant to have the opportunity to prove her complaint in light of <span class="Italic">Young</span>. Particularly important to this framework is the fact that the Agency contended that it did not need to provide light-duty work to Complainant as it did for employees who sustained on-the-job injuries. The existence of such a distinction, work-related versus non-work-related injury, does not absolve the Agency of liability under the <span class="Italic">Young</span> framework. <span class="Italic">See Young</span>, 575 U.S. at _____, 135 S. Ct. at 1341 (reversing grant of summary judgment in favor of UPS where lower court found that plaintiff did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case because employer who fell within on-the-job injury or ADA categories were too different to qualify as "similarly situated comparators").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant offered proof of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> elements of her case. She demonstrated that she belongs to a protected class by virtue of being female, she sought accommodation by requesting light duty, and the Agency did not accommodate her, resulting in her having to take leave without pay. Complainant also pointed to four employees who were performing their jobs while seated. The Agency does not dispute that these employees were given seated positions; rather, it argues that it had no legal obligation to accommodate Complainant as it did those workers because pregnancy is not an on-the-job injury. Viewed in the light most favorable to Complainant at the summary judgment stage, there is a genuine dispute as to whether the Agency provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Complainant's.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In further support of her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, Complainant pointed to another comparator, who was pregnant and provided with light duty as an accommodation two years prior. The Agency argues that this employee was not a valid comparator because she was also in Complainant's protected class in being pregnant. However, the fact that this employee was accommodated with light duty could serve to undercut the Agency's position that it could not accommodate Complainant's restrictions, particularly in the Dump N' Cull area, the very area in which the comparator allegedly was allowed to work with the same 15-pound lifting restriction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Martin v. Winn-Dixie Louisiana, Inc</span>., No. 3:13-CV-00682-JWD-SCR, 2015 WL 5611646 (M.D). La. Sept. 23, 2015) (reasoning that the employer previously providing other pregnant women with accommodations could count against it because this indicated that the pregnancy-related restrictions in question did not affect the performance of an essential job function). It calls into question the Agency's position that the lifting restrictions and breaks could not be granted. This is accompanied by the fact that at least one supervisor, S3, allowed Complainant to work with the restrictions Complainant presented, without any issues. Finally, Complainant alleged that a manager made a comment that there were rumors that she was faking her pregnancy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has proffered as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reason that it did not have an obligation to accommodate Complainant with light duty because she did not sustain an on-the-job injury and, further, that there were no light-duty positions in which to safely accommodate Complainant's request for 15-minute breaks each hour and her 15-pound lifting restriction. The Agency will need to further articulate a justification for its stated policy of not having to accommodate pregnant workers while accommodating other categories of workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the AJ should facilitate developing the record to determine whether Complainant can show pretext by demonstrating that such a policy imposes a significant burden on pregnant workers, and that the Agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is not sufficiently strong to justify the burden imposed. Complainant has pointed to the fact that the Agency accommodates workers injured on the job and employees who are granted reasonable accommodations for disabilities, yet her request for light duty was denied. However, the record needs to be developed on this issue to determine whether the Agency's justifications to accommodate others but not a pregnant worker are sufficiently strong to avoid liability under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, Complainant's allegation that S5 asked her about rumors regarding whether she was actually pregnant should be reinstated and analyzed under a framework of hostile work environment sex and race discrimination. The claim was sufficiently related to the denial of reasonable accommodation for pregnancy-related complications, which Complainant raised with the EEO counselor. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(b) (an agency may dismiss a matter "that has not been brought to the attention of a Counselor," unless that matter is "like or related to a matter that has been brought to the attention of a Counselor"). In addition, this allegation should be analyzed to determine whether it presents evidence of a discriminatory motive by agency officials based on Complainant's pregnancy status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, a decision without a hearing was not appropriate because genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the Agency provided more favorable treatment to some employees; further, the record needs more development for an analysis consistent with <span class="Italic">Young</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Reita M. v. Agency for International Development</span>, 0120161608 (2018), involved allegations of sex-based discrimination and reprisal when, shortly after the complainant advised her supervisor of her pregnancy, her supervisor began to excessively monitor the complainant, denied her telework, and refused to renew her fellowship. Applying the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> evidentiary scheme, the Commission found that the agency had discriminated against the complainant in <span class="Italic">Reita M</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Prima Facie</span> Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant established that she belonged to a protected class upon informing her manager that she was pregnant around January 27, 2010. Complainant was subjected to adverse action when she was excessively monitored and denied telework and when her fellowship was not renewed. Employees outside of Complainant's protected class were treated differently in that none were monitored to the same degree as Complainant, and all fellowships were renewed except for Complainant's fellowship. This establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of pregnancy discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant engaged in protected activity for the first time on March 3, 2010, when she informed S2 about the inappropriate nature of Sl's comments regarding her pregnancy. Complainant engaged in additional protected activity on June 10, 2010 when she contacted an EEO Counselor alleging sex discrimination. Management was aware of Complainant's protected activity as evinced by the fact that Complainant spoke directly to S2. Complainant was subjected to adverse treatment including when her fellowship was not renewed beyond September 2010 and when her AWS day was taken away. Nexus is established because of the proximity of time between Complainant's EEO activity and the start of adverse treatment, culminating in non-renewal of her fellowship in September 2010, while she was on maternity leave. Therefore, Complainant also established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Agency's Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory, Reasons</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To successfully articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reason, "the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for" the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 255 (Noting that: "An articulation not admitted into evidence will not suffice. Thus, the defendant cannot meet its burden merely through an answer to the complaint or by argument of counsel"). The legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reason must be--clear--and "reasonably specific." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 258.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management attempted to state legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for the alleged adverse actions. S1 stated that increased scrutiny of Complainant's teleworking "was directly tied to performance issues." ROI, p. 112. Regarding removal of Complainant's AWS day, S1 stated that AWS days were taken away from the entire department because of his concerns regarding accountability. ROI, p. 114. S1 stated that he spoke to the Agency's Human Resources division and Complainant's fellowship organization prior to disallowing an AWS day. According to the Agency's FAD, by restricting and monitoring Complainant's telework, and removing AWS privileges, S1 was trying to establish a blanket policy that applied to the entire division. S1 stated that he called Complainant's March 2010 leave int() question because she did not sufficiently account for her time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding Complainant's fellowship non-renewal, the Agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons are not clear and do not appear to be supported by the investigative record submitted by the Agency. S1 stated in his deposition that the decision was based on performance issues, and that it was made by the office's Director and Deputy Director.4 However, the Agency does not point to areas in the record illustrating that Complainant was not performing well, or where S1 said in the ROI that that the fellowship was not renewed due to performance. Further, the Agency's conclusion in the FAD that the decision was based on budgetary issues and a management decision was baseless and not specific enough to be understandable, much less enabling Complainant to respond. For example, the FAD invokes a March 2012 affidavit from a previous fellow which purportedly supports the proposition that the scope of work he performed, alleged to be like Complainant's work, should not be done. FAD, p. 26.5</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1009"></span>III.&#x2003;Pretext</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant demonstrated that the Agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons were pretext for several reasons. While S1 states that he had concerns regarding accountability, evidence reveals that shortly after Complainant informed S1 of her pregnancy, he began to immediately scrutinize Complainant's activities while she teleworked. Pursuant to that scrutiny was the requirement that Complainant submit a summary of what she planned to work on each day she was requesting telework. However, the evidence reveals that while Complainant submitted extensive narratives about what she planned and accomplished, S1 still had issues with the reports and would ask for further information. S1's requests were cumbersome to the degree that they could not be reasonably satisfied. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., ROI, p. 123-131. Even when Complainant clearly met the reporting requirements, she was accused of not meeting them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, regarding accountability while teleworking between March 24-26, 2010, Complainant established that S1 knew that she worked more than 8 hours a day, but he still asked her to take leave and did not approve all of her work hours. This is demonstrated via correspondence between Complainant and S1 regarding the extent of work on the dates in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, while S1 removed AWS days for the entire division, the evidence reveals that only Complainant and other employees with EEO activity were affected. S1 also left open the possibility that he could approve AWS days on an individual basis, but when Complainant asked for an AWS day, S1 denied it, citing lack of coverage for Complainant. Further, when Complainant asked what information S1 had to overcome the presumption that she would not be able to fulfill her duties while taking an AWS day, S1 did not have a response to her request. ROI, p. 164. Rather, S1's response was speculative and concluded that while AWS has not affected Complainant's productivity, his decision was based on whether work requirements would be met. ROI, p. 164. E-mails and other documents produced, along with testimony from Complainant's co-workers, establish that there would not have been an issue with Complainant having an AWS day and that Complainant's work requirements were being met. Further, S1 also stated that AWS was being removed over concerns regarding accountability, but Complainant demonstrated that she was responsive and accountable for work while using workplace flexibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, Complainant was able to demonstrate pretext on the Agency's reasons for nonrenewal of fellowship, even though the Agency did not properly state legitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons. Regarding S1's assertion that Complainant had performance issues, there are actually no documented instances of a performance issue with Complainant's work. Rather, the documents reveal that S1 suspected that Complainant was underreporting her leave on days she teleworked, and proceeded to contact Human Resources and her fellowship organization inquiring about what actions can be taken. However, there is no evidence that Complainant failed to turn in an assignment or performed poorly in any of her work. Additionally, management offered inconsistent explanations regarding why Complainant's fellowship was not renewed beyond 2010. S2 stated that there was no other reason than the office's needs being different that Complainant's fellowship was not renewed beyond a six-month time frame. Taft Dep., 139. Also, testimony provided from a co-worker, El, tends to establish that there were no issues with Complainant's performance. El stated that she worked with Complainant on several assignments and found Sl's statement to be wholly inaccurate. ROI, p. 194.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that Complainant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that she was subjected to sex (pregnancy) and reprisal discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lois G. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2019000920 (2020), affirmed a finding of no discrimination where the complainant failed to disclose her pregnancy on a pre-employment medical questionnaire. Shortly after her start date, the complainant informed management that she had just become aware that she was six months pregnant and could not "do any heavy lifting, pushing or pulling." The agency requested supporting medical documentation of her pregnancy, but the complainant did not comply and was terminated. The Commission found that the agency provided a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the termination in <span class="Italic">Lois G.:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) requires that an agency treat women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions the same for all employment-related purposes, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to do work. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e(k) (1994). Thus, a complainant alleging that the denial of an accommodation for a pregnancy-related condition constituted disparate-treatment sex discrimination may state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that: (1) she belongs to the protected class; (2) she sought accommodation; (3) the agency did not accommodate her; and (4) that the agency did accommodate others "similar in their ability or inability to work." <span class="Italic">Young v. United Parcel Service</span>, 575 U.S. 206, 229 (2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency may then seek to justify its refusal to accommodate the complainant by relying on "legitimate, nondiscriminatory" reasons for denying her accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing, <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973)). "That reason normally cannot consist simply of a claim that it is more expensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the category of those ('similar in their ability or inability to work') whom the employer accommodates." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The complainant may then show that the agency's reasons are pretextual, which can be done "by providing sufficient evidence that the employer's policies impose a significant burden on pregnant workers, and that the employer's 'legitimate, nondiscriminatory' reasons are not sufficiently strong to justify the burden, but rather--when considered along with the burden imposed--give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Young</span>, 575 U.S. at 229.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that Complainant established all four prongs of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of pregnancy discrimination, the Agency articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. In so finding, we note that the SDO specifically explained that Complainant failed to provide the requested medical documentation and was given three weeks to provide the documentation. ROI, at 158. MDO1 also explained that Complainant was dishonest when she checked "no" on the Medical Questionnaire answering that she did not have any physical or medical limitations that would interfere with her ability to perform the duties of the offered Support Processing Clerk position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 150.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that Complainant has failed to establish that the Agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions were pretext for discrimination based on her pregnancy. In so finding, we note that the record reflects that Complainant did not inform the Agency of her pregnancy and her need for accommodation until shortly before her starting date. Moreover, at no time did Complainant provide the Agency with medical documentation regarding any medical restrictions related to her pregnancy. We specifically note that a week after reporting for duty on November 13, 2017, Complainant emailed HR on November 20, 2017, writing that she was six months pregnant and could not do any heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling. But she did not provide the Agency with medical documentation describing what duties should could perform relating to her physical limitations regarding her pregnancy. Complainant moreover has not identified any pregnancy-related conditions that could constitute a disability. Furthermore, we find that Complainant was provided with sufficient time to provide such documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is also no dispute that Complainant was five to six months pregnant when she checked "no" on the Medical Questionnaire answering that she did not have any physical or medical limitations that would interfere with her ability to perform the duties of the offered Support Processing Clerk position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that Complainant averred that she was "very pregnant" when she reported for work in November 2017. ROI, at 7. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A40636 (July 7, 2005) (finding no discrimination when the agency terminated complainant for providing false information on her employment application's Medical History Questionnaire). We therefore find that Complainant has not established that the Agency's actions herein were motivated by unlawful discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span>.</p>
