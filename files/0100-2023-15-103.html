<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-101"><span class="space">A.</span> DISCOVERY SCOPE AND PROCEDURES</h3>
<p class="noindent">For the uninitiated, some discussion of the general methods of discovery is in order. Discovery methods are defined in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Most federal administrative agencies, including the EEOC, are not bound by the Federal Rules but look to them for guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The scope and method of discovery as defined by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are reviewed below. It should be noted that the time limits referred to in those rules are not necessarily the same time limits adopted by the EEOC to govern its discovery procedures, although the 1999 revisions to MD-110 have brought EEOC discovery deadlines more in line with the federal rules. MD-110 sets out the basic time limits for discovery at 7-23 to 7-24. The parties are required to initiate discovery within 20 days of receipt of the acknowledgment order issued by the administrative judge, unless a different time period is established by the judge in the acknowledgment order. As noted above, the parties generally must initiate discovery on their own after receipt of the acknowledgment order, unless the order specifically advises the parties to seek the authorization of the administrative judge prior to initiating discovery. MD-110 at 7-22. If the judge requires the parties to seek advance authorization to conduct discovery, the request must specify the method and scope of discovery and the relevance of the requested discovery to the complaint. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Under the 1992 version of MD-110, all discovery was required to be completed within 90 days of Commission's receipt of the request for a hearing, unless the administrative judge granted an extension of that time period. No specific time limit for discovery is mandated. Instead, the administrative judge assigned to the case has the discretion to establish the time in which discovery must be completed. MD-110 at 7-20. This certainly makes more sense than a blanket rule on the time for discovery. Cases vary in complexity, and consequently the amount of discovery required is not the same for every case. Under the new guidance, administrative judges can assess every case, and determine an appropriate time period for discovery. The administrative judge also retains the authority to modify the time frame for discovery as necessary. In some cases, particularly those that are complex legally or factually, the judge may require the parties to submit preliminary witness lists and then hold a conference to discuss each party's proposed discovery and establish a time frame for completion of discovery.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at 4-4 to 4-5 further clarifies the discovery time frames and the judge's discretion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Acknowledgment and Order provides for discovery to be completed within ninety days of receipt of the order. The discovery period should remain ninety days except where, in a particular case, the Administrative Judge determines that a different time frame for discovery is required to protect the interests of a party or when such a change would materially expedite the completion of the hearing process. If a party requests an alternative schedule, the Administrative Judge should consider the complexity of the case, the relevant concerns of the parties, and the 180-day time limit for issuing a decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Judge, the exchange of requests for written discovery (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admissions) must be made within twenty days of the start of the authorized discovery period. EEO MD-110, 7-19. Failure to initiate written discovery within the first twenty days may be deemed a waiver of the right to pursue discovery.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote, the Commission indicates the administrative judge has the discretion to stay discovery if the parties are engaged in alternative dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the acknowledgment order is received a party has 20 days to serve the specific discovery requests upon the opposing party, unless the administrative judge provides a different time frame. The opposing party must respond within 30 days, unless otherwise ordered by the administrative judge. MD-110 at 7-24. This represents an extension over the 15-day response period provided for in the 1992 version of MD-110 and is consistent with the response period under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Given the crowded dockets of EEOC administrative judges and the fact that cases will generally spend several months in the prehearing stage, it simply is a more reasonable approach to discovery.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has specifically defined what it means by a discovery response in MD-110 at 7-24:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless otherwise ordered, the opposing party/representative must serve his/her response to the request for discovery within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of service of the request. If service of the request was by mail, the opposing party/representative may add three days to the date that the response is due. A response means:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Compliance with the request;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Voluntary cooperation with discovery requests is encouraged;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Written opposition to the request/motion for a protective order;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Such opposition shall set forth a basis for finding that the request is irrelevant, overburdening, repetitious, or privileged;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;Written agreement or stipulation obviating the request;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Stipulations of fact are favored as a means of resolving discovery issues;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">d.&#x2003;Request for extension of time;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Request for extension of time to comply or to produce a written agreement shall not exceed 15 calendar days.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the Commission does not list failing to respond as an option.</p>
<p class="noindent">Any motion to compel discovery must be filed within 10 days of the expiration of the time period for responding. Any opposition to the motion to compel must be filed within 10 days. The administrative judge is required to rule on the motion to compel expeditiously. <span class="Italic">See</span> MD-110 at 7-25. Under the 1992 version of MD-110, the administrative judge was required to rule within 10 days of receipt of any opposition. Because administrative judges rarely issued rulings within 10 days, the strict time frame was abandoned in favor of the more flexible <span id="Page_490"></span>"expeditious" standard. Compliance with any order compelling discovery must be within 15 days, though the administrative judge can establish a different time frame, usually shorter, for compliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> MD-110 at 7-26.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the 1992 version of MD-110, some of the EEOC's district offices routinely departed from the procedures set forth in MD-110. For example, some offices abandoned any attempt to interject themselves into discovery unless necessary; some offices did not require the parties to seek authorization to conduct discovery. Rather, they expected the parties to proceed with discovery and involve the administrative judge only if disputes arose. There was nothing wrong with this policy. As noted above, it is the preferred policy of courts and most administrative adjudicators and it is the policy adopted under the 1999 version of MD-110. The problem primarily was one of having a uniform set of rules that was ignored by some district offices and judges. The ultimate result was to defeat the purpose of a uniform set of rules--the parties were left with no real guidance as to the proper procedure before any particular judge. The Commission, with its 1999 regulation and policy changes, has come a long way in standardizing its discovery procedures. That goal was further advanced in July 2002 with the publication of the <span class="Italic"><a href="https://deweypub.com/store/media/EEOC_Administrative_Judges_Handbook.pdf">Handbook for Administrative Judges</a></span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission does not rigidly follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but it does look to the rules for guidance. Throughout the discussion of discovery, reference is made to the federal rules and, where applicable, portions of the rules are reproduced. A word of caution, however, about the rules, they are amended on a fairly frequent basis. Prior to relying on the version of the rules reproduced in this book in submissions in particular cases, the reader is urged to check a current edition of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to insure accuracy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic scope of discovery is set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b), which provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Discovery Scope and Limits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;In General.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. All discovery is subject to the limitations imposed by Rule 26(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;Limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By order, the court may alter the limits in these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories or the length of depositions under Rule 30. By order or local rule, the court may also limit the number of requests under Rule 36. The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under these rules and by any local rule shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues. The court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable notice or pursuant to a motion under Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Trial Preparation: Materials</span>. Subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)(4) of this rule, a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under subdivision (b)(1) of this rule and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party's representative (including the other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has been made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by the party....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Trial Preparation: Experts</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial. If a report from the expert is required under subdivision (a)(2)(B), the deposition shall not be conducted until after the report is provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;A party may, through interrogatories or by deposition, discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial, only as provided in Rule 35(b) or upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;Unless manifest injustice would result, (i) the court shall require that the party seeking discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery under this subdivision; and (ii) with respect to discovery under subdivision (b)(4)(B) of this rule shall require the party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Claims of Privilege or Protection of Trial Preparation Materials.</span> When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable under these rules by claiming that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation material, the party shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced or disclosed in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the purpose of discovery is the disclosure of relevant information and not its concealment. Indeed, recent revisions to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) require the mandatory disclosure of certain information to an opposing party prior to the initiation of discovery.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of the requirement that agencies investigate complaints of discrimination and the fact that the investigation record is automatically part of the hearing record, the scope of discovery may be more narrow in EEOC cases than in regular civil litigation. Also, under the 1991 Civil Rights Act, a successful complainant now may recover expert witness fees, so note should be taken of the discovery provisions regarding expert witnesses. These provisions could be of particular use in cases under the Rehabilitation Act where medical testimony often is paramount, and in cases where compensatory damages are sought.</p>
<p class="noindent">Rule 26 also provides for the issuance of protective orders to insulate parties from overly burdensome discovery. The provisions of the rule may prove useful in helping the parties and the administrative judge to impose reasonable parameters on discovery:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Protective Orders. Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, accompanied by a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action, and for good cause shown, the court in which the action is pending or alternatively, on matters relating to a deposition, the court in the district where the deposition is to be taken may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following: (1) that the disclosure or discovery not be had; (2) that the disclosure or discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place; (3) that the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking the discovery; (4) that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be limited to certain matters; (5) that discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court; (6) that a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of the court; (7) that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a designated way; (8) that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery....</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has specifically authorized its judges to issue protective orders. MD-110 at 7-20.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is within the sound discretion of the administrative judge to limit the scope of discovery. An administrative judge does not abuse her discretion in declining to allow a complainant to conduct discovery designed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where the agency has already articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <span class="Italic">Germano v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984320 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">Rule 26 also has provisions relating to the supplementation of discovery responses:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Supplementation of Responses</span>. A party who has made a disclosure under subdivision (a) or responded to a request for discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or correct the disclosure or response to include information thereafter acquired if ordered by the court or in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_491"></span>(1)&#x2003;A party is under a duty to supplement at appropriate intervals its disclosures under subdivision (a) if the party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing. With respect to testimony of an expert from whom a report is required under subdivision (a)(2)(b) the duty extends both to information contained in the report and to information provided through a deposition of the expert, and any additions or other changes to this information shall be disclosed by the time the party's disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3) are due.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Neither the Commission's regulations nor its discovery guidance at MD-110 requires the supplementation of discovery responses. However, many representatives include the duty to supplement discovery responses as part of the instructions in their discovery requests. It is worth noting that under Part 1613, if discovery was permitted by the administrative judge and discovery responses were supplied, the parties had an obligation to supplement any responses as necessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mosley v. Attorney General</span>, 05870529 (1988) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(2)(B)). Under 1614, there is nothing improper about either party requesting that discovery responses be supplemented as information becomes available, and both parties should be responsive to such requests.</p>
