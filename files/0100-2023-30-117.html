<h3 class="h3" id="sec21-114"><span class="space">H.</span> COMMISSION TRILOGY ON DAMAGES</h3>
<p class="noindent">In July 1995, the Commission started to give some affirmative guidance on damages in its case law. In three cases--<span class="Italic">Rountree, Carpenter</span> and <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>--the Commission issued compensatory damage awards that began to establish not only the substantive case law the Commission would apply to damage cases, but also began to give some substance to the amount of awards under the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The three cases are presented in substantial detail below because they have formed, and will no doubt continue to form, the basis for many of the Commission's decisions on damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01941906 (1995), the Commission awarded $8,030 in compensatory damages. However, the Commission failed to award any monies for most of the pain, suffering, and other claimed emotional harm, on the basis that the complainant had not demonstrated a causal connection between the discrimination and all of the claimed harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying heavily upon guidance issued in "Compensatory and Punitive <span id="Page_1807"></span>Damages Available Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991," EEOC Notice No. N 915.002 (July 14, 1992), the Commission in <span class="Italic">Rountree</span> began to set out some of basic guidance on compensatory damage awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Compensatory damages may be awarded for past pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and non-pecuniary losses which are directly or proximately caused by the agency's discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at p. 8. Pecuniary losses are out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of the employer's unlawful action, including job-hunting expenses, moving expenses, medical expenses, psychiatric expenses, physical therapy expenses, and other quantifiable out-of-pocket expenses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Past pecuniary losses are pecuniary losses that are incurred prior to the resolution of a complaint via a finding of discrimination, the issuance of a full-relief offer, or a voluntary settlement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8-9. Future pecuniary losses are losses that are likely to occur after resolution of a complaint. Id at 9. Non-pecuniary losses are losses that are not subject to precise quantification including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing, and loss of health. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[C]ompensatory damage awards must be limited to the sums necessary to compensate [a complainant] for actual harm, even if the harm is intangible."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 13. Thus, a compensatory damages award should reimburse a complainant for proven pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and non-pecuniary losses. A complainant has a duty to mitigate his or her pecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 9. If a respondent can prove that a complainant failed to exercise reasonable diligence to mitigate pecuniary damages, the damages award should be reduced to reflect all losses that could have been avoided with reasonable diligence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 9-10. There are no precise formulas for determining the amount of damages for non-pecuniary losses. Damages awards for nonpecuniary losses that have been assessed by juries and courts have varied significantly. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13. However, an award of compensatory damages for non-pecuniary losses, including emotional harm, should reflect the extent to which the respondent directly or proximately caused the harm and the extent to which other factors also caused the harm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 11-12. An award of compensatory damages for non-pecuniary losses should also reflect the nature and severity of the harm and the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 14.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission began the process of differentiating between awards for pecuniary damages and awards for nonpecuniary damages, such as pain and suffering. Causation started to emerge as an important element in establishing the right to damages. Moreover, the Commission made clear that compensatory damages are awarded for harm caused by the agency's acts of discrimination and not for harm, real or imagined, caused by how an agency subsequently litigates its case. Nor is an agency liable for the harm a complainant causes others because of his own emotional distress. For example, in <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, the Commission found it would be violative of public policy to award the complainant damages for abusing his wife and child allegedly as a result of his distress over a discriminatory performance appraisal. Finally, the Commission drew some distinctions between claims for relief that involve compensatory damages, as opposed to claims that involve equitable relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission delineated several factors in placing a value on emotional distress, including the nature and severity of the distress and any related symptoms, recent jury and court awards in cases involving similar injuries, the duration of the distress, the duration the distress is expected to continue, and the extent to which the distress is caused by factors other than discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that pecuniary damages could be apportioned. In <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, the Commission approved an award for only one-half of the cost of therapy sessions after finding that discrimination was only partially the cause of the complainant's distress. The Commission also set a low nonpecuniary damage award because factors other than discrimination caused much of the harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the final agency decision denied appellant's request for compensatory damages and additional equitable relief based on findings that appellant failed to prove causation. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the final agency decision in part and reverse the final agency decision in part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Non-pecuniary Damages Awarded</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final agency decision denied appellant damages for emotional distress and depression based on a finding that appellant's symptoms were caused by the EEO complaint process, not the discriminatory performance rating. We agree with the agency that compensatory damages are not available for emotional distress and depression caused by the stress of participating in the EEO process<span class="Italic">. See Raymond Appleby v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933897 (March 4, 1994) (compensatory damages were added to the statutes to address how an agency treats an employee or applicant in an employment-related context, not how an agency litigates an EEO complaint during the administrative process). However, we do not agree with the agency that all of appellant's symptoms were due to the stress of participation in the EEO process. Based on appellant's affidavit and the statements of agency employees described above, we find that appellant's stress-related symptoms were due, in part, to the initial discrimination; in part, to the stress of participating in the EEO process; and, in part, to appellant's perception that agency officials were harassing him in the workplace in reprisal for his participation in the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant indicated in his affidavit that as result of being discriminated against, as well as his being in the EEO process, he has had to endure emotional changes brought on by stress. Although the sleep disturbances reported by appellant began when he first contacted an EEO counselor, appellant contacted the EEO counselor soon after learning of the discriminatory performance appraisal rating. Appellant's additional mental distress and depression (as evidenced by increased fatigue, increased irritation, decreased ability to concentrate at work, decreased physical activity, decreased libido, and weight gain), and the decreased enjoyment of life which flowed from these, began in early December 1992, more than six weeks after appellant filed his formal EEO complaint. Appellant indicated that in early December 1992, he learned that the agency was not going to settle his complaint and that because of the low performance appraisal rating he would not receive approximately $1000 in bonus pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Psychologist indicated in his letter of September 12, 1993, that appellant had exhibited all the classic symptoms of depression. The Psychologist did not express an opinion as to the cause of appellant's depression; however, he indicated that appellant attributed his depression and anxiety to work incidents beginning in September 1992. The Psychologist also indicated that appellant was very tense and that most of the time his mind was focused on the events leading to his EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that some of appellant's emotional distress, including feelings of inadequacy and failure and depression were the result of the discriminatory performance appraisal and the denial of bonus pay based on that appraisal. Accordingly, we award compensatory damages for that part of appellant's emotional distress and depression that is attributable to the discriminatory performance appraisal and the resultant denial of bonus pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that appellant proved that the above-described emotional distress and related symptoms were caused, in part, by the discriminatory performance appraisal and the resultant denial of bonus pay, we must next determine the amount of compensatory damages to be awarded for that harm. In determining the amount of a compensatory damages award we are guided by the principle that a compensatory damages award is limited to the sums necessary to compensate him for the actual harm caused by the agency's discriminatory action<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Notice No. N 915.002 (July 14, 1992) at 13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to provide a reasonable award of compensatory damages for emotional distress and related symptoms caused by the discriminatory act, we first look to the nature and severity of appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms. We consider fairly recent jury and court awards in cases in which the harm to the plaintiff was similar in nature and severity to appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms. We also consider the duration and expected duration of appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms. We consider the extent to which appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms were caused by factors other than the discriminatory act of the agency<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Notice No. N 915.002 (July 14, 1992) at 10, n.13, 11-12, 14. Finally, after considering all of these factors, we decide a reasonable dollar value to compensate appellant for that portion of his emotional distress and related symptoms that were caused by the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, appellant avers that he experienced depression; feelings of inadequacy and failure; increased fatigue; increased irritation; decreased ability to concentrate at work; decreased physical activity; decreased libido; weight gain; and decreased enjoyment of life. Although appellant represented that his depression was severe, the Psychologist diagnosed appellant's condition as dysthymia which, by definition, does not include a major depressive episode.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fairly recent jury and court awards for emotional distress or mental anguish which did not include major depression have varied considerably, ranging from $500 to $100,000<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Fleming v. County of Kane, State of Illinois</span>, 898 F.2d 553, 562 (7th Cir. 1990) (jury award of $120,000 reduced to $40,000 for embarrassment, humiliation, severe headaches, sleeplessness, and depression following a termination); <span class="Italic">Wulf v. City of Wichita</span>, 883 F.2d 842, 874-875 (10th Cir. 1989) (jury award of $250,000 award remanded for reconsideration and an award of damages no greater than $50,000 for anger, depression, anxiety, frustration and emotional strain following a termination); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Pool Mortgage Co.</span>, 868 F.2d 1178, 1180 (10 Cir. 1989 ($24,421 award for depression, muscle spasms, stomach pain, and hair loss following a termination); <span class="Italic">Kuntz v. City of New Haven</span>, 3 AD Cases 1590, 1592 (D.C. Conn.) ($500 award for emotional distress based on testimony that plaintiff was "disappointed," <span id="Page_1808"></span>"cranky" with family and friends, "embarrassed" at not having been promoted, and had many sleepless nights), <span class="Italic">aff'd without opinion</span>, 29 F.3d 622 (2d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom., City of New Haven v. Kuntz</span>, 155 S. Ct. 667 (1979); <span class="Italic">McClam v. City of Norfolk Police Department, et al.</span>, 877 F. Supp. 277, 284 ($15,000 award for 18 months of headaches, lowered self esteem, and changes in attitude and devotion toward job following repeated denials of job transfer requests); <span class="Italic">Boyce v. Board of Commissioners of Dickinson County</span>, 857 F. Supp. 794 (D. Kan. 1944) ($50,000 award for emotional pain, suffering and mental anguish due to a hostile work environment); and <span class="Italic">Willson v. Shannon</span>, 857 F. Supp. 34, 37 (S.D. Tex. 1994) ($100,000 award for mental anguish due to reprisal for filing a discrimination complaint); and <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Philadelphia Electric Co.</span>, 709 F. Supp. 98, 104 (E.D. PA. 1989) ($10,000 for mental anguish following the denial of a promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to compensate only for actual harm, we must consider the actual and anticipated duration of the harm<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Notice No. N 915.002 (July 14, 1992), at 14. In the instant case, the agency notified appellant that it would remedy the discriminatory performance appraisal and provide the bonus pay by decision of August 23, 1993, almost one year after appellant's sleep loss began and almost nine months after appellant's remaining symptoms began. The record contains no evidence that any emotional harm attributable to the discriminatory performance appraisal rating and denial of bonus pay was likely to extend beyond the date appellant received notice of the agency's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We consider the extent to which appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms were caused by the agency's discrimination. According to appellant's affidavit, he was distressed because his performance was wrongfully rated "fully successful" instead of "superior" based on discriminatory factors. Appellant was also concerned that he would not be able to successfully compete for an anticipated supervisory vacancy in his unit because his performance was rated lower than that of his two coworkers. In addition, appellant was distressed because he was denied bonus pay based on the discriminatory appraisal. The lack of availability of the bonus pay during the holiday season caused additional feelings of inadequacy, embarrassment, and failure. However, according to the statements of agency employees and the Psychologist, appellant indicated that he was distressed by the agency's allegedly on-going unjust actions and by the EEO process. Appellant also indicated in his request for sick leave compensation that the sick leave was used to cope with pressure, stress, anxiety, and harassment during the pursuit of his EEO complaints. The record indicates that appellant used over 100 hours of sick leave from January through June 1993, but only 17 and 1/2 hours of sick leave from September through December 1992. Based on all of this evidence, we conclude that most of appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms stemmed from factors other than the agency's discrimination in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above considerations, including the nature and severity of harm to appellant, the actual duration of the harm, and the fact that only a part of appellant's harm was attributable to the discriminatory "fully successful" performance appraisal rating and denial of bonus pay, we find that an award of $8,000 in compensatory damages for appellant's proven non-pecuniary loss is reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Non-pecuniary Damages Denied</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the final agency decision that appellant failed to prove that the discriminatory performance appraisal was the direct or proximate cause of appellant's other non-pecuniary losses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant represented in his statement that as coworkers and friends became aware of his EEO complaint, their treatment of him changed. Appellant indicated that in response to their attitudes and statements, he began to feel alienated, ostracized, paranoid, guilty, and anxious. However, there is no evidence in the record that the agency informed appellant's coworkers and friends that appellant had filed an EEO complaint. On the contrary, the statements of four employees indicate that appellant, not the agency, told the employees that he had filed an EEO complaint. There also is no evidence in the record that any agency action was a factor in the reported changes in the coworkers' behaviors. Therefore, we find that any change in the coworkers' behaviors stemmed from appellant's and not the agency's actions. It also appears that appellant and not the agency informed his coworkers and friends that he had received only a "Fully Successful" performance appraisal. Given the evidence of record, we do not attribute any damage to appellant's reputation at work to the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also represented that he began to distrust whites whom he perceived as the transgressors responsible for his plight and to feel that all whites were against him. Appellant indicated that he began to argue with whites at work and eventually was arrested for assaulting a white department store manager. Appellant further represented that he no longer goes to church. Appellant presented no medical evidence that there was a causal relationship between the discriminatory performance appraisal and denial of bonus pay and appellant's distrust and hostility towards all whites. There also is no indication in the DSM-III-R's description of dysthymia that such generalized distrust and hostility are symptomatic of dysthymia. Appellant has presented no other evidence from which we can conclude that the discriminatory performance appraisal, the denial of bonus pay, and the resultant mental distress and depression were the direct or proximate cause of appellant's hostility towards all whites.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find no persuasive evidence in the record that the discriminatory performance appraisal, the denial of bonus pay, and the resultant mental distress and depression caused appellant to verbally and physically abuse his wife and child. Appellant presented no medical evidence that there was a causal relationship between the discriminatory performance appraisal and the denial of bonus pay and his verbal and physical abuse of his wife and child. There also is no indication in the DSM-III-R's description of dysthymia that either violent or abusive behavior is symptomatic of dysthymia. Furthermore, even if appellant could establish a causal linkage between the agency's discrimination and his abuse of his wife and child, it would be contrary to the public's interest in the prevention of violence to reward appellant for his violent behavior by granting him monetary damages for his abuse of his wife and child. It also appears that appellant's loss of consortium stemmed primarily from appellant's abuse of his wife. For this reason we do not award appellant damages for loss of consortium.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that appellant failed to prove he was entitled to compensatory damages for the injury to his reputation in community and personal life that stemmed from his hostility towards whites and from his abuse of his wife and child. As discussed above, appellant failed to prove that the hostility and abuse stemmed from the discriminatory performance appraisal, the denial of bonus pay, and the resultant mental distress and depression. In addition, we find that any adverse impact on appellant's credit history and appellant's inability to send his child to a private school stemmed from his wife's loss of her job and not from the discriminatory performance appraisal, the denial of bonus pay, and the resultant mental distress and depression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Pecuniary Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With one exception, we agree with the final agency decision that appellant did not establish that he was entitled to any additional compensatory damages for pecuniary losses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant requested compensatory damages for the past and future loss of his wife's contribution to the household. He also sought damages for additional losses that stemmed for his wife's job loss. These losses included late mortgage payment charges, additional credit card interest payments, and appellant's inability to refinance his mortgage at a more favorable rate. We find that appellant failed to prove that but for the discriminatory performance appraisal, denial of bonus pay, and the resultant mental stress and depression, his wife would not have lost her job. The record establishes that appellant's wife lost her job for refusing to work as scheduled. Appellant represents that his wife did not want to leave their son alone with him because he began to whip and spank the son for little or no reason in March 1993. However, appellant's wife indicated that she began to avoid weekend work in February, not March, 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find insufficient evidence in the record on which to base an award of compensatory damages for the adverse side effects of appellant's anti-depressant medication. The record does not establish how long appellant took the medication and does not indicate that appellant ever informed his physician of any adverse side effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also requested $277 for medical bills. However, the only proof of medical expenses submitted by appellant was proof of $60 in out-of-pocket payments for four visits to the Psychologist. The final agency decision correctly observes that, according to appellant, the impetus for seeking professional counseling was to keep his wife from leaving him. This impetus is further shown by the fact that appellant stopped seeing the Psychologist once his wife left him, even though appellant had not completed treatment. There also is no evidence in the record that appellant's wife chose to leave him because of the discriminatory performance rating, the denial of the bonus based on the discriminatory rating, or the mental distress, depression, and physical symptoms that flowed from the discriminatory rating and denial of bonus pay. However, the record also establishes that the Psychologist diagnosed appellant's dysthymia and provided appellant counseling regarding his dysthymia, a condition we have found to be caused, in part, by the agency's discriminatory action. Under these circumstances we find a sufficient causal relationship between appellant's receipt of medical treatment and the agency's discriminatory action to award appellant compensatory damages for 1/2 of his out-of-pocket costs for the Psychologist's services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Additional Equitable Relief</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant requested $2,823.17 for 118.5 hours of sick leave used to cope with pressure, stress, anxiety, and harassment during the pursuit of his EEO complaints. Appellant's request for compensation for leave taken due to emotional distress is a claim for equitable relief, not compensatory damages<span class="Italic">. Robbie McGowan-Butler v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC <span id="Page_1809"></span>Request No. 05940636 (September 9, 1994). Appellant submitted sick leave request forms for 118.5 hours of sick leave taken from September 22, 1992 through June 30, 1993. However, appellant did not indicate that any of this sick leave was taken in response to the discriminatory performance appraisal and the resultant denial of bonus pay. Moreover, none of appellant's sick leave in 1992 was taken in close proximity to the dates when appellant learned of the discriminatory performance appraisal on September 9, 1992, or the denial of bonus pay in early December 1992. Appellant took 3 hours of sick leave on September 22, 1992, 5 and 1/2 hours of sick leave on November 16, 1992, and 9 hours on December 28, 1992. Based on appellant's request representations and the evidence of record, we conclude that appellant has failed to prove that his sick leave was taken in response to the discriminatory performance appraisal and the resultant denial of bonus pay. Accordingly, we do not order the restoration of sick leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also requested $30,000 for the loss of opportunities for promotion to a GM-14 position. Appellant represented that he had been placed on the best qualified list for several positions for which he had applied; he was not selected; and individuals with higher performance appraisal ratings were selected. However, the only such position specifically identified by appellant was the GM-14 position advertised under vacancy announcement 92-61JJ. The final agency decision correctly indicated that that nonselection was adjudicated and the evidence indicated that appellant's performance appraisal was not the basis for the nonselection. Appellant presented no other evidence that but for his discriminatory performance appraisal, he would have been placed on a best qualified list for any other GM-14 position, or selected for any GM-14 position. Thus, we find no basis in the record for awarding appellant a subsequent promotion with backpay as part of make-whole equitable relief for the discriminatory performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, appellant requested $10,000 for the loss of opportunity for career development training, specifically for participation in the Executive Potential Program. Appellant opined in his affidavit that the agency did not nominate him for the Executive Potential Program because of his performance appraisal rating. However, there is no evidence in the record that appellant's performance appraisal was the basis for the agency's decision not to nominate him for the Executive Potential Program. Nor is there any other evidence in the record that the agency would have nominated appellant for the Executive Potential Program if appellant had received a nondiscriminatory rating, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a "Superior" rating. Therefore, we find no basis in the record for ordering the agency to nominate appellant for the Executive Potential Program as part of make-whole equitable relief for the discriminatory performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, the Commission drew freely on federal case law involving recent damage awards. Note that it did not restrict itself to damage awards in cases involving discrimination. Instead, its focus in fixing the specific amount of damages was more in the nature of the injuries than on the specific cause of those injuries.</p>
<p class="noindent">A few weeks later the Commission issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01945652 (1995). In <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, the parties reached a settlement agreement providing that the agency would pay up to $150,000 in compensatory damages, subject to the complainant's submission of evidence on the existence and extent of the damages. The agreement further provided that the agency did not admit or concede that it engaged in discrimination. The complainant submitted a claim for more than $150,000 in damages, and the agency awarded $544 for past pecuniary damages and nothing for either future pecuniary damages or nonpecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">First, in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, the Commission addressed the question of whether pre-Act discrimination has any relevance in damage claims after <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission further notes, as a predicate to our analysis of appellant's request for compensatory damages, that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that Section 102, which authorizes, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, damages, may not be applied to cases arising prior to the November 21, 1991 effective date of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA 1991)<span class="Italic">. Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1483 (1993). We note, however, that where there is a violation that begins before the effective date of the CRA 1991 and continues after November 21, 1991, damages may be sought for the post-Act conduct. A complainant is entitled to reimbursement for all pecuniary and nonpecuniary losses incurred as a result of the post-Act discrimination. Thus, if an agency is liable for post-Act conduct, it is responsible for the damages that result from that conduct, even if the complainant was already emotionally weakened by its pre-Act conduct and the post-Act injury is greater as a result<span class="Italic">. See Hatley v. Store Kraft Mfg. Co.</span>, 859 F. Supp. 1257, 1259-60 (D. Neb 1994). Evidence of pre-Act discrimination thus is relevant in assessing the extent of post-Act injury.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, the Commission established the following general test for determining the amount of damages: the award must "not be 'monstrously excessive' standing alone and it must be consistent with similar awards made in similar cases."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission addressed a number of other issues in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>. It made clear that medical evidence is not required to establish a claim for emotional damages. Testimonial evidence can be adequate to establish both the harm and the cause. But, perhaps most significantly in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, the Commission held that it is not incumbent upon the complainant to disprove an agency's contention that his emotional distress has causes other than discrimination. Put another way, it is incumbent upon the agency to prove that the complainant's harm is caused by factors other than discrimination. The burden of proof remains upon the complainant in the first instance to demonstrate a causal connection between the harm claimed and the agency's discriminatory acts, but once this is established, the burden shifts to the agency to show there are other causes at work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also made clear that there is a distinction between compensation for loss of future earning power and front pay. The former is an appropriate element of a compensatory damage award, while front pay is an equitable remedy. However, compensation for loss of future earnings is inappropriate where, as in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, the complainant agreed to apply for disability retirement as part of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission then went on to address the specific claims for damages in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appellant's Entitlement to Compensatory Damages--Causal Connection to Agency Action.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Compensatory damages may be awarded for all post-Act pecuniary losses and for nonpecuniary losses, such as, but not limited to, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. In <span class="Italic">Carle v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (January 5, 1993), the Commission described the type of objective evidence that an agency may obtain when assessing the merits of a complainant's request for emotional distress damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[E]vidence should have taken the form of a statement by appellant describing her emotional distress, and statements from witnesses, both on and off the job, describing the distress. To properly explain the emotional distress, such statements should include detailed information on physical or behavioral manifestations of the distress, information on the duration of the distress, and examples of how the distress affected appellant day to day, both on and off the job. In addition, the agency should have asked appellant to provide objective and other evidence linking...the distress to the unlawful discrimination....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Objective evidence may include statements from the complainant concerning his/her emotional pain or suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character or reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other nonpecuniary losses that are incurred as a result of the discriminatory conduct. Statements from others, including family members, friends, and health care providers could address the outward manifestations or physical consequences of emotional distress, including sleeplessness, anxiety, stress, depression, marital strain, humiliation, emotional distress, loss of self-esteem, excessive fatigue, or a nervous breakdown. Objective evidence also may include documents indicating a complainant's actual out-of-pocket expenses related to medical treatment, counseling, and so forth, related to the injury allegedly caused by discrimination. In determining damages, the agency is only responsible for those damages that are clearly shown to be caused by the alleged discriminatory conduct, not for any and all damages in general.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">a.&#x2003;Appellant's evidence in support of his request for nonpecuniary damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this matter, appellant, who worked for the agency over twenty-five years, submitted a fifty-page, unsworn statement in support of his claim for compensatory damages. He also provided a three-page sworn declaration, statements from his wife and health care providers, as well as other documents from his physicians in support of his request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's complaints focused, in part, on the agency's requirement that he work, beginning in June 1988, in a log lodge that was marked by insect damage and infestation, rotted wood, fungus, and molds. Following his assignment to the log lodge, appellant experienced increased difficulty with breathing. Thereafter, appellant informed his supervisors of his difficulties caused by the lodge and they, according to appellant, failed to accommodate his disability, began to harass him, and took reprisal actions against him, including actions that he interpreted as threatening his continued employment with the agency. Appellant worked in and out of the log lodge until August 1990 and suffered Bronchial Asthma, "a permanent handicapping condition," caused by his assignment to the lodge, according to a workers' compensation claim that he filed. Between the late summer of 1990 and 1992, appellant apparently worked in a office with a window, but remained tasked with providing tours to agency visitors that started at the log lodge. Appellant's statement also notes that in September 1992, the agency reassigned him from his window office to a windowless inside office and that in March 1993, he <span id="Page_1810"></span>was moved again to another inside, windowless office. According to appellant's statement, this latter office had inadequate air circulation and he had difficulty breathing when the door to the office was closed. Appellant states that his use of the office exacerbated his asthma and caused him to be absent from work for two months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Statements from appellant's health care providers corroborate appellant's claim of respiratory problems. A September 15, 1993 statement from Dr. B, who holds a Diploma from the American Board of Allergy and Immunology, stated that appellant presented "extrinsic asthma in March 1990" and that its "onset was related to [appellant's] office space in a log cabin with high levels of dust, dust mites and molds--aspergillus." Dr. B noted that appellant responded well to treatment until March 1993, when he "presented with acute asthma precipitated by 'increased dust and molds due to his office renovations and inadequate air circulation.'" Dr. B also noted that appellant's medical condition "should have little impact on life activities on or off the job if he follows prescribed plan," which requires his use of an Intal Inhaler four times a day, a Ventolin Inhaler every four to six hours if needed or fifteen minutes before anticipated exposure to known precipitants, and good environmental controls. Dr. B's statement added that appellant's "continuous exposure to high levels of molds, fungus, dust, and dust mites may severely exacerbate [his] asthma to such a degree that he would be unable to work to capacity." Finally, Dr. B's statement indicated that appellant could perform the essential functions of his job as long as the agency accommodated his medical condition by providing him with a well-ventilated, air-conditioned office and a parking space near his office to minimize walking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A separate statement from a second health care provider, Dr. V, dated December 29, 1993, indicated that appellant "has sustained moderately severe medical, physical and emotional-psychological disorders," including chronic recurrent bronchial asthma and hypertension. Dr. V noted that there is an unpredictability associated with appellant's asthma, because of its relationship to environmental factors. Dr. V stated that appellants current work place environment was not conducive to his well-being and that he likely would "suffer injury or harm if he will continue in his position of record." Dr. V's statement confirmed Dr. B's opinion that an accommodation of appellant's condition would require controlling his work place environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's statement further described the stress and distress caused by agency actions. He stated that the agency's actions caused:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">irreparable harm to my emotional health and I, on a daily basis, have brought the work situation home to my family and friends. My family suffers by having to endure my heightened sensitivity and irritability. I no longer enjoy the same quality of life both on and off the job, both physically and emotionally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a separate, sworn statement, appellant stated that his "family, friend, and work relationships began to deteriorate" in the pre-Act period, beginning in June 1988, continuing into the post-Act period. He stated that he suffered "long periods of anger and self pity" and took out his pain and suffering "on the ones I love." He stated that as a result of his work-related stress, "I am non-responsive to my sexual desires," resulting "in little to no sexual activity with my wife," an inability to engage in sexual relations, and "feelings of helplessness and embarrassment." Appellant stated that prescribed medications caused intolerable side effects, that his digestive system shut down, and that he suffered from internal bleeding, hemorrhoids, and severe pain. Appellant also stated that he now suffers from Nerve Ending Dermatitis and develops hives when he becomes nervous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's wife, Mrs. C, seconded his description of their relationship, noting that "prior to his discriminatory treatment on the job, [appellant] was an ardent lover." Mrs. C stated that subsequent to his work place treatment, she and appellant attempted to engage in sexual relations only three or four times per year but appellant was physically unable to do so. She also noted that appellant became preoccupied with what was occurring at work and would discuss work place matters with her and their children to the point where the children would ask him to stop. Mrs. C stated that prior to the improper agency action, appellant often played with his children, but became increasingly withdrawn from them and treated them abruptly. She stated that as a result, the children "began to exhibit symptoms of heightened nervousness...." She further noted that over the four years that appellant was subjected to agency discrimination, harassment, and reprisal, he became "anxious, agitated, irritated, angry, and frustrated with his work environment." She noted that after he was transferred to the inside office in March 1993, which exacerbated his asthma and caused him to miss two months of work, he "cried in my arms and told me that he was having thoughts of suicide. (My daughter later told me that she was upset because she had heard daddy crying and asked if everything was alright.)" Mrs. C noted that she accompanied her husband to see Dr. V, who arranged for him to see a psychiatrist and prescribed anti-depressant medicine. Finally, Mrs. C noted that appellant suffered from "other stress-related conditions: rashes,...irregular bowel movements, digestive problems--constant heartburn and gas, sleeplessness, headaches, neck aches."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his statement, Dr. V also stated that appellant's "progressive medical condition poses a serious adverse effect to [his] life activities and interpersonal relationship both on and off job," including the development of hostile relationships with others. He stated that appellant's work situation "had created a high pressure and high tension office life initiating an emotional, behavioral and mood changes culminating in psychiatric disorder and numerous somatic complaints that make a miserable and agonizing life both on and off work." Dr. V noted that the frequent exacerbation of his asthma caused him "discouragement, loss of spirit, hopes and limited energies and opportunities." In a separate statement, dated May 14, 1993, Dr. V noted that appellant's assignment to a windowless office in March 1993 caused him to suffer a "sudden onset of symptom complex suggestive of bronchial asthma." Dr. V noted that appellant was suffering from severe respiratory distress. He further noted that appellant's condition was difficult to treat, requiring proper environmental controls at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A medical report from Dr. L-B confirms Mrs. C's statement that appellant met with a psychiatrist on March 18, 1993, following a referral from Dr. V. Dr. L-B noted that appellant reported experiencing severe panic attacks, insomnia, irregular eating habits, confusion, and difficulty concentrating. Dr. L-B's clinical impression of appellant was "hypomania," and she prescribed lithium carbonate, which is indicated in the treatment of manic episodes of bi-polar disorder. She also noted that in a return visit, he exhibited marked improvement and stated that she would "see him regularly to monitor his medication and for psychotherapy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">b.&#x2003;The Agency's Final Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its final decision, the agency awarded appellant "zero" in response to his claim for emotional distress damages. The agency stated that there was no evidence in the record indicating mental distress or psychological problems until March 1993, or over a year after he initiated the EEO process. It further discounts the statement from appellant and Mrs. C because they were not notarized and are "devoid of evidence tying the claimed incidents to [appellant's] medical visits or treatment...." It further suggests that "the amount of suffering claimed could have been reduced through interventions of mental health professionals early in the five years of complaint activity. There is no evidence of treatment for alleged deterioration of marital relationship." The agency also suggests that assuming appellant suffered the losses claimed, "evidence in the record leaves room for a possibility that the claimed injuries were caused by something other than the complaint activity." The agency discounted the corroborative value of Mrs. C's statement, noting the absence of affidavits from "objective third party witnesses about how [appellant's] emotional distress manifested in his behavior at work and/or in other environments." The agency further asserted that appellant failed to discuss other potential causes of his medical problems, such as his and his wife's smoking habits, whether he was exposed to secondary smoke, or how long he suffered from asthma prior to his assignment to the log lodge. Finally, it noted that appellant failed to provide affidavits from his treating physicians establishing a causal relationship between his medical condition and the allegations set forth in his complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">c.&#x2003;The Commission's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the record supports appellant's claim for compensatory damages, including his request for damages attendant to embarrassment, humiliation, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of health, loss of consortium, and for losses associated with other disruptions of his marital and family relationships. Although much of the agency's conduct, such as appellant's assignment to the log lodge, occurred prior to the effective date of the CRA 1991, we further find that the agency's actions continued well into the post-Act period. We also find that the agency's actions, including its decision to assign appellant to windowless offices, exacerbated his asthma in March 1993, adding to the stress and related medical, emotional, and psychological problems described in detail in his and Mrs. C's statements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we disagree with the agency that appellant failed to support his claim for compensatory damages. First, although signed affidavits might be the preferable form for statements in support of claims for nonpecuniary damages, they are not mandatory. In <span class="Italic">Carle</span>, the Commission stated that a complainant should provide a statement in support of a claim for damages. We did not require that such statements be notarized or in affidavit form. Second, we disagree with the agency's contention that the statements from appellant's health care providers are inadequate. Such statements are not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages. Courts have held that "expert testimony ordinarily is not required to ground money damages for mental anguish or emotional distress." <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co.</span>, 37 F.3d 712, 724 (1st Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">citing Wulf v. City of Wichita</span>, 883 F.2d 842, 875 (10th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Busche v. Burkee</span>, 649 F.2d 509, 512 n.12 (7th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 454 U.S. 897 (1981). Moreover, and contrary to the agency, we find sufficient <span id="Page_1811"></span>information in appellant's two statements, the statement from Mrs. C, and the statements from several of appellant's health care providers to establish the causal connections between the agency's actions and the resulting deterioration of his medical and emotional condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the agency offered no evidence that factors other than those that appellant set forth in his presentation may have caused his medical and emotional distress damages. The Commission disagrees with the agency that appellant had to prove the negative, that is, disprove the possibility of other causes of his damages. This was the agency's burden, which it failed to meet.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Commission disagrees with the agency's suggestion that appellant should have provided statements from "objective third party witnesses" to support his claim for damages. Appellant's claims for damages for loss of consortium or loss of enjoyment of family relationships may be outside the realm of third party observation. Moreover, courts consistently have made or upheld compensatory damage awards based on statements or testimony from a plaintiff alone, or from a plaintiff and other witnesses, who may include family members or health care providers or both<span class="Italic">. See Sanchez</span>, 37 F.3d at 724 and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other employment discrimination cases, federal courts have awarded compensatory damages in a wide range of amounts depending on the facts of the particular case. In <span class="Italic">Rowlett v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.</span>, 832 F.2d 194 (1st Cir. 1987), the court held that a jury's decision to award the plaintiff $123,000.00 for emotional distress was not improper based on the testimony from the plaintiff, who noted the stress caused by his discriminatory termination from the defendant, and corroboration from a psychiatrist, who also noted that the plaintiff suffered from anxiety and some depression. The court noted that the amount awarded was not "'grossly excessive' compensation for the emotional distress that would accompany several years of discrimination at work and a significant period of unemployment."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 205. In <span class="Italic">Walters v. City of Atlanta</span>, 803 F.2d 1135 (11th Cir. 1986), the court affirmed an award of $150,000.00 where plaintiff testified to a life long desire to work for the defendant and the "wear and tear" caused by the discrimination, which thwarted his repeated attempts to achieve that goal<span class="Italic">. See also Cooley v. Carmike Cinemas, Inc.</span>, 25 F.3d 1325 (6th Cir. 1994) (award of $85,000 upheld in age discrimination/termination case involving thirty-five year employee, whose own testimony, plus that of wife and son, supported the jury's decision); <span class="Italic">Kientzy v. McDonnell Douglas Corp.</span>, 990 F.2d 1051 (8th Cir. 1993) (award of $150,000.00 in sex discrimination/termination case upheld based on testimony of plaintiff and psychiatrist); <span class="Italic">Moody v. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co.</span>, 915 F.2d 201 (6th Cir. 1990) (wrongful discharge/age discrimination case in which court upheld $150,000.00 award based on testimony of plaintiff, who testified to shock, humiliation, and adverse effect on family, and of his wife, who testified that plaintiff was upset to the point of crying); <span class="Italic">Lussier v. Runyon</span>, 3 A.D. Cas. (BNA) 223 (D. Me. 1993) (award of $75,000.00 upheld where the defendant's actions "have caused severe and substantial injury to [plaintiff's] mental health, self-esteem and status within his family and the community [which] impact...is likely to stay with him the rest of his life...."); <span class="Italic">see also Turic v. Hospitality House</span>, Inc., 849 F. Supp. 544 (W.D. Mich. 1994) ($50,000.00 in sex and religion discrimination/termination case); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. AIC Security Investigations, Ltd.</span>, 823 F. Supp. 571 (N.D. Ill. 1993) ($50,000.00 in disability/termination case); <span class="Italic">McAdams v. United Parcel Service, Inc.</span>, 2 A.D. Cas. (BNA) 1489 (D. Minn. 1993) ($35,000.00 in failure to accommodate case).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Commission finds that Appellant is entitled to an award of $75,000.00 in compensatory damages for emotional distress. In making this award, the Commission recognizes that damage awards for emotional harm are difficult to determine and that there are no definitive rules governing the amount to be awarded in given cases. In this regard, the Commission finds that a proper award must meet two goals: that it not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone and that it be consistent with similar awards made in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989). Here, the Commission notes that the parties agreed that appellant could recover up to $150,000.00 in proven compensatory damages. Appellant claimed the full amount of $150,000 for damages that began occurring prior to the effective date of the CRA 1991 and we note that much of the damages about which appellant complains occurred in the pre-Act period. Nonetheless, we find that an award of half of that amount properly compensates appellant for his emotional distress damages, based on the long pattern of agency actions that resulted in causing appellant further harm, and that such an award is not excessive standing alone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Appellant's Entitlement to Past Pecuniary Losses</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant requested compensation for visits to health care providers in 1992 and 1993. In 1992, appellant asserted that he made twenty-one separate visits to health care providers and sought reimbursement of $2,243.20 in medical expenses, $112.50 for travel expenses, and $4,817.92 in sick leave (199.5 hours). In 1993, appellant listed seventeen visits and sought reimbursement of $2,009.90 in medical expenses, $112.50 for travel, and $7,462.35 in injury (249 hours) and sick leave (60 hours).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency ruled that appellant received reimbursement for 1,238 hours of sick leave upon his retirement, that he received eighteen days of leave from OWCP, and that he was reimbursed for 900 hours of leave without pay prior to his departure. The agency also ruled that appellant was entitled to reimbursement for five "documented" visits to health care providers in 1992, but limited his reimbursement to $56.00, the "cost to patient," which it set at 20% of the total cost. It further awarded him $156.98 for drugs, and $45.00 in travel costs (30 miles x six trips x .25&#x00A2;/mile), for a total of $257.98. The agency also ruled that appellant was entitled to reimbursement for six visits in 1993 ($179.90), plus $38.64 for drugs (reimbursed at 25% of documented charges), and $67.50 in travel costs (30 miles x nine trips x .25&#x00A2;/mile), for a total of $286.04. In sum, appellant sought reimbursement of $16,758.37; the agency awarded him $544.02.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant disputes the agency's assertion that it reimbursed him for the 900 hours of leave without pay. He further states that the lump sum credit for sick leave that he received upon retirement did not include credit for any of the sick leave that he claimed in his compensatory damages submission. The Commission cannot determine from the present record whose argument is correct and will remand this matter so that the agency may undertake a supplemental investigation of this matter and allow appellant an opportunity to provide proof that he did not receive all of the reimbursement for leave to which he was entitled. The agency also may supplement the record with evidence regarding its alleged prior reimbursement or payment of sick leave and leave without pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Commission finds that appellant is entitled to a greater level of reimbursement for past pecuniary damages than the agency allowed. The record in this case indicates that job-related environmental factors caused appellant to develop bronchial asthma and that other agency actions exacerbated his respiratory condition and caused him to suffer from other physical ailments. For this reason, the Commission finds that appellant should recover more for his past pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1992, appellant listed twenty-one visits to medical providers and the agency reimbursed him for five visits. Appellant's submittal indicates that he met with Dr. B on February 24 and July 17, listing charges of $150.00 for both visits. The agency reimbursed him $30.00 (20%). Dr. V's notes indicate that he met with appellant on the [several] dates....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency reimbursed appellant only for his November 17 visit, paying him $12.00, or 20% of the $60.00 documented charge. The Commission finds no basis for the agency's decision to isolate this single visit for reimbursement. The record indicates that each visit involved the same condition, that is, each related to appellant's respiratory system. The record does not indicate, however, what each visit cost and how much of that cost appellant paid.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant also listed three visits to Dr. T and one to Dr. F. The record includes documentation of his visits to Dr. T, and the agency provided compensation of $14.00, consisting of 20% of the $70.00 cost of the visits. The agency declined to compensate appellant the full $520.00 for the three visits, finding that he also met with Dr. T for a toe injury that was unrelated to the medical conditions associated with his complaint. The agency excluded appellant's visit with Dr. F. The record indicates that Dr. F conducted lab work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant is entitled to reimbursement of his out-of-pocket expenses for his treatment from Drs. B, T and V, excluding treatment for his toe injury unless appellant can demonstrate that it was related to an allegation set forth herein, plus his out-of-pocket expenses for medicine; he may not receive the full documented cost of a visit or for medicine if he received reimbursement from health insurance or if his insurer paid the provider directly. On remand and in its supplemental investigation, the agency should direct appellant to provide a full accounting of his medical expenses for the two visits with Dr. B; the ten visits with Dr. V; his visits with Dr. T concerning medical expenses for conditions related to the issues raised in this matter; and for the lab work performed by Dr. F. Appellant further is entitled to reimbursement for his travel to each of his providers using the formula set forth in the agency's final decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis concerning appellant's reimbursement claim for 1993 is the same. Appellant sought reimbursement for seventeen visits to health care providers and for medicine; the agency compensated him at 20% for three visits, at varying amounts for two visits and one drug purchase, and at 25% for two drug purchases. Appellant's compensatory damages claim identified the [several] dates of visits with Dr. V....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency compensated appellant for his visit on February 11. The Commission again finds no basis for the agency's decision to compensate appellant only for this single visit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also compensated appellant for each of his visits with Dr. B, except for an April 5 visit. The agency failed to provide a basis for its exclusion of this visit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1812"></span>The agency did not provide appellant with compensation for charges he incurred on May 25, 1993 at Greater Laurel Beltsville Hospital. Although we note that there is no information in the file concerning the nature of these charges, we find that on remand, the agency should conduct a supplemental investigation concerning these charges in order to determine whether they were related to the disputed agency actions set forth in appellant's complaints and resolved by the settlement agreement. Similarly, appellant is entitled to compensation for his visits with Drs. B and V, limited to his actual out-of-pocket expenses; for his actual out-of-pocket expenses for drugs; and for his travel expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Commission notes that appellant omitted and the agency thus did not provide reimbursement for appellant's visits to Dr. L-B. The Commission finds that appellant has waived any entitlement to recovery of expenses relative to his treatment from Dr. L-B.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Future Pecuniary Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its final decision, the agency ruled that appellant was not entitled to future pecuniary damages, asserting that the settlement provided for the award of $40,000.00, which amounted to an award of front pay, and that no additional award for future pecuniary damages was provided for or justified. The agency noted that the loss of future earning capacity was directly caused by appellant's agreement to retire.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission agrees. The Commission notes that loss of future earning capacity is not the same as front pay: an award for loss of future earning capacity concerns the effect that appellant's injury will have on his ability in the future to earn a salary comparable with what he earned before his injury. Front pay, which is an equitable remedy and thus not encompassed by the parties' agreement concerning compensatory damages, compensates an individual where s/he no longer would be able to work for the party found to be discriminating. Damages for loss of future earning capacity are generally awarded in personal injury cases, but also have been awarded in employment discrimination cases<span class="Italic">. McKnight v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 973 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 113 S. Ct. 1270 (1993), <span class="Italic">citing Morales v. Cadena</span>, 825 F.2d 1095, 1100 (7th Cir. 1987). Proof of entitlement to loss of future earning capacity involves "evidence suggesting that [an individual's] injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to him." <span class="Italic">Gorniak v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.</span>, 889 F.2d 481, 484 (3d Cir. 1989). Such evidence need not prove that the injured party will, in the near future, earn less than s/he did previously, but that "his injury has caused a diminution in his ability to earn a living."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Courts require evidence that the impairment of earning capacity "be shown with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability and there must be evidence which will permit the [factfinder] to arrive at a pecuniary value for the loss." Annotation, Evidence of Impaired Earnings Capacity, 18 A.L.R.3d 88, 92 (1968).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record indicates that appellant agreed to retire on disability when he entered into the settlement agreement. The Commission finds that his retirement precludes an award of future pecuniary damages; whatever diminution in earning capacity appellant may have suffered as a result of the agency's actions is eliminated by his disability retirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wallis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01950510 (1995), decided in November 1995, the complainant was awarded a little over $60,000 in compensatory damages: $1,690 in pecuniary damages, $8,452 in future pecuniary damages, and $50,000 in nonpecuniary damages for such things as pain, suffering, and embarrassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Wallis</span> case is significant not only for the guidance it gives on placing actual dollar amounts on compensatory damage awards, but because it also dealt with three other significant issues related to damages. First, <span class="Italic">Wallis</span> established a clear right to future pecuniary damages in cases where the discriminatory conduct of the agency is likely to have a continuing impact on the victim. Second, <span class="Italic">Wallis</span> also involved the thorny issue of whether, and to what extent, an agency is liable for aggravating a preexisting condition. The Commission held that, just as with common law torts, the agency must take the complainant as it finds him and is indeed liable for aggravating a preexisting condition. However, the liability is subject to reduction in recognition of the fact that the agency's conduct did not cause the entire injury. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, the Commission reversed its previous position adopted in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> on the so-called "collateral source" rule, finding that agencies may not deduct payments from other sources from a pecuniary damage award. For example, if medical treatment is required, the agency does not benefit from the fact that health insurance pays some portion of the expenses. The agency is liable to the complainant for the entire expense.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of the significance of <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, it is reproduced in its entirety:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 14, 1993, appellant, then a Letter Carrier, PS-5, assigned to the agency's Barrington, Rhode Island, Post Office, filed a formal complaint alleging that the agency discriminated against him based on mental disability (Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features) and reprisal (prior EEO activity) when (1) on May 27, 1993, he was issued a seven-day suspension for engaging in an altercation with another employee; (2) following the suspension, he was placed on administrative leave effective June 26, 1993, pending the outcome of a fitness-for-duty examination; and (3) when he finally returned to duty on July 12, 1993, he was read several sections of the agency's Code of Conduct. The agency conducted an investigation and provided appellant with a copy of the resulting investigative report on or about January 6, 1994.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant timely requested a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge (AJ), which was held on August 22, 1994; appellant was represented by an attorney (appellant's representative, AR). In an RD received by the agency on September 15, 1994, the AJ found no discrimination with regard to Issue 1, but found discrimination based on reprisal with regard to Issues 2 and 3. The agency officials found responsible for the acts of reprisal were the Barrington Postmaster and the Supervisor of the Barrington Post Office. Among the relief recommended by the AJ was an award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by the agency after submission of additional information by appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By final agency decision (FAD) dated September 27, 1994, the agency adopted the RD except for the award of compensatory damages. The agency referred to a "Member History Screen," showing the dates of appellant's office visits with his psychiatrist, Dr. B, and noted that the printout "fails to indicate that there was any significant increase in treatment by [Dr. B] following the incidents of June 25 and July 12, 1993. Thus, it is not evident that your pre-existing condition was exacerbated by the two incidents involving the Postal service. No evidence submitted by you establishes a requisite link between the two allegations and your Adjustment Disorder.... Your claim for compensatory damages is thus denied." It is from this decision that appellant now appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;Agency's Discriminatory Conduct</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 20, 1993, appellant and another employee (Employee A) became involved in an altercation in the workplace. On May 27, 1993, the agency notified appellant that he was to be suspended without pay for seven calendar days, from June 19 through 25, 1993; Employee A also was suspended for seven calendar days. Appellant expected to return to work on June 26, 1993. However, by letter dated June 24, 1993, the agency informed appellant that he was to be placed on administrative leave effective June 26, 1993. The letter did not explain to appellant the reason for placing him on leave. The letter informed appellant that he was to remain at home to be "fully available during...[his] normal work hours to respond to a recall back to the facility" and that "periodic inquiries" would be made to determine whether he was, "in fact, on-call and available." Agency officials proceeded to call appellant at home on at least a daily basis during his entire absence. On one occasion when appellant needed to leave the house to take his wife for medical treatment, he called the agency to provide a telephone number where he could be reached if he was needed, to maintain his on-call status; he was told, however, that he would have to take annual or sick leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By letter dated June 28, 1993, the agency informed appellant that he had been scheduled for a fitness-for-duty examination on July 1, 1993. The letter did not explain the reason for the referral, and appellant stated that he was never informed of the reason. The referral physician examined appellant on July 1, 1993, and in a report of the same date, informed the agency that appellant was fit for duty; nonetheless, appellant was not permitted to return to work until July 12, 1993. Appellant later learned that, in his absence, Employee A approached agency officials with the substantially false accusation that appellant had identified himself as fitting the profile of a "Postal killer" and had intimated that he (appellant) might shoot someone. Although circumstances reasonably should have led the officials to doubt Employee A's accusation, they instead placed appellant on administrative leave and referred him for a fitness-for-duty examination without any discussion or explanation; the accusation apparently became known to some of appellant's coworkers. The record reflects, however, that despite the fact that during the May 20, 1993, altercation, Employee A had been overheard to threaten appellant with severe bodily harm, Employee A was allowed to return to work immediately after serving his suspension, and was not referred for a fitness-for-duty examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the day appellant finally was permitted to return to work, he was made to sit in a manager's office while various portions of the agency's Codes of Conduct were read to him. Employee A was not subjected to this treatment. However, the record reveals that when agency officials were questioned about this difference in treatment, they fabricated after-the-fact documentation which falsely stated that Employee A was also read provisions of the Codes of Conduct when he returned to work from his suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;Proof of Causal Relationship and Damages Offered</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is noted that all of the evidence discussed below, with the exception of Dr. B's November 1, 1994, report, was submitted to the agency prior to the issuance of the FAD. It is further noted that appellant's psychiatric condition dates back to 1988; accordingly, some of the evidence submitted by appellant pre-dates the June 1993 administrative leave/fitness-for-duty-exam order (the AL/FFDE order) and July 1993 reading of the Codes of Conduct (the Codes reading), and will not be discussed herein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1813"></span>1.&#x2003;October 20, 1993 Medical Note</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B stated, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Over the past four weeks [appellant] has been experiencing increased feelings and symptoms of depression and anxiety resulting in a recurrence of his Depressive Disorder. This has necessitated reinstituting his antidepressant medication treatment...[Desipramine] and medication for anxiety and agitation...[Thioridazine]....Because of the nature and severity of his condition, I feel his functioning is significantly impaired, and he is unable to perform his duties at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B recommended a four-week leave of absence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;December 21, 1993 Medical Note</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B noted that appellant's medication has been reinstituted, and stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">My feeling is that this recurrence [of Depressive Disorder] is related to the same circumstances that caused these conditions initially, and is work related. Since returning to work following his reinstatement [in August 1992] from his unjust termination [in November/December 1991], he has continued to experience feelings of harassment and lack of appropriate support from management. This is reflected in an incident in which he states he was assaulted by another carrier, but ended up being unfairly suspended. He has also been suspended from the Union, again he feels unfairly, which has also been very distressing for him. As in the past, these and related incidents have caused him to experience increasing feeling[s] of frustration, helplessness and agitation, thus precipitating a relapse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;January 4, 1994 Medical Note</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B stated that appellant had a recurrence of his Depressive Disorder in November which required a leave of absence from October 18 to November 15, 1993:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">He did return to work at that time but because of the continuing stressful work situation, his condition and functioning again deteriorated. Because of this decompensation in his condition, I do not feel that he is able to perform his duties and a return to work would only cause a further worsening of his condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B recommended at least another five weeks leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;January 24, 1994 Medical Note</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B stated that appellant suffered a relapse around December 27, 1993. He further stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Appellant] continues to feel that the management will do anything to get rid of him and they are working in concert with the Union to do this. In regard to this depression, he is completely preoccupied with the constant battle that he feels he is in with the [agency] to protect his job, as well as around the litigation that he is attempting to pursue around the mistreatment he has experience[d] particularly his unjustified termination which has had a devastating [e]ffect on him. I would describe his current condition as an exacerbation of what has become an increasingly chronic and persistent disorder. I feel that his condition is clearly work related and again directly related to the persistent harassment and unjust treatment that he experiences in the performance of his postal duties, as well as his feeling of frustration and vulnerability around pursuing legal retribution for his firing.... At this time, I feel he is again totally disabled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr. B stated that appellant would require at least a five-week leave of absence "[al]though because of the rather unstable nature both of his mental status and the interaction between [appellant,] management, and the Post Office Union, it is very difficult to say when, in fact, he would be able to return to work with any consistency."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;March 17, 1994 Medical Note</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B stated that appellant's condition had not yet stabilized to the point where he felt appellant could return to work, and that he would re-evaluate appellant after another four weeks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6.&#x2003;August 25, 1994 Member History Screen printout</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The printout reveals that for 10 months prior to the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading, appellant did not see Dr. B more than once per month. Following the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading, appellant saw Dr. B: twice in July; twice in August; once in September; four times in October; four times in November; once in December; three times in January; twice in February; five times in March; twice in April; once in May; once in June; once in July; and four times in August. The printout also reveals that for four office visits appellant paid only a five dollar health insurance co-payment; for the remaining visits, appellant paid nothing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7.&#x2003;Dr. B's September 8, 1994 Affidavit</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B stated that he has been treating appellant since January 28, 1988, and that his fee is $40 per one-half hour. He stated that appellant has been diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features, and also displays characteristics and symptoms of Major Depression, Recurrent; Dr. B termed the whole condition the "Mental Disability." Dr. B stated that appellant has suffered from the Mental Disability since January 28, 1988, and will require treatment therefor for an additional 5 years. Dr. B stated that "[t]here exists a strong likelihood that [appellant's] mental disability may continue indefinitely requiring prolonged treatment if [appellant] continues contact with the [agency] under the present employment conditions." Dr. B set forth a list of symptoms appellant "experiences and will continue to experience due to his Mental Disability," including, among others, sleeping and eating disorders and sexual apathy. Dr. B stated that he has prescribed medications including Prozac, Thioridazine, Desipramine, and Xanax.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">8.&#x2003;Appellant's September 8, 1994 Affidavit and Prescription Expense Information</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant stated that he has purchased certain prescription drugs on specified occasions post-dating the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading: Prozac at $129.60 each on March 16, April 14, May 5, June 10, July 7, and August 9, 1994; Thioridazine at $6.30 on August 24, 1994; Desipramine at $30 each on October 4, November 1, November 11, and December 10, 1993, and January 14 ($25), February 7, and March 10, 1994; and Xanax at $6.50 on October 4, 1993. A computer printout and a hand-written note, apparently from a pharmacist, also shows Fluoxetine (Prozac) at $64.60 each on March 16 and April 14, 1994,6 and again at $129.60 each on May 5, June 10, July 7, and August 9, 1994; and Naproxen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for pain relief) at $10.20 on May 5, 1994. The printout further reveals, however, that for at least eleven of the prescription fulfillments, appellant paid only a $5 co-payment, the balance being paid by his health insurer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although appellant provides expense information for name-brand drugs purchased at full price, a computer-generated printout from appellant's health insurer reflects that appellant's prescriptions were filled with lower-cost, generic drugs, and that appellant typically paid only a $5 co-payment. The record reflects that appellant purchased Thioridazine at $5 on August 24, 1994. Appellant states that he paid $30 for each refill of Desipramine on October 4, November 1, November 11, and December 10, 1993, but this information is not confirmed by documentary evidence; the printout shows that he paid $5 per refill on January 14, February 7, and March 10, 1994. Appellant states that he paid $6.50 for Xanax on October 4, 1993, which is not confirmed by documentary evidence. Appellant purchased Fluoxetine (Prozac) at $5 each on March 16, April 14, May 5, June 10, July 7 and August 9, 1994; and Naproxen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for pain relief) at $5 on May 5, 1994.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant stated that he has suffered damage to his reputation "in the community"; that he has had so many absences from work that "people assume I am the problem"; he is viewed as a trouble-maker by the agency, which would cause extra scrutiny if he transferred to another facility because the district managers would be the same; both his character and reputation have been damaged, and people he has known all his life "look at me differently, as if it must be my fault that I am always having trouble with the [agency]." Appellant stated that he is "sick and exhausted" from having to continually defend himself; he is unjustly known as a troublemaker, which will cause him difficulty in finding another job with the agency; he has fewer friends, and coworkers "tend to shun" him because management has harassed the ones who have shown him support.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant stated that his 1991 termination, later reversed, caused him to have to declare bankruptcy in 1992, and prevented him from refinancing his house at a more favorable rate; he is "mentally haunted" every day; his problems with the agency have caused his wife and aged parents stress; his mother cannot stay in the same room with him, and he had to ask his father for financial help (in relation to the termination); he has become estranged from his brother, who got tired of listening to his problems with the agency, and also from his nieces and nephews; he cannot describe his anguish, he has been overwhelmed emotionally, and has "thought about ending it all."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant stated that he has been unable to enjoy vacations because he dreads the return to work; he has lost interest in sex, which has further damaged his already fragile relationship with his wife; he had to take a two-year leave of absence from his country club because he is no longer able to concentrate on his golf game, which had been his "avenue of escape."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant stated that he continues to see Dr. B. He has sleeping problems, and requires medication to get through the night, but still gets only 3 or 4 hours of sleep per night. He is so exhausted, because of the "inordinately close scrutiny" he is subject to at work, that many times he goes to bed at 6:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span>; he is so tired that he cannot work on projects around the home; his appetite fluctuates between binge-eating and not eating at all, so that his weight also fluctuates; constant anxiety has put a strain on his marriage; he has been humiliated in public and in front of coworkers for years; and he has become bitter and angry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1814"></span>9.&#x2003;November 1, 1994 Medical Report</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This report was prepared in support of appellant's disability retirement application. Dr. B noted that appellant was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder in 1988, and that appellant's history of "harassment and maltreatment" by agency officials dates back to 1986; and that appellant also suffered the onset of Major Depression in November 1991. Relevant to this case, Dr. B stated that appellant was doing well until the May 1993 suspension, after which appellant felt "that he was 'fair game for anybody'" in the workplace. Dr. B stated that appellant "continued to struggle while doing his job with these feelings but in October 1993, he learned that he was suspended from the Post Office Union, and this resulted in another relapse of his Depressive Disorder...." Dr. B stated that appellant's medications were restarted/increased after this.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B discussed subsequent events at work, attributed appellant's psychiatric difficulties to his entire history of problems with agency management, then concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Appellant] continues to be out of work, and he continues to be quite devastated by this whole process; [t]hat even when some decisions go in his favor, the [agency] is finding some way to get around them. This whole process has been quite demoralizing for [appellant]. He feels that various actions over the years taken against him have been humiliating and have taken their toll both psychiatrically and financially. He feels psychologically beaten down with associated feelings of apathy and loss of will, not only in regard to the work situation, but these feelings have generalized to all areas of his life.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Even though I am strongly recommending that his disability be approved this too will be a significant loss for Mr. Wallis in that he really loves the job itself, and this seems to be the real tragedy. However, because of the combination of his past and current psychiatric state, his emotional vulnerability and liability and the demonstrated antagonism of his supervisors at [the agency,] I do not see any way that [appellant] can return to his job without severe emotional repercussions and deterioration in his condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">C.&#x2003;Damages Requested</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant requested past pecuniary damages as follows: psychiatric treatment with Dr. B since January 21, 1988, at the rate of $40 per one-half hour; transportation to and from Dr. B's office since January 21, 1988, at the rate of 27.5 cents per mile per 20 mile round-trip; prescription medications Prozac, Thioridazine, Desipramine, and Xanax since January 21, 1988.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant requested future pecuniary damages as follows: Dr. B stated that he expects appellant's condition to continue, and to continue to require treatment, for the next 5 years (through August 1999), although he did not explain how he arrived at that estimate. Appellant therefore requested an amount at least equal to the average annual past pecuniary losses since 1988 multiplied by five. Appellant specifically requested recovery for the full amount of past and future pecuniary damages, notwithstanding that certain of these expenses have been paid or are expected to be paid in whole or in part by appellant's health insurer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant requested non-pecuniary damages as follows: for loss of reputation, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing (the 1992 bankruptcy), emotional pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of health, an amount equal to three times the total amount requested for past and future pecuniary losses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes at the outset that the agency found that appellant had been discriminated against with regard to the AL/FFDE order and Codes reading. Appellant did not appeal the agency's finding of no discrimination with regard to the 7-day suspension. Accordingly, the Commission limits its review on appeal to the issue of whether appellant is entitled to compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;Legal Standards for an Award of Compensatory Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA 1991), 105 Stat. 1071, Pub. L. No. 102-166, codified as 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a, authorizes an award of compensatory damages as part of the "make whole" relief for intentional discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. Section 1981a(b)(2) indicates that compensatory damages do not include backpay, interest on backpay, or any other type of equitable relief authorized by Title VII. Section 1981a(b)(3) limits the total amount of compensatory damages that may be awarded to each complaining party for future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses, according to the number of persons employed by the respondent employer. The limit for an employer with more than 500 employees, such as the agency, is $300,000. 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that compensatory damages are recoverable in the administrative process<span class="Italic">. Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923399 (November 12, 1992), <span class="Italic">req. to reopen den.</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930306 (February 1, 1993). If a complainant has raised a claim for compensatory damages during the administrative process, an agency must request from the complainant proof that damages were incurred, and proof linking the damages to the alleged discrimination, prior to issuing an offer of full relief<span class="Italic">. Papas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC No. 01930547 (March 17, 1994. Similarly, if a complainant alleges that he or she is entitled to compensatory damages and the agency or Commission enters a finding of discrimination, the complainant must be given an opportunity to submit evidence establishing his or her claim. To receive an award of compensatory damages, a complainant must demonstrate that he or she has been harmed as a result of the agency's discriminatory action; the extent, nature, and severity of the harm; and the duration or expected duration of the harm<span class="Italic">. Rivera v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01934157 (July 22, 1994); Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, EEOC Notice No. N 915.002 (July 14, 1992), at 11-12, 14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Compensatory damages may be awarded for the past pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and non-pecuniary losses which are directly or proximately caused by the agency's discriminatory conduct. EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 8. Pecuniary losses are out-of-pocket expenses that are incurred as a result of the employer's unlawful action, including job-hunting expenses, moving expenses, medical expenses, psychiatric expenses, physical therapy expenses, and other quantifiable out-of-pocket expenses<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Past pecuniary losses are the pecuniary losses that are incurred prior to the resolution of a complaint via a finding of discrimination, an offer of full relief, or a voluntary settlement<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 8-9. Future pecuniary losses are losses that are likely to occur after resolution of a complaint<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 9. Non-pecuniary losses are losses that are not subject to precise quantification, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing, and loss of health<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A compensatory damages award should fully compensate a complainant for the harm caused by the agency's discriminatory action even if the harm is intangible<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 13. Thus, a compensatory damages award should reimburse a complainant for proven pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and non-pecuniary losses. A complainant has a duty to mitigate his or her pecuniary damages<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 9. If a respondent can prove that a complainant failed to mitigate pecuniary damages, the damages award should be reduced to reflect all losses that could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable diligence<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 9-10. There are no precise formulae for determining the amount of damages payable for non-pecuniary losses. Damage awards for non-pecuniary losses that have been assessed by juries and courts have varied substantially from one another<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 13. However, an award of compensatory damages for non-pecuniary losses including emotional harm, should reflect the extent to which the respondent's discriminatory action directly or proximately caused the harm and the extent to which other factors also caused the harm<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 11-12. An award of compensatory damages for non-pecuniary losses should also reflect the nature and severity of the harm and the duration or expected duration of the harm<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Compensatory damages may be awarded for all pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses post-dating the November 21, 1991, effective date of CRA 1991<span class="Italic">. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, ___ U.S. ___, 114 S. Ct. 1483 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Carle v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 01922369 (January 5,1993) the Commission described the type of objective evidence that an agency may obtain when assessing the merits of a complainant's request for emotional distress damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[E]vidence should have taken the form of a statement by appellant describing her emotional distress, and statements from witnesses, both on and off the job, describing the distress. To properly explain the emotional distress, such statements should include detailed information on physical or behavioral manifestations of the distress, information on the duration of the distress, and examples of how the distress affected appellant day to day, both on and off the job. In addition, the agency should have asked appellant to provide objective and other evidence linking...the distress to the unlawful discrimination....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Objective evidence may include statements from the complainant concerning his or her emotional pain or suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character or reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other non-pecuniary losses that are incurred as a result of the discriminatory conduct. Statements from others, including family members, friends, and health care providers could address the outward manifestations or physical consequences of emotional distress, including sleeplessness, anxiety, stress, depression, marital strain, humiliation, loss of self-esteem, excessive fatigue, or a nervous breakdown. Objective evidence may also include documents indicating a complainant's actual out-of-pocket expenses related to medical treatment, counseling, and so forth, <span id="Page_1815"></span>related to the injury caused by the respondent's discriminatory action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that this case raises the question of the extent of an employer's liability when the injury caused by its discriminatory action is the aggravation of a pre-existing emotional condition. Where a complaining party has a pre-existing emotional condition, and that condition deteriorates as a result of the discriminatory conduct, the additional harm may be attributed to the respondent employer, EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 11, following the theory that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.</span>, 817 F.2d 1290, 1294 (7th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AR has directed the Commission's attention in this regard to the case of <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981). In <span class="Italic">Maurer</span>, the employee sustained a non-disabling back injury while working aboard ship. Sometime later, the employee sustained a second back injury aboard another ship, and after the second injury the employee became disabled for work. The <span class="Italic">Maurer</span> court explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is a settled principle of tort law that when a defendant's wrongful act causes injury, he is fully liable for the resulting damage even though the injured plaintiff had a preexisting condition that made the consequences of the wrongful act more severe than they would have been for a normal victim. The defendant takes the plaintiff as he finds him. A plaintiff's recovery for damages caused by a defendant's wrongful act may not be proportionately reduced because of a preexisting weakness or susceptibility to injury such as...a weakness caused by a preexisting injury.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">However, there are two exceptions to the general rule. First, when a plaintiff is incapacitated or disabled prior to an accident, the defendant is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation that he caused. Second, when a plaintiff has a preexisting condition that would inevitably worsen, a defendant causing subsequent injury is entitled to have the plaintiff's damages discounted to reflect the proportion of damages that would have been suffered even in the absence of subsequent injury, but the burden of proof in such cases is upon the defendant to prove the extent of the damages that the preexisting condition would inevitably have caused. (citations omitted)</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 99-100.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AR correctly cites <span class="Italic">Maurer</span> to support the proposition that the agency is liable for the entire harm caused to appellant by the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading, unless the agency shows that such harm would inevitably have occurred even absent these acts. The agency has offered no such proof; neither has Dr. B ever indicated that appellant's condition inevitably would have worsened even in the absence of the discrimination. AR, however, also requests the Commission to find that the agency's discriminatory actions render the agency liable for all of appellant's damages in connection with his emotional condition, reaching back to 1988<span class="Italic">. Maurer</span> does not support this request; the <span class="Italic">Maurer</span> court plainly states that where the plaintiff has a pre-existing condition, the defendant "is fully liable for the resulting damage" (emphasis supplied)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 99. This reading is consistent with the Commission's recent holding in <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995), where the Commission found the agency to be liable for exacerbation of the complainant's pre-existing asthmatic condition and for the additional physical and emotional harm caused by the exacerbation of the asthma, only to the extent that such harm was caused by discrimination post-dating the effective date of CRA 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;Appellant's Evidence of Injury and Causation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has produced substantial evidence bearing on injury and causation. This evidence supports a finding that appellant's troubled relationship with the agency first caused, then aggravated appellant's emotional condition. However, because the agency's liability for compensatory damages is limited to the injuries directly or proximately caused by the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading, it is necessary to more closely examine the causes to which appellant's injuries are attributed both by him and by Dr. B.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his October 20, 1993, note Dr. B stated that over the preceding four weeks, appellant had experienced increased feelings and symptoms of depression and anxiety which resulted in a recurrence of his Depressive Disorder. This recurrence in turn required Dr. B to reinstitute treatment with anti-depressant medication, and appellant stopped work for about four weeks. Although the event which most immediately precipitated appellant's leave of absence was his suspension from his union, it is noted that appellant filed the complaint at bar on October 14, 1993, and was thereafter engaged in litigation of that complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his December 21, 1993, note Dr. B stated that appellant had continued to experience feelings of harassment and lack of support since his return to work in August 1992. Dr. B cited as examples the May 1993 suspension from work and the October 1993 suspension from his union, which he described as "very distressing" to appellant. Dr. B stated, "These and related incidents have caused him to experience increasing feeling[s] of frustration, helplessness and agitation, thus precipitating a relapse."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his January 24, 1994, note Dr. B stated that appellant was completely preoccupied with his "constant battle to keep his job," as well as with "litigation he is attempting to pursue around the mistreatment he has experience[d] particularly his unjustified termination which has had a devastating effect on him." Dr. B opined that appellant's condition was "directly related to the persistent harassment and unjust treatment that he experiences in the performance of his postal duties, as well as his feeling of frustration and vulnerability around pursuing legal retribution for his firing...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his November 1, 1994, report Dr. B noted that appellant was doing well until the May 1993 suspension from work, after which appellant felt "that he was 'fair game' for anybody." Dr. B noted that appellant continued to struggle with these feelings while doing his job, "but in October 1993, he learned that he was suspended from the Post Office Union, and this resulted in another relapse of his Depressive Disorder..." after which his medications were restarted or increased.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is noted that Dr. B's statements reflect that the events of 1993 which most affected appellant were the May suspension from work and the October union suspension. However, Dr. B's comments do appear to support a finding that the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading contributed to appellant's weakened state immediately before the union suspension. Dr. B also stated that appellant "continues to be devastated by the whole process; [t]hat even when some decisions go in his favor, the [agency] is finding some way to get around them."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that compensatory damages provisions were not added to EEO statutes to address how an agency litigates an EEO complaint alleging employment discrimination, but to address how an agency treated an applicant or an employee in an employment-related context. <span class="Italic">E.g., Appleby v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933879 (March 4, 1994). Although a complainant who establishes that discriminatory animus motivated the improper processing of his or her EEO complaint may be entitled to compensatory damages, <span class="Italic">see Grose v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01940870 (May 13, 1994), the Commission has held that a complainant may not recover compensatory damages for the stress associated with prosecuting an EEO complaint<span class="Italic">. See Rountree v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941906 (July 7, 1995). Here, although the Commission might question the agency's apparent failure to consider all of the evidence on compensatory damages submitted by appellant, appellant has not produced evidence to show that this failure was motivated by discriminatory animus. Accordingly, appellant may not recover compensatory damages for whatever injury he sustained on account of the stress of litigating his EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's statement is set out in detail above and need not be repeated here. The Commission notes, however, that appellant attributed a substantial portion of his difficulties to his 1991 wrongful termination and the resultant bankruptcy, which the Commission has already noted is not part of the case at bar. However, appellant also detailed his ongoing problems with friends and family, as well as the physical manifestations of his ill mental health which Dr. B attributes, in part, to the agency's discriminatory acts during the summer of 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Overall, the evidence reflects that a great part of appellant's condition after the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading is attributable to events which occurred before them, and to appellant's union suspension. However, although neither appellant nor Dr. B specifically identified the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading as events precipitating the worsening of appellant's condition, it is apparent from a review of the entire body of evidence that these events did substantially contribute to the worsening of appellant's mental condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">C.&#x2003;Calculation of Damages Payable</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission now turns to the calculation of damages payable to appellant. The Commission notes that appellant has requested application of the "collateral source" rule, which holds that "benefits received by the plaintiff from a source collateral to the defendant may not be used to reduce that defendant's liability for damages." 1 Dobbs, Law of Remedies 3.8(1), at 372-73 (2d ed. 1993). What appellant is asking, in other words, is to be reimbursed by the agency for the full amount of his pecuniary damages, even though some of the expenses have been paid by appellant's health insurer. In previous cases, the Commission has awarded past pecuniary damages based on the amount of money the complainant personally paid<span class="Italic">. Carpenter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652; <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941906. In neither <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> nor <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, however, did the Commission have occasion to address whether the collateral source rule should be applied; it does not appear that the issue was raised in either case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Berg v. United States</span>, 806 F.2d 978 (10th Cir. 1986), the issue was whether Medicare benefits may be used to off-set a plaintiff's recovery <span id="Page_1816"></span>under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The court held that collateral source funds cannot be used to offset damages payable by the Federal government where the source of funds is "separate and distinct" from general government revenues<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 984-86. This is so even where the defendant contributes monies to the collateral source<span class="Italic">. Id.; Phillips v. Western Company of North America</span>, 953 F.2d 923 (5th Cir. 1992) (benefit is collateral even where defendant contributed to benefit, provided defendant did not purchase the benefit to respond to legal liability) (citing <span class="Italic">Haughton v. Blackships, Inc.</span>, 462 F.2d 788 (5th Cir. 1972); <span class="Italic">Andrulonis v. United States</span>, 724 F. Supp. 1421, 1524 (N.D.N.Y. 1989), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, 924 F.2d 1210 (2d Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">cert. granted and judgment vacated and remanded</span>, 502 U.S. 801 (1991), <span class="Italic">prev. judgment reinstated</span>, 952 F.2d 652 (2d Cir. 1991) (Social Security benefits are collateral and do not off-set damages payable under FTCA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More recently, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the determination whether a source of compensation is "collateral" to the employer depends on whether the benefit derived from that source is in the nature of a "fringe benefit," or instead reflects an attempt by the employer to limit its potential legal liability. In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Odeco</span>, Inc., 18 F.3d 1237 (5th Cir. 1994), the employer paid 95 percent of the employee's health insurance premium for a policy which covered only non-work-related illness and injury. The <span class="Italic">Odeco</span> court considered several factors in reaching its decision that the health insurance benefits were a collateral source, in particular that the plan applied only to non-work-related injury and illness, for which the employer would not ordinarily be liable<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1244-45. The court found, therefore, that the employer did not provide the health insurance as a means to limit its legal liability, and no off-set should be permitted<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, although the agency pays a substantial share of appellant's health insurance premium, the actual funds disbursed to pay appellant's expenses were overwhelmingly those of the insurance company, as contributed by not just the agency, but appellant and countless other insureds<span class="Italic">. See Berg</span>, 806 F.2d 978. Neither may it fairly be said that the agency contributed to appellant's health insurance premium in order to respond to some legal liability it might otherwise have toward appellant<span class="Italic">. See Odeco</span>, 18 F.3d 1237; <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 953 F.2d 923. Accordingly, the Commission finds that application of the collateral source rule is appropriate. This approach is consistent with Commission precedent in other remedies determinations, where it has been held that unemployment benefits, which also result from the agency having paid an insurance premium, may not be used to off-set the amount of backpay to which a successful EEO complainant is entitled<span class="Italic">. See Scott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01921641 (June 11, 1993); <span class="Italic">Collick-Brown v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01910904 (March 26, 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Past Pecuniary Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant is entitled to past pecuniary damages from June 25, 1993, (the date of the AL/FFDE order) through September 27, 1994 (the date of the FAD admitting discrimination). If the sole cause of appellant's past pecuniary damages had been established as the AL/FFDE order and the reading of the Codes, appellant would be entitled to reimbursement for all of his past expenses. However, given that the evidence does not establish this, the Commission will award appellant past pecuniary damages for the increase in his treatment with Dr. B after the AL/FFDE order, and for his medications, which were reinstituted/increased after the AL/FFDE order. Appellant is therefore entitled to past pecuniary damages (1) for his psychiatric treatment with Dr. B at the rate of $40 per one-half hour office visit for 19 office visits, a total of $760; (2) transportation to and from Dr. B's office, a 20-mile round-trip, at the rate of 25 cents per mile for 19 round trips, a total of $95; and (3) his prescription medications of Fluoxetine (Prozac), Thioridazine, Desipramine, and Xanax, 16 as follows: Fluoxetine (Prozac), 2 purchases at $64.90 each, and 4 purchases at $129.60 each; Thioridazine, 1 purchase at $6.30; Desipramine, 1 purchase at $25, and 5 purchases at $30 each; and Xanax, 1 purchase at $6.50; a total of $835.40. The total of all pecuniary damages awarded is $1,690.40.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Future Pecuniary Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.B stated that he expects appellant's condition to continue, and to continue to require treatment, for the next 5 years (through August 1999). Although Dr. B did not explain the clinical basis for this opinion, given the nature and extent of appellant's condition, Dr. B's estimation does not seem unreasonable. Appellant requests future pecuniary damages in the full amount of his expected expenses for future treatment. Given that appellant was already in treatment with Dr. B at the time of the AL/FFDE order, and that appellant has presented no evidence that his treatment was expected to end any sooner than the five years projected by Dr. B, the award of future pecuniary damages should reflect only that portion of appellant's future treatment attributable to the effects of the discrimination. The Commission therefore finds that appellant should receive pecuniary damages in an amount equal to five times the amount of past pecuniary damages. Accordingly, future pecuniary damages are awarded in the amount of $8,452. This amount reflects the additional treatment that appellant is expected to need on account of the events at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3<span class="Italic">.&#x2003;Non-Pecuniary Damages</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has requested damages for loss of reputation, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing (the 1992 bankruptcy), emotional pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of health, in the amount of at least $130,000. The Commission notes that, as with pecuniary damages, the agency is liable only for those damages directly or proximately caused by the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 11. In other words, because the compensatory damages provisions of CRA 1991 apply only to conduct occurring on and after November 21, 1991, and the agency has found discrimination only with regard to the AL/FFDE order and the Codes reading, the Commission cannot consider the effect of the agency's actions toward appellant prior to June 25, 1993, for purposes of enhancing the award of non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are no "hard and fast" rules governing the amount to be awarded. However, non-pecuniary damages must be limited to the sums necessary to compensate the injured party for actual harm, even where the harm is intangible, <span class="Italic">see Carter v. Duncan-Higgins, Ltd.</span>, 727 F.2d 1225 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and should take into account the severity of the harm and the length of time that the injured party has suffered from the harm<span class="Italic">. Carpenter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652; EEOC Notice N 915.002 at 14. The Commission notes that for a proper award of non-pecuniary damages, the amount of the award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F. 2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">US EEOC v. AIC Security Investigations, Ltd.</span>, 823 F. Supp. 573, 574 (N.D. Ill. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the amount of non-pecuniary damages to which appellant is entitled, the Commission has considered that appellant has suffered from the effects of the discrimination for two years and is expected to continue suffering from them for at least five more years, and has taken into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by appellant as it relates to events occurring on and after the date of the AL/FFDE order, and the evidence that a substantial portion of appellant's injuries appear to have been caused by events preceding the AL/FFDE order. The Commission therefore finds that appellant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $50,000, approximately five times the amount of pecuniary damages awarded. While substantially less than the amount requested by appellant, his calculations took into account his injuries caused by other factors, especially his wrongful termination and resultant bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Wulf v. City of Wichita</span>, 883 F.2d 842 (10th Cir. 1989) ($250,000 award for mental distress based on testimony of plaintiff and plaintiff's spouse remanded for reconsideration and an award of damages no greater than $50,000 for anger, depression, anxiety, frustration, and emotional strain following wrongful termination); <span class="Italic">Stallworth v. Shuler</span>, 777 F.2d 1431 (11th Cir. 1985) ($100,000 award for emotional distress upheld based on testimony that plaintiff suffered loss of sleep, marital strain, and humiliation, and discriminatory activity occurred over a period of years); <span class="Italic">Fleming v. County of Kane, State of Illinois</span>, 898 F.2d 553 (7th Cir. 1990) ($40,000 award for emotional distress upheld based on testimony of plaintiff, plaintiff's spouse, and plaintiff's coworker that plaintiff was embarrassed and humiliated, suffered from headaches, sleeplessness, and depression, and job stress aggravated appellant's physical condition); <span class="Italic">Lussier v. Runyon</span>, 3 A.D. Cas. (BNA) 223 (D. Me. 1993) ($75,000 awarded where court found that defendant's actions "caused severe and substantial injury to [plaintiff's] mental health, self-esteem and status within his family and the community [which] impact...is likely to stay with him the rest of his life").</p>
<p class="noindent">With this trilogy of cases, in 1995 the Commission began to give some actual meaning to the compensatory damage provision of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 05950919 (1996), the Commission, on reconsideration and citing <span class="Italic">Appleby</span>, affirmed "the broad principle established therein applies equally to the instant case: compensatory damages are available to the extent necessary to compensate a victim, but only for an agency's intentional discrimination in the workplace." No damages are available for any emotional distress suffered as a result of participating in the EEO process. The Commission upheld its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, writing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the previous decision shows that it correctly identified and applied the standards from the Commission's policy guidance regarding compensatory and punitive damages,<span class="Italic"> see</span> EEOC Notice No. N 915.002 (July 14, 1992), in determining appellant's compensatory damages award. The previous decision relied on the principle that a compensatory damages award should be limited to the amount <span id="Page_1817"></span>necessary to compensate a complainant for the actual harm caused by the agency's discriminatory action. The previous decision reviewed relatively recent jury and court awards for emotional distress and/or mental anguish that did not include major depression and found that the amount of the awards varied considerably--from $500 to $100,000. To provide a reasonable award of compensatory damages, the previous decision considered the nature and severity of appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms; the duration and expected duration of same; and, the extent to which appellant's emotional distress and related symptoms were caused by factors other than the discriminatory act of the agency. On this basis, the previous decision found that $8,000 was a reasonable dollar value to compensate appellant for that portion of his emotional distress and related symptoms which were caused by the agency's discrimination. Although appellant would prefer a higher award, $8,000 is not inconsistent with awards made in other similar cases. We find no error in the amount of compensatory damages awarded by the previous decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, in <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, on reconsideration, the Commission rejected the appellant's argument that his distress was actually lasting longer than had been projected in the initial decision by OFO and, therefore, he was entitled to more in the way of compensatory damages. In support of that argument, the appellant submitted an affidavit chronicling his continuing symptoms of emotional distress. However, the Commission found this did not constitute new and material evidence that was not previously available. The Commission held that the previous decision properly considered the evidence of record on the expected duration of the distress, and that appellant was given a full opportunity to submit evidence for the record in the oriGINAl proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent">What underlies the decision about the duration of emotional distress in <span class="Italic">Rountree,</span> but is never articulated by the Commission, is the simple tenet that, at some time, a decision must become final and no longer subject to review. To allow complainants, barring exceptional circumstances, to endlessly submit additional evidence on the duration of their distress which can only be projected at the time of the final decision, would subject agencies to endless litigation solely on the issue of the duration of distress. Of course, it also would raise the interesting prospect of the agency seeking a remitter in those rare cases where the emotional distress lasts far less time than estimated in the final decision.</p>
