<h4 class="h4" id="sec22-55"><span class="space">16.</span> Partial and Fractionable Fees</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are two distinct determinations that must be made that relate to the success of the prevailing party. The first determination, addressed above, is whether a party has prevailed to an extent that permits an award of fees. The second determination relates to the actual degree of success. The degree of success does not go to the issue of eligibility for fees. Instead, it goes to the issue of the amount of the fee award.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no bright-line rule to the effect that a party who only partially prevails is not entitled to a full fee award. In some cases, the degree of success will be such that a full fee award is warranted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Layman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995568 (2002) (full fee was awarded where complainant prevailed on five of six claims). This is particularly true where there is a factual relationship between the successful and unsuccessful claims. For example, in rejecting the agency's argument for a fee reduction in <span class="Italic">Ferrall v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A30054 (2003), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the issue of the AJ's award of attorney's fees incurred in the prosecution of her complaint, the agency contends that "it appears" the AJ failed to make an adjustment to the fee award for the fact that complainant presented a nonselection claim, upon which she did not prevail, in addition to her reassignment claim upon which she did prevail. The agency contends that therefore the AJ's attorney's fee award should be halved. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the complainant did not prevail on every aspect of her complaint does not, in itself, justify a reduction in the hours expended where the claims are intertwined, and it would be impossible to segregate the hours involved in each claim. It is true that attorney's fees may not be recovered for work on unsuccessful claims<span class="Italic">. Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983). Courts have held that fee applicants should exclude time expended on "truly fractionable" claims or issues on which they did not prevail<span class="Italic">. See National Ass'n of Concerned Veterans (NACV) v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1337 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Claims are fractionable or unrelated when they involve "distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here the unsuccessful claims are not fractionable. All three of complainant's claims are based, at least in part, on retaliation for complainant's participation over time in protected EEO activity. Each of the claims arise from this common factual core. Furthermore, many of the same individuals were involved in the events giving rise to both claims, and several witnesses testified concerning both claims. Therefore, we find that the claims on which complainant did not prevail are not "distinct in all respects" from the claim on which she was successful, and that the AJ's attorney's fees award is supported by substantial evidence. No part of the AJ's attorney's fees award will be disallowed because complainant was not successful on all of her claims. We are similarly unpersuaded by the agency's identical argument regarding the AJ's award of $552.84 for costs associated with the litigation of the complaint, and, accordingly, we will not reduce the amount of that award.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Nannie D. v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720150021 (2016) (modifying AJ's fee reduction in a hostile environment case; "We find that the bases of national origin and sex are not truly fractionable from the basis of reprisal as Complainant prevailed on the claim of a hostile work environment. Based on the AJ's finding that Complainant was subjected to unlawful harassment, it cannot be said that the bases of national origin or sex on which Complainant did not prevail were distinct from the basis of retaliation on which she was successful. Therefore, we conclude that no reduction in the fee award is warranted here based on the unsuccessful bases."); <span class="Italic">Heffley v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a40138.txt">07A40138</a> (2005); <span class="Italic">Anthony v.

<p class="noindent">Another good explanation of the Commission's approach on when full fees are warranted even when the complainant does not prevail on all claims is provided in <span class="Italic">Holley v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720110028 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission, an agency, or an AJ may award complainant reasonable attorney's fees and other costs incurred in the processing of a complaint regarding allegations of discrimination in violation of the Title VII. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e). To establish entitlement to attorney's fees, complainant must first show that he or she is a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health and Human Resources,</span> 532 U.S. 598 (2001). A prevailing party for this purpose is one who succeeds on any significant issue, and achieves some of the benefit sought in bringing the action. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970101 (February 4, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 427, 433 (1983)). A finding of discrimination raises a presumption of entitlement to an award of attorney's fees. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Attorney's fees shall be paid for services performed by an attorney after filing of a written complaint. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An award of attorney's fees is determined by calculating the loadstar, i.e., by multiplying a reasonable hourly fee times a reasonable number of hours expended. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, at 433; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B). "There is a strong presumption that this amount represents the reasonable fee." 29 C.F.R. 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B). A reasonable hourly fee is the prevailing market rate in the relevant community. <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886 (1984). A petition for fees and costs must take the form of a verified statement required by the Commission's regulations at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(e)(2)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that the award of attorney's fees should be substantially reduced to reflect the fact that Complainant was unsuccessful on her claim of sexual harassment, having prevailed only on her claim of retaliation. The Agency's position is not well-taken. While it is true that under some circumstances attorney's fees will not be awarded for work on unsuccessful claims, <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 434, courts have held that fee applicants should exclude only time expended on "truly fractionable" claims or issues on which they did not prevail. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1327 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Claims are fractionable or unrelated when they involve distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 435. However, in cases where a claim for relief involves "a common core of facts or will be based on related legal theories" a fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "The hours spent on unsuccessful claims should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee only where the unsuccessful claims are distinct in all respects from the successful claims." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO MD-110, Ch. 11, Sect. 6(A)(7) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case the AJ found that S2 retaliated against Complainant by transferring her from the Automation Unit back to the Flat Unit in breach of the settlement agreement. S2 did this as punishment for Complainant's "engaging in protected EEO activity, complaining of sexual harassment; filing an EEO complaint regarding a hostile work environment and engaging in mediation to resolve her EEO complaint." AJ Decision at 19. Thus, the sexual harassment and retaliation claims are not "fractionable or unrelated" since evidence of the alleged sexual harassment was necessary to prove S2's motivation for retaliation. Therefore Complainant is entitled to $77,651.75, the full amount in attorney's fees as ordered by the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Michelle G. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120160822 (2016) (reversing a 15% reduction of fees for an unsuccessful EPA claim where the complainant prevailed on other claims based on the same set of facts); <span class="Italic">Mannon v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070074 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a full fee award is not warranted, there have been two approaches to fee awards. The first approach is a "fractionable" fee award. Under this approach, the factfinder attempts to quantify the percentage of success and scales the fee award accordingly. Fractionable fees often are used where the complainant advances more than one legal theory, but does not prevail on all theories advanced. Closely akin to fractionable fee awards is the concept of partial fee awards. The partial fee award approach is less mathematical and depends primarily upon the imprecise art of determining a reasonable fee in light of the success of the action. Partial fees are used where more than one action is in dispute, but the complainant does not demonstrate that all disputed actions were discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Sang G. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120151360 (2017), considered the "common core of facts" to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees, crediting the complainant's argument that he was successful with respect to the most important claim, i.e., his termination, and that claim constituted the "bulk of his concerns and that other matters were intertwined":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency reduced Complainant's requested attorney's fees by 75%. The Agency reasoned that Complainant's requested attorney's fees should be reduced because Complainant only prevailed on two out of his thirteen claims. Commission cases have not automatically reduced attorney's fees to a ratio of prevailing claims to non-prevailing claims. <span class="Italic">See, <span id="Page_2010"></span>e.g., King v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, Appeal No. 01A24792 (Jan. 23, 2004) (stating that "the Commission discourages reducing attorney's fees based on mathematical formulas or inflexible ratios comparing litigated claims to claims won").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant prevailed on allegations of discrimination based on reprisal when he was placed on administrative leave, his authority to carry a firearm was suspended, he was directed to surrender his government-issued firearm and credentials; and by letter dated January 11, 2011, he was terminated during his probationary period. Complainant's remaining assertions constituted, for the most part, a hostile work environment claim based on race, color, and reprisal. We find that Complainant's hostile work environment claim is not truly fractionable from his successful claims because they arise out of a common core of facts which took place during his approximately nine months of employment. In fact, the Agency found that direct evidence of retaliation took place regarding issues 12 and 13 when Complainant complained to the FBI about race-based and threatening comments made in his workplace and his fear of potential race-based violence in his workplace. We note that several of the matters Complainant complained to the FBI about were incidents set forth in his unsuccessful hostile work environment claim. The two issues that Complainant prevailed upon were not only the most important of the 13 matters raised but were clearly intertwined with the remaining 11. Therefore, we find that a reduction of attorney's fees in the amount 75% was unwarranted. We find that given that Complainant's allegations cannot be said to be "distinct in all respects," no reduction of attorney's fees is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bujalski v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720110020 (Aug. 31, 2012) (finding that "since all the [complainant's] claims, both successful and unsuccessful, are based on the same theory of liability, i.e., race, color, retaliation, it cannot be concluded that the unsuccessful claims are "distinctly different" from the successful claims"; as such we find that other than the $1,881.50, deduction for travel there should be no reduction in attorney's fees even though Complainant only prevailed on two out of 13 claims. Therefore, attorney's fees should be paid in the amount of $25,517.39.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Berzingi v. Department of Army</span>, 01830105 (1983), the Commission addressed the issue of attorney fees in the context of a case in which the complainant had not wholly prevailed. The appellant alleged three alternative legal theories as to his nonselection, ultimately prevailing on a reprisal theory. The agency reduced the requested fee award by dividing the number of hours by the number of theories advanced and awarded a fractional fee. In reversing the agency, the EEOC adopted the rationale of <span class="Italic">National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Fractionable fees are appropriate only where the issue and claims are truly divisible and no reduction of fees is appropriate when the unsuccessful claims were "part and parcel of the one matter." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When a complainant prevails on one issue but loses on others, fees are recoverable only for the successful portion of the complaint. In <span class="Italic">Carrier v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01830803 (1984), the EEOC upheld the agency's decision of a partial fee award for nine and a half hours as opposed to the 26 requested, where the complainant failed to prevail on claims of race and sex discrimination but had prevailed on a claim of reprisal. The fee submission clearly demonstrated that counsel had spent nine and a half hours on the reprisal claim and the remainder of the hours pursuing the unsuccessful claims. Partial fees differ from fractionable fees discussed above in that fractionable fees deal with pursuing different legal theories on the same issue. Partial fees relate to cases where more than one issue is raised. However, the Commission has not been consistent in its usage of the terms. For example, in <span class="Italic">Dildy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A40115 (2005), the Commission stated that "[c]laims are fractionable or unrelated when they involve 'distinctly different claims of relief that are based on different facts and legal theories.'" In <span class="Italic">Dildy</span>, the Commission found that claims of disparate treatment and harassment, on which the complainant had not prevailed, were distinctly different from the claim of failure to accommodation, on which the complainant had prevailed. The important point, however, is not which label to attach to each scenario, but to understand that there are two methods of determining a fee award in a situation where the complainant has prevailed in part and not prevailed in part. One determining factor will be whether the complainant's attorney has kept time records in a manner that permits specific hours to be allocated to specific claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120112724 (2011) (rejecting agency argument for a fee reduction where counsel had already reduced the fee requested by the number of hours spent on the unsuccessful claim).</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Carrier</span> case presented an easy scenario where the hours spent on the different issues were clearly segregable. In cases involving multiple issues where the complainant only partially prevails, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to segregate the hours worked by issue. When the hours are not reasonably segregable, a percentage reduction in the fee, may be appropriate. In other words, if a partial fee award cannot be reasonably determined then the Commission will make a fractionable fee award. For example, in <span class="Italic">Griskonis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01902624 (1990), the attorney was successful in disputing the amount of back pay awarded to his client, but was not successful in obtaining his reinstatement. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Griskonis</span> found the agency was not obliged to award fees for time spent on the reinstatement issue, but it was not possible to segregate actual hours worked on the respective issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e are mindful that an exact allocation will be impossible as the attorney was often working on both issues at the same time. The Supreme Court has indicated that in this situation reasonable attorney's fees may be awarded by either identifying specific hours which should be eliminated or by simply reducing the award to account for the limited success of the complainant. <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland School Dist.</span>, 49 FEP 465, 467 (U.S. 1989). In this case, we are unable, with any degree of accuracy, to identify the specific hours spent working on the reinstatement issue from the information provided on the attorney's itemized billing statement. Therefore, we elect to reduce the compensable hours by 50% to reflect the limited success achieved for appellant in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Zook</span>, 865 F.2d 887 (attorney's fee award reduced by 75% to reflect the limited success of the prevailing party)....</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant did not clearly articulate the issue on which she ultimately prevailed is not a bar to a fee award. <span class="Italic">McGinnis v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01913336 (1991). In that case, the complainant oriGINAlly challenged a nonselection, a claim on which she did not succeed. However, she was successful in demonstrating that she was the victim of hostile environment sexual harassment. The Commission rejected an agency argument that attorney fees should not be awarded because the sexual harassment claim was not articulated clearly in the formal complaint. The Commission found that the efforts of appellant's attorney, from his first appearance in the case, led the administrative judge to amend the complaint and find that sexual harassment had occurred. The complainant was a prevailing party and entitled to a fee award.</p>
<p class="noindent">On reconsideration, the Commission further held that a partial fee award is proper where the issues in the complaint are not intertwined. Moreover, where the attorney claims that he cannot separate out the hours spent on each issue, an across-the-board reduction is appropriate. The Commission explained in <span class="Italic">McGinnis v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 05920150 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found appellant to be a prevailing party, the Commission, upon review, finds that there is an error in the decision in EEOC Appeal No. 01913336 regarding the method directed for calculating the award of attorney's fees in the present case. Accordingly, the Commission, in its discretion pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.235(a), hereby reopens the decision in EEOC Appeal No. 01913336. The previous decision found that the circumstances of appellant's nonselection were intertwined with the facts regarding the sexual harassment, that they involved a "common core of facts," such that the hours spent on the sexual harassment claim could not be separated from those spent on the nonselection allegation. The Commission finds however, that the facts and elements for establishing a hostile environment sexual harassment case are so different and distinct from those required in establishing a nonselection case that they are not intertwined as to preclude severing the hours spent on the successful sexual harassment claim. Further, the Commission finds no justification for appellant's attorney to recover fees for the hours of service rendered prior to the time when appellant raised the allegation of sexual harassment in her investigative affidavit of November 14, 1989, prepared just prior to the hearing. After appellant raised the allegation of sexual harassment, her attorney advanced the arguments that appellant was subjected to <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment when she was not selected, as found by the AJ; however, appellant ultimately prevailed on a claim of hostile environment sexual harassment. Appellant's attorney previously had the opportunity to submit a fee request designating the specific time spent on the issue for which appellant prevailed: namely, hostile environment sexual harassment. In his request, as well as during the subsequent appeals of the attorney's fees award, appellant's attorney indicated that he was unable to separate out the hours spent on the hostile environment sexual harassment issue and also that the time spent on the "minor retaliation claim was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>," again prohibiting the separation of the hours spent thereon.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Commission finds that it would be futile to request a new fee request from appellant's attorney. Rather than examining each hour spent or task performed for excessive billing, the courts have recognized that a superior method to address this concern is to take a percentage across-the-board reduction of compensable time billed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Kennickell</span>, 645 F. Supp. 437, 446-451 (D.D.C. 1986); <span class="Italic">Hampton Richardson v. Anthony M. Frank, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service, (Central Region)</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01901556 (July 10, 1990). In view of the fact that appellant did not raise the issue of sexual harassment until November 14, 1989, shortly before the hearing, and the fact that appellant's attorney focused his efforts on the theories of <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment and disparate treatment regarding the nonselection, theories upon which appellant did not prevail, we find that an across-the-board 50 percent reduction is warranted in the present case. This across-the-board reduction will also account for the "<span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span>" time spent on the unsuccessful reprisal claim. Accordingly, on remand, the agency shall determine the number of hours appellant's attorney expended beginning <span id="Page_2011"></span>from November 14, 1989, as indicated in the previously submitted request for fees, and shall reduce the total number of hours expended by 50 percent in calculating the attorney's fees award. Furthermore, as there are no dates specified for the claimed costs incurred, we will assume for purposes of this decision that all the costs were incurred after November 14, 1989, and we hereby direct the agency to include 50 percent of the claimed costs in the final award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Postmaster General</span>, 01923186 (1993), the Commission followed <span class="Italic">McGinnis</span> and reduced a fee award by 50% where the attorney had focused most of his attention on a disparate treatment claim based on the employee's termination, but the complainant ultimately prevailed on a hostile environment claim. The Commission found that because the two claims were so different, the hours spent on each could have been severed and accounted for separately. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A33198 (2004), the Commission reduced the fee award by 75% prevailed on only one of several claims. The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> also demonstrates that it is possible to have a reduction in a fee award based on the reasonableness of the hours expended as well as an across-the-board reduction based on the limited success of the action. Prior to applying the 75% reduction in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, the Commission eliminated nearly 100 hours from the fee claim because the hours claimed for specific tasks were deemed excessive.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is possible that a case can present claims which are distinct and some in which the facts are intertwined. In <span class="Italic">Almera v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A13618 (2002), the Commission dealt with a fee award in a case where the complainant was unsuccessful on a hostile environment claim which was deemed distinct from her nonpromotion claims. Although the complainant prevailed on only one of three nonpromotion claims, the Commission found the facts of those claims were interrelated. In reducing the requested fee by 50%, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Almera</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One of the considerations that could result in an adjustment of the lodestar amount is the extent of a complainant's success. Attorney's fees cannot be recovered for work on unsuccessful claims<span class="Italic">. Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433. Courts have held that fee applicants should exclude time expended on 'truly fractionable' claims or issues on which they did not prevail<span class="Italic">. See National Association of Concerned Veterans (NACV) v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1337, n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Claims are fractionable or unrelated when they involve "distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35. Thus, in cases where claims are distinctly different, "work on an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 435 (citation omitted). In cases where a claim for relief involves "a common core of facts or will be based on related legal theories" a fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, complainant's attorney submitted his petition for attorney's fees in the amount of $41,937.50 for 167.75 hours of work at a rate of $250.00 per hour. The AJ reduced the award stating that complainant is only entitled to fees in conjunction with the issue upon which she prevailed and therefore reduced the fee request by 70%. Specifically, the AJ concluded that the hostile work environment issue accounted for 50% of the total claim. The AJ noted that the hostile work environment issue involved claims that the agency took numerous adverse actions against complainant over a fifteen month period. The AJ stated that the fact that there was no investigation and that this matter had to be explored through discovery and that a majority of the witness testimony over the seven-day hearing focused on this issue made it the significant issue in this case. The AJ determined that the remaining 50% of the total case focused on the three non-selections, and noted that complainant was a prevailing party on only one of the three non-selection issues. The AJ found that "the three non-selection issues involved facts so inextricably intertwined because they involved the same selecting officials and substantially the same witnesses that it would be impossible to segregate the hours involved in each claim." The AJ then stated that the preparation for the August 1994 non-selection required 30% of the total claim. Thus, the AJ found that the agency should pay complainant $12,581.25 in attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ improperly reduced the fee petition by 70%. We note that in his decision on attorney's fees, the AJ found that complainant's hostile work environment claim accounted for 50% of her total claim. The AJ noted that the issue of the hostile work environment covered a period of approximately fifteen months, involved many alleged adverse agency actions, and constituted a majority of the testimony during the hearing. The Commission finds that the evidence in the record supports the AJ's determination that the hostile work environment claim constituted 50% of complainant's total claim. Thus, the remaining 50% of complainant's claim comprised the claim that she was not selected for the Outpatient Pharmacy Supervisory position. "The hours spent on unsuccessful claims should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee only where the unsuccessful claims are distinct in all respects from the successful claims." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO MD-110, Ch. 11, Sect. 6 (A)(7) (citation omitted). The Commission finds that the evidence of record does not support the contention that the two 1995 non-selections were "distinct in all respects" from the 1994 non-selection. The Commission agrees with the AJ's assessment that the three non-selection issues involved facts so "inextricably intertwined" that it would be impossible to segregate the hours involved in each claim. Specifically, we find that the three non-selections were "inextricably intertwined" in that the same position was at issue, they involved the same selecting officials, they occurred close in time, and they involved substantially the same witnesses. The Commission finds that the hostile work environment claim, which accounted for 50% of complainant's total claim, is distinct in all respects from her successful 1994 non-selection claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the agency's decision to compensate complainant's attorney for only 30% of the hours submitted is insufficient and the Commission finds that complainant's attorney shall be compensated for 50% of the hours contained in his verified statement. Therefore, we shall order the agency to pay complainant a total of $20,968.75 ((167.75 hours x 50%) x $250.00/hour). Furthermore, we find that complainant is entitled to appropriate attorney's fees for work performed by complainant's attorney in pursuing the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">St. Cyr v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080034 (2008) (50% reduction warranted where complainant prevailed on one of three tangentially related claims); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 07A30126 (2004) (50% fee reduction warranted where two distinct claims were presented and complainant prevailed on one claim); <span class="Italic">Schlieter v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30007 (2003) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent">In making an across-the-board reduction, the Commission can take into account not only the number of claims presented versus the number of claims the complainant prevailed on, but also the scope of relief itself. For example, in <span class="Italic">Castillo v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A20005 (2003), the Commission awarded only one-third of the total fee where the complainant did not prevail on her claim with regard to not being placed on the best qualified list, but did prevail on a secondary retaliation claim. In reducing the award, the Commission noted that the complainant was only minimally successful in terms of the relief granted.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining the percentage reduction of a fee when the complainant only partially prevails, the Commission can take into account whether the claim was primary or secondary in nature based on the arguments made by the complainant and the evidence presented. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Attorney General</span>, 01A52756 (2006), the Commission ordered a one--third reduction in the total fee requested where the complainant prevailed on a sexual harassment claim, but not on a reasonable accommodation claim. The Commission found that the harassment claim was the primary claim presented by the complainant in terms of the arguments made on appeal and the evidence submitted at hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">A partial fee reduction can also be used where some of the hours expended are deemed excessive. However, the administrative judge must fully explain the basis for the fee reduction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gist v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070081 (2010) (Commission imposed 10% reduction where judge had not explained the basis for the 50% reduction in his decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">It also is possible for a complainant who only partially prevails on a complaint to receive a full fee award without any reduction. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wakefield v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01994413 (2002), the Commission determined that an across-the-board reduction in fees was inappropriate where the complainant prevailed on only one of five claims, but all claims were related to disparate treatment on the basis of disability. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Wakefield</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency decided that because complainant prevailed on only one of the five issues enumerated by the AJ, the number of hours to be reimbursed should be reduced by 66%, from 301.25 to 99.41. We find that under the circumstances of this case such an across-the-board reduction is inappropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the complainant did not prevail on every aspect of her complaint does not, in itself, justify a reduction in the hours expended where the claims are intertwined, and it would be impossible to segregate the hours involved in each claim. It is true that attorney's fees may not be recovered for work on unsuccessful claims. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433. Courts have held that fee applicants should exclude time expended on "truly fractionable" claims or issues on which they did not prevail<span class="Italic">. See National Association of Concerned Veterans (NACV) v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1337 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Claims are fractionable or unrelated when they involve "distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in cases where claims are distinctly different, "work on an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 435 (citation omitted). However, in cases where a claim for relief involves "a common core of facts or will be based on related legal theories" a fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> "The hours spent on unsuccessful claims should be <span id="Page_2012"></span>excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee only where the unsuccessful claims are distinct in all respects from the successful claims." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEO MD-110, Ch. 11, Sect. 6 (A)(7) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here the claims on which complainant did not prevail are not fractionable. They are all premised on the same legal theory of liability, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> disparate treatment based on disability and require that complainant prove, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> that she was a qualified individual with a disability entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. All of the claims arise from a common factual core, in that each involves the consequences of the agency's decision to subject complainant to a fitness for duty examination. In addition, several of the witnesses testified concerning all of the claims. In light of these factors, it cannot be said that the claims on which complainant did not prevail are "distinct in all respects" from the claim on which she was successful. We conclude that no reimbursement will be disallowed because complainant was not successful on all issues.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Attorney General</span>, 0720080008 (2009), the Commission upheld a fee award of more than $94,000 and rejected the agency's argument that it should be significantly reduced because the complainant prevailed on only one of two claims. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the Commission finds that complainant raised and pursued two claims in her formal complaint, namely, a discriminatory terms and conditions claim (comprised of several incidents), and a claim of discriminatory termination. Complainant prevailed on only one of the claims; however, the claims are substantially interrelated. First, reprisal and sex discrimination were identified as bases for both claims. Second, issue (2) involved many of the events leading up to complainant's termination, and provided vital context to understanding how and why complainant's employment was ultimately terminated. The agency's articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination involved alleged deficiencies in complainant's performance and conduct, and many of the details concerning complainant's job performance and conduct were addressed in the testimony and evidence brought forth concerning issue (1). In addition, even if complainant had only pursued the termination claim, although it might have been somewhat less lengthy, a hearing would still have been held, and perhaps not all, but many of the witnesses would still have been called to testify. Moreover, as the AJ noted, the agency failed to provide adequate guidance for determining which fees belonged to which claim. Accordingly, we find that substantial evidence supports the AJ's award of attorney's fees in the amount of $94,373.08.</p>
<p class="noindent">In other cases, the failure to prevail on all claims for relief may result in only a small reduction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Selmon v. Postmaster General,</span> 0120061912 (2008) (10% reduction where complainant did not prevail on front pay claim, but obtained significant other relief).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prevailing on the substance of the claim does not guarantee a full fee where the overall success of the litigation is limited. For example, in <span class="Italic">Durham v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120072115 (2009), the Commission upheld the 80% reduction of a $32,400 fee request to $6,105. The complainant alleged a failure to accommodate over a year period of time, but the judge found the failure was limited to a period of two months. The Commission noted that there was a relatively limited period of time involved, no make-whole relief was ordered and no compensatory damages were awarded.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the fact that the complainant has prevailed on her "major allegation," does not guarantee that a full fee will be awarded. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Bohac v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/05A40111.txt">07A00030</a> (2003) (applying a 30 % reduction in the total fee where complainant prevailed on her major claim of a hostile work environment over a period of years, but did not prevail on several lesser claims).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission apparently feels no need to explain or justify a reduction in a fee award. For example, in <span class="Italic">McCann v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 10980715 (2000), the Commission reduced a fee award by 20% without providing any specific rationale. If there was any consolation for the complainant it was in the fact that the agency issued a decision reducing the fee by 25%.</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden is upon the complainant to demonstrate the number of hours spent in pursuit of the successful claim and the nature of the work accomplished. In the absence of such evidence, the agency is justified in reducing the fee award based upon its estimate of what constitutes a reasonable amount of time. <span class="Italic">Garde v. Department of Commerce</span>, 01850545 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant is not entitled to recover attorney fees for an issue on which she has prevailed where her lawyer has played no part in presenting the evidence that was critical on that issue. In <span class="Italic">Douglas-Slade v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01903537 (1990), the complainant prevailed on the issue of reprisal with respect to a denial of leave claim. However, the critical evidence presented at the hearing was done by the complainant herself after her attorney failed to appear during the latter stages of a lengthy hearing. The Commission found the complainant was not entitled to an award of fees for any of the work done by the lawyer on this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant does not prevail on every aspect of her complaint does not automatically justify a reduction in the hours expended where the claims are intertwined and it would be impossible to segregate the hours involved in each claim. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Pollack v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931105 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One of the considerations that could result in an adjustment of the lodestar amount is the extent of a complainant's success. Attorney's fees cannot be recovered for work on unsuccessful claims. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433. Courts have held that fee applicants should exclude time expended on "truly fractionable" claims or issues on which they did not prevail. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Concerned Veterans (NACV) v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1337, n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Claims are fractionable or unrelated when they involve "distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35. Thus, "work on an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have been 'expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 435, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. County of Los Angeles</span>, 8 EPD 9444, 5049 (C.D. Cal. 1974).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that it is not liable for attorney's fees incurred from work on the reassignment claims herein because appellant was unsuccessful on these claims and that it therefore properly reduced the hours submitted for compensation by 50%.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's attorney asserts that this reduction was improper, as appellant's claims are interrelated and therefore inseparable for the purposes of an attorney's fee award. After a careful review of the record in appellant's underlying complaint, including the investigatory report and the AJ's findings, the Commission agrees. As noted by the AJ, the record shows that the circumstances of appellant's reassignment were intertwined with the nonselection issue on which she prevailed. Each of appellant's allegations arose as a result of the elimination of her position during an agency realignment and the need for the agency to find another position for her. The allegations additionally are all related to the agency's compliance (or lack of compliance) with its regulations for placing employees during a realignment. Moreover, appellant's reassignment directly flowed from her nonselection for the newly-created position. In other words, if she had been selected for the higher-graded position, she would not have subsequently been reassigned. While we note that some of the facts necessary to proving each claim were different, the claims involved a common core of facts sufficient to support a finding that they were interrelated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the formal complaint and the record herein show that appellant's nonselection allegation was her primary focus during processing of this matter. Appellant's request for relief related only to her nonselection allegation. Appellant requested no remedy stemming from the denial of lateral assignment and subsequent involuntary reassignment. Thus, we find that appellant's claims do not involve "distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35.</p>
<p class="noindent">A fractionable fee award can also be used where the degree of success itself warrants a full fee award, but the hours billed are unreasonable. For example, in <span class="Italic">Block v. Director of United States Information Agency</span>, 01961573 (1998), the Commission awarded only a percentage of the fee requested where lead counsel on the case billed for 10.8 hours in consultation time with an associate. Although the Commission determined that some consultation time was appropriate, it determined that 10.8 hours was excessive. Instead of examining each hour spent in consultation, the Commission used a percentage award approach.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although percentage awards are used, awards of attorney fees and costs must not be based on simple ratios. Specific consideration must be given to the degree of success in the context of the entire case in its evaluation. In <span class="Italic">Brodziak v. Postmaster General</span>, 145 F.3d 194, 197 (4th Cir. 1998), the court explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the magistrate judge awarded only 40 percent of the requested fees and costs based on a determination that Brodziak prevailed on only 40 percent of his claims. This reasoning contravenes the principle set forth in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> that awards of fees and costs should not be based simply on the ratio of claims raised to claims prevailed upon. Accordingly, we vacate the award of attorneys' fees and costs. On remand, the magistrate judge should consider the relationship between various claims raised by Brodziak and the degree of overall success obtained in determining an appropriate award of fees and costs<span class="Italic">. See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Donelson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01996394 (2001), the Commission found that a 15% reduction in the fee was warranted in a case involving four complaints with multiple issues, where the complainant ultimately prevailed on only two of them in one complaint. However, the Commission noted that the complainant had prevailed on the most significant claims and that the relief ordered would not have been greatly increased by prevailing on the remaining claims. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0720130023 (2014) (25% reduction appropriate where claims related to reasonable accommodation where not related to retaliation claims on which complainant prevailed).</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to properly document time charges can lead to a percentage reduction in the fee. In <span class="Italic">Altman v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A1691 (2002), the Commission agreed with a 70% reduction in the fee where the complainant prevailed on only one of four claims and the time records of the attorneys were not <span id="Page_2013"></span>sufficiently detailed to permit an allocation of the hours to the separate claims. The Commission noted that "[f]irst, it is the attorney's responsibility to provide sufficiently detailed time records so that the agency can determine whether the fees claimed were proper." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Where only a partial fee award is appropriate, a full fee award is not justified as a sanction because the agency attorney reviewing the fee request has a conflict of interest. In <span class="Italic">Bartner v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01966904 (1998), the Commission rejected the complainant's argument, noting there was no support for awarding full fees because of the conflict of interest and that the agency's reasons for reducing the award were sound.</p>
