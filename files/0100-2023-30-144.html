<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-135"><span class="space">d.</span> $15,001-$20,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $16,000 in nonpecuniary damages for depression, anxiety, sleep deprivation, and family problems in <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Secretary of Defense, AAF</span>, 01956675 (1998). The Commission considered the complainant's testimony, as well as a "rather conclusory" report from the complainant's psychotherapist. The Commission also considered evidence of a "clear pattern of discrimination," including low rankings on three straight appraisals following the complainant's EEO activity. The award was mitigated by evidence showing that some of the complainant's problems were caused by his wife's drinking and problems with his stepdaughter. Moreover, the medical report indicated that some of the complainant's stress was due to participating in the EEO process, which is not compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $16,000 by the administrative judge was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0720120040 (2013), where the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in support of her claim for compensatory damages, Complainant only offered her testimony and did not provide medical documentation or testimony from her family or friends. Complainant stated that the discrimination had both mental and physical effects on her. Complainant stated that she has been diagnosed with depression and has been prescribed medication for her condition since 2009 up until the hearing in 2012. Complainant also described feelings of stress and being overwhelmed because of the discrimination. With regard to physical effects, Complainant stated that she gets headaches, has a hard time sleeping, has an upset stomach, and she cannot concentrate at work. The AJ found her testimony to be credible, and there is nothing in the record that would justify second guessing his credibility determination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Shulte v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995576 (2002), the Commission awarded $17,500 in damages where the discriminatory harassment exacerbated a preexisting alcohol abuse problem and depressive condition. In <span class="Italic">Shulte</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her statement supporting non-pecuniary damages, dated September 25, 1998, complainant described the stress and trauma she suffered as a result of being harassed by her supervisor. Complainant also indicated that her personal relationships had been devastated and some were destroyed as a result of the harassment. Complainant indicated that her ex-husband could not understand why she could not prevent the harassment from happening and eventually thought that she was the cause of the harassment. Complainant also indicated that as a result of the harassment she began drinking more heavily. The record also included submissions from complainant's co-workers, and ex-husband describing complainant's condition when the claimed discrimination occurred. Complainant's co-workers described instances where complainant was embarrassed and humiliated by management. These instances included the disclosure of confidential medical information about complainant's condition to employees; clipped magazine ads for the sale of beer and alcohol placed in complainant's work area; complainant being described as a troublemaker and a man chaser after she complained about the harassment; and management not following through to determine if the harassment ceased. Complainant's ex-husband also attributed the claimed harassment as the cause of complainant's dramatic mood changes. He also indicated that complainant became depressed and withdrawn and that her behavior became very unpredictable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record showed that complainant appeared to have a pre-existing condition consisting of alcohol abuse since age 13, with one inpatient alcohol treatment admission in 1986. The record also showed that complainant suffered from a bipolar disorder with multiple episodes of depression with a longstanding personality disorder, mixed type with borderline and passive dependent features. After reviewing complainant's medical history and meeting with her for two hours, the agency psychiatrist concluded that there was no evidence that the harassment as complainant described had any impact on her pre-existing conditions. In contrast, complainant's own psychiatrist, who regularly saw complainant in 1997 and 1998, indicated that complainant has had significant difficulties in part related to the tremendous stress that she experienced regarding sexual harassment and other issues in the work place. Further, there is evidence in the record that complainant received counseling from a center that assisted victims of sexual assault and harassment in 1995, and that complainant continued to receive treatment. The record also contained information that complainant was still in treatment in 1998. Based on this evidence we find that complainant has established a causal nexus between the discrimination that occurred and the emotional harm she suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by complainant, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $17,500.00. We note that this sum is meant to compensate complainant for the emotional distress she suffered, which was caused entirely by the agency's discriminatory actions. Finally, this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989) at 574.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $17,500 in damages was affirmed by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Avila v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07A60023 (2006). The administrative judge found that the complainant suffered physical and emotional distress as a result of the discrimination, her blood pressure increased, she suffered from anxiety and depression, and was humiliated by being required to attend training that was designed for far more junior officers.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also awarded a total of $17,500 in damages in <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060070 (2008), where the part of the award was for physical pain that resulted from the agency's failure to provide accommodation. The agency did not dispute the $10,000 award by the administrative judge for emotional distress, but did challenge the $50,000 awarded by the judge for physical pain. The Commission found that the physical pain award, premised on the fact that the complainant's temporary assignment to other facilities required him to walk more, was not supported by the evidence and would have amounted to $1,700 per day for each temporary assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $18,000 in compensatory damages where the discrimination spanned some 13 months and the complainant developed high blood pressure and significant psychological trauma as evidenced by the testimony of her husband and doctor. <span class="Italic">Lam v. Secretary of Agriculture,</span> 01961589 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">But in a case that is hard to reconcile with <span class="Italic">Lam</span>, the Commission awarded only $20,000 where the employee had suffered egregious sexual harassment over a four-year period of time. In <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01961474 (1999), the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the agency's position. The agency's award of compensatory damages was based on a typographical error and is clearly inadequate in view of the extensive findings regarding "serious, continuous and pervasive" harassment suffered by the appellant over a period of four years. The AJ found that the appellant was subjected to humiliating and embarrassing remarks of a sexual nature on a daily basis by two of her co-workers for over four years. The daily remarks included references to the appellant as: a "fat drunk thing," "fat pig," "pretty monster," "blonde bimbo," "six packer," "suck the chrome off a bumper," "biker b****," "blonde b****," "slut," "Harley b****," "changes boyfriends like we change clothes," "sucks him," "f**ks them and leaves them," and "wonder if he rides the bike as much as he rides her." The agency officials (Mr. AF, a supervisor; and, Ms. BG, Manager of Customer Services Operations) failed to take any action to stop the harassment in spite of the appellant's repeated complaints to them. The AJ found that the appellant credibly testified that the harassment distracted her from work; and, she had difficulty sleeping, experienced frequent anxiety and crying episodes, suffered headaches and nosebleeds, and declined most overtime work and took sick and annual leave to escape the harassment. Appellant's co-workers corroborated the appellant's testimony regarding the persistent harassment as well as the emotional and physical distress suffered by her. Some of them testified that at times the appellant was near a breaking point. Appellant would often wait in the car after returning from her street duties and cry because she was not able to go into the post office and face her two harassers while casing her mail; she would wait until the two harassers finished their shifts. Although the appellant was unable to document her claim for the amount of sick and annual leave used by her as a result of the sexual harassment, the agency's award of $22,000 for lost overtime opportunities is supportive of the appellant's claim that she suffered serious emotional and physical distress as a result of the sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although there are no definitive rules governing the amount of nonpecuniary damages which can be awarded, an award must be <span id="Page_1849"></span>adequate to fully compensate the injured party for the agency's discriminatory action even if the harm is intangible. The award must take into account the severity of the harm and the length of the time that the injured party has suffered from the harm. However, the amount of an award for non-pecuniary losses should not be monstrously excessive or the product of passion or prejudice. Here, we find an award of $20,000 in compensatory damages for the severe and continuous emotional and physical distress suffered by the appellant for a period of over four years appropriate and consistent with our past awards in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. April v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01963775 (June 5, 1997); <span class="Italic">Bever v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01953949 (Oct. 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Sinnott v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952872 (Sept. 19, 1996); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943844 (May 9, 1996); and <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (Nov. 13, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">The award seems extraordinarily low considering that the Commission deemed some of the harassment so extreme, it refused to print the actual words used in its decision without resort to asterisks.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sinnott v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01952872 (1996), the Commission awarded $20,000 in damages where the discrimination resulted in the complainant suffering from nightmares and heart palpitations, interfered with her marital relations, and she remained reluctant to work with males. The Commission noted that some of the discriminatory conduct occurred prior to the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act and, therefore, the complainant could not recover damages for the harm done by that conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also awarded $20,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Canino v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01983857 (2000), where the emotional distress was reasonably severe and lasted approximately 10 months. The complainant had feelings of fear, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and intermittent panic attacks, along with a brief period of hospitalization.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an agency damage award of $10,000 to $20,000 in <span class="Italic">Darrell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01992288 (2001), <span class="Italic">reaffirmed</span> <span class="Italic">Darrell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05A10286 (2001), where the complainant testified that she had a sexual identity crisis that led to an affair with another woman after being subject to several months of sexual harassment. The Commission also noted that the complainant continued to suffer from the effects of the discrimination nearly four years later and had abandoned her career aspirations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission increased an award from $6,000 to $20,000 in <span class="Italic">Ashlea P. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141369 (2016), where the complainant alleged that she was subjected to a coworker "who wore his shorts 'in a manner that significantly outlined and occasionally exposed his penis,' often without underwear, and at times with an erection." The Commission ordered a supplemental investigation for the agency to determine compensatory damages. The agency awarded $6,000, noting that the harassment occurred on five different days. The Commission rejected the agency's attempt to minimize the duration of the harm by characterizing the harassment as having occurred over five days rather than five alleged incidents occurring over a period of five to six months. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Ashlea P</span>., noted the harm suffered by complainant due to the agency's delay in addressing the harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant attested that she developed anxiety in November 2009 and gastrointestinal difficulties (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting) on her way to work in early 2010. The record also contains a letter from Complainant's daughter, stating that Complainant was "reluctant to go to work," "spent increased time in bed," "sullen and despondent," and "never seemed to want to spent time with me or family members, or go out at all." Similarly, Complainant's Aunt stated that Complainant exhibited "some nervousness, a fear of being home alone...fear of going out walking, shopping...." A May 2010 letter from Complainant's physician noted that Complainant's diabetes was "poorly controlled" and that the "recent stress at work" was a contributing factor. Complainant's therapist began treating Complainant in May 2010, when she was referred by her primary care physician due to "significant stress and anxiety related to her job." She was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. According to Complainant's therapist, she suffered from depressed mood, irritability, anxiety, sleep difficult, loss of interest and excessive worrying. Even at that time, November 2010, Complainant "remains in treatment one time every 1 to 3 weeks." Complainant was prescribed Xanax and Zoloft.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to Clerk G's conduct, we also consider the Agency's failure to address the situation. On appeal, Complainant describes the intense emotional pain resulting from management's mishandling of her complaint, a loss of self-esteem when the Agency took no steps to separate them or ensure her confidentiality. She did not feel that her concerns were taken seriously when, for example, management suggested that she simply look away or turn her station around.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Colwell v. Postmaster General</span>, 01985789 (2001), the Commission awarded $20,000 in damages where the complainant presented evidence that the agency's discrimination was a contributing factor in her depression and emotional stress for which she received psychological treatment, her loss of credit standing due to her inability to pay bills, and her loss of professional status because it was difficult for her to find a job in her chosen field after being removed for poor attendance and performance. The Commission took into account the fact that the agency's discrimination was not the sole cause of her distress and that the complainant did not demonstrate that her work record was a "primary factor" in her inability to find employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $20,000 was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Telles v. Postmaster General</span>, 01994535 (2002), where the complainant testified that he suffered various symptoms of emotional distress over a three and a half year period between his termination and resolution of his case. The complainant also testified he had marital problems and problems relating to his children. In <span class="Italic">Reiley v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10019 (2002), the Commission upheld an award of $20,000 in damages with virtually no discussion of the injuries suffered by the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $20,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">St. John v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996706 (2002), where the Commission determined there were several outside causes for the complainant's emotional distress, including injury in an automobile accident, separation and divorce from her husband, and a misdiagnosis of terminal lung cancer.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Avery v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A04201 (2003), the Commission increased a damage award of $5,000 to $20,000 where the complainant's supervisor discriminated against him in work assignments and that permeated the work environment. The complainant testified that discrimination made him feel like a second-class citizen and that he ceased to enjoy his work. The complainant's wife submitted an affidavit testifying that he was an ideal worker, husband and family member prior to the discrimination, but that he became constantly irritable, was subject to outbursts of temper, and stopped communicating with her and his family. Likewise, an award of $20,000 was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 07A20043 (2003), where the complainant suffered emotional distress, insomnia, anxiety, stress, depression, humiliation, loss of self-esteem and interfered with marital and family relations. The Commission did not indicate the duration of the symptoms.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $2,500 was increased to $20,000 in <span class="Italic">Green v. Social Security Administration</span>, 01A22077 (2003), where the complainant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder for an extended period of time. The complainant presented evidence that she had been a happy and outgoing before the harassment and that after she suffered from anxiety, hopelessness, nightmares, nausea, crying bouts and loss of self-esteem. As a result, she also experienced marital difficulties.</p>
<p class="noindent">A damage award of $60,000 by the administrative judge was reduced to $20,000 in <span class="Italic">Perez v. Postmaster General,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A20117.txt">07A20117</a> (2003), where the agency's failure to hire the complainant caused him to experience anger, humiliation, depression and marital problems and he was forced to perform harder manual labor with fewer benefits in another job for a period of two and a half years. In making the award, the Commission noted that the complainant did not experience any physical symptoms from the emotional distress and did not seek medical treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Curry v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A22291 (2003), the Commission awarded $20,000 in damages where the complainant developed both mental and physical symptoms as a result of 10 months of harassment. The complainant required medical treatment for stress and anxiety. She also experienced severe migraine headaches, took extensive sick leave, and worried about her son's employment status with the agency. In <span class="Italic">Verlarde v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A22780 (2003), the Commission awarded $20,000 in damages where the complainant suffered several years of depression, had physical symptoms of stress, and became estranged from this family.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered severe emotional distress from 1992 through 2003 as the result of sexual harassment, the Commission increased an agency damage award of $5,000 to $20,000. In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A33363 (2004), the complainant suffered from depression that required treatment and testified that she was a "virtual prisoner in [her] own home" because of her fear of contact with others, and experienced panic attacks on the way to the grocery store.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Flowers v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A43114.txt">01A43114</a> (2004), the Commission increased a damage award from $9,500 to $20,000 even where there were other causes for the harm:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we take notice that complainant also suffered from factors unrelated to her non-selection and she did not show any medical evidence of her harm, we find that complainant has sufficiently proved that she is due a larger award based on our review of similar cases. We also give credence to the fact that: (1) complainant suffered sleeplessness, depression, emotional distress and anxiety for approximately seven years, since 1995; (2) complainant's loss of income through her becoming unemployed and her and her family's uncertain future caused her significant stress and anxiety; (3) complainant's economic deprivation caused her loss of enjoyment of life, loss of relationship with her family; and (4) complainant had many episodes of crying due to her and her family's plight, but that she did not undertake treatment or counseling from any health care or lay provider due to lack of monies to support such. This evidence provides a sufficient nexus between the discriminatory conduct and the emotional distress detailed in the record. A $20,000.00 <span id="Page_1850"></span>non-pecuniary damages award is consistent with other awards that we have issued in similar situations. For example, the Commission awarded a complainant $20,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered from depression and anxiety for six to seven months, followed by a four to five month period of major depression, due to the agency's discrimination. <span class="Italic">Money v. United States Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01974494 (May 24, 2000). In addition, the Commission awarded a complainant $20,000.00 for an undetermined length of injury for complainant's depression and emotional distress, loss of credit standing, and loss of professional standing. <span class="Italic">Colwell v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01985789 (June 13, 2001). Furthermore, the Commission awarded $25,000.00 for sleep problems, frequent crying, weight loss, depression, embarrassment, mental anguish, loss of relationships with his wife, family, and friends, lasting approximately two and a half years, but mitigated by evidence that other factors unrelated to agency's discrimination contributed to complainant's distress. <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996) request to reconsider denied, EEOC Request No. 05970336 (November 20, 1997). Moreover, the Commission awarded a complainant $35,000.00 for discrimination when complainant and his wife testified that complainant suffered severe stress, sleeplessness, and misery as a result of the agency failing to reasonably accommodate his disability. <span class="Italic">See Feris v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983167 (September 18, 1998). We point out that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are intended to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions. <span class="Italic">See Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura</span>, 477 U.S. 299, 311-12 (1986) (stating that a compensatory damages determination must be based on the actual harm sustained and not the facts of the underlying case). Therefore, we modify the AJ's decision award complainant $20,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Peebles v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A31967.txt">01A31967</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $20,000 in damages where the complainant had a preexisting condition. The Commission increased the award from the $7,500 set by the administrative judge because some of the complainant's hospitalizations and psychiatric visits occurred during the period of discrimination, her doctors noted that the complainant was under considerable stress because of work, and she submitted statements from other witnesses attesting that the emotional distress was due to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $20,000 in damages was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A33384.txt">01A33384</a> (2004), where the complainant suffered from sleeplessness, felt unprotected and had nightmares because of the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">A damage award of $28,000 by the administrative judge was reduced by the Commission to $20,000 where the judge improperly determined the length of the period of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Higgins v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30086 (2005), the judge premised his damage award on the finding that the complainant had been subjected to retaliation and denied accommodation for a period of one year. On appeal, the Commission determined the appropriate period for the award was nine months.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jambora v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40128 (2006), where the agency's failure to accommodate led to a constructive discharge, the Commission awarded $20,000 in damages. In part, the damage award was relatively low given the circumstances because testimony established that some of the stress was caused by litigation. This was also corroborated by the complainant's documentary evidence showing that she did not take psychotropic or sleep medication until just before the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency's discriminatory termination of the complainant led to a deterioration in her relationship with her mother and the cancelation of her engagement, the Commission found that an award of $20,000 in damages was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Hiller v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120072290 (2008), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following a hearing, the AJ concluded that complainant was terminated from her position on account of her prior EEO activity. With respect to the award of compensatory damages, the AJ concluded that before complainant's termination, she and her mother had a close relationship; they would speak to each other on a daily basis, sing karaoke, go on picnics, and ride horses together. In addition, the AJ noted that complainant and her boyfriend (C1) were engaged and planned to be married and had spent $5000 on the upcoming marriage. The AJ also noted that after the agency terminated complainant's employment, she felt depressed and inadequate. She was extremely moody, and had bouts of anxiety. Complainant's mother could not communicate normally with complainant because the mother feared that the agency would take retaliatory action if she communicated with her daughter. The AJ also noted that similarly, the agency's action poisoned complainant's relationship with C1. After her termination, complainant would come home and display an explosive personality toward C1; she would lash out at him. Their relationship deteriorated to the point that they separated and cancelled their marriage plans which included a proposed marriage date of September 20, 2003.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Clemente v. Attorney General</span>, 0720080012 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recon.</span> 052009075 (2009), the Commission overturned the decision of the administrative judge denying nonpecuniary damages and awarded $20,000 in damages. One of the interesting features about <span class="Italic">Clemente</span> is the Commission's reliance on the nature of the discrimination, a nonselection, as a factor in damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that he was treated for work related stress between August 7, 2002, and December 2006. Complainant also maintained that he suffered depression and was angry all of the time which adversely impacted his relationship with his wife. Complainant testified that he became withdrawn and spent less time doing activities with his wife and that they were less intimate. He also testified that he became estranged from his family and ceased communicating with his siblings unless his wife directed him to do so. He indicated that his sleep was adversely affected and that he had been treated at an emergency room for heart palpitations during 2004.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, contrary to the AJ's decision which denied non-pecuniary damages, that complainant has established a nexus between the alleged harm and discrimination. While it appears that complainant suffered work stress prior to the subject nonselections, complainant's testimony reveals that he was affected by the agency's discriminatory conduct in the present case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, we find that, given that the agency's discrimination resulted in a severe consequence, namely a non-selection, it is reasonable to infer that complainant's testimony that he suffered emotional distress, and that the discrimination had a detrimental effect on his medical state, is accurate. <span class="Italic">See Yeats v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01973250 (March 11, 1999). Moreover, a damage award can be based on evidence consisting of complainant's statement explaining the effects of the discrimination and/or statements from others addressing the outward manifestations of the impact of the discrimination on complainant. <span class="Italic">See Carle v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (January 5, 1993); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, despite evidence of contributing factors to complainant's emotion distress, to include the EEO processing, and some situations in his personal life, we find that complainant provided sufficient testimony and a sworn statement indicating that he suffered emotionally as a direct consequence of the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proper award of compensatory damages must meet two goals: it must not be "monstrously excessive"; and it should be consistent with awards in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Jackson &#x0026; Beaneer v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 01972555 &#x0026; 01972556 (April 15, 1999). In this case, we find that an award of $20,000.00 satisfies these goals and is proper. Specifically, we find that, despite record evidence showing that much of the emotional distress for which complainant was treated was associated with situational work stress, there is nonetheless also evidence of record to show that he suffered a significant degree of emotional distress as a consequence of the discriminatory actions of the agency in the present case. There is also sufficient evidence to show that this emotional distress, and other harm, is comparable to that described in other Commission cases. In <span class="Italic">Flowers v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A3114 (October 7, 2004), EEOC Request No. 05A50243 (January 11, 2005), the Commission awarded $20,000 in compensatory damages upon a showing that, despite other contributing factors, the agency's disability-based discriminatory failure to hire complainant resulted in sleeplessness, depression, emotional distress, anxiety, loss of enjoyment of life and strained family relationships. In <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20043 (May 5, 2003), the Commission awarded $20,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages where a discriminatory non-selection occurred. There, the award was based on testimony from complainant and his family as to emotional distress, insomnia, anxiety, stress, depression, marital strain, humiliation, loss of self-esteem, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and injury to relations with family. In <span class="Italic">Minardi v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01981995 (October 3, 2000), another discriminatory non-selection, despite evidence of contributing factors, the Commission awarded $20,000 in compensatory damages upon evidence that complainant experienced headaches, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depression, panic attacks, loss of self-esteem, tension, loss of reputation and loss of enjoyment of life, as corroborated by friends and a physician statement. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Randle-Harris v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A04769 (March 6, 2001), EEOC Request No. 05A10468 (June 19, 2001), the Commission awarded $15,000 in compensatory damages with evidence showing that the discrimination interfered with the complainant's relationships of both friends and family, and that complainant experienced a worsening of sickle cell anemia and depression after a disability-based termination. Based on the foregoing factors, we modify the AJ's decision and award complainant $20,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $20,000 in damages was upheld on appeal in <span id="Page_1851"></span><span class="Italic">Reid v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070077 (2009), where the complainant and her husband presented testimony that her nonselection resulted in depression, difficulty sleeping and episodes of crying and overeating. She also testified that the nonselection harmed her professional reputation and her husband testified that it impact family relations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected an agency argument that an award of $20,000 in damages was too high because the complainant's testimony was not corroborated by family or friends in <span class="Italic">Thomas-Madison v. Attorney General</span>, 0720100053 (2011), explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will limit our review to the two issues squarely before us on appeal. The first issue is the $20,000.00 compensatory damage award. The AJ found that Complainant credibly testified regarding her emotional harm. Complainant suffered anxiety which required hospitalization and medication. Several months after the abusive conduct occurred, she remained under significant stress which sometimes caused her to break out in rashes. The AJ found that the referral to the EAP left her embarrassed and humiliated. The AJ cited a broad spectrum of nonpecuniary awards for similar suffering ($10,000-$100,000) and concluded that $20,000.00 was appropriate to compensate Complainant, a long term Agency employee, for what happened to her in 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In objecting to this amount, the Agency cited to several Commission decisions suggesting that a smaller award was all that was due. The Agency noted in particular the fact that Complainant's testimony was not corroborated by family, friends or medical/mental health records. We are not persuaded by the suggestion that Complainant's testimony was insufficient to establish what she experienced and how she felt about the Agency's actions. The Commission has long held that medical documentation is not required to support an award for pain and suffering, and the Agency makes no argument that the AJ's factual findings regarding the harm Complainant suffered are not supported by substantial evidence. We do not find this award to be punitive in nature or "monstrously excessive" and we decline to disturb the AJ's judgment about the seriousness of Complainant's pain.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $1,000 in damages by the agency was increased to $20,000 in <span class="Italic">Compton v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120083066 (2011), finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to non-pecuniary damages, Complainant's psychiatrist noted that Complainant experienced emotional and physical suffering due to the Agency's actions. Complainant's psychiatrist noted that Complainant experienced the following symptoms: depression, loss of appetite, difficulty with sleep, nightmares, nervousness, panic attacks, irritability, forms of palpitation, choking feeling, fear of passing out, mounting fear lasting for 10 minutes, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Complainant's psychiatrist noted that Complainant had to take medications as a result of the discrimination that she suffered. Complainant's psychiatrist noted that Complainant visited him up until June 1, 2006, wherein he advised her to continue to take medication because she continued to experience a high level of anxiety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant noted that she was transferred to the Nursing Home Care Unit after she raised allegations of a hostile work environment. Complainant noted she was thereafter transferred, at her request, to the Quality Improvement Section for approximately one week, where she was satisfied. However, Complainant noted that S3 involuntarily transferred her again to a position in the Surgery Department, wherein she had difficulty performing the physical demands of the position. Complainant noted that she was embarrassed and scared when she was transferred from her Emergency Room position. Complainant noted that as a result she, among other things, has had trouble with her family life, and suffers from depression as a result of the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several Commission decisions have addressed compensatory damages in cases similar to Complainant's. <span class="Italic">See Mayfield v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A44178 (Mar. 23, 2005) ($20,000 awarded after complainant was reassigned, and she suffered, among other things, migraine headaches, chest pains, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, hypertension, anxiety attacks, stomach pain, and professional embarrassment. <span class="Italic">Clements v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A50052 (June 29, 2006) ($15,000 awarded after complainant's job duties were given to other employees, and she suffered from headaches, insomnia, and loss of hair, requiring prescription medication); <span class="Italic">Norte v. Dep't of Energy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A24738 (Dec. 12, 2003) (complainant awarded $15,000 after her job classification was changed and she felt humiliated, demeaned, and degraded, and had overwhelming feelings of dread, foreboding, anxiety, sadness, helplessness, and hopelessness); <span class="Italic">Pearman v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No-07A40063 (Nov. 18, 2004) (incidents of retaliation over four months warranted an award of $15,000.00 where other factors may have contributed to damages); <span class="Italic">Reneau v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A30568 (April 20, 2004) <span class="Italic">request for recon. den'd,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A40847 (Aug. 17, 2004) ($20,000.00 awarded after complainant was reassigned and removed from her position and she experienced anxiety and depression).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the above, we find the Agency's award of $1,000 insufficient to compensate Complainant for her pain and suffering. In considering the appropriate award in this case, we note that Complainant suffered emotional distress due to events that she was unable to prove were discriminatory. However, we also find that Complainant suffered from emotional distress for which she should be compensated. We therefore find that the evidence supports an award of $20,000. This amount takes into account the severity and the likely duration of the harm done to Complainant by the Agency's action. The Commission further notes that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that other external factors also cause the complainant emotional distress, such as the illness of a spouse, does not mean an award should be reduced where the administrative judge properly accounts for those factors. In <span class="Italic">Esylee v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720100050 (2011), the Commission upheld an award of $20,000 noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the AJ's award of $20,000 for non-pecuniary, compensatory damages was proper. The award is consistent with prior awards by the Commission in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Hatton v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01985377 (June 6, 2000) ($25,000.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages awarded for prolonged feelings of frustration, anger, loss of self esteem, and a sense of betrayal); <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Veterans Admin.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30068 (Oct. 30, 2003) ($20,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages awarded for complainant's testimony of emotional distress, headaches, and sleeplessness). The AJ based the award on Complainant's testimony that she suffered from anxiety, stress, sleeplessness, humiliation, and the feeling that she could not do anything to change her situation. Placing Complainant on a PIP, denying her the use of flexiplace, denying her OJI opportunities, not selecting her for a vacancy, and evaluating her at a lower rate, caused Complainant anxiety, humiliation, stress, sleeplessness, and powerlessness. We disagree with the Agency's argument that the AJ did not consider the contribution of the health condition of Complainant's husband. The AJ specifically noted that Complainant also suffered from stress at home, partially attributable to the health problems of Complainant's husband. The AJ's award takes into account the severity and the duration of the harm to Complainant by the Agency's actions but also recognized that some of Complainant's stress was related to the health of Complainant's husband.</p>
<p class="noindent">A $10,000 award by the administrative judge was increased to $20,000 in <span class="Italic">Shimko v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093033 (2012), where because of his physical condition and appearance his supervisor and coworkers called him Forrest Gump. Although the complainant had a history of pain, anger and depression, those conditions were aggravated by the workplace harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $2,500 in damages was increased to $20,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Rafalski v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093891 (2012), where the agency failed to accommodate the complainant's back condition for some 18 months by providing an ergonomic chair. In increasing the award in <span class="Italic">Rafalski</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon a review of the instant record, we find that the Agency's award of non-pecuniary damages should be increased to $20,000. While Complainant suffered from back problems prior to the discriminatory actions, it is reasonable to find that the denial of a doctor-prescribed accommodation (i.e. an ergonomic chair) for approximately eighteen months resulted in an aggravation of his condition. Moreover, Complainant attested the he suffered from depression, sleeplessness, irritability, problems with concentration and loss of self-esteem. This award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases...</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an agency award of $20,000 where the failure to accommodate led to sleeplessness, a dread of going to work, weight gain and high blood pressure from stress. The complainant also said her social and marital relations were negatively effected and submitted affidavits from family and friends in support of her own statement. <span class="Italic">Logan-Arrington v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120121792 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure to establish a causal connection between much of the harm alleged that the retaliatory nonselections led the Commission to affirm an agency award of $20,000 in <span class="Italic">McFarland v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 012010392 (2013). For example, a physician's note that complainant thought she was getting depressed because of the situation at work predated the retaliation. In addition, although the complainant's treatment for irritable bowel syndrome postdated the retaliation there was not evidence linking the condition the retaliation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A failure to cooperate in discovery led to a limitation on damage evidence that resulted in only a $20,000 award in <span class="Italic">Strafford v. Attorney General</span>, 0520130322 (2013)--an egregious case of sexual harassment where a supervisor repeatedly pressured a complainant for a relationship and warned a coworker dating her that he would "cut his balls off." The administrative judge ruled that as a sanction the complainant could not submit any documentary evidence of damages beyond what was already in the report of investigation. The judge then awarded $5,000 which the Commission increased to $20,000 on <span id="Page_1852"></span>appeal. In denying the agency's request for reconsideration in Stafford, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that the harassing conduct in this case was inherently degrading and humiliating, we find that the previous decision appropriately awarded Complainant $20,000 for emotional damages. The AJ found credible Complainant's testimony that, for ten months, she feared to be alone with the supervisor and felt uncomfortable, dirty, and embarrassed. She hated going to work and at one point wanted to resign. She was visibly upset at work, cried, experienced nausea and vomiting, and slept restlessly. We find no clear error in awarding $20,000 for such constant and frequent emotional distress. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Banks v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A20037 (Sept. 29, 2003) ($35,000 awarded for 18 months of fearing for her safety and being humiliated, intimidated, embarrassed, deeply depressed, with no medical evidence produced); <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dep't of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112249 (Mar. 19, 2013) ($30,000 awarded for a complainant who, for between one to two years, feared for her safety and felt shock, embarrassment, dirty, and violated with no subsequent petition for compensatory damages).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We see no reason to lower the award of $20,000 in compensatory damages merely because Complainant's first and second husbands died around the relevant time period. We have found no evidence tying the deaths of her former spouses to her negative feelings about work, her fear of being alone with her supervisor, her feelings of being uncomfortable and embarrassed, or the feeling that she was dirty. There is no evidence in the record to show that the deaths of her former spouses caused her to become nauseated and vomit, or caused her to cry after she rebuffed yet another sexual advance from her supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The mere fact that two of her former spouses died is insufficient to infer that these matters must have caused Complainant to experience some lingering emotional distress. Indeed, Complainant in her testimony explicitly rebuffed those suggestions from the Agency and the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding her first husband, who was the father of her children, Complainant testified that there was stress at the beginning stages of their separation and divorce because he would not pay for child support. But once that issue was resolved, "he didn't cause any other stress." She maintained that the death of her first husband was not traumatic to her. "I was glad that he died, but I was saddened for my children that their father had--had died."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the hearing, the AJ questioned Complainant whether she had been severely depressed from the time that her second husband died in July 2008 to November 2008 when she began dating a coworker. Complainant acknowledged that she had been saddened by the death, but she had not been severely depressed because she and her second husband had already separated before his death.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the previous decision and the entire record, the Commission finds that the request fails to meet the criteria of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.405(b), and it is the decision of the Commission to deny the request. The decision in EEOC Appeal No. 0120121638 remains the Commission's decision. There is no further right of administrative appeal on the decision of the Commission on this request. The Agency shall comply with the Order as set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected an argument that the complainant was entitled to $75,000 in damages and awarded $20,000 in a case where the complainant was seeing a psychiatrist prior to the discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123309 (2014), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requested $75,000.00 for non-pecuniary losses. Complainant claimed that the discriminatory non-selection "upset" him. Specifically, he said the non-selection caused mental and emotional distress, physical pain, mood changes, headaches, loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, relationship issues with his wife and son, social withdrawal, anxiety, disruption of daily activities, inconvenience, humiliation, and loss of enjoyment of life. He contends the non-selection caused him "a lot of anguish, stress, emotional distress as well as mental distress, mood changes, headaches, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and just functions in [his] daily activities." Complainant stated that when he was informed of his non-selection he was "upset," and that he thought about it for a week, and went to talk with his supervisor to find out why he was not selected. Complainant contends that there was a lot of back and forth but that he never got the information he wanted regarding the reasons for the non-selection. Complainant submitted affidavits from himself and his spouse; and statements from his sister, sister-in-law, three co-workers, his spouse's physician, and his own psychologist, in support of his compensatory damages claim. He also submitted medical progress notes from January 5, 2001 to August 26, 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">See Wallis v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (Nov. 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Mach, Co</span>., 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987)). However, the Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a complainant has a preexisting condition, the Agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. Second, if the complainant's preexisting condition inevitably would have worsened, the Agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination; the burden of proof is on the Agency to establish the extent of this entitlement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that Complainant attributed his elevated stress to many factors. Complainant's testimony, his spouse's testimony, and the physician notes all indicate that Complainant has battled with depression many years before the non-selection. Complainant was first diagnosed with depression in 2000 or 2001. His depression has been treated with medication, and Complainant stated that his prescriptions have changed over the years (his dosages have also increased). Complainant also acknowledged that he started receiving psychological treatment in 2004, over a year before the non-selection, and he stated that he began receiving medical treatment long before that in 1975, for a service-connected headache condition. Complainant's principal argument is the non-selection aggravated his mental and physical conditions.... Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by Complainant, we find the Agency's award of non-pecuniary, compensatory damages in the amount of $20,000.00 to be reasonable. The Commission has supported compensatory damages awards for similar amounts in cases where similar harm has occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $6,000 by the agency was increased to $20,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Yun C. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141368 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the Agency's adverse conduct here in failing to address a situation that was inherently degrading and humiliating, we find it reasonable to accept Complainant's affidavit of emotional distress to support an award for emotional damages. We find it appropriate to award Complainant $20,000 because her affidavit testimony, along with her supporting witness, established that, during the relevant period, she felt humiliated, degraded and "unworthiness" when the Agency did not investigate her claims properly. Specifically, Complainant stated "the whole investigation has not been handled smoothly or consistent with anyone of us that was involved. I asked [a named Agency official] if she had heard anything on the investigation and she said that she had been told that it took a long time. This is not satisfactory. No one should have to work under this type of sexual harassment. The instances that [G] continued to flaunt his genitals became more frequent. And caused nerves to rattled. I felt that management had not followed Postal Policy and had betrayed us because other supervisors began to know about the situation and who was involved...it is unnecessary for something of this nature to go on for so long. It has been 4 months at the end of December with no follow up from [HRM]. She has yet to get in touch with me at 10 months out of initial complaint. The sexual harassment has continued with no resolution in sight."</p>
