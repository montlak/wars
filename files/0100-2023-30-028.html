<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-29"><span class="space">a.</span> Level of Back Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">In many instances, determining the level of back pay is a relatively simple matter, particularly in those positions covered by the GS, or General Schedule, where an agency has little discretion in determining the grade and step level of an employee who is newly hired or promoted. However, the more discretion that an agency has in this regard, the more likely it is that the Commission will order back pay at the level or levels actually received by the selectee even if the agency may have given the complainant a lesser level of pay had he or she been initially selected.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the precise parameters are not defined, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120072120 (2010), the Commission, explained at length, why it was ordering the back pay award to be calculated according to the higher rate received by the selectee and not the lower rate that the agency contended it would have paid had it initially selected the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ ordered the agency to promote complainant retroactively to the position of Labor Relations Specialist, at whatever EAS level the selectee, E1, assumed at the time E1 was promoted. The record shows that E1 was promoted on October 11, 1997 to EAS 17 with an accompanying base salary of $49,461.00. Complainant states that for every EAS level, the agency has a range of salaries, including a minimum, mid-level and a high range salary, and that instead of minoring E1's salary, the agency's back pay calculation assigned to complainant a starting salary at the lowest possible EAS 17 level. Complainant states that this was improper and that her starting salary should have been the same as E1's starting salary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency claims that E1's starting salary at the time of his promotion reflected his prior work at the EAS 16 level and therefore he was entitled to an 8% raise upon his promotion to the EAS 17 level. Complainant, the agency argues, was permanently assigned to a mail handling position at the PS 06 level, and therefore, complainant's base salary upon her promotion to EAS 17 was at the entry level salary shown on the PS Form 50 or $42,553.00.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously ordered an award of back pay to reflect the salary actually paid to the selectee, rather than a lower base salary that might have been offered, where the circumstances require. <span class="Italic">See Dropka v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A12087 (December 6, 2002). In the instant case, the AJ noted that complainant had performed the duties of the Labor Relations Specialist (LRS) for more than six years prior to the time of the selection in October 1997 and that complainant's superior qualifications were considered in the AJ's finding of discrimination. Complainant had also been paid at the higher EAS 16 level pay during her lengthy detail to the LRS position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most significantly, the AJ specifically ordered that complainant receive "salary increases, bonuses, merit increases, awards and additional compensation...as measured by those perquisites [E1] earned or was awarded." Accordingly, we find that the appropriate measure for complainant's base salary is E1's salary upon his promotion to the LRS position in the amount of $49,461.00. Similarly, those salary increases that E1 received in the course of the back pay period are those that complainant should receive such that the two salary histories thus mirror each other, as the AJ ordered. Had the agency wanted to challenge the AJ's order that complainant's salary mirror the salary of E1, the proper venue for raising such a challenge would have been to decline to implement the AJ's decision and simultaneously file an appeal with the Commission. Instead, the agency fully implemented the AJ's decision, including the relief ordered, and is not permitted to challenge that relief now.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that the agency's starting point from which the agency should have calculated complainant's back pay award to be incorrect, we must remand this matter to the agency to recalculate, with adequate documentation, the amount of back pay and interest due complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Higher Level Pay</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant states on appeal that she is owed higher level pay for those pay periods during which the selectee, E1, received higher level pay. In response to complainant's request for higher level pay, the agency claims that complainant did not work during certain pay periods, that she had surgery for her hand in October 2001, and therefore was not entitled to higher level pay for those periods.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant replies that the agency's response does not consider that the reason complainant was not at work during some periods was because of the agency's own discriminatory behavior. Specifically, complainant points out that the AJ found the agency did not participate in the interactive process required by the Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., and also failed to accommodate complainant's known medical restrictions by failing to provide her with work that did not violate her restrictions, from April 2001 through her return to work in 2002. Complainant points out that E1's higher level assignments ended in September 2001. Complainant's surgery was not until October 2001 and accordingly, complainant requests that the agency be ordered to pay complainant the higher level pay that E1 received.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's decision ordered the agency to reimburse complainant for all salary increases, bonuses, merit increases, awards and additional compensation she would have received as a Labor Relations Specialist, as measured by those perquisites E1 earned or was awarded. Thus, we find the agency is obligated to pay complainant higher level pay during the relevant time frame that E1 received higher level pay. Moreover, we concur with complainant that the agency should not benefit from its own discrimination in failing to provide complainant with an accommodation. Upon remand, we shall order that complainant be provided with the same higher level pay as E1 was paid and that the agency provide adequate documentation to complainant accompanying its payment to her for that higher level pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Pay for Performance and Incentive Awards</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant argues that the agency produced records indicating that for each year of the back pay period (excluding 2006), complainant received a pay for performance (PFP) pay increase and therefore, complainant was owed nothing further for this type of pay that E1 received. Complainant replies that a comparison of the monies E1 and complainant received shows that complainant received less for the back pay period than E1 and therefore, complainant is due the difference to make her actual receipts for PFP pay mirror E 's receipts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given our decision to remand this matter to the agency with respect to back pay, we will also remand the matter of awards and order the agency to provide the Commission and complainant with a clear statement of the PFP and incentive awards earned by E1, together with a clear statement of any offsets the agency makes for pay or awards of a like nature received by complainant and the amount, if any, paid to complainant for the difference.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant would have completed certification that entitled her to a higher rate of pay but for a transfer to a new facility to avoid a hostile environment, she is entitled to that higher rate of pay from the time she would have completed that certification. In <span class="Italic">Coopwood v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120083127 (2012), the complainant was subjected to a hostile environment based on race that included a coworker writing the initials "KKK" on a data tag left on her desk and two instances of a noose being placed at her workstation. As a result, she asked to be transferred from the agency's Knoxville facility. The agency delayed her reassignment and terminated her training. She was then offered a job at Andrews Air Force Base. She received her "facility certification" within seven months of transferring to Andrews. In the underlying decision finding discrimination, <span class="Italic">Coopwood v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120054544 (2007), the Commission specifically found that there was nexus between her EEO activity and cancelation of the training and that her inadequate skill level was due to the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency determined that the complainant was not entitled to any back pay because her reinstatement rate of pay at Knoxville was equivalent to what she previously earned there and at Andrews. The Commission, finding that its oriGINAl relief order was unclear, remanded the case to the agency noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find it necessary to clarify the back pay order because the oriGINAl language did not precisely encapsulate all of the back pay and benefits that were possibly due to Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of a back pay award is to restore to Complainant the income she would have otherwise earned but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 442 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975); <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (Nov. 29, 1990). Back pay should include all forms of compensation and must reflect fluctuations in working time, overtime rates, penalty overtime, Sunday premium and night work, changing rate of pay, transfers, promotions, and privileges of employment to which Complainant would have been entitled but for the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Ulloa v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Petition No. 04A30025 (Aug. 3, 2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04940006 (May 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Perez v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04A40041 (Mar. 3, 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on Complainant's affidavit testimony that she completed facility-specific training at other locations within 12 months, we find that Complainant would have completed the Knoxville facility-specific training within 12 months, if her coworkers and trainers had not subjected her to race-based hostile work environment harassment. Therefore, we find that by October 24, 2000, her job status would have changed from <span id="Page_1717"></span>a "Certified Professional Controller in Training" to Certified Professional Controller who has achieved "facility certification."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We determine that the oriGINAl order in <span class="Italic">Coopwood</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120054544 did not clearly articulate to the Agency that it should calculate how Complainant's compensation would have increased if she had attained "facility certification" on October 24, 2000.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Would her base pay have increased, under the relevant labor agreement that was in effect at that time?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Would her pay rates governing such activities as night work or overtime have increased?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--What was Complainant's loss of future earning capacity for not completing the facility training by October 24, 2000? Would she have experienced step increases or been promoted to higher pay grades or positions from October 24, 2000 onward?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These are some of the outstanding questions that must be answered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we order the Agency to undertake a supplemental investigation to determine, under the terms of the relevant labor agreements in effect at that time, how much Complainant's compensation and benefits, in all their forms, would have increased, had she attained "facility certification" at Knoxville on October 24, 2000 and subsequently transferred to Andrews Air Force Base with such a job status and corresponding salary.</p>
