<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-34"><span class="space">7.</span> Priority Consideration</h4>
<p class="noindent">"Priority consideration" is a term of art and where the term is included in a settlement without further definition, the Commission will define it in a manner consistent with its precedent. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bignall-Kreckel v. Secretary of Army,</span> 01966181 (1997), provided the proper interpretation, and remanded the case to the agency to determine if priority consideration was given:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously interpreted the phrase "priority consideration" as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Priority consideration is commonly understood to mean that appellant must be considered before any formal action to recruit for the vacancy, and must be give[n] <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration on [his] own merit, without competition with other potential candidates. Priority consideration does not guarantee selection...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_362"></span><span class="Italic">Bishop v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910148 (Apr. 10, 1991) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency asserts that appellant was given priority consideration, there is no evidence that the agency has given appellant priority consideration as described in <span class="Italic">Bishop</span>. There is no evidence in the record showing that appellant was considered for the positions before any formal action to recruit for the vacancies at issue or that appellant was given <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration on his own merit without competition with other potential candidates. Therefore, we shall remand the matter for a supplemental investigation to determine whether the agency has complied with provision 3(d) of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Villareal v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A21952 (2003). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Terrance A. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 2019005518 (2020) (reversing and remanding for vagueness of a settlement agreement that did not define "priority consideration").</p>
<p class="noindent">Posting a vacancy announcement for the job before considering the complainant does not breach a priority consideration provision. In <span class="Italic">Vernia M. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0520160312 (2016), on request for reconsideration, the complainant argued that priority consideration required the agency to consider her for the position before announcing the vacancy. The Commission disagreed, reiterating what is required of the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Commission has held that priority consideration generally requires the Agency to consider the employee for a position before referring any other candidate to the selecting official for consideration. <span class="Italic">See Charles D. Phillips v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A40620 (October 22, 2004). We find that the Agency provided Complainant with priority consideration and therefore complied with the settlement agreement. Complainant was interviewed by the selection interview committee before all of the other candidates and she was considered for the position by the selecting official before each of the other candidates. Thus, the Agency fulfilled its obligation under the settlement agreement. The Commission notes that the settlement agreement did not guarantee Complainant's selection for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency will be held to its promise where the settlement agreement references a specific job vacancy announcement number. <span class="Italic">Arnie H. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120162734 (2017), involved a settlement agreement that expressly listed the posting for which the complainant would receive priority consideration as "VA-66." Instead, the agency gave the complainant consideration under "VA-99," defending its action by noting that it fulfilled the "intent" of the agreement because the two announcements were for the same job--an RN Case Manager. The complainant did not dispute that the announcement was for an identical position, but complained because the VA-99 position had a different application deadline than VA-66, thereby resulting in a different pool of applicants on the Certificate of Eligibles. The Commission agreed that the agency was in breach, noting that the agreement's controlling language was the vacancy announcement number, not the position name.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agreement does not reference a specific job vacancy but rather a position title with "one" opportunity for priority consideration, the agency must make that one opportunity meaningful as the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Lashaunda G. v. Attorney General</span>, 0120172415 (2017):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The settlement agreement provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Agency agrees to give Complainant one opportunity for priority consideration for a Unit Secretary upward mobility program position with save pay and one opportunity for priority consideration for a Case Manager position located at MDC-Los Angeles for a period of three years. If Complainant is not on the Best Qualified list for the Unit Secretary vacancy pending at this execution, then the Agency will give Complainant two priority considerations for Case Manager instead of one. The parties understand that there must be a posted vacancy announcement on USAJOBS for a Case Manager vacancy located at MDC-Los Angeles. Complainant must properly apply for the vacancy and make the best qualified list to be considered for the vacancy. Further, priority consideration means that Complainant's application will be considered first for the position. Priority consideration does not guarantee Complainant will be selected;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Agreement provided for priority consideration for positions for which she is eligible. It did not guarantee the position and it did not address the situation where an agency decides to post an announcement, but limit the area of consideration to reinstatement eligible employees and then make a lateral assignment. She applied for one position for which she was deemed ineligible because of the way the Agency defined the area of consideration. She applied for a second position, was qualified and referred, but the Agency decided not to fill the position for unexplained reasons. For these reasons, we find that Complainant has shown the Agency has not yet given Complainant priority consideration, as of the date of this appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency conceded that Complainant's "eligibility for the opportunity for priority consideration for a subsequent Case Manager vacancy at MDC Los Angeles would continue for the remainder of the three year period."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we disagree with the Agency's finding that it already "met its obligation of compliance." Specifically, we note that the Agreement requires that Complainant be provided priority consideration for a Case Manager position located at the MDC-Los Angeles for a period of three years or until such time as Complainant is selected for promotion at MDC-Los Angeles, transfers to another BOP facility or voluntarily separates from the BOP facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agreement continues in place and that the Agency has not yet fulfilled its obligations under the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We caution the Agency that we find it troubling that the Agency did not place Complainant for the Case Manager position for which she qualified and instead allowed the certificate to expire, without an explanation or proof as to its reasons. Those actions, however, are beyond the scope of the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a settlement agreement provided that the appellant would be given priority consideration for any GS-12 position, the agency may not post a position as being a GS-12/13 and then later argue it was a GS-13 position. In <span class="Italic">Landis v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs,</span> 01966903 (1997), the Commission rejected such an argument, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unpersuaded by the agency's contention that it properly declined to give appellant advance notice of the Director of Employee Education position because it was, in actuality, a GS-13 position which merely has the potential of being filled at the GS-12 level. To the extent that the agency interpreted the settlement agreement as imposing such qualifications on Announcements that expressly identified positions as being filled at the GS-12 level, such interpretation should have been reduced to writing as part of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. Jenkins-Nye v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01851903 (March 4, 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, moreover, that appellant's attorney presents evidence on appeal reflecting that appellant has not received priority consideration for another position, identified as an Equal Employment Manager position, under Announcement No. 96-19, which has been described as "currently vacant." The Commission finds, based on the record in this case, that the agency breached the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission rejected an agency argument that the term "priority consideration" in a settlement agreement applied only to competitive vacancy announcements and did not include positions that the agency elected to fill through lateral reassignments. In <span class="Italic">Waters v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120073867 (2008), the Commission also rejected an argument that a clause stating that the complainant could submit a resume if she desired meant that she had to submit a resume to be considered for priority consideration. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Waters</span>, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the settlement agreement provides that the agency will provide: "first consideration for the next Mortgage Loan Servicing (MLS) Supervisor position, GS-1101-9/11, in the Centralized Servicing Center, which becomes available and management intends to fill following the detail." The record indicates that positions were vacated, and the agency filled them with lateral reassignments. The agency argues that such reassignments are outside of the agreement. However, we do not find that this is reflected in the settlement agreement language. If the agency wanted to exclude reassignments from the agreement, it should have reduced its intentions to writing. It could have simply stated, as it does on appeal, that complainant would be given priority consideration for MLS, GS-11 Supervisor positions that are open and advertised through the merit promotion process. We finds that the plain meaning of the provision requires the agency to provide complainant with priority consideration, even in instances that are reassignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, to the extent that one position was purportedly advertised but complainant "did not submit his name and resume as per the Agreement," we disagree with the agency's interpretation. The agreement states that "first consideration means that the complainant's name and resume, if he chooses to submit one, will be referred to the selection official..." We find the antecedent to the "one" identified in the clause "if he chooses to submit one" is exclusively the word "resume." Consequently, a fair reading of this provision is that complainant's name will be referred to the selecting official, and that if complainant chooses to submit a resume, such resume would be likewise referred to a selecting official. In sum, complainant is not required to submit his name for the priority consideration to occur. The settlement agreement obligates the agency to refer complainant's name to the selecting official for consideration prior to any certificate of eligibles,</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case in which the Commission specifically distinguished the situation from <span class="Italic">Bishop</span>, noted above, it found that the agency did not violate a settlement agreement giving the complainant priority consideration for a mediator position where the agency granted a hardship transfer to another employee, who was also a mediator, from Dallas to San Francisco. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 0120090852 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_363"></span>In support of her argument, complainant cites the case of <span class="Italic">Bishop v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910148 (April 10, 1991). In <span class="Italic">Bishop</span>, the parties signed a settlement agreement giving the appellant "priority consideration for promotion to the next appropriate GS/GM-14 in the Regional headquarters." The respondent agency conceded that during the relevant period, the position of Assistant Personnel Officer, GM-14 was filled by reassignment/transfer. In finding a breach, the Commission rejected the respondent's argument that the settlement agreement only applied to positions filled by competitive procedures and held that the agency filled the position in question via reassignment in a specific effort to circumvent its settlement agreement. In the instant matter, complainant argues that the hardship transfer to the SFO violated the agency's merit promotion plan under which employees are allegedly entitled to "advance consideration" only if they were involuntarily demoted or not given proper consideration clue to a procedural violation or error in a previous competitive placement action. Complainant also controverts the statements of agency management, claiming a mediator position was filled in the San Francisco District Office (SFDO) in fiscal year 2007, and during this time the hardship transfer requests by two SFO employees were not granted because there was no vacancy at the receiving office and/or the office directors did not agree on the transfer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In opposition to complainant's appeal, the agency supports the findings in the FAD. The agency adds that the settlement agreement expressly defines priority consideration to mean "the selecting official for the future position will review complainant's application without any comparison to any other applicants' applications and determine if complainant should be selected for the position." It argues that the plain meaning of this language is that the parties were only agreeing to give complainant priority consideration in which the selection of a mediator would occur through the typical hiring process. It argues that there is no selecting official in a hardship transfer request. The agency argues that, to the extent complainant contends that merit promotion procedures were violated, the EEO administrative process is not the proper forum for addressing such procedural irregularities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that <span class="Italic">Bishop</span> does not apply because the agency did not attempt to circumvent the settlement agreement or normal hiring procedures by granting the hardship transfer. It counters with a citation to <span class="Italic">Stringfield v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05920592 (October 29, 1992), where the Commission found that a transfer of an employee, without the appellant receiving priority consideration, did not breach a priority consideration clause of a settlement agreement because there was no evidence that the transfer was illegitimate, i.e., that the agency was required to advertise the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the agency did not violate complainant's agreed right to priority consideration when it granted a Dallas employee a hardship transfer to the position of mediator in the SFO. We find by a preponderance of the evidence that the hardship transfer did not occur under circumstances where priority consideration applied under the terms of the settlement agreement. As already noted, the record contains statements from management that, for budgetary reasons, the SFO did not have authority to fill any positions, either internally through a merit promotion announcement or externally through an OPM all sources announcement, Thus, there is no indication that management initiated any selection process to fill a mediator position in SFO. Moreover, as argued by the agency, the settlement agreement expressly defined priority consideration as applying when there was a selecting official and applicants, which was not the case with the hardship transfer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unpersuaded by complainant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bishop</span>. In <span class="Italic">Bishop</span>, unlike in the instant case, there was no description of an exceptional situation. Here, first, the SFO had no authority to fill the positions for budgetary reasons. Second, a hardship request was made by an employee and granted by the agency. There is no evidence that the agency solicited the employee to make a hardship request to get additional staff to the SFO. If the evidence showed the hardship transfer was granted in bad faith to circumvent the settlement agreement, or that the agency was using alternate methods to fill mediator positions in the SFO to get around complainant's priority consideration right, we would likely reach a different result. However, such is not the case here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also argues, in essence, that hardship transfers violate the agency's merit promotion procedures. We agree with the FAD that the EEO administrative process is not the appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Priority consideration does not mean that the complainant will necessarily get the job. It does mean that the complainant can be rejected only for valid reasons. For example, in <span class="Italic">Eric M. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120140510 (2015), the Commission found that the complainant was not deprived of priority consideration where the supervisor testified:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was given Priority Consideration; however, based on poor recommendations from the references he provided from his last two employers, I returned the Priority Consideration as a Non-Select. This recruitment was then cancelled by HRSC and shortly after re-recruited as Vacancy Announcement number SW30081-R1-841696PK549053. More specifically, on 5 February 2013, HRSC issued a Priority Consideration. I called the references listed on Complainant's resume, speaking first at 1420 hours on 5 February 2013, to [Reference #1], referenced as his supervisor in the resume. [Reference #1] indicated he was not a supervisor, but a Lead Firefighter during the referenced period of 1990 to 1991. [Reference #1] stated Complainant was mediocre, not a stand-out, and was there only for a short time. At 1435 on 5 February 2013, I called the Ventura County, California, Fire Department, which Complainant had also listed. [Reference #2], identified in Complainant's resume as the Assistant Chief, was not on duty at the time of my call. Therefore, the Administrative Assistant referred me very quickly to [the Fire Chief (FC)]. I told [FC] I had a Priority Consideration on my desk for Complainant. What [FC] could tell me was that Complainant resigned vise [sic] termination in 2009; and there had been multiple problems with Complainant. I determined I would non-select Complainant's Priority Consideration, given I had a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reason based on information from the references listed by Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The term "priority consideration" will not be given its generally accepted meaning when the specific provisions of the settlement agreement define the term in another way. For example, in <span class="Italic">Peters v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A14142 (2003), the parties defined the term to mean that the complainant had to apply for the positions for which she sought priority consideration. As a result, the agency's failure to give the complainant priority consideration for positions for which she did not apply was not a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Priority consideration and priority placement are two different terms of art, and where the latter is used in a settlement agreement, the Commission will interpret it accordingly. In <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01965768 (1998), the complainant alleged that the agency breached the agreement by not placing her into various positions. The agency argued that it only promised priority consideration to the complainant, and that the "hiring official has the option of selecting the appellant or deciding to select from a pool of other applicants." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency also stated that although the complainant was minimally qualified for one of the positions, another applicant was more qualified. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span> distinguished between priority placement and priority consideration, and found that the terms of the agreement required the agency to offer priority placement to the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, we find that the agency obligated itself, in the SA, to give appellant "priority placement for all NF-I and NF-II Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality regular positions for which she is qualified." We find, from a fair reading of the plain language of this provision, that the parties intended that appellant be placed in a position, on a priority basis, if she were qualified for that position. We base our findings on the fact that the SA contains the phrase "priority placement" twice in the same paragraph, the second use occurring when the parties declared, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If [appellant] accepts an NF-1 position, she shall still maintain her priority placement for NF-II positions during the life of this agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also found, given that the agency agreed to priority placement of the complainant, the term "qualified" in the agreement encompassed positions for which the complainant was "minimally qualified," and therefore the agency was not free to choose a candidate it considered to be more qualified:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find no ambiguity to the word "qualified." The agency concedes that appellant was "qualified," albeit it argues "minimally qualified," for the position of Sales Clerk, which we find was an NF-I regular position. If the agency had intended to use the language of "priority consideration," instead of "priority placement," as it argues on appeal, it was free to negotiate those terms. We find, therefore, the agency's nonselection of appellant, in favor of what the agency considered to be a better qualified applicant, to be a breach of the agreement.</p>
