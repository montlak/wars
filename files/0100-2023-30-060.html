<p class="noindent">Obviously, an agency may not comply with an order for relief by placing the employee in a position that is several hundred miles from the position that was the subject of the EEO complaint. But neither is the employee entitled to a position in a different location because his or her circumstances have changed during the pendency of the complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Henley v. Attorney General</span>, 01A22186 (2002) (that complainant moved to Georgia was not a basis for changing a remedial order which required her reinstatement in New York).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wiley v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930520 (1994), the Commission examined the claim of an employee who sought reinstatement at a facility other than the one where she had been denied a position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's request for modification of the previous decision's order of relief, however, is more persuasive. Clearly, the Commission's regulations contemplate that a complainant who prevails in a discriminatory nonselection case be offered retroactive placement in the position for which s/he would have been selected absent discrimination, but not that the complainant be forcibly transferred to the position regardless of the individual's wishes or of the effect such an involuntary transfer would have<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.501(a)(3). (footnote omitted). Thus, although the previous decision ordered that appellant be retroactively placed in the Durant, MS, Part-Time Flexible Distribution Clerk position, the Commission contemplated that appellant be offered such placement and not that she be involuntarily transferred there. The agency's haste to accomplish such a transfer, at considerable inconvenience to appellant, is clearly not indicative of a good faith attempt at compliance with the Commission's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant further asserts that agency officials made remarks that are indicative of retaliatory motivation. The agency is advised that such remarks, if made, would be wholly inappropriate and could constitute evidence of such an illegal motivation. In view of the foregoing, the previous decision's remedial Order is modified to inform the agency that appellant is to be provided with an offer of retroactive placement in the Durant position. Further, if appellant declines this offer, agency records are to be corrected not to indicate appellant's placement at Durant and appellant shall be restored her former seniority and status at the Madison, MS, facility. If appellant declines the Durant position, then appellant's back pay, if any, shall be calculated from the date of the October 1987 Durant selection until the date of the agency's offer of placement in the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to appellant's further request for alternative relief in view of changed circumstances, the Commission finds that appellant is not entitled to receive a position tailored to her present needs and desires, but only the Durant position for which she was nonselected based upon race discrimination, or, if that position is unavailable, a substantially equivalent position. Nor is the agency obligated to provide appellant with training for a position of her choice, since such an award would provide appellant with more than make whole relief for the discrimination from which she has suffered....</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, nothing prevents an agency and complainant from negotiating a resolution that is mutually acceptable in such cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McCoy v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01960120 (1998), the Commission came to a similar conclusion. In <span class="Italic">McCoy</span>, the complainant relocated to a different agency site to avoid a possible reduction-in-force before the final decision finding discrimination was rendered. The Commission in <span class="Italic">McCoy</span> found that the agency's offer of a position at the complainant's former worksite was sufficient relief:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of his complaint, appellant was employed by the agency as an Aircraft Engine Mechanic supervisor, WS-8602-15, at the agency aviation depot at Alameda, California (NADEP ALA), where he had applied for the Production Superintendent position. Feeling that he was discriminated against when he was nonselected, appellant sought EEO counseling and later filed a formal EEO complaint dated February 12, 1992. The agency accepted the allegation and complied with all our procedural and regulatory prerequisites. Although appellant initially requested a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge, he later withdrew the request, and the agency then issued a FAD finding discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the agency rendered its final decision, however, appellant had relocated to the agency aviation depot at Jacksonville, Florida (NADEP JAX), since NADEP ALA was targeted for closure in 1993, and he had been offered a position at NADEP JAX at the WS-10 level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its FAD dated March 171 1995, which found discrimination, the agency directed the Commanding Officer of NADEP ALA to retroactively promote appellant to the position of Production Superintendent, GM-13, effective December 1, 1991, and then to grade GM-14 effective the earliest date that any one of the three oriGINAl selectees (STs) had subsequently been promoted to grade GM-14. Appellant voluntarily elected to remain at NADEP JAX, however, since he had been cautioned that acceptance of the position at NADEP ALA did not guarantee that he would not be affected by future Reduction-in-Force actions due to base closure. It appears that appellant was then given the retained grade and pay of a GS-14 for two years at NADEP JAX, before reverting to the pay and grade of a WS-10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, appellant contends that to be made whole, he should be placed in a GS-14 position or be provided with front pay at that level until he is placed in a GS-14 position at NADEP JAX, He further contends that his representative should have been allowed to review the personnel files of the STs chosen for the GS-13/14 position to determine if all required actions were taken to make him whole. Finally appellant contends that the agency should finance a trip by him back to NADEP ALA so that the implementation of the final decision could be implemented jointly by him, his representative, and NADEP ALA officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the agency contends that its only obligation was to offer appellant a GS-14 position at NADEP ALA, and that appellant's representative was only entitled to review all sanitized copies of documents used by the agency in implementing the FAD. Finally, the agency contends that there was no need for appellant to return to NADEP ALA for implementation of the FAD, since the planned implementation was communicated to him by mail, and implementation only required his acceptance of the terms set forth in the FAD.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission takes judicial cognizance that where discrimination is found, the agency is obligated to make the complainant whole by restoring him to the position he would have occupied but for the discriminatory personnel action<span class="Italic">. Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 420-21 (1975). If that is not possible, as is the case here since the oriGINAl STs occupied the positions in question, by EEOC regulation the agency is then obligated to offer the complainant "a substantially equivalent position." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.501(b)(1)(i). Yet the Commission has defined a "substantially equivalent position" not only as one which is similar in duties and responsibilities to the one for which the complainant was discriminatorily nonselected, but also one which is similar in location, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, one which is within a reasonable commuting distance from the location of the position which the complainant would have occupied absent discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Patterson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940079 (Oct. 21, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, upon appellant's deciding not to accept the agency's offer to return to the NADEP ALA as a GS-14 Production Superintendent, the agency was under no obligation to provide him a similar position at NADEP JAX, as appellant contends<span class="Italic">. See Kahmann v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 04930003 (Dec. 3, 1993) (finding that the agency fulfilled its obligation when it offered the complainant reinstatement to her former position and duty station, despite the fact that the complainant had relocated several years after the alleged discrimination)<span class="Italic">. See also Bass v. Department of Justice</span>, Petition No. 04970001 (Jan. 16, 1997). Therefore, the agency's first obligation was to provide appellant backpay plus interest for the difference between what he received as a WS-10 at NADEP JAX and what he would have received as a GS-13/14 at NADEP ALA from the earliest date that any one of the STs had been promoted to GS-13 (to include the earliest subsequent promotion to GS-14) up until the time that NADEP ALA was closed or appellant declined the offer to return to NADEP ALA as a Production Superintendent, whichever came first. From appellant's reference in the appeal brief, it appears that this was done.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720090055 (2010), the Commission gave the agency an option of remedies where the complainant's was terminated from his position and, during the pendency of his case, moved to another location. In a decision that contains little in the way of explanation to distinguish from the cases discussed above, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the relief ordered by the AJ. As noted above, the agency challenges the AJ's decision to place complainant in a permanent position. In awarding a permanent position, the AJ reasoned that "others in complainant's position had gained permanent promotions after their temporary positions had run their course." The Commission finds that substantial evidence of record supports the AJ's determination that, while not all temporary employees are offered permanent bids, absent the discrimination, as a good employee complainant would have been placed in a permanent position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that the AJ erred in requiring the agency to offer complainant the position at Seymour Johnson AFB (North Carolina), rather than the McGuire AFB (New Jersey; the location of the discrimination). Complainant's change in residence is insufficient to support such a remedy. However, it is more likely than not that, absent the discrimination, complainant would not have moved from New Jersey to North Carolina. Therefore, the agency will be given the choice of either (1) offering complainant a permanent Store Worker position at the McGuire AFB commissary and paying all reasonable relocation expenses associated with his need to move back to New Jersey, or (2) offering complainant a permanent Store Worker position at Seymour Johnson AFB near where he currently lives.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the facility to which reinstatement is ordered has been closed, the complainant does not necessarily have her choice of alternative facilities. The agency is not required to assign the complainant to a facility that is closest to <span id="Page_1756"></span>her home when that facility is organizationally in a different segment of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Costello v. Postmaster General</span>, 04A20021 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to place the complainant in a position at a different facility simply because the employee contends that he should not be returned to the site of the previous discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bahaudin v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01993594 (2000), the Commission found the agency properly offered the complainant a job at the facility where he was nonselected. The Commission rejected the complainant's argument that he should be placed at a different facility because the discrimination caused him to suffer from depression and anxiety, noting that the supervisors involved in the discrimination either no longer worked at the facility or would not be in the complainant's chain-of-command.</p>
