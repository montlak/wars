<h3 class="h3" id="sec7-3"><span class="space">A.</span> TIME LIMITS</h3>
<p class="noindent">An agency has 40 days from receipt of the administrative judge's hearing file and decision to take final action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.110(a). Under the previous regulations, the agency had 60 days from receipt of the recommended decision of the administrative judge to accept, reject, or modify that decision. If the agency failed to reject or modify the decision within that time period, the recommended decision became binding on the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Whitman v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 01830530 (1983). This practice was specifically retained under the current regulations. If an agency fails to take final action on the administrative judge's decision by filing an appeal with OFO within 40 days, the administrative judge's decision will become binding on the agency. MD-110 at 9-7, footnote 5 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the agency issues a final order to the complainant stating that it does not intend to fully implement the decision of the Administrative Judge but fails to file an appeal, the agency's final order has no effect on the Administrative Judge's decision. If the agency fails properly to issue a final order and file an appeal simultaneously with the issuance of the order, the Administrative Judge's decision will be deemed ratified by the agency upon the expiration of the agency's 40-day period for accepting or not accepting the Administrative Judge's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Graham v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720030064 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">As with all EEOC time limits, if the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, the time period is extended to the next business day. <span class="Italic">May v. USPS</span>, 01841631 (1986). Decisions such as <span class="Italic">May</span> have now been codified at 29 CFR 1614.604(d). If the judge's decision is not transmitted by certified mail, an agency can add five days to the time frame from mailing to allow for receipt. MD-110, at 9-2, n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's period for acting on the recommended decision starts to run from the day the agency actually received the decision and not the day it was circulated to the appropriate official. In <span class="Italic">Rosette v. Department of Justice, INS</span>, 01842487 (1986), the agency's complaint processing unit did not receive the complaint until two weeks after it arrived in the agency mailroom. The agency's final decision rejecting the recommended decision was untimely, under Part 1613, when issued more than 30 days after its arrival in the mailroom.</p>
<p class="noindent">The date stamped on the agency's final decision is not dispositive where the postmark on the envelopes to the complainant and her representative show a later day. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Katt v. Postmaster General</span>, 01991033 (2002) (holding that final decision was postmarked after the decision became final through expiration of the time period).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the 1992 version of Part 1614, the Commission also held that the agency was not entitled to additional time based on the fact that the adjudication component of the agency did not actually receive the complaint file until a later date. Moreover, as the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01931924 (1993), even if the agency requested the administrative judge to forward the complaint file to the adjudication component of the agency, the administrative judge did not err in sending it to the agency representative:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that on December 16, 1992 the AJ transmitted the case file to the attorney who represented the agency at the AJ hearing. Thus, the case file was not sent, as per the request that the agency stated that it made, to the part of the agency who would issue the final agency decision. The EEOC Detroit Office stated that its records showed that the agency received the completed case file on December 21, 1992. Appellant's attorney stated in a letter dated February 23, 1993 that he received his copy of the case file on December 21, 1992. The agency does not contest the EEOC Detroit Office's statement that the case file was received by the agency's representative on December 21, 1992. Therefore, we find that the agency's representative received the case file from the AJ on December 21, 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that it did not receive the case file for the purposes of time computation under 29 CFR 1614.109(g) until the office of the agency entitled Director, Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance and Complaints Review Agency, Department of the Army, received the case file. The AJ is required to send the case file to "the parties." 29 CFR 1614.109(g). There is no requirement in 29 CFR 1614.109(g) that the case file be sent to a particular office of the agency even if so requested by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency cites EEOC-Management Directive 110, Chapter I, Paragraph II (Oct. 22, 1992) as supporting the proposition that decisions will be rendered by an individual who has no involvement in the defensive function, which is the role of the agency representative. The Commission Directive in question states, in part: "(I)t would be excessively intrusive for the individual who represented the agency in an equal employment hearing to have authority to approve decisions with respect to resolution in the same or related cases." EEOC-MD 110, Ch. 1, Par. II. While the Commission Directive cited by the agency discusses the propriety of decision making by the agency's representative, the Commission Directive does not state that the agency's representative is not the proper recipient of the case file. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, we find that, pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.109(g), the AJ was proper in sending the case file to the attorney who represented the agency at the AJ hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the agency failed to reject or modify the findings and conclusions or the relief ordered by the administrative judge and issue a final decision in accordance with 29 CFR 1614.110 within 60 days of December 21, 1992 (when the agency received the case file). Therefore, we find that the AJ's November 12, 1992 findings and conclusions and the relief ordered are now the final decision of the agency. 29 CFR 1614.109(g). We find that the subsequent final decision issued by the agency which was issued more than 60 days after December 21, 1992 is null and void.</p>
<p class="noindent">Certainly, the Commission should not permit agencies to significantly extend the time period because of internal delays on the part of the agency in providing the file to the proper office. However, it seems the result in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> is somewhat harsh, given the agency's specific request that the file be sent to the EEO office. Given the decision, though, agency representatives who receive recommended decisions would be prudent to ensure that the proper agency office also receives a copy in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="noindent"> Although the issue is not specifically addressed in the 1999 amendments, there is no reason to believe the Commission will retreat from past policy in <span id="Page_551"></span>measuring the time for final agency action from the agency's receipt and not receipt by the proper agency processing unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the November 1987 regulation amendments, it was unclear whether the agency's time began to run when the recommended decision left the hands of the administrative judge or was received by the agency. This was originally clarified in the 1987 amendment of 1613.220(d). The clarification has been carried forward in 29 CFR 1614.110. It now is agreed that the time period begins to run on the receipt of the judge's decision by any agency employee at the facility to which the agency has instructed the administrative judge to forward the decision. <span class="Italic">Pianka v. Postmaster General</span>, 05880159 (1988). As the agency learned in <span class="Italic">Pianka</span>, this means the administrative judge should be advised when an agency office changes locations.</p>
<p class="noindent">When it is not clear precisely when the agency received the administrative judge's decision, the Commission will apply its usual presumption that the decision was received within five days of its mailing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nicholson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01880085 (1988) (codified at 29 CFR 1614.604(b)). The first day of the 40-day period for final agency action is the sixth day after mailing, in the absence of evidence that the decision was received earlier.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the regulation requires that the complete record of the case be transmitted to the parties along with the decision of the administrative judge, the agency's time period for issuance of a final agency action will not begin until it has the complete record. For example, in <span class="Italic">Booker v. Attorney General, INS</span>, 01933842 (1994), a case decided under the former Part 1614, the appellant attempted to argue that the final agency decision was untimely because it was not issued within 60 days of the agency's receipt of the recommended decision. The Commission rejected the argument noting that, after receipt of the recommended decision, the administrative judge's law clerk discovered that not all of the record was transmitted to the agency. The 60-day period started not upon receipt of the recommended decision, but upon receipt of the remainder of the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the agency must actually issue and mail a final decision within the 60-day period for it to be effective. In <span class="Italic">McIntyre v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01953384 (1997), the Commission found the agency was bound by the recommended decision of the administrative judge where it was signed within 60 days of receipt of the recommended decision but not mailed until 65 days after receipt.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency may not amend its final decision after the expiration of the 60-day period. <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Postmaster General</span>, 05900957 (1990). In that case, the agency issued a final decision adopting the findings of the administrative judge on both the issues of discrimination and relief. Shortly after the 60-day period expired, the agency issued an addendum decision in which it narrowed the scope of relief. The Commission found the agency was bound by its initial decision, since the 60 days for rejecting or modifying the recommended decision of the administrative judge had expired.</p>
<p class="noindent">But, in <span class="Italic">Guajardo v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01956664 (1998), the Commission found that even though the agency's final decision was not timely issued, it was bound by its finding of discrimination. In that case, curiously enough, the agency rejected the administrative judge's recommended findings of no discrimination and entered its own findings of discrimination. Two seemingly competing doctrines of the Commission came into play: (1) the recommended decision of the administrative judge becomes a final decision if not modified or rejected within 60 days, and (2) once an agency issues a finding of discrimination it is binding and cannot be rescinded. In <span class="Italic">Guajardo</span>, the Commission found the latter doctrine to be controlling:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that the agency's final decision was issued more than 60 calendar days after its receipt of the AJ's RD and the complete case file. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.110 requires the agency to issue a final decision within 60 days of receiving the findings and conclusions of the AJ. In addition, EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(g) provides in part: "If an agency does not, within 60 days of receipt, reject or modify the findings and conclusions of the administrative judge, then the findings and conclusions of the administrative judge and the relief ordered shall become the final decision of the agency and the agency shall notify the complainant of the final decision in accordance with &#x00A7; 1614.110." Accordingly, the Commission has held that an agency is bound by an AJ's RD and the agency's untimely decision is without legal effect<span class="Italic">. See Martin v. Department of the Interior</span>, Appeal No. 01931768 (August 5, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has also held, however, that once an agency makes a finding of discrimination, an EEO complainant becomes entitled to a remedy as a matter of law, an entitlement which cannot be forfeited<span class="Italic">. See Alexander v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940482 (September 21, 1995); <span class="Italic">Ybarra v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900447 (December 4, 1990). Accordingly, we adopt the agency's findings of discrimination. . . .</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission did reject one agency finding of reprisal in <span class="Italic">Guajardo</span>, on the basis that whistleblowing--the basis for the finding of reprisal--is not within EEO purview.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's brief is due 20 days after issuance of its final order and the filing of the appeal. 29 CFR 1614.403(d). Because it is not necessary for the agency to present any rationale for not fully implementing a decision of an administrative judge prior to filing its brief with the Commission, an agency, in effect, still has 60 days from receipt of the judge's decision to articulate why it believes that decision is incorrect.</p>
