<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-112"><span class="space">1.</span> Sufficiency of Claim</h4>
<p class="noindent">Intertwined with the issue of the appropriate time for asserting a damage claim, though distinct, is the issue of the appropriate manner for asserting a claim. The Commission has been extremely liberal regarding what constitutes a request for compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140691 (2014) (request "to made whole" included a claim for compensatory damages); <span class="Italic">Donovan O. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120170521 (2017) (request to "stop the psychological warfare" against the complainant qualified as a request for compensatory damages).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the complainant makes a demand for compensatory damages, the agency must request that the complainant provide some objective proof of the damages suffered, as well as objective proof of a causal connection between the damages and the alleged discrimination. The Commission's basic guidance was set forth in <span class="Italic">Caldwell v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01934139 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission advises the parties that a claim for compensatory damages, must be supported by objective evidence. Where the complainant shows objective evidence that he or she has incurred compensatory damages, and such damages are related to the alleged unlawful discrimination, the agency must address the issue <span id="Page_1805"></span>of compensatory damages in its final decision. Because the appellant in this case made a timely claim for damages related to the alleged discriminatory conduct by the agency, but failed to offer objective evidence in support of the damages request, the agency should have requested from appellant some objective proof of the alleged damages incurred, as well as objective evidence linking those damages to the adverse action at issue, prior to making its decision on the mootness of appellant's complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">A generalized list of damages is not sufficient to satisfy the objective evidence requirement. In <span class="Italic">James v. Postmaster General</span>, 01943504 (1994), the complainant responded to an agency request for objective evidence of compensatory damages by stating "that he should be compensated for his travel expenses, facsimile expenses, the time he spent pursuing his case, the interest he lost on the 80 hours of salary due to the delay in his being paid, and reimbursement for his telephone calls." The only evidence the complainant submitted was a copy of his telephone bill. He did not, however, attempt to explain to whom the phone calls were made, or why. The Commission found that such a generalized statement did not satisfy the objective evidence test.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency properly advises a complainant of the need to submit evidence, describes the types of evidence required, gives the complainant a reasonable amount of time to respond, and advises the complainant that failure to respond will result in dismissal of the claim, the agency is justified in dismissing the complaint if the complainant does not respond within the allotted time. <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01A14682 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a complainant is not required to specifically request compensatory damages in order to be entitled to them as part of his relief. It is sufficient if, in the factual allegations of his complaint, he puts the agency on notice that he may have suffered such harm. Such allegations trigger the agency's responsibility to request objective evidence of compensatory damages. As the Commission held in <span class="Italic">Barnett v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01943513 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Commission notes that appellant did not specifically request compensatory damages as part of the relief sought in his complaint, the Commission finds that he had alleged harassment which caused him to seek medical attention. The Commission finds evidence in the record to substantiate that appellant sought medical treatment for job-related stress. It is, therefore, possible that he would be entitled to compensatory damages if he prevails<span class="Italic">. See Lynnette Park v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01931280 (December 7, 1993). Accordingly, the Commission finds "the agency should have requested from the appellant some objective proof of the alleged damages incurred, as well as objective evidence linking those damages to the adverse actions at issue, prior to making its decision on the mootness of appellant's complaint." <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930316 (February 9, 1994) (citation omitted)....</p>
<p class="noindent">A claim for compensatory damages is properly made by referencing physical and mental anguish in the corrective action section of the formal complaint. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944372 (1995). Or, as in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> <span class="Italic"> v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01966242 (1997), the Commission found that the appellant's indication that the agency's actions "aggravated a chronic illness," constituted a claim for compensatory damages. The agency may not, thereafter, dismiss the complaint for failure to accept a certified offer of full relief that does not provide for compensatory damages without requesting evidence of such damages. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Elliott D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120152604 (2016) (asking to be "made whole" constitutes request for damages); <span class="Italic">Vereb v. Attorney General, INS</span>, 01945011 (1996) (complainant referenced emotional distress both in his complaint and in his investigatory affidavit).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the complainant articulates a claim for compensatory damages prior to the hearing, any subsequent offer of relief must provide at least the opportunity to present evidence on such damages. <span class="Italic">See Sloan v. Postmaster General</span>, 03940166 (1995). When the agency makes an offer of full relief at the hearing stage and the complainant does not raise the issue of compensatory damages, it cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Powell-Bishop v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01954185 (1996). The Commission in <span class="Italic">Powell-Bishop</span> noted that the complainant had never raised the issue of compensatory damages prior to her appeal, even though discussions were held with the administrative judge about the scope of full relief. However, in <span class="Italic">McAllister v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05960416 (1997), the Commission found that the complainant's presentation of evidence, in his appeal, that he sought psychiatric treatment for "mental stress disorders" following the incident at issue was an attempt to raise the issue of compensatory damages. The Commission remanded the case for a determination of entitlement to compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Perry v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24771 (2003), the Commission found the agency erred in dismissing an EEO complaint as moot on the basis that the contested suspension was rescinded in response to a grievance filed by the complainant. In his grievance, the complainant requested to "be financially compensated for the stress and mental anguish" caused by the suspension. As a result, the Commission found the agency was required to address the issue of compensatory damages prior to dismissing the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many lawyers include one simple phrase in any request for relief that is designed to cover any possible omissions. That phrase, quite simply, demands "any and all other relief to which the complainant is legally entitled." Such a phrase is sufficient to state a claim for compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Craig v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A15089 (2002); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Dantzler v. Postmaster General</span>, 01973907 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no merit to the contention that requiring a complainant to provide all evidence of compensatory damages by a date certain, in effect, puts an artificial cap on the amount of damages. <span class="Italic">See Androvich v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01950531 (1996). In that case, the complainant was required to present all evidence of damages within 60 days of signing a settlement agreement. The complainant somehow reasoned that this would place a cap on the amount of damages by limiting his right to future damages. All evidence of damages is typically presented at one time, however, including a projection of damages that have not yet accrued, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> future pecuniary damages. Future pecuniary damages are therefore considered when accounting for the "cap."</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure of the complainant to respond to an agency request for specific evidence of compensatory damages as part of a certified offer of full relief can result in dismissal of the complaint. <span class="Italic">See Lugardo v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01942768 (1994). Mere assertion of compensatory damages is not sufficient to avoid dismissal. The complainant must present actual evidence. <span class="Italic">See Raymer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01942478 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944611 (1995), the Commission held that the complainant's refusal to provide evidence of compensatory damages in his affidavit was not fatal to his claim for such damages where the agency had not specifically requested evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has not addressed the issue of compensatory damages. We note that appellant stated in his investigatory affidavit that he is not submitting any supporting documentation for his claim of compensatory damages. There is no evidence, however, showing that the agency specifically requested such documentation from appellant or informed appellant of the consequences of failing to provide such documentation. Therefore, we find that the complaint is not moot.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, an agency may not take advantage of a complainant's confusion over the request for evidence to dismiss a claim for compensatory damages. In <span class="Italic">Debonise v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01942963 (1996), the agency issued a final decision with a finding of discrimination. In the decision, the agency advised the complainant of her appeal rights to the EEOC. It also advised her of the need to submit evidence to support her claim for damages. Subsequently, the complainant requested an extension of time to appeal the final decision because of difficulty in obtaining the evidence to support her damage claim. In reversing the agency's dismissal in <span class="Italic">Debonise</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the FAD, the agency acknowledged that appellant had requested compensatory damages for the alleged discrimination. Therefore, the agency requested the submission, within 30 calendar days of appellant's receipt of the decision, of any bills or other objective evidence to show that appellant had incurred such damages, and that the damages were incurred as a result of the discrimination. The record shows that by letter dated April 7, 1994, appellant requested that the agency grant her an extension of time to appeal the FAD, "due to difficulty in obtaining some of the information required." It appears that appellant, who is not represented by an attorney, was confused as to the agency's request for compensatory damages evidence and her right to appeal the FAD. Appellant's request was denied by the agency by letter dated April 14, 1994, on the grounds that the agency did not have the authority to grant an extension. By letter dated May 2, 1994, the agency informed appellant that her request for compensatory damages was denied, based on appellant's failure to submit any evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the record in this case lacks any evidence regarding appellant's compensatory damages claim. Based on our review of the record, however, we find that the agency did not provide appellant with a sufficient opportunity to obtain the evidence to support her claim. Accordingly, we will REMAND this matter to the agency for further development of the record with respect to this issue....</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency has an obligation to make a specific request for evidence of compensatory damages and to advise the complainant of the specific kinds of evidence that should be submitted. In <span class="Italic">Jones v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01994659 (2001), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the agency found no compensatory damages available to complainant, it only requested that complainant provide "clarification of the claim, 'Respondent's actions have caused me much mental anguish and emotional stress.' This clarification should substantiate the claim, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span> medical documentation, medical bills, etc." The agency did not inform complainant that supporting evidence of compensatory damages was necessary to determine whether the agency accepted complainant's complaint. Where the agency makes an insufficient request for damages, it cannot then find the complaint moot based on complainant's failure to provide a detailed response<span class="Italic">. See Gore v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01983616 and 01983617 (May 17, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, once the agency has requested specific evidence of damages, it is not required to make a second request for additional evidence. In <span class="Italic">Fazekas v. <span id="Page_1806"></span>Postmaster General</span>, 01954627 (1997), the appellant complained that he could have provided the evidence the agency found lacking in its final decision had it asked for that evidence. However, the Commission found that the appellant was properly notified by the agency of the need to submit evidence, and the type of evidence to submit. The agency was not required to make specific requests to the appellant for evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is improper for an agency to dismiss a claim for compensatory damages prior to its determination on the merits of the underlying discrimination claim. In <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01954935 (1996), the agency dismissed the damages portion of the complaint where the employee refused to provide evidence of her mental state prior to the alleged discriminatory actions. In reversing the agency's dismissal in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency's dismissal of appellant's claim for compensatory damages was improper. Compensatory damages are a remedy. In the circumstances in this case, where the agency has accepted appellant's complaint and is conducting an investigation, the agency need not determine whether appellant is entitled to compensatory damages until appellant is found to be entitled to relief, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, when a finding of discrimination is made. Unlike an allegation of discrimination, which may be dismissed on various grounds under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107, a specific requested remedy is not subject to dismissal; a claim for compensatory damages may only be denied and then only at the appropriate stage of processing, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, as stated above. Indeed, a requested remedy, like compensatory damages, does not affect the processing of a case and is only considered when determining the remedial relief to which a complainant is entitled. Therefore, the agency's dismissal of appellant's claim for compensatory damages was improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> decision is important because there is a real tension between the agency's legitimate interest in being able to assess its potential liability early in a case and the complainant's legitimate interest in not having to unnecessarily disclose the extremely private details of her life. This tension becomes most acute when, as in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, the agency is seeking information about past mental illness and treatment. The <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> decision should not be read as meaning that complainants can simply stonewall the agency on information relevant to damages until or unless there is a finding of discrimination. It should be read, instead, as a limitation on the agency's ability to gather certain private and sensitive information until the case reaches the posture of a damages determination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of compensatory damages has caused some confusion at the hearing stage of cases. Some of the Commission's regional offices have adopted a policy of bifurcating proceedings such that evidence regarding compensatory damages is not taken unless the administrative judge determines to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law with a finding of discrimination. There has been some agency tendency toward seeking extensive discovery on the issue of damages prior to hearing. Although extensive discovery prior to a finding of discrimination may be premature, the Commission would appear to require that a complainant make at least a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of entitlement to damages prior to the hearing.</p>
