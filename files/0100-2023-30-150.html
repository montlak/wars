<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-141"><span class="space">j.</span> $50,001-$60,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Arreola v. Attorney General</span>, 01A03342 (2002), the Commission increased an agency award of $35,000 to $52,000, where the complainant demonstrated that his termination not only resulted in emotional distress, but that distress was heightened by the impact on his personal and professional reputation and the financial impact upon the complainant and his family. In increasing the award in <span class="Italic">Arreola</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted evidence, through his own affidavit and testimony as well as affidavits from relatives, of the emotional distress caused by the agency's action. Complainant stated that prior to his termination, he had no debt and no balances on his credit card accounts, but after the agency terminated his employment, he accrued $22,000.00 of debt and became delinquent in his payments. And as a result of his delinquency, he sometimes received telephone calls from his creditors at his new job. Complainant added that his significant debt and decreased income caused him to (1) get a negative credit rating, (2) consistently worry about his family's financial stability, (3) refrain from attending family functions due to embarrassment from his appearance and his inability to purchase gifts, and (4) miss important life opportunities. In addition, complainant stated that his reputation, which is very important in the field of law enforcement, was attacked by his former supervisors spreading false rumors about the convenience store incident and indicating a dishonorable justification for his termination in his personnel record. Specifically, complainant stated that his integrity would sometimes be questioned when he went to court in his new job as a city police officer; that some of his relatives, who used to look at him as a role model, would question his character; and, since his reinstatement as a BPA, he has been taunted by some of the other BPAs. Summarily, complainant stated that he experienced stress, depression, loss of enjoyment of life, humiliation, sleeplessness, headaches, loss work experience, and weight fluctuation due to the agency's action. Finally, complainant stated that he also experienced emotional distress while a BPA because some other BPAs and supervisors mistreated Mexican immigrants and he opposed such activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's wife, mother, and sister corroborated his statements. Complainant's mother added that complainant, throughout his life, participated in activities and held jobs that were considered honorable, e.g., church altar boy, high school graduate in top ten percent of his class, member of National Honor Society, Marine, BPA who graduated fourth in his academy class, and that his termination for a dishonorable reason has been devastating to him. Complainant's sister stated that complainant would not seek professional help due to his pride.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously noted, the agency considered the absence of medical evidence in the record in awarding complainant $35,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages. The Commission has previously held that neither evidence from a medical provider nor expert testimony in general is a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for mental and emotional distress, and that evidence may include statements from the complainant<span class="Italic">. Mayo v. Department of Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05990302 (July 21, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, the Commission finds the agency's award insufficient to remedy the severe and persistent harm the agency's actions caused complainant. We find $52,000.00 an appropriate amount as complainant presented sufficient objective evidence to establish that the agency's actions caused his emotional distress and the disruption of his home life. Similar cases with somewhat similar evidence support this award<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ward-Jenkins v. Department of Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) ($50,000 award for nonpecuniary damages where the agency detailed and then reassigned complainant, which aggravated a pre-existing condition and resulted in stress, insomnia, loss of enjoyment of life, and problems concentrating); <span class="Italic">Morra-Morrison v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01976222 (May 12, 2000) ($60,000 award for nonpecuniary damages where the agency failed to reasonably accommodate complainant and terminated her more than once, which resulted in depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, low self-esteem, marital problems, and alienation). Further, we note that this award does not consider the harm complainant alleged he experienced during his agency employment. Such harm does not arise out of the complaint at issue herein.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, similarly, increased an administrative judge's $40,000 award to $60,000 in <span class="Italic">Selma D. v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0720150015 (2016), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[R]ecord evidence confirmed that Complainant experienced an exacerbation of certain pre-existing conditions (e.g. depression and high blood pressure) for which she sought treatment caused by the stress created by the Agency's discriminatory actions. The Commission finds that an award of $60,000.00 is reasonable under the circumstances. <span id="Page_1879"></span><span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Transp</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720140022 (Sept. 16, 2015) (Complainant awarded $60,000.00 where Agency's failure to accommodate resulted in depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and exacerbation of existing symptoms); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720130013 (Aug. 14, 2014) (Complainant awarded $60,000.00 where Agency's failure to accommodate resulted in exacerbation of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, stress, and elevated blood pressure); <span class="Italic">Henery v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50034 (Sept. 22, 2005) ($65,000.00 awarded where Complainant suffered from frustration, negativity, and loss of sleep for a four-year period, as well as physical pain associated with the resulting excessive walking. The discrimination caused significant increase in Complainant's need for medical treatment, as well as an increase in physical and emotional harm).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that this amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. Finally, the Commission finds this award is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (Apr. 15, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F. 2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also awarded $52,000 in <span class="Italic">Campos v. Attorney General</span>, 01A03368 (2002), where the complainant testified that his termination caused him to fall into debt and lose a five-year romantic relationship.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $53,000 in compensatory damages was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Clafiin v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 07A50069 (2006), The Commission in <span class="Italic">Claflin</span> noted the findings of the administrative judge that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that an award of $53,000.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages was appropriate. The AJ found that complainant suffered emotional distress due to the agency's discriminatory actions. Specifically, the AJ found that complainant, after the termination, felt that her world had collapsed and her reputation was ruined. The AJ noted that complainant testified that she began throwing up immediately after she received the termination notice. The AJ further found that complainant said she felt ashamed and was afraid to go outside for fear that someone would ask about her job loss. The AJ found that complainant's husband testified that she used to attend social functions and her children's sports games, but stopped going because she was embarrassed and ashamed to see people. The AJ concluded that after complainant's termination, her relationship with her husband was affected in that she did not want to be intimate with him. The AJ found that complainant's husband confirmed that after she was terminated she became cold, and not as affectionate as before, and that she snaps at him and accuses him of not respecting her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also found that complainant testified that her professional life was also affected. Complainant testified that she could not seek employment for two months because she was too ashamed and embarrassed to leave her home.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $55,000 was deemed appropriate by the Commission in a case where sexual harassment and abuse by a coworker brought back to the complainant memories of spousal abuse. In <span class="Italic">Nevarez v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01992199 (2000), the Commission noted the complainant showed symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder, depression and paranoia for a period of 11 months.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without any specific recitation of the details, the Commission approved a $55,000 damage award in <span class="Italic">Chuney v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10056 (2003), where the complainant suffered stress, anxiety, isolation, relationship strain, and humiliation due to the agency's demotion and reassignment of the complainant. The Commission also awarded $55,000 in <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a53933.txt">01A53933</a> (2006), where the complainant presented evidence that her forced retirement caused her financial anxiety that ultimately resulted in treatment for panic attacks.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered several years of harassment as a result of his psoriasis, the Commission increased an award of $5,000 in damages by the agency to $55,000. In <span class="Italic">Rainbolt v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120080503 (2008), the complainant submitted statements from himself, his wife and from coworkers. In increasing the award in <span class="Italic">Rainbolt</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted evidence of the emotional distress and resulting physical debilitation caused by the agency's discriminatory harassment in a personal statement, as well as statements from a former coworker and his wife. In the record for <span class="Italic">Rainbolt v. Dep't of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120033857 (February 1, 2007), complainant detailed how, from his transfer in 1998 to the Kansas City ARTCC to the end of his employment with the agency in late 2004, he had to deal with ongoing complaints and negative comments to management about his personal hygiene, daily ostracizing by his coworkers that was encouraged or ignored by management, rumors about his personal hygiene, notes chastising him for the symptoms of his condition, and constant reminders to clean up after himself due to his condition. On appeal, complainant stated that the constant hostility from his coworkers made him not want to go to work, and left him devastated and with a feeling of worthlessness. Also, complainant stated that the hostile treatment resulted in depression and numerous thoughts of suicide, as well as feelings of outrage and anger.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated further that the stress from the environment worsened his psoriasis, particularly his psoriatic arthritis. (The decision for EEOC Appeal No. 0120033857 noted that complainant provided articles stating that stress affects psoriasis negatively.) Complainant explained how he had led an active and independent life, e.g., canoeing, sailing, white water rafting, and completing maintenance on his car as well as house and yard work. He stated, however, that psoriatic arthritis developed and worsened due to his daily exposure to the aforementioned hostile work environment. A former coworker and the coworker's wife corroborated the worsening of complainant's psoriatic arthritis since he arrived at the Kansas facility in 1998. F1 and F2 stated that complainant went from having an ability to function independently to a consistent need for a cane, as well as a need for assistance with everyday tasks such as opening a jar, turning a door knob, or unbuckling a seat belt. F1 stated that complainant is tired and frustrated from the toll that his worsened condition has taken on his body. F2 added that she believes that complainant's psoriasis has lessened somewhat since he left the hostile work environment in 2004.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant was humiliated by unwarranted medical examinations, terminated for more than three years and was at the end of his career without time to rehabilitate it, the Commission found an award of $55,000 in damages was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090036 (2010), the Commission cited the findings of the administrative judge that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[C]onsidering the dramatic insult to Complainant's economic lifestyle, factoring in his credible testimony, as supported by his wife and his brother-in-law, I am awarding Complainant $55,000 in non-pecuniary damages for his pain and suffering. This award of $55,000 is predicated on Complainant's pain and suffering at not being reasonably accommodated, being sent for and being subjected to a specious and unwarranted fitness-for-duty examination, being terminated for a period of or in excess of three years, and the consequent loss of wages and benefits, the latter of which caused Complainant, and his family, severe economic deprivation. This award is wholly appropriate, despite [medical] testimony that Complainant exhibited no DSM diagnosis or psychiatric symptoms, because [medical] testimony failed to address the effect on Complainant and his family due to his economic losses, mental and physical stress and the day-to-day effects thereof. It is consistent with the daily struggle Complainant, the bread winner in his family, had to endure for a lengthy period through the present.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">As noted in Arreola</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Commission awarded $60,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Morra-Morrison v. Postmaster General</span>, 01976222 (2000), where the complainant was twice terminated for discriminatory reasons resulting in a five-year period of discrimination. In making the award, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Morra-Morrison</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, complainant testified to her depression, anxiety, deteriorating memory, sleep problems, loss of self-esteem, marital problems, humiliation, and alienation she has felt due to her two discriminatory terminations and the loss of economic stability that resulted. Her feelings of hopelessness have led to a significant weight gain and a feeling of being a failed mother because she cannot provide for her child. Complainant's credit rating has been damaged due to unpaid doctor's bills sent to a collection agency and a lien against her house due to water and sewage bills she could not pay....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of Commission files indicates that, as noted above, complainant has had to file two petitions for enforcement in order to force the agency to comply with Commission orders and grant complainant the relief to which she is entitled. This delay has contributed to her emotional harm, making it impossible for complainant to move past the discriminatory actions of the agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the amount of non-pecuniary damages to which complainant in the case at hand is entitled, the Commission has considered that complainant has suffered from the effects of the discrimination for five years (as of 1997) and was expected to continue suffering for another year or more. We have considered the nature and severity of the discrimination, especially the fact that complainant was subjected to multiple discriminatory terminations, as well as the nature and severity of complainant's emotional distress and the fact that a great deal of that stress was caused by the discrimination. Finally, we have taken into consideration amounts awarded in similar cases and the goals of compensatory damages. Based on these factors, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $60,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a portion of the decision on pecuniary damages, the Commission credited the complainant's testimony in <span class="Italic">Morra-Morrison</span> that her termination was the cause of a divorce.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Leon-Guerrero v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A11828 (2002), the Commission awarded $60,000 in damages where the discrimination resulted in depression and anxiety and contributed to the end of the complainant's 20-year marriage. In <span class="Italic">Leon-Guerrero</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1880"></span>Our review of complainant's declaration in support of her request for compensatory damages herein indicates that it is detailed, credible, and corroborated by affidavits from coworkers and friends who personally observed the manifestations of complainant's emotional harm. We further find that these statements amply establish sufficient causation related to the discrimination that was found. Complainant avers that the ongoing emotional strain she has endured at the agency contributed to the break up of an twenty-year marriage. The record reflects the filing of the complaint for divorce. Complainant's daughter's statement that her mother no longer had energy to socialize and their only conversations when her mother got home were about what went wrong that day at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we reject the agency's assertions on appeal that these effects may have only resulted from complainant's prior conditions and were unrelated to any of the discrimination found by the Commission and that occurred in 1993. Dr. 1 testified that complainant began to manifest clinical signs of depression since 1991 and continuing that he believed were linked to her work treatment and mistreatment by her manager. Witness 2 testified regarding her interactions with complainant from June 1992 and lasting for a period of three years. During that time, she observed complainant's sadness, fear, escalating depression and anxiety and that she "suffered greatly" and she felt uncomfortable visiting complainant because of the tense environment. We are mindful of the extended period of time over which complainant sustained injury from the discriminatory acts and the profound loss of hope and dignity engendered by the agency's failure to provide her with the support and recognition to advance within the agency. While the record does show that other factors may have contributed to complainant's distress (including a demanding position, denial of a grievance, and a grievance filed against her by another coworker, family problems), clearly her conflicts with her supervisor and watching while less qualified individuals are accorded more responsibility were contributing factors to her decline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining compensatory damages, the Commission strives to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases<span class="Italic">. See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 18, 1998) and <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal 01945652 (July 17, 1995). While the medical evidence presented by complainant to corroborate her symptoms is sparse, the Commission has held that evidence from a health care professional is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional distress<span class="Italic">. Bernard v. Veterans Affairs, Id.</span> In this case, there was sufficient evidence that provides a link to the events in 1993. We find that complainant is entitled to compensatory damages in the amount of $60,000....</p>
<p class="noindent">That some of the emotional distress predates the agency's discrimination does not preclude a significant damages award. In <span class="Italic">Ingham v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A11692 (2002), the Commission awarded $60,000 in damages in a case that also demonstrates that it is the level of the complainant's suffering and not the egregiousness of the discrimination that determines damage awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, complainant provided an affidavit in which he details the emotional harm he suffered due to the agency's discriminatory actions. Complainant described humiliation and stress he suffered throughout 1993 before he was subjected to the behavior found to be discriminatory by this Commission, but also testified to the emotional distress he suffered due to the agency's discriminatory failure to rehire him in 1994. He testified, for example, that he began to experience severe migraines, that he was under constant and extreme stress, slept poorly, and had a difficult time getting along with his wife. His affidavit indicates that these problems began in 1993, when his earlier suspicions that the agency was going to discriminate against him were confirmed, and continued through September 2000. Complainant's wife provided an affidavit that confirmed complainant's testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency correctly determined that this evidence establishes that the emotional distress and physical pain to which complainant testified was not solely attributable to actions found to be discriminatory. Although complainant argues that the agency's discriminatory actions began as early as 1993, the only incident found to be discriminatory was the agency's 1994 failure to rehire complainant as a seasonal employee. The testimony of complainant and his wife therefore establishes that the emotional distress complainant began to suffer as early as 1993, while exacerbated by the agency's discriminatory behavior, was not caused by any agency action found to be discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also provided an affidavit from P1, a psychiatrist, who, in his capacity as an expert witness, reviewed the affidavits of complainant and his wife, as well as complainant's medical records. From this review, P1 determined that complainant was treated for severe migraines from December 1994 through September 2000. P1 noted that complainant had a predisposition towards migraines based on his family history, but determined that this tendency towards migraines was asymptomatic until 1993. P1 noted that stress could trigger severe migraines and that, based on his review of the records, complainant's severe headaches began in 1993 due to the emotional stresses arising out of the treatment he received at the hands of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we disagree with the agency that P1's testimony is of minimal value due to his lack of face-to-face communication with complainant, we agree that his testimony confirms that the stress and migraine headaches to which complainant testified were only exacerbated, not caused, by the agency's 1994 failure to rehire him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the evidence is clear that because of the agency's discriminatory action, the humiliation, stress, headaches, sleeplessness and marital difficulties complainant was suffering as of 1993 were greatly exacerbated and continued through at least September 2000. Moreover, the evidence establishes that this emotional stress and family strain was increased by the fact that, in attempting to justify its failure to rehire complainant, the agency made numerous false statements concerning complainant's personality and abilities, including claiming that he had trouble taking direction from women and displayed hostility towards the public.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several Commission decisions have awarded compensatory damages in cases somewhat similar to complainant's.<span class="Italic"> See Bull v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12574 (August 28, 2002) ($40,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on complainant's testimony that, due to the agency's discrimination, she suffered depression, sleeplessness, nervousness, anger, and frustration, as well as interference with her relationship with her family, her self-esteem and her physical well-being, for approximately two and 1/2 years, where only a portion of this emotional distress was caused by actions found to be discriminatory); <span class="Italic">Viers v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A14246 (June 20, 2002) ($65,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on the testimony of complainant and others that she experienced fatigue, insomnia, loss of marital harmony, apprehension, anxiety, loss of self-esteem and other emotional distress for approximately thirteen months, where the agency's discriminatory actions contributed to certain of these emotional problems and caused a reoccurrence of others that had been in remission); <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961030 (October 25, 1996), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span> EEOC Request No. 05970336 (November 20, 1997) ($25,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages based on "quite serious" emotional harm, lasting upwards of two years, frequent crying, introversion, disruptions in relationships with family and friends, suicidal thoughts, depression, sleep problems, marital and financial difficulties exacerbated, although the majority of problems were not shown to be caused by discrimination); <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) ($50,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant testified that he suffered for two years from loss of reputation, injury to professional standing, injury to character and credit standing, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of health due to the agency's discriminatory actions, and was expected to continue to suffer from the effects of discrimination for five more years, but where evidence established that a portion of his injuries were caused by incidents not found to be discriminatory).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the amount of non-pecuniary damages to which complainant in the case at hand is entitled, the Commission has considered that complainant has suffered from the effects of the discrimination for approximately 6 and 1/2 years. We have considered that these effects have included stress, severe headaches, and sleeplessness, among other things, and have interfered with complainant's relationship with his family. We have also considered that complainant was experiencing these emotional difficulties prior to the action found to be discriminatory and that the discrimination to which he was subjected exacerbated his pain and suffering. Finally, we take into consideration amounts awarded in similar cases and the goals of compensatory damages. Based on these factors, the Commission finds that complainant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $60,000.00</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rose v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A01561 (2003), the Commission reduced the award of an administrative judge from $125,000 to $60,000 where the agency's discrimination aggravated preexisting conditions. Although the complainant suffered severe depression with several physical symptoms such as headaches, neck pain and weight gain, the Commission found the condition and symptoms existed prior the discrimination. Taking into account the complainant's condition prior to the discrimination, the Commission found that $60,000 was an appropriate damage award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying upon <span class="Italic">Leon-Guerrero, supra</span>, the Commission awarded $60,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A35278.txt">01A35278</a> (2004), where the involuntary detail of the complainant for six months to a location outside his commuting area caused depression over a seven-year period. In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Commission explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD awarded the complainant $18,000 in nonpecuniary damages. It noted the complainant was not terminated but involuntarily detailed, <span id="Page_1881"></span>and he returned to his job six months later. It found that it was likely the complainant had depression as a result of the discrimination, it was likely the depression or Zoloft caused his sexual dysfunction, and the complainant's attitude toward work and his personality dramatically changed. The FAD cited cases which awarded between $15,000 to $20,000 in nonpecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the complainant cites Commission cases which awarded between $80,000 and $150,000 in nonpecuniary damages, and states the complainant's award should be commensurate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Day v. USPS,</span> EEOC Appeal No. OVA 10079 (November 2, 2001), the complainant was discriminated against when a job offer was withdrawn. The complainant experienced 5 years of emotional harm, including sleeplessness, impotence, inability to communicate with family, feelings of abandonment, anxiety, humiliation, depression, anger, feelings of worthlessness, lack of motivation, suicidal thoughts, and weight loss. The complainant did not leave the house for almost one year. He was forced to sell his home and move into an apartment, and then took a long distance job which separated him from his family. The complainant was awarded $80,000 in nonpecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Leon-Guerrero v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01 Al 1828 (May 22, 2002), the complainant was discriminated against when he was not nominated for Executive Potential Program and rarely assigned to serve as Acting Manager. The complainant experienced a loss of self-esteem and professional standing, humiliation, and the discrimination contributed to the breakup of her marriage. Statements of friends and co-workers, as well as a physician corroborated the symptoms. There was an extended period of harm. The complainant was awarded $60,000 in nonpecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant herein suffered many harms similar to those in <span class="Italic">Day</span> as a result of being taken out of his job and involuntarily detailed outside commuting distance. As in <span class="Italic">Day,</span> the complainant had extended severe emotional harm, seven years in the complainant' s case, with less severity thereafter. This included depression, isolating himself, constant anxiety about losing his job, loss of self-esteem, little or no sexual relations with his wife and being emotionally estranged from her, and being hurt by the damage to his work reputation. Further, immediately after the detail, there was a six month period of separation during the week from his wife, more severe isolation, and much tearfulness. However, the complainant's injuries were not as severe as those described in <span class="Italic">Day.</span> Unlike <span class="Italic">Day,</span> the complainant did not have suicidal thoughts, did not stay in his home for almost a year, and was not forced to sell his home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant's situation is closer to that described in <span class="Italic">Leon-Guerrero.</span> The complainant underwent a metamorphosis from an outgoing, confident, decisive person to a meek and depressed person which lasted an extended period of time. A similar metamorphosis occurred in <span class="Italic">Leon-Guerrero.</span> Given the severity and duration of the complainant's emotional harm resulting from the discrimination, we find the complainant is entitled to $60,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Underscoring that OFO decisions awarding substantial damages are becoming increasingly routine, in <span class="Italic">Khatami v. Secretary of Health and Human Services,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40072.txt">07A40072</a> (2004), the Commission, without any comment or review of the facts, increased the award of an administrative judge from $5,000 to $60,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a40101.txt">07A40101</a> (2005), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the administrative judge's damage award was punitive where the judge awarded $20,000 in future pecuniary damages and $60,000 in nonpecuniary damages. The award of $20,000 was premised on testimony that the complainant would require weekly therapy and medication for a period of two years. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bullock</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the agency argues that the AJ's award of $60,000.00 was intended to punish the agency rather than compensate complainant for actual harm suffered. Thus, the agency argues that the compensatory damages award should be reduced to $20,000.00. In essence, the agency is arguing it should only be responsible for pecuniary, and not non-pecuniary compensatory damages. However, the AJ only awarded non-pecuniary compensatory damages. Thus, we find the agency's argument unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that an award of $60,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages was appropriate. The AJ found that complainant suffered emotional distress due to the agency's discriminatory actions. Specifically, the AJ found that complainant, after the termination, felt confused, frustrated, angry, embarrassed and depressed. Further, the record contains testimony from complainant's aunt indicating that her nephew grew moody and depressed, less sociable and more irritable and withdrawn after the termination. Complainant's friends testified that he socialized less after the termination. A clinical psychologist diagnosed complainant as severely depressed with significant self-esteem issues. The AJ concluded that complainant was a withdrawn, irritable, depressed individual, compensating for his career disappointment by overeating.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though the administrative judge, in awarding $60,000, noted that the award was in the "upper range" for cases with similar evidence, the Commission upheld that award in <span class="Italic">Hibbert v. Attorney General</span>, 0720070036 (2007). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Hibbert</span>, rejected agency arguments that the award should be reduced because the judge miscalculated the period of harassment, and the complainant presented no medical testimony:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds, that complainant has established a nexus between the alleged harm and discrimination. At the hearing, complainant testified that, following the agency's repeated actions against her over a six year period, she suffered severe stress, anxiousness, frustration, humiliation and embarrassment. According to complainant, this negatively affected her home life. Complainant's self-assessment was echoed in an unsworn statement provided by her husband in support of her claim for compensatory damages. Complainant's husband noted that the agency's action impacted on her emotional distress, loss of self esteem, and loss of confidence. Statements were also provided by two witnesses who noted the changes in complainant's behavior. Accordingly, the Commission finds that complainant established a nexus between the alleged harm and the discrimination and therefore, is entitled to an award of non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ awarded $60,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages to complainant based on the severity and duration of the harm suffered. The AJ indicated that he applied the Commission's case law and held that an award of $60,000.00 fell "within the upper range of cases with similar evidence." Upon review, the Commission agrees with the AJ's finding that the severity and the duration of the harm warranted a finding of $60,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages. The Commission finds that the award is supported by the evidence and consistent with the decisions that were cited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we disagree with the agency's arguments on appeal for reducing the award. Assuming, for the purposes of this decision that we agreed with the agency that the race based harassment that complainant was subjected to lasted only five years, not six as the AJ found, we find that the award of $60,000.00 would still be justified because of the affect that it had on complainant. Regarding the agency's second argument that there was not persuasive evidence that complainant suffered "severe stress and anxiousness" because of race discrimination because she did not show that she was treated by a health care professional. The Commission has long held that an award of damages is not contingent upon the existence of medical evidence. The supporting documentation of family, friends and coworkers has historically been acceptable. Finally, the agency's argument that the award is excessive in light of the fact that complainant did not file an EEO complaint before 2004, is not relevant. The record shows that complainant was subjected to egregious conduct by the agency over a substantial period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an accommodation was withdrawn from a bartender that ultimately led to her termination for poor performance, the Commission upheld an award of $60,000. In <span class="Italic">Estate of Mary L. Chase v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120082106 (2010), the Commission's somewhat short analysis suggests that preexisting conditions may have affected the award. The decision notes that the agency presented some evidence that the complainant had been on antidepressants before the withdrawal of the accommodation, had been a heavy smoker for 30 years and had a congestive heart condition and was at least a moderate drinker. In finding that $60,000 was appropriate in <span class="Italic">Chase</span>, the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, the Commission finds that the award of $60,000.00 is sufficient to remedy the harm that the agency's actions caused complainant. The record established by way of statements from complainant, her daughters, a friend and a former coworker that complainant experienced emotional and physical problems as a result of the discrimination that she experienced. The record reveals that the discrimination caused complainant to experience significant depression, a loss of enjoyment of life, a loss of one-third of her weight and physical weakness, an inability to assist a daughter going through chemotherapy, withdrawal from family and friends due to her depression, and stress and anxiety. Prior to the removal of the accommodation and the termination, complainant was a friendly, outgoing person who had enjoyed her job and performed it effectively. The Commission has awarded compensatory damages in cases somewhat similar to the instant case in terms of harm suffered. <span class="Italic">Bullock III v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40101 (August 3, 2005) (awarding $60,000.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages after termination when complainant felt confused, frustrated, angry, embarrassed and depressed);<span class="Italic"> Hicks, Jr. v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A10020 (September 26, 2003) (awarding $70,000.00 after termination when complainant experienced humiliation, embarrassment and rejection); <span class="Italic">Levy v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A01561 (May 12, 2003) (awarding $60,000.00 following the denial of reasonable accommodation and subsequent termination as complainant exhibited feelings of humiliation and shame, worry, nervousness and anxiety). <span id="Page_1882"></span>An award of $60,000.00 meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases.<span class="Italic"> See Cygnar, supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $60,000 was found appropriate in <span class="Italic">Farrington v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090011 (2011), where the agency conducted an unwarranted investigation of the complainant and released her from position. The Commission particularly took into account both the severity and public nature of the actions as the complainant had been escorted from the agency facility by security guards upon her release and agency management had widely publicized the results of the investigation. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Farrington</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has argued that the damages award in this case should be reversed because Complainant did not provide medical evidence to support her claim. However, evidence from a health care provider or other expert is not a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for emotional harm. <span class="Italic">See Lawrence v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Carle v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (January 5, 1993)). Complainant's own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular case, can suffice to sustain her burden in this regard. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The more inherently degrading or humiliating the Agency's actions, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> In addition statements from others, like Complainant's friend in the instant case, can address the outward manifestations or physical consequences of emotional distress, including sleeplessness, anxiety, stress, depression, humiliation, emotional distress, or loss of self-esteem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by the Complainant, including the severity and public nature of the actions taken management against a long-time employee who had been respected and praised in the past, that resulted in emotional anguish and humiliation, we find the AJ's award of $60,000 to be appropriate. This amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Leggett et al. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720120019 (2012), a sexual harassment case involving several female rural carriers who were harassed by a male coworker over a period of several years, the Commission increased an award of $50,000 to one of the complainants to $60,000:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Linda Marshall</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ awarded Complainant Marshall $50,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages from the harm she suffered as a result of the male coworker's harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted earlier, the AJ found that the male coworker's harassment of the Complainants began in approximately 2004. AJ's June 24, 2011 Decision at 2. Further, the AJ noted that the Postmaster stated that he first received complaints about the male coworker from the Complainants in 2003-2004. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant Marshall stated that the coworker's harassment made her fearful that he would act violently towards her and she would not go into the Post Office alone. March 23, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 119. Complainant Marshall testified that the harassment made her feel more strained at work and under more tension, and that she no longer trusts people. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 121; 133. She testified that at home she was more short tempered with her family and she did not want to celebrate the holidays with her family. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because of the male coworker's harassment, Complainant Marshall began to see a therapist through the Agency's EAP Program in 2008. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 130. The EAP therapist diagnosed Complainant Marshall in 2008 as having a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct caused by stress from the negative work environment. March 24, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 52-53. Further, following the February 4, 2008 incident, the EAP therapist met with all the Complainants as a group and diagnosed each of them, including Complainant Marshall, with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the workplace harassment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 121-124.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant Marshall's husband testified that he noticed changes in his wife's personality during the relevant time of the male coworker's harassment. Specifically, he noticed that his wife was depressed, had anxiety, was abrupt when asked questions, she stopped doing housework, and she stayed up all times of the night. March 23, 2011 Damages Hearing Transcript at 144. Complainant Marshall's daughter testified that the harassment from the male coworker put a strain on their relationship and they were no longer close. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 152. The daughter stated that the harassment made her mother distraught, on edge, very testy, irritated, aggravated, and distant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 150. The daughter testified that her mother no longer wanted to leave the house, and instead would sit in a corner or nap. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 152.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the evidence of record, including evidence not specifically mentioned herein, we find an award of $60,000 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. This amount takes into consideration the nature of the discriminatory acts, the severity of the physical and emotional harm suffered, the length of time Complainant suffered the harm, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Tewilliager v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A53028 (September 13, 2006) (Complainant was awarded $65,000 for sexual harassment that left her feeling tired, short tempered, secluded, depressed, anxious, and trouble eating and sleeping. The harassment caused stress on her marriage and her condition lasted two years). <span class="Italic">Servold v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120053029 (March 29, 2007) (Complainant was awarded $45,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages after a hostile work environment based on sex caused her to feel stress, misery, torment, and insomnia); <span class="Italic">Powell v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A50989 (March 3, 2006) (Complainant was awarded $45,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages when the hostile work environment caused emotional distress).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission rejected an agency argument that an award of $60,000 by the administrative judge should be reduced to $15,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720130013 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the AJ's award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages of $60,000 is excessive and inconsistent with awards in similar cases. Specifically, with respect to the finding the Agency took issue with on appeal, the denial of reassignment, the Agency argues that an award of $15,000 is more appropriate and consistent with precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's presentation of evidence at the damages hearing consisted of testimony from himself and his wife. The Agency did not call any witnesses at the damages hearing. Both Complainant and his wife testified that he experienced symptoms of PTSD as early as 1993. Complainant testified that he was diagnosed with PTSD in the late 1990s, and that while working in Kansas City, he saw a mental health professional every other day. Complainant testified that his symptoms of PTSD and depression worsened in July 2009, one year before his July 2010 request for reassignment. Specifically, he testified that his supervisor's "aggressive" and "demeaning" behavior made him feel "less than zero." Both Complainant and his wife testified that Complainant's symptoms worsened after he was placed on administrative leave in November 2009, and that since February 2010 he was depressed and had higher blood pressure. Complainant testified that the denial of his request for accommodation resulted in stress and humiliation, and his wife testified that after Complainant's request was denied, his symptoms worsened, including an elevation of his blood-pressure. Complainant testified that he saw a mental health professional twice per month as of November/December 2010. The AJ found Complainant and his wife's testimony to be candid and credible. Additionally, the AJ found that the testimony was supported by documentary evidence. Neither Complainant, nor his wife, testified that his condition would have inevitably worsened, nor was there documentary evidence that his condition would have inevitably worsened absent the discrimination. We find substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's finding that any progression or aggravation of Complainant's condition is attributed to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has awarded compensatory damages amounts similar to the amount awarded in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the failure to accommodate spanned months and resulted in the complainant seeing a psychiatrist for an anxiety disorder, the Commission upheld an award of $60,000 by the administrative judge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found the following with regard to Complainant's testimony concerning the effect of the Agency's failure to provide her a reasonable accommodation: Complainant stated that she was humiliated by her supervisors' reactions to her requests for accommodation. AJ Decision at 43. Complainant's supervisors did not believe her and called her a liar. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This made her feel horrible, worthless, and less confident. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant also became angry and frustrated because she could not understand why the Agency did not take relatively simple measures to help her do her job. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. She became disillusioned about the future of her career. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant was preoccupied with the situation and no longer enjoyed activities and hobbies. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Her stress level increased, and she wakes up at night feeling anxious. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 43-44. Her increased stress and anxiety negatively affected her migraines. Complainant began seeing a psychiatrist on November 25, 2002, and continued to see him about once a month. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's psychiatrist testified that during her visits, Complainant discussed her reaction to her employer's response to her requests for accommodation for her migraine headaches. The psychiatrist corroborated that Complainant was frustrated by the lack of action on the part of the Agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant's psychiatrist diagnosed her with Anxiety Disorder NOS (not otherwise specified). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. He reached this conclusion based on the fact that Complainant was nervous, anxious, angry, frustrated, depressed and irritable, and had problems eating and sleeping. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. She also exhibited rapid eye movements, rapid speech, and quicker motor movements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's anxiety primarily related to the Agency's failure to accommodate her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 45. Complainant was prescribed medications, including Wellbutrin, which she took for a while, but she stopped taking the medications because of the adverse side effects. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant currently is prescribed anti-anxiety and sleep medications as needed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Complainant's psychiatrist described Complainant's Anxiety Disorder as <span id="Page_1883"></span>"moderately severe" and noted that there has been no improvement in her condition because she did not feel she was being treated fairly at work and still had not been accommodated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The AJ concluded that, based on the uncontested medical evidence and the credible testimony of Complainant and her psychiatrist, Complainant suffered mental and physical distress and loss of enjoyment of life that was directly and solely attributable to the Agency's discriminatory actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Complainant's psychiatrist testified that if Complainant is provided with an effective accommodation and feels better as a result, her mental state would begin to improve within a few months. We find that this does not obviate the AJ's finding regarding the nature of the harm already suffered by Complainant or its severity during the relevant time period. In fact, this further demonstrates that the Agency's failure to accommodate Complainant is largely responsible for Complainant's anxiety and stress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that comparator cases show that the award is monstrously excessive. We find, however, that the award of $60,000 is consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">Miller v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05A40871 (Jun. 29, 2006) (complainant awarded $70,000 in compensatory damages due to agency's failure to accommodate complainant's disability which resulted in complainant experiencing emotional distress stemming from financial problems caused by denial of accommodation); <span class="Italic">Henery v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A50034 (Sep. 22, 2005) (complainant awarded $60,000 in compensatory damages due to agency's failure to accommodate complainant's disability for four year period where complainant suffered from frustration, negativity, and loss of sleep and physical pain associated with resulting excessive walking, and caused significant increase in complainant's need for medical treatment, as well as increase in physical and emotional harm); <span class="Italic">Court v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A10114 (May 15, 2003) (complainant awarded $60,000 in compensatory damages due to agency's failure to accommodate complainant's disability which resulted depression and physical suffering for more than two years).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Irvin W. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120141773 (2016), increased the complainant's award from $10,500 to $60,000 where the complainant was able to establish that his condition had stabilized before the discriminatory incident:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission notes that record evidence confirmed that over a three year period, Complainant experienced an exacerbation of his pre-existing conditions for which he sought treatment caused by the stress created by the Agency's discriminatory actions. Complainant asserts that he suffered from anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and loss of consortium. He maintains he did not go out socially, and suffered from headaches, night sweats and loss of bone density. Most notably, he states he had tapered down his steroid dosage prior to reporting to Brussels, but was forced to increase the medication when the Agency refused to provide him with an accommodation of his disability. We find the evidence supports Complainant's position that his condition had stabilized and thus, the Agency is liable for the worsening of his condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720140022 (2015), where the discrimination exacerbated a preexisting condition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ found that Complainant suffered both emotional and physical distress as a result of the Agency's actions. In support of this finding, the AJ noted that Complainant suffered from sleeplessness, anxiety, stress, and depression as a result of discrimination for which the AJ ordered the Agency to pay Complainant $60,000 in nonpecuniary damages. On appeal, the Agency argues that Complainant was treated for some symptoms prior to the time she was subjected to discrimination. Complainant's evidence at the hearing regarding her pain and suffering consisted of her own testimony and that of her treating physician. On appeal, Complainant points out that she began taking an identified anti-depressant, Zoloft, in November 2008, after the discrimination occurred and also suffered an exacerbation of her existing symptoms, noted by the increase in the dose of sleeping medication she was prescribed after she was subjected to discrimination in 2008 through 2012.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Roxanna B. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120143067 (2016), increased a $15,000 to $60,000 where the complainant had previously been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and anxiety and alleged exacerbation of those conditions as well as problems sleeping, weight gain, embarrassment, humiliation, lost of interest in outside activities, fears of losing her job, colitis and chest pains due to the agency's discriminatory conduct.</p>
