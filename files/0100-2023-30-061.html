<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-59"><span class="space">3.</span> Subsequent Promotions--"Job Skipping"</h4>
<p class="noindent">In cases where the Commission orders retroactive reinstatement or a promotion as relief, there can be further questions of additional promotions that would have occurred but for the illegal discrimination. In such cases, "the remedy to which a complainant is entitled includes subsequent promotions which the complainant would likely have received had he or she received the position directly in issue at the time of the oriGINAl selection." <span class="Italic">Rai v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 05880596 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Locke v. Kansas City Power and Light Co.</span>, 660 F.2d 359 (8th Cir. 1981)); <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Claytor</span>, 629 F.2d 596 (9th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Foster v. Simon</span>, 467 F. Supp. 533 (W.D.N.C. 1979). This is sometimes referred to as "job skipping."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Rai</span>, the Commission also found that such relief is an entitlement and, as such, the complainant is not required to present evidence of a subsequent promotion during the investigation or hearing stage. "Rather, the complainant's entitlement to all appropriate relief is established upon a finding of discrimination and cannot be diminished by a failure to affirmatively assert each element of the necessary make whole relief." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission noted that its own order for relief included the phrase "all other benefits which the complainant would have received but for the discrimination suffered." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The general rule is that the Commission does not presume any subsequent promotions. The burden is on the complainant to show that any subsequent promotions would have been perfunctory in nature. Where the agency has a peer review process for promotions, such a showing cannot be made. <span class="Italic">Malek v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 04990009 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Allen v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 05900807 (1990), the Commission rejected arguments by the agency that granting subsequent promotions results in a windfall for complainants and further explained the criteria for granting such promotions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Eighth Circuit provides guidance in identifying the circumstances under which make-whole relief prescribed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405 (1975), would include promotion to a higher-level position than the one for which appellant was discriminatorily nonselected. <span class="Italic">Locke v. Kansas City Power and Light Co.</span>, 660 F.2d 359 (8th Cir. 1981). Appellant may establish that she is entitled to a higher level position by showing: (1) she has the particular skills or qualifications for the higher-level position; (2) the higher-level position was in a line of progression upward from the position for which she was discriminatorily nonselected; and (3) prerequisite service in the lower-level position is not itself justified by business necessity aside from the skills or other qualifications needed to perform in the higher level position. 660 F.2d at 369.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Allen</span> went on to note that <span class="Italic">Locke</span> only requires that the progression be normal and not automatic. "Thus, the term 'line of progression' as articulated in <span class="Italic">Locke</span> is not synonymous with 'career-ladder,' as the agency would have us believe." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The burden is on the complainant to establish entitlement to a subsequent competitive promotion. The complainant must "establish the likelihood" of such a promotion. <span class="Italic">Jewell v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0492001 (1993). Although career ladder promotions may tend to be routine, the complainant has a much higher burden of establishing a right to a subsequent merit promotion because the "speed and availability of competitive promotions vary widely both within a given agency and between the many departments of the federal government." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As a result, the complainant's promotion at another federal agency is entitled to little weight. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Winston v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01972099 (2000) (subsequent promotions of the selectee were too speculative for a claim of relief).</p>
<p class="noindent">Though it is difficult for a complainant to demonstrate that she would have received a subsequent competitive promotion, it is not impossible and the fact that the subsequent promotion is through competitive procedures does not <span class="Italic">per se</span> preclude the complainant from demonstrating entitlement to the position. In <span class="Italic">King v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 07A40003 (2005), the Commission upheld the finding of its administrative judge awarding a subsequent promotion noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relief provided under Title VII must be designed to make the victim of discrimination "whole" by placing her "as near as may be, in the situation [s]he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed."<span class="Italic"> Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 442 U.S. 405, 418-419 (1975). It is established Commission policy that remedial relief under Title VII includes placement into the position which the complainant would likely have received had she receive[d] the position directly in issue at the time of the oriGINAl selection. Further, the fact that the subsequent position would have had to have been obtained through the competitive process is not dispositive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rai v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880596 (August 12,1988 (the discriminatory denial of a GS-14 position may entitle the complainant to placement in a GS-15 position);<span class="Italic"> Allen v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900807 (September 11, 1990) (the discriminatory denial of a GS-12 position may entitle the complainant to placement in a GS-13 position); <span class="Italic">Ritchie v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952558 (February 10, 1998) (the discriminatory termination of a temporary employee may entitle the employee to placement into a career position).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, after a hearing, the AJ determined that complainant had presented sufficient evidence to establish the likelihood that she would have been selected for a Branch Manager after having been selected for the Hub Manager position. Indeed, the individual selected for the Hub Manager position over complainant was selected for a Branch Manager position. Furthermore, there was evidence that such promotion occurred during the relevant time, and after the incumbent [had] served in a Hub Manager capacity. Evidence from the agency's witness supported the AJ's finding that complainant would have likely been selected for a subsequent promotion. Accordingly, we find insufficient evidence to overturn the AJ's decision to place complainant into the Branch Manager position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although bidding procedures remove much of the speculation from promotion decisions, a complainant's contention that he would have bid on a particular job may be too speculative for purposes of granting relief. For example, in <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120053035 (2006), the Commission found that the complainant was entitled to retroactive reinstatement to his previous position or a comparable position. However, the Commission declined to grant the complainant a promotion based on his argument that had he not been constructively discharged he would have bid for a higher level position and received it. The Commission found that the complainant's claim that he would have bid on promotion positions to be too speculative.</p>
<p class="noindent">Generally, complainants will have a hard time establishing that they are entitled to additional competitive promotions as part of their relief for prohibited discrimination, and agencies have a correspondingly tough burden to meet in establishing that complainants are not entitled to noncompetitive, or career ladder, promotions. In <span class="Italic">Watson v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01941462 (1994), the Commission rejected the notion that the burden of proof with respect to remedy falls on the complainant in a case involving a noncompetitive promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the grade level at which appellant must be reinstated, it is the position of the Commission that an agency has the burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence that an employee would not have received a noncompetitive promotion even in the absence of discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Day v. Mathews</span>, 530 F. 2d 1083 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Guillen v. Dept. of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930833 (October 26, 1993). In this case, the evidence of record establishes that, with the exception of two students who failed the program, all of the students in appellant's class were noncompetitively promoted to the GS-14 level. Appellant has argued that, but for the unlawful discrimination, he too would have achieved the GS-14 level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency has argued that appellant did not complete the training, and, in essence, produced no evidence that he was qualified for the GS-14 level. The Commission notes that in its previous decision, it found that if appellant had not been subject to unlawful discrimination, he would have successfully completed the entire 13-phase NETP; the Commission ordered that appellant be allowed to complete the NETP without further formal testing. The logical consequence of the Commission's prior finding is that appellant would have been noncompetitively promoted to GS-14 in the absence of unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that, but for the unlawful discrimination, appellant would have been promoted to the GS-14 level, the Commission must now determine the method by which to compute appellant's backpay and benefits, a matter complicated by the fact that there is no way to determine on what dates appellant would have received interim promotions to the GS-12 and GS-13 levels. The Commission has recognized that the computation of backpay is inherently speculative. Consequently, unrealistic exactitude is not required. Further, the law is well-settled that once an employer is found to have discriminated, uncertainties in determining what an employee would have earned should be resolved against the discriminating employer<span class="Italic">. McIsaac v. Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920136 (March 30, 1992); <span class="Italic">Salinas v. Roadway Express, Inc.</span>, 735 F.2d 1574, 1578 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant has argued that he should receive backpay and benefits as though he had completed the progression from GS-7 to GS-14 within the minimum possible time of 825 days. This suggested method does not address the matter of interim promotions, nor does it acknowledge <span id="Page_1757"></span>that no one in appellant's class achieved the GS-14 level in so short a time; in fact, most of appellant's classmates took considerably longer. Nonetheless, the Commission must determine some means of calculating appellant's backpay and benefits. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the agency must calculate appellant's backpay and benefits as if appellant had progressed at the same rate his fastest-rising classmate, who achieved the grade of GS-14 863 days after his appointment to GS-7....</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not prevent a complainant from demonstrating that she would have been subsequently selected for a permanent position when she was discriminatorily denied a temporary position. In <span class="Italic">Paris v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 01973306 (1998), the agency argued that the complainant was not entitled to an opportunity to demonstrate entitlement to the additional remedy because the oriGINAl decision, in which the only issue was the temporary promotion, was dispositive on the remedy question. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Paris</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is established Commission policy that remedial relief under Title VII includes placement into the position which the complainant would likely have received had she received the position directly in issue at the time of the oriGINAl selection. Further, the fact that the subsequent position would have had to have been obtained through the competitive process is not dispositive....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission does not agree that the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> precludes the application of the principles of make whole relief in the instant case. The question of whether appellant could establish that she was intentionally subjected to discrimination on the basis of her race when she was nonselected for a position for which she did not apply, and for which she was not eligible to apply, is not an equivalent cause of action to the issue of whether, had the agency not discriminatorily nonselected her for a temporary position, she would now be a permanent agency employee. In addition, the Commission notes that appellant points to positions other than the Clerk-Word Processor positions which became vacant during the period of July 29, 1989, through January 29, 1990.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Commission finds that this matter must be remanded to the agency for a determination as to whether appellant would likely have been selected for a permanent position in accordance with the agencies normal business practices had she remained an agency employee during the period of July 29, 1989, through January 29, 1990<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Allen v. Department of Defense, supra; Locke v. Kansas City Power and Light Co.</span>, 660 F.2d 359, 369 (8th Cir. 1981). Appellant's specific arguments as to her entitlement to a permanent position require an examination of the treatment of comparable employees, including the selectees for the temporary Clerk position and other temporary employees during the period in question. In addition, it appears that there are several positions which may have been available. Until the agency makes a determination as to the precise relief to which appellant is entitled, any decision by this Commission would be speculative in nature or may address issues which the parties otherwise may have amicably resolved themselves<span class="Italic">. Rai, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where, during the pendency of the litigation, the at-issue position and its pay is restructured, the complainant may have a difficult time proving her entitlement to a subsequent promotion. In <span class="Italic">Dionne W. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0720150040 (2018), the complainant applied but was not selected for a GS-15 position. While her case made its way through the EEO process, the position was recreated as an NSA position at the SES level. The administrative judge deemed the complainant SES eligible and placed her into the position. The Commission reversed the administrative judge, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ ordered that Complainant to be placed into an SES position due to her non-selection for a Director position. The Agency argues that the position to which Complainant applied and was not selected was a GS-15 position. Agency Brief, p. 25-26.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant who prevails in whole or in part on a claim of discrimination is entitled to full relief which places him/her in the position s/he would have been in absent the agency's discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-419 (1975). For cases in which the employee is not selected for a position or promotion due to discrimination, this would include an offer of placement into the position sought, or a substantially equivalent position. <span class="Italic">See Carson v. Dep't. of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100078 (Feb. 16, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant applied for a Supervisory Information Technology Specialist, J9 Director (GS-15) position and was not selected in August 2012. The individual who was selected occupied the position at the GS-15 level from August 10, 2012 until he left in 2013. In 2013, another individual was placed into the position, and served in at the SES level. The AJ reasoned that Complainant would have been eligible for placement into an SES position at that time given that she is eligible for hire as an SES. However, the Agency explained that the SES position in question which was created in 2013 was a National Security Agency (NSA) position, and not a position with the Agency. The individual selected to fill the position was an NSA employee, serving as either a "detailee" or "integree" with the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the position to which Complainant applied and was not selected was a GS-15 position, and a promotion to SES was not guaranteed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Millenson v. Dep't of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01964298 (Oct. 23, 1997) (finding that promotion to an SES position was too speculative to order as relief). Therefore, the AJ's conclusion that Complainant was entitled to placement in an SES position is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining the proper grade level for reinstatement of a complainant, it is appropriate to consider the grade level obtained by similarly situated employees who were not subject to discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Watson v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05950040 (1996), the Commission ordered the complainant reinstated to a grade 14 position where 11 of the 13 students in his training class all received promotions with minimum time-in-grade. The Commission found that, but for the discrimination, the complainant would have successfully completed the training and, thus, was entitled to reinstatement at the grade 14 level. However, the complainant also was entitled to complete the training because "pay status is not equivalent to operational status." The Commission noted that training was necessary for the complainant to be able to perform at the grade 14 level.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120113877 (2014), where the complainant would have received an accretion of duties promotion but for the discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's award clearly ordered the Agency to include all benefits that Complainant would have received had he been selected, which would have included the accretion of duties promotion in March 2009. As such, the Agency must retroactively promote Complainant to the GS-10 level beginning when the selectee was promoted in March 2009, and re-calculate and pay Complainant the appropriate amount of back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission used a slightly different approach in <span class="Italic">Cvijanovich v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A13904 (2003). In that case, the Commission found that selectees under the vacancy announcement were hired at the GS-11 level, but that the position was developmental with promotion potential to GS-12. The selectees all received training to perform at the GS-12 level and were promoted after a period of acceptable performance at the 11 level. The Commission determined that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Cvijanovich</span> was entitled to be retroactively reinstated at the GS-11 level, and "[o]nce complainant completes this mandatory training and has demonstrated satisfactory performance at the GS-11 level in the same manner as other similarly situated employees, the agency should offer complainant the same opportunity for promotion to the GS-12 level as the other selectees."</p>
<p class="noindent">A good example of a situation where the complainant was entitled to subsequent promotions is provided in <span class="Italic">Henry v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07200601 (2007). In that case, the complainant, a GS-6 medical technician, applied for a promotion to a supervisory vacancy with a GS-6/7/8 grade range. The complainant was determined to be eligible at the GS-6 level, but was not selected. By the time the case was decided at hearing, the complainant would have been at the GS-8 level and that is the relief the administrative judge ordered. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, modified that order instead awarding the complainant the position at the GS-6 level and two subsequent promotions to the GS-8 level, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that the AJ correctly found that as a result of the discriminatory non-selection complainant should be retroactively promoted. However, we slightly modify the retroactive promotion of complainant to the position. Specifically, we conclude that even absent discrimination, complainant was not entitled to a GS-8 level position until June 1, 2004. We find that the agency has presented clear and convincing evidence that on December 3, 2002, complainant did not meet applicable specialized experience and time-in-grade requirements for promotion to the GS-7 or GS-8 level. The record reveals that complainant did not meet the requirements for the GS-7 level until June 2003, and for the GS-8 level until June 2004. Accordingly, we modify the AJ's decision to award complainant back pay and interest and other benefits commensurate with his eligibility in accordance with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120053382 (2007), the Commission determined that the complainant was denied a position as a firefighter based on his race. The Commission also determined that the complainant would have subsequently been promoted to fire captain had he been initially selected. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is established Commission policy that any remedial relief includes any subsequent promotion that a complainant would likely have received if he had been selected for the position at issue. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of Defense (Defense Logistics Agency),</span> EEOC Request No. 05900807 (September 11, 1990); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940482 (September 21, 1995); <span class="Italic">Red v. Department of Interior,</span> EEOC Request No. 05880596 (August 12, 1988). We have previously found that the fact that further promotions would have to be made through the competitive process is not dispositive to the issue. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant may establish that he is entitled to a higher level position over and above the one for which he was not selected due to discrimination by showing, (1) he has the particular skills or qualifications <span id="Page_1758"></span>for the higher-level position; (2) the higher-level position was in a line of progression upward from the position for which he was discriminatorily not selected; and (3) prerequisite service in the lower-level position is not itself justified by business necessity aside from the skills or other qualifications needed to perform in the higher-level position. <span class="Italic">Allen, supra, citing Locke v. Kansas City Power and Light Co.,</span> 660 F.2d 359, 369 (8th Cir. 1981). When there has been a finding of discrimination, the agency must prove by clear and convincing evidence that complainant would not have been entitled to a subsequent promotion even absent unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of Defense (Defense Logistics Agency),</span> EEOC Request No. 05900807 (September 11, 1990); <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. Barry,</span> 869 F.2d 605, 614 (D.C. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Day v. Matthews,</span> 530 F.2d 1083, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 1976); 29 C.F.R. 1614.501(c)(l).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission noted that comparatives selected for the firefighter position had subsequently been promoted to captain. It also rejected an argument that the complainant would not have completed the necessary training for promotion, in part, because one of the selectees for captain was allowed to complete his training after selection.</p>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 0420060035 (2007), the Commission rejected the complainant's argument that had he properly received the promotion to the GS-14 level that the Commission ordered as relief, he would have received performance bonuses and a promotion to GS-15. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner has incorrectly interpreted our order. It does not include a retroactive promotion or any entitlement to a GS-15 position. The order states that the agency is to promote petitioner "retroactively to the effective date of the selectee's promotion to the position of Program Management Officer, <span class="Italic">GS-340-14, or a substantially equivalent position." Johnson v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30128 (Aug. 11, 2005) (emphasis added). A plain reading of the phrase "substantially equivalent position" does not imply placing petitioner in a grade higher than GS-14, but rather, in a position that is similar in duties, responsibilities, and location (reasonable commuting distance) to the position for which he oriGINAlly applied. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Monroig v. U.S. Commission on Civil Rights,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04A40029 (Sept. 29, 2005); <span class="Italic">Spicer v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04980007 (Sept. 24, 1998). Furthermore, we have consistently found that claims that an individual would have received a promotion subsequent to the discriminatory act are speculative, particularly when the promotion is competitive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A02707 (Aug. 14, 2002). Here, petitioner sought to apply competitively for GS-15 positions; these were not part of a career ladder progression. As such, his assertion that he would have obtained a GS-15 position, even absent the discrimination is entirely speculative. In the same vein, we find that his claims of entitlement to higher grade performance bonuses, benefits, and back pay are also speculative. <span class="Italic">See Rafalski v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04A30023 (Apr. 14, 2004); <span class="Italic">see also Morgan v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> EEOC Petition No. 04980027 (Dec. 16, 1999) (noting that "to allow a petitioner, in a non-selection case, to receive compensation for a higher level of performance not exhibited, would be too speculative.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0420140007 (2015), the Commission found that the agency erred in delaying the complainant's subsequent promotion where management had delayed the starting date for the selectee. The Commission found that the time for calculating the complainant's subsequent promotion began at the time of selection and not the time the selectee assumed the position. In the same case, the Commission also found that the complainant's attempt to have the agency clarify its offer was not a rejection of that offer:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has failed to offer and retroactively place Complainant in a position to comply with the Commission's Order. Petitioner is entitled to make-whole relief for the Agency's discrimination. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 442 U.S. 405 (1975). Such relief can include subsequent promotions that a complainant likely would have received if he had been selected for the position in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See generally Complainant v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900807 (Sept. 11, 1990). In this regard, the Commission's case law distinguishes between competitive and career ladder promotions. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910201 (March 14, 1991) (Complainant not entitled to be placed at grade level beyond his career ladder, which he could only have obtained competitively, as such relief would be speculative). We note that the record reflects that this was a career ladder position to an EAS-19. 3 Complainant's attorney asserts that Complainant should initially be retroactively placed in the Labor Relations Specialist position as an EAS-17 and then 18 months after that appointment date, Complainant shall be retroactively promoted to an EAS-19. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency sent Complainant two job offers for the position at issue. However, it is unclear from the wording of these job offers when the Agency intended to promote Complainant to the EAS-19 level. We note that in response to the Agency's January 23, 2014 job offer, Complainant's attorney responded via letter dated February 6, 2014. Therein, Complainant's attorney stated that Complainant accepted the job offer to the extent it complied with the Commission's Order. Complainant's attorney also requested clarification of the job offer. Specifically, Complainant's attorney stated "please contact me immediately if the Agency's offer is not intended to be retroactive (that is, if the offer does not place [Petitioner] at the EAS-19 level effective 18 months from his retroactive appointment date)." The Agency in its correspondence to the Commission dated March 20, 2014, determined that it viewed Complainant's attorney's response to be a rejection of the job offer. We disagree. Rather, we find Complainant was simply seeking clarification of the Agency's job offers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Complainant's February 6, 2014 letter to the Agency, Complainant's attorney asserts that Complainant's retroactive appointment date into the position in question should be May 21, 2008, rather than August 16, 2008. Specifically, Complainant's attorney asserts "I note for the record that the Agency's job offer letter indicates [Petitioner's] appointment is retroactive to August 16, 2008. I understand this to be because the selectee did not move into the Labor Relations Specialist position until that date. The selectee, however, was promoted to that position in May 21, 2008 date; she did not move into her position until August due to her prior management's delay in releasing her." The prior OFO order set forth that Complainant's appointment "shall be retroactive to the date the selectee was hired." Based on the foregoing, we find that Complainant's appointment should be retroactive to the date the selectee was officially placed in the position in question, that is, the official effective date listed on the selectee's Personnel Action form.'</p>
<p class="noindent">Even in the absence of a showing that the complainant would have been promoted but for discrimination, the employee is entitled to be made whole for lost advancement opportunities. When improper documentation is placed in the employee's official personnel file, it is not sufficient to merely remove the documents if consideration of the information contained in them caused the employee to lose advancement opportunities. The employee must be given the opportunities lost. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v. Postmaster General</span>, 05890235 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the fact that the complainant has lost advancement opportunities does not compel a finding that advancement is the proper remedy. In some cases, restoring the opportunity for advancement is the proper remedy because actual advancement is speculative and possibly places the complainant in a better position than she would have been in, but for the discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00180 (2000), the Commission determined that the order of an administrative judge to convert the complainant from a transitional position to a part-time flexible position went beyond the scope of full relief:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the remedy, however, we agree with the agency that the AJ's recommend relief would place complainant in a position greater than that which she was at the time of her termination. The AJ noted in his decision that all TE's were either removed or converted to PTF positions through the administration of special examinations, which if passed by the TE, caused the employee to convert from TE status to PTF status. The AJ also noted that complainant had previously passed a battery of tests administered by the agency. Thus, it is presumed that the AJ made his determination that complainant should be placed into a PTF position for these reasons....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as complainant has established discrimination, she is entitled to "make whole" relief. "Make whole" relief has been defined as the placement of an individual, as near as may be, in the situation he would have been in absent the discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-419 (1975). We find that the AJ's determination that complainant be placed into a PTF position is clearly speculative and not supported by the record. The Commission has been reluctant to assume that an individual, absent a discriminatory act, would have subsequently received a competitive promotion<span class="Italic">. Ritchie v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No 05980501 (February 11, 1999); <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04950024 (February 8, 1996). Based on the foregoing, the Commission concludes that offering complainant placement into a PTF Carrier position goes beyond what constitutes "make whole" relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">Instead, in <span class="Italic">Tyler</span>, the Commission ordered the agency to rescind the complainant's separation, and to award back pay and benefits from her date of separation until the expiration of her appointment to allow her to compete for any career positions that she would have been entitled to compete for in the absence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Hollimon v. Postmaster General</span>, 01981377 (2000), the Commission found that the proper remedy for a discriminatory failure to convert the complainant from transitional to part-time flexible status was the actual conversion, unless the agency could demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would not have converted the complainant even absent discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Hollimon</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relief, the AJ ordered the agency to "[a]fford complainant the opportunity for [conversion and if] the agency decides that complainant <span id="Page_1759"></span>should have been [converted] to a PTF position, then an award of backpay...should be accomplished." We find that the AJ's recommended remedy is inadequate. We have previously held that where a selection process is discriminatory at any phase, the applicant must be awarded full relief, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the position retroactively, unless the employer shows by clear and convincing evidence that even in the absence of discrimination, the applicant would not have been selected<span class="Italic">. See Pryor v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05980405 (August 6, 1999). Placing such an onerous burden on the employer is proper, inasmuch as the employer's unlawful acts caused the difficulty in determining what would have resulted if there had been no discrimination<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> Thus, in a case such as this one, complainant is entitled to retroactive placement in a Distribution Clerk, Part-Time-Flexible position because the agency did not show by clear and convincing evidence that, even absent discrimination, it would not have selected complainant for the position he desired<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">It is difficult to reconcile the holdings in <span class="Italic">Tyler</span> and <span class="Italic">Hollimon</span>. Though it is less than clear from the Commission's decisions, the difference may lie in the fact that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Tyler</span> demonstrated discrimination in the conversion process by showing that she was denied the opportunity to compete for a number of conversions. In <span class="Italic">Hollimon</span>, it appears the finding of discrimination was based on the challenge to a particular conversion.</p>
<p class="noindent">That may also explain the finding in <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993112 (2001), where the Commission upheld the decision of an administrative judge to award the complainant a promotion in a case that involved training opportunities and assignments. In <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, the Commission finds that the AJ's decision summarized the relevant facts and referenced the appropriate regulations, policies, and laws. We discern no basis to disturb the AJ's decision. A review of the record demonstrated that complainant was not afforded an equal opportunity at advancement to the supervisory position due to the nature of his assignments while on the 204-B program. Complainant was repeatedly assigned to the hardest work areas and then only as a relief supervisor, whereas his co-workers were assigned to their own units. Complainant's assignments were not the same assignments given to the vast majority of the 204-B program participant and thus, he may not have been as prepared as his co-workers for the supervisor position. Despite this, however, the preponderance of the testimony reveals that complainant's work was outstanding and that he would have made a good supervisor. The AJ's finding that the preponderance of the evidence supports complainant's contention that he was discriminated against on the bases of race and reprisal is supported by substantial evidence in the record. The AJ's determination that had complainant remained in the 204-B program, and been afforded more traditional assignments instead of being sent unit to unit, he would have been promoted to a supervisory position is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Finally the AJ's findings with respect to the evidence of a discriminatory animus on the MDO's part are also supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>
