<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-44"><span class="space">14.</span> Physical Contact or Conduct</h4>
<p class="noindent">Physical contact of a sexual nature can, <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span>, establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of hostile environment. <span class="Italic">DePaul v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912729 (1992). "[I]t is the policy of the Commission to presume that the unwelcome, intentional touching of an employee's intimate body areas is sufficiently offensive to alter the conditions of her working environment and to create a hostile environment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Depaul</span>, the complainant was subjected to several incidents involving the touching of her breasts and other intimate contact.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Jones v. Postmaster General</span>, 01952445 (1997), the Commission found that one incident of the harasser squeezing the appellant's buttocks was sufficiently offensive to violate Title VII. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> had also alleged other incidents of harassment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to appellant, as the RO passed by her he squeezed her buttocks with his left hand. Appellant testified that she was both angry and upset as a result of this incident (the Incident), and she also notes that this was not the first time the RO had harassed her. In this regard, appellant testified that the RO would occasionally block her path and say nasty things when he passed her. Appellant also cited several sexually suggestive comments the RO had made to her, and noted that, after she had filed her EEO complaint, the RO would walk by and curse her under his breath. The Commission will presume that the unwelcome, intentional touching of a charging party's intimate body areas is sufficiently offensive to alter the conditions of her working environment and constitute a violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">More so than in the case of verbal advances or remarks, a single unwelcome physical advance can seriously poison a victim's working environment.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">(Emphasis added.) <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Marielle L. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120162299 (2018) (a single incident of a coworker hitting the complainant on the buttocks with a cane was insufficiently severe or pervasive to rise to the level of harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954703 (1998), the Commission found that a single incident of a coworker sticking his tongue into the complainant's ear was sufficient for a finding of harassment. Although a single incident may establish the existence of a hostile environment, the complainant also must establish that the agency failed to take prompt and effective remedial action in order for the agency to be liable under Title VII. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant did not complain of or describe any incidents other than the occurrence on August 20, 1994. The Commission has held that, in general, unless the conduct complained of is very severe, a single incident will not be regarded as discriminatory treatment<span class="Italic">. Taylor v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942699 (March 7, 1996); Policy Guidance On Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, EEOC Notice No. N-915-050 at 16 (March 19, 1990) <span class="Italic">citing Barrett v. Omaha National Bank</span>, 584 F. Supp. 22, 35 (D. Neb. 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 726 F.2d 424 (8th Cir. 1984). Violations have been found in cases involving single incidents where the harasser forcibly grabbed and kissed the complainant while they were alone in a storeroom, and where the harasser slid his hand under the complainant's skirt and squeezed her buttocks<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at n.24, <span class="Italic">citing</span> Commission Decision No. 83-1, CCH EEOC Decisions 6834 (1983); Commission Decision No. 84-3, CCH Employment Practices Guide 6841 (1984). We find that the co-worker's act of sticking his tongue into appellant's ear, like the incidents cited as examples in the Commission's policy guidance, is sufficiently severe to give rise to a hostile work environment, in and of itself. We now turn to whether the agency took prompt remedial action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the agency knows or has reason to know about the occurrence of acts of sexual harassment on the part of its employees but fails to take immediate and effective action reasonably calculated to end the harassment, including making the victim whole, it will be held liable for a violation of Title VII<span class="Italic">. Taylor</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942699; Policy Guidance, EEOC Notice No. N-915-050 at 29-30, <span class="Italic">Hirschfield v. New Mexico Corrections Dept</span>., 916 F.2d 572, 577 (9th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Hacienda Hotel</span>, 881 F.2d 1504, 1516 (9th Cir. 1989), Disciplinary action against the offending employee may be necessary. In this case, the manager knew that the incident in question had occurred. The manager stated that he did nothing more than discuss with the offending co-worker, in general terms, behavior that might constitute sexual harassment, He did not discipline the co-worker, nor does it appear from the record that he took any action to separate the co-worker from appellant to ensure that they had no further contact. Indeed, the sparseness of the investigative file undermines the manager's claim that the matter was thoroughly investigated. We therefore find that the agency failed to take prompt remedial action as it was required to do.</p>

<p class="noindent">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10988 (2001), the Commission found that a single incident of a coworker grabbing and squeezing the complainant's breasts, and then commenting on how soft they were, was sufficiently severe to constitute harassment. The Commission found, however, that the agency was not liable for the harassment because the perpetrator was a coworker and the agency took prompt remedial action once it learned of the alleged harassment. In <span class="Italic">Kyle v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01a55295.txt">01A55295</a> (2005), the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim where the complainant alleged several instances of physical touching on two particular days and the touchings were with sufficient force to leave marks on her body. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wolff v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 0120083727 (2009) (single incident of supervisor hugging complainant, placing his legs between hers, rubbing against her chest, and saying he should leave his wife to take her out sufficiently severe or pervasive to create hostile environment); <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120065324 (2008) (single incident of coworker hugging complainant from behind and gyrating his pelvis while saying "oh baby, oh baby" sufficiently severe or pervasive to create hostile environment).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922440 (1994), the Commission noted its policy "to presume that the unwelcome, intentional touching of an employee's intimate body areas is sufficiently offensive to alter the condition of her working environment and to create a hostile environment." In that case, the Commission found that one episode where the management official cornered the complainant in his office, attempting to kiss her and massage her breasts, was sufficient to establish a hostile environment, even absent other incidents of harassment presented in the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Incidents of physical contact do not always rise to the level of being sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Samuel v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A40751 (2005), the Commission held that the complainant's allegations that his supervisor had yelled at him, shook his finger at him, poked him in the chin and grabbed the complainant by the shoulder did not state a claim for relief. The Commission noted that "[w]hile the claimed actions of the supervisor may have been unprofessional, the actions are not severe or pervasive enough to constitute actionable harassment." <span class="Italic">Id. See also</span> <span class="Italic">Redman v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120092733 (2011) (incident where employee touched complainant's elbow and ran his hand up her arm not sufficiently severe or pervasive to state a claim of hostile environment harassment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even where there is physical contact between the alleged harasser and victim, the complainant must establish that the contact was sexual in nature in order to prevail on a claim of sexual harassment. In the alternative, the complainant must show that the contact is at least based on gender. In <span class="Italic">Hilbern v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 01940618 (1994), the complainant failed to prevail on such a claim where the testimony clearly indicated that the alleged harasser had a habit of slapping people on the back, both male and female, and all witnesses agreed that they did not perceive the conduct as sexual.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the physical conduct results in an injury to the victim of harassment, this clearly meets the severe or pervasive requirement. As the Commission found in <span class="Italic">Ayers v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01970359 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The harassment in this case involves verbal and physical conduct. CW1's persistent requests for dates escalated to unwelcome physical touching. The unwelcome touching escalated to ongoing hostility and intimidation. The hostility culminated in a physical injury which has left complainant physically disabled and unable to work. In addition, the record reveals that complainant contemporaneously expressed discomfort and fear in response to CW1's conduct. The Commission finds this harassing conduct to be severe, based on standards of reasonable conduct in the workplace, and complainant's credible and corroborated statements that she was hurt both emotionally and physically.</p>
<p class="noindent">As in many other areas, however, the Commission is inconsistent in applying its <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that one incident of physical contact is sufficient to create a hostile environment. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Byers v. Postmaster General</span>, 01956140 (1998), found that the complainant failed to state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of harassment despite alleging two incidents in which a coworker grabbed her arm and kissed her:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant testified that she was in a hallway walking towards the copier room on August 31, 1994, when CO 1 approached her, grabbed her by the head, pulled her face towards him, and kissed her on the cheek. Appellant asked CO 1 what he was doing and told him not to touch her hair. CO 1 allegedly responded that "it felt good" and asked appellant why she had not called him. When appellant told CO 1 she did not have time to call him, CO 1 returned to a meeting he was attending. A few minutes later, however, CO 1 returned. He then grabbed appellant by her left forearm, told her she had pretty legs, and puckered his lips. Appellant told CO 1 that he was crazy and that he was "going to mess around and get hurt." CO 1 testified that he grabbed appellant because he thought she was falling, and was then told not to touch her hair. There were no witnesses to this incident. Appellant testified that she informed the Supervisor, <span id="Page_844"></span>Distribution Operations (Supervisor 1), the acting Manager, Distribution Operations (the Manager), and two co-workers of the incident. Supervisor 1 confirmed that appellant informed him of the incident; the Manager testified that appellant told him that she was having a problem with an unnamed employee. In response to the Manager's offer to have the matter investigated, appellant stated that Supervisor 1 was handling the problem and that she did not want an investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant testified that on September 1, 1994, she was sitting with a co-worker (CO 2) in the cafeteria when CO 1 approached their table. She stated that he kissed CO 2 on her forehead and then grabbed appellant's right forearm. Appellant snatched her arm away from CO 1 and instructed him not to touch her, CO 1 then said, "I like a feisty woman," and tried to touch appellant again, but she pulled away, CO 1 then said, "I would love to chase you around my house." Appellant then told CO 1 that her husband would not like him (CO 1) putting his hand on her and CO 1 eventually left the table. CO 2 confirmed appellant's version of events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CO 1 testified that after greeting CO 2, he asked appellant how she was doing and attempted to shake her hand, but she pulled her hand back. CO 1 stated that when he asked appellant what was wrong, she did not respond. He then told appellant that she was "mighty feisty." CO 1 stated that appellant then showed him pictures of herself and her fiancee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the September 1st incident, appellant approached the Manager and told him that she wanted to file sexual harassment charges. The Manager testified, however, that Supervisor 1 and appellant entered his office later that same day and indicated that the matter was settled. On September 2, 1994, all of the involved parties met, at CO 1's insistence, to clear the air. The Manager testified that appellant agreed to the meeting but stated that if she met with CO 1, she was going to file sexual harassment charges. After the meeting, the Manager tasked a Supervisor, Distribution Operations (Supervisor 2) with conducting an administrative inquiry into the sexual harassment charges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 12, 1994, Supervisor 2 issued a memorandum confirming that he had interviewed CO 1 relative to the sexual harassment charges and that he had explained the severity of such charges. Supervisor 2 advised CO 1 not to approach appellant on the premises. CO 1 agreed to these instructions. In his April 18, 1995 affidavit, Supervisor 2 noted that appellant and CO 1 were working on different tours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its FAD, the agency found that appellant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of hostile environment sexual harassment. It concluded that the alleged harassment was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment or to create an abusive or hostile work environment. Furthermore, the agency found that immediate and appropriate corrective action was taken as soon as it was put on notice of the alleged harassment. Accordingly, it concluded that there was no basis for imputing liability to the employer under agency principles. The agency also noted that appellant and her alleged harasser are now working on different tours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that appellant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of hostile environment sexual harassment. The three incidents which she has described are not sufficient to establish a hostile work environment based on sexual harassment. Appellant failed to show that her work environment was permeated with "discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult" that "is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that appellant established a case of harassment, we find that the agency would not be liable. In order to avoid liability for hostile environment sexual harassment, the agency must demonstrate: (1) that the acts/conduct complained of did not occur; (2) that the conduct complained of was not "unwelcome"; (3) that the alleged harassment was not "sufficiently severe or pervasive" to alter the conditions of the victim's employment so as to create an abusive work environment; (4) immediate and appropriate corrective action was taken as soon as the employer was put on notice; and/or (5) there is no basis for imputing liability to the employer under agency principles<span class="Italic">. See Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. at 62-67. First, we find that these three incidents were not "sufficiently severe or pervasive" to alter the conditions of appellant's employment and create an abusive working environment. Second, we find that the agency took immediate and appropriate corrective action as soon as it was put on notice. Specifically, the agency conducted an immediate investigation and instructed CO 1 to stay away from appellant. Further, CO 1 subsequently was assigned to a different tour than appellant, Accordingly, we find that there is no basis for imputing liability to the employer under agency principles.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no doubt that the Commission's determination that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Byers</span> did not allege a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is inconsistent with its previous case law on physical contact. Arguably, a distinction can be made between touching a person's breasts or buttocks and kissing them. But it would seem that such a distinction is totally meaningless to the victim who would be justified in fearing that such a kiss is merely a prelude to more blatant sexual conduct. <span class="Italic">See Ellison v. Brady</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The real problem for the complainant in <span class="Italic">Byers</span> is that the agency took prompt and effective corrective action as the Commission rightly notes. As a result, the agency should not be held liable for the conduct. The Commission would have done far better to rely solely on that basis in finding no discrimination in <span class="Italic">Byers</span>, rather than leaving the impression that some levels of physical contact are acceptable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even when there is not physical contact, the physical nature of conduct is taken into account in determining whether it rises to the level of being sufficiently severe or pervasive. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60803 (2006), the complainant alleged that incidents on two days about a month apart created a hostile work environment on the basis of his national origin. The incidents included a supervisor screaming and swearing at the complainant, slamming down a telephone several times, throwing a chair across the room, and acting like he was going to hit the complainant. Although the Commission noted that the agency had cited a number of OFO decisions in support of its dismissal of the claim, it found that none of those cases involved behavior as violent as the throwing of a chair by a management official The Commission reached a similar conclusion in <span class="Italic">Felton v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0720060046 (2006), where a male supervisor raised his fists at a female complainant, who felt threatened by the supervisor's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">When physical contact is combined with verbal conduct it is more likely to create a hostile environment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Smith-Riggins v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120093837 (2011), the Commission found the act of pushing the complainant and causing her pain, combined with comments about how she would look in a bikini and that she was wearing lace underwear, created a hostile environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next examine whether the unwelcome conduct was "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [complainant's] employment and create an abusive working environment." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</span> 23 U.S. 75 (1998). In determining whether the unwelcome conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive, the Commission evaluates the harasser's conduct from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc.,</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002, at 6 (Mar. 8, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While a single incident or isolated incidents of offensive conduct or remarks generally do not create an abusive environment, a single incident may be sufficient to create an abusive environment if it is unusually severe. Here, we find that. Postmaster's remarks on bikinis and lace underwear, coupled with physically pushing Complainant, constituted unusually severe conduct. In particular, we emphasize the public nature of Complainant's humiliation in front of three other employees, who were directed by the Postmaster to look at Complainant's buttocks and intimate apparel. We also emphasize that the conduct was not limited to verbal remarks. Rather, the verbal conduct culminated in physical conduct, which resulted in physical pain to Complainant, Given the public nature of the humiliation and the physical conduct and pain suffered by Complainant, we find such behavior to be sufficiently severe to create an abusive environment. Therefore, Complainant satisfied the fourth element in establishing a hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a case involving conduct rather than contact, the Commission held that one incident where a male employee unzipped his pants in front of a female custodial supervisor was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120081101 (2010), the complainant was supervising a male custodian who was cleaning a men's room. A mail handler told the complainant to leave the men's room because he was going to use it. As the Commission recounted in its decision in <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant testified that she told C that the restroom was closed, and he could not use it. She stated that C then unbuckled his pants to the extent that she could see "his pubic hairs at the baseline of his underwear" and used a partitioned urinal. Hearing Transcript, p. 203. She stated that when she heard him urinating, she left the restroom. She stated that she immediately went to management officials and reported the incident while they were having a meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the AJ properly found that the April 14, 2005 incident is not severe enough to constitute sexual harassment. In so finding, we note that although C's conduct was tactless and unrefined, EEO regulations are not a general civility code. Rather, they forbid "only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim's employment." <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc</span>., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998). In this case, complainant was subjected to a momentary incidental glimpse of the top of C's underwear as he used the restroom at a partitioned urinal in the men's restroom. Moreover, we note that C alerted complainant that he had an urgent need to use the men's restroom before he used it in her presence. Contrary to complainant's assertions, this is clearly not the type of lewd or lascivious indecent exposure that we have previously found to constitute harassment. <span class="Italic">See Wendy L. Lemons v. Bureau of Prisons</span>, EEOC <span id="Page_845"></span>Appeal No. 0120081287 (April 23, 2009) (Commission found harassment where inmate repeatedly targeted complainant with indecent exposure by manipulating his fully exposed genitals in her presence and sexually assaulting her while naked). Because we do not find that complainant was subjected to actionable harassment, the agency is not liable for the alleged conduct. Thus, we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the AJ's determination that complainant failed to prove that was she was subjected to unlawful harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Though a sex-based harassment rather than sexual harassment case, in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120121157 (2012), the Commission found that even a few instances of alleged harassment stated a claim where the instances involved physical conduct. The complainant, a service representative, was suffering from a pregnancy-related condition known as hyperemesis gravid arum with symptoms of nausea and vomiting, as well as other symptoms. As a result, she needed to work at the window closest to the bathroom and also needed to use a chair to wheel files to and from her work location because of a lifting restriction. The Commission found a verbal altercation that resulted in a panic attack, moving the complainant's window and moving the chair at times bumping into the complainant "alleged wanton disregard for Complainant and the child she carried," and stated a claim for relief.</p>
