<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-44"><span class="space">g.</span> Retirement Benefits</h5>
<p class="noindent">As noted below, when an employee who has retired during the processing of his or her complaint receives a back pay award, the agency is required to notify OPM so an adjustment can be made in retirement benefits, if necessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> section on Adjustment of Retirement Benefits. In limited circumstances, a complainant who retires because of a failure of the agency to reasonably accommodate a disability has the option of continuing to receive retirement benefits or return to employment. See section below on "<a href="0100-2023-24-192.html#sec15-166">Effect of Resignation or Retirement</a>." When such a complainant does elect to return to employment, the agency may not deduct retirement benefits received by the complainant from his or her back pay award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Savage v. Postmaster General</span>, 04990044 (2000), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Commission found that the agency's failure to consider complainant's request to return to regular duty was discriminatory and that its reliance on the union settlement in this instance was a pretext for disability discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Savage v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01960183 (September 3, 1998). As a result, the Commission reversed the agency's FAD and ordered complainant reinstated to his regular position with backpay, interest on back pay, all other benefits and seniority retroactive to the date in August of 1990 when the agency removed complainant from his light duty position. In addition, the Commission found that the agency shall not deduct from the complainant's back pay award any disability retirement benefits received by him, pursuant to the EEOC Policy Guidance: Cases Involving the Deduction of Pension Payments from Back Pay Awards, Number N-915-054 (May 11, 1990). It is from this portion of the Commission's decision that the agency seeks clarification....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Commission's decision in EEOC Request No. 01960183, the agency was ordered to not deduct from the complainant's back pay award any disability retirement benefits received by him during the period after his disability retirement was approved by the agency in 1991 and the date he was reinstated to his regular position. We find that complainant's intervening reinstatement to his regular position with the agency in 1998 does not allow the agency to deduct from complainant's back pay award the amounts of disability retirement benefits he received. The Commission clearly held in its Policy Guidance that it is not equitable for an employer to be permitted to recoup pension payments made from a pension plan which, while usually funded by the employer, is a separate legal entity from the employer. In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit rejected the agency's argument that disability annuity retirement benefits received by plaintiff since his discharge should be deducted from plaintiff's back pay award<span class="Italic">. Arneson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 128 F.3d 1243, (8th Cir. 1997). The circuit court applied the common law collateral source rule, stating that the rule holds that a defendant's liability shall not be reduced merely because the plaintiff's net damages are reduced by payments received from others. The circuit court observed that it had already addressed the same issue in an Age Discrimination in Employment Act case. The circuit court did not believe that plaintiff's back pay award included any agency contributions to plaintiff's disability pension. Moreover, the court noted that the disability retirement benefits did not entirely come from the agency, because plaintiff "has unquestionably contributed" to his retirement fund. Finally, the circuit court pointed out that the disability retirement payments to plaintiff were made to carry out a social policy that was wholly independent of back pay awards, and that they did not discharge any direct obligation that the agency had to plaintiff.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Savage</span> does not prevent OPM from attempting to recover the retirement benefits paid to the complainant. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ralph v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0420070010 (2007). In addition, the agency is required to notify OPM of the change in salary to it can adjust future retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0420120003 (2013).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Franklin v. Postmaster General</span>, 04A20006 (2003), the Commission held that the agency was not permitted to deduct disability retirement payments from the complainant's back pay award. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Franklin</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1736"></span>Despite the confusing documentation supplied by the agency, one item regarding petitioner's back pay award is clear: the agency deducted disability retirement payments received by petitioner from the gross amount. The worksheet provided to petitioner as explanation of his award reflects that the gross amount of $140,745.96 was reduced by $60,648.07 which the agency allegedly paid to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as reimbursement for payments OPM made to petitioner under the provisions of his disability retirement. Petitioner argues that such a deduction from his award, and therefore recoupment by the agency, is not appropriate. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has previously held in our Policy Guidance that it is not equitable for an employer to be permitted to recoup pension payments made from a pension plan which, while usually funded by the employer, is a separate legal entity from the employer.<span class="Italic"> See Savage v. United States Postal Service,</span> Petition No. 04990044 (May 28, 2000). In addition, we concur with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit's rejection of the argument that disability annuity retirement benefits received by a plaintiff after his discharge should be deducted from his back pay award<span class="Italic">. Arneson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 128 F.3d 1243, (8th Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> (June 15, 1998). The circuit court in <span class="Italic">Arenson</span>, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Gullett Gin Co.</span>, 340 U.S. 361, 95 L. Ed. 337, 71 S. Ct. 337 (1951), applied the common law collateral source rule, stating that the rule holds that a defendant's liability shall not be reduced merely because the plaintiff's net damages are reduced by payments received from others<span class="Italic">. Arenson</span> at 1248. The court noted that the disability retirement benefits did not entirely come from the agency, because plaintiff "has unquestionably contributed" to his retirement fund. The circuit court pointed out that the disability retirement payments to plaintiff were made to carry out a social policy that was wholly independent of back pay awards, and that they did not discharge any direct obligation that the agency had to plaintiff. Accordingly, the agency is ordered to pay petitioner for all amounts erroneously deducted from his back pay award which were based on disability retirement payments received.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency erroneously deducts monies from the complainant's back pay award and submits it to OPM's retirement programs, the Commission requires the agency to reimburse the complainant those monies and later seek to recover the amount from OPM. <span class="Italic">Martina S. v.

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Clark v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120092454 (2010), the Commission found that the record was not sufficiently developed to determine if Individual Unemployability and Disability Compensation benefits the complainant received were an offset against back pay. However, in doing so, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, did give a fulsome description of how the collateral source applies in various circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, Complainant has requested application of the "collateral source" rule, which holds that "benefits received by the plaintiff from a source collateral to the defendant may not be used to reduce that defendant's liability for damages." <span class="Italic">Finlay v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997) (citing 1 Dobbs, Law of Remedies 3.8(1), at 372-73 (2d ed. 1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission examined the application of the collateral source rule to health insurance benefits in <span class="Italic">Wallis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995). In <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, the Commission determined that health insurance benefits funded by employer-paid premiums are collateral source funds, and not subject to offset. The Commission noted that although the Agency paid a substantial share of Complainant's health insurance premium, the actual funds disbursed to pay Complainant's expenses were overwhelmingly those of the insurance company, as contributed by not just the Agency, but by Complainant and countless others. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted), The Commission also noted that it could not be said that the Agency contributed to Complainant's health insurance premium in order to respond to some legal liability it might otherwise have toward Complainant.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Thus, the Commission found the application of the collateral source rule appropriate and consistent with Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Dana v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01921641 (June 11, 1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Finlay v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997), the Commission examined the application of the collateral source rule to workers' compensation wage-replacement benefits under FECA. The Commission noted that FECA does not limit the "make whole" relief to which a victim of discrimination is entitled under Title VII. The Commission stated that under FECA, OWCP disburses funds to the injured employee, and is reimbursed by the Agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the Commission determined the source of funds used to pay Complainant's medical expenses in <span class="Italic">Finlay</span> were not collateral to the Agency, and may be used to offset the pecuniary damages which might otherwise be recoverable. The Commission distinguished the wage-replacement benefits paid under FECA, which are paid in full by the Agency, from unemployment benefits, where the Agency pays an insurance premium resulting in a benefit to the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In both <span class="Italic">Finlay</span> and <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, the Commission cited <span class="Italic">Lussier v. Runyon</span>, 50 F.3d 1103 (1st Cir. 1995), which held that the effect to be given to collateral benefits, whatever, their source, is within the equitable discretion of the trier of fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More recently, in <span class="Italic">Franklin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04A20006 (January 28, 2003), the Commission addressed the issue of whether the Agency properly deducted disability retirement benefits from an award of back pay. In Franklin, the Commission stated that it is not equitable for an employer to be permitted to regroup pension payments from a pension plan which, while usually funded by the employer, is a separate legal entity from the employer. <span class="Italic">Franklin</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04A20006 (citations omitted). The Commission noted that in <span class="Italic">Arenson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 128 F.3d 1243 (8th Cir.), the court applied the common law collateral source rule, stating that the rule holds that a defendant's liability shall not be reduced merely because the plaintiff's net damages are reduced by payments received from others. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In concluding that an offset of disability retirement benefits was improper, the Commission noted that the <span class="Italic">Arenson</span> court pointed out that "the disability retirement payments to plaintiff were made to carry out a social policy that was wholly independent of back pay awards, and that they did not discharge any direct obligation that the agency had to plaintiff." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Commission is unable to determine whether Complainant's back pay award must be offset by the Individual Unemployability and Disability Compensation benefits he received during the relevant time frame. Specifically, we find the record does not indicate whether the source of the benefits received by Complainant is "separate and distinct" from the general government funds. We note it is unclear whether the benefits were paid in full by the Agency or whether Complainant contributed to these benefits. The record also does not show whether the benefit is in the nature of a "fringe benefit," or instead reflects an attempt by the employer to limit its potential legal liability. Additionally, the Commission cannot determine what triggered Complainant's entitlement to Individual Unemployability benefits, i.e., was Complainant entitled to Individual Unemployability Benefits because he was terminated, because of his service-connected disability, or for some other reason. Moreover, the record does not indicate whether Complainant had been receiving Disability Compensation benefits prior to July 9, 2005, or the amount of such benefits if he had been receiving them while working for the Agency. After supplementing the record with the above-requested information, the Agency shall issue a new final decision analyzing Complainant's back pay award and indicating whether the collateral source rule should apply to the Individual Unemployability Benefits Complainant received.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Liza B. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120152098 (2017), modified and remanded the agency's finding that the complainant was not entitled to back pay because she took disability retirement prior to her termination. The Commission's remand instructions provide detailed steps on how back pay is to be calculated in cases involving disability retirement such as <span class="Italic">Liza B</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Commission policy and caselaw, back pay does not cut off because a complainant is approved for SSD retirement. <span class="Italic">See McKelvey v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120054980 (May 7, 2007); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Effect of Representations Made in Applications for Benefits on the Determination of Whether a Person Is a "Qualified Individual with a Disability" Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)</span> (Feb. 12, 1997) (available at eeoc.gov) (while the ADA definition of "qualified person with a disability" requires consideration of reasonable accommodation, eligibility for SSD retirement does not consider whether a person can work with reasonable accommodation. It is a violation of public policy to force people to choose between applying for disability benefits, including SSD, and vindicating their rights under the ADA. Because of the fundamental differences in the definitions used in the ADA and the terms used in disability benefits programs, including SSD, an individual can meet the eligibility requirements to receive disability benefits and still be a qualified individual with a disability for ADA purposes. Thus, a person's representations that she is "totally disabled" or "unable to work" for purposes of disability benefits are never an absolute bar to an ADA claim).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In FAD 2, the Agency found Complainant is entitled to back pay. We will not disturb this finding, but find that the Agency started back pay too late. In FAD 1, the Agency found that management failed to provide Complainant reasonable accommodation and she was discriminated against based on her disability when after denying her the full-face respirator, management failed to consider any alternative reasonable accommodation options, i.e., reassignment. Management denied the full-face respirator on November 20, 2009. Accordingly, we find that the back pay period starts on November 20, 2009. The back pay period shall continue for the length of time it is determined there was a funded vacant Agency position for which Complainant was qualified and could perform with or without reasonable accommodation. In determining <span id="Page_1737"></span>whether there were any such positions, the Agency only need look at jobs Complainant would have accepted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This will require the Agency to gather facts to support any determination on back pay. The Agency must solicit from Complainant her qualifications (e.g., a resume), the geographical locations she would have accepted a reassignment to, and when she planned on retiring. Further, given the record medical evidence which was recounted herein, there is some question on whether Complainant was ever available for reassignment to work in any funded, vacant positions the Agency may determine were available. Given this, the Agency may request from her, at Agency expense, all medical records related to her ability to work in jobs at the Agency to which she could have been reassigned meeting the above criteria, and for how long. This includes the medical records from all of Complainant's health care providers, the medical records Complainant submitted to the Social Security Administration to receive SSD retirement benefits, and any medical documentation generated by the Social Security Administration related to her disability retirement. Further, if the parties disagree on whether Complainant medically could have worked in any Agency positions to which she could have been, the Agency may, at its own expense, conduct independent medical examinations relevant to Complainant's ability to work, and/or interview her on her ability to work therein. The purpose of gathering these facts is to determine if and/or when Complainant could have been reassigned and work in Agency positions for the purpose of determining whether the Agency's denial of reasonable accommodation resulted in Complainant being denied employment at the Agency, and hence when and if she was eligible for back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with Complainant that her SSD retirement payments are not deductible from back pay, and disagree with the Agency's argument to the contrary. The common law collateral source rule holds that an agency's liability shall not be reduced merely because the complainant's net damages are reduced by payments received from others. <span class="Italic">Arnelson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 128 F.3d 1243, 1248 (8th Cir. 1997) (Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) disability retirement disability benefits) are not deductible from back pay award. Disability benefits are from a collateral source and should not be considered interim earnings. Disability benefits do not come entirely from the agency since the complainant contributed to his CSRS disability retirement fund); <span class="Italic">Franklin v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04A20006 (Jan. 28, 2003) (followed <span class="Italic">Arnelson</span>). We find that the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Arnelson</span> applies to SSD retirement benefits as, Complainant unquestionably contributed to the social security retirement fund. Also, any employer Complainant had other than the Agency would have made contributions to this fund. Further, tracking additional reasoning in <span class="Italic">Arnelson</span> regarding CSRS, the Social Security Administration is a separate legal entity from the Agency, and SSD benefits are made to carry out a social policy wholly independent of a back pay award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.501(b)-(c), a successful complainant should receive "a sum equal to the backpay he would have received" had there been no discrimination. The regulation does not require that the complainant receive actual payroll wages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Kearney</span>, 05850040 (1986). In that case, the complainant retired before a final decision in her discrimination complaint and later prevailed. The retirement negated any need for reinstatement. In order to comply with the Commission's remedial order, the agency attempted to void the employee's earlier retirement and force her to reapply. The reapplication would have resulted in a reduced annuity due to a congressionally approved reduction in 1981. The Commission found the complainant's assertion that she would have retired just before the reduction to be reasonable and, therefore, ordered a backpay award via a monetary sum equal to what she would have received if she had continued to work for the agency until just before the annuity reduction. The Commission also ordered her retirement annuity to be recalculated to credit the additional service time.</p>
