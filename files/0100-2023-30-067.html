<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-65"><span class="space">9.</span> Multiple Victims of Discrimination</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is possible for more than one complainant to demonstrate that he has been the victim of discrimination in a selection process. For example, when a selecting official chooses a particular candidate because of her sex, he has discriminated against all qualified male applicants. From a remedy perspective, the problem is that the agency would have selected only one candidate. Certainly, awarding both complainants the position would put one of them in a better position than he or she would have been in but for the discrimination. Although in some cases, the Commission has found priority consideration to be an appropriate remedy (see above), in other cases, it has found it is appropriate for the agency to recreate the selection. In <span class="Italic">Ball v. Secretary of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration</span>, 01933092 (1994), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the record indicates that at least two complainants who applied for this position were discriminated against based on sex. In cases where there are two or more complainant-applicants for a single position and discrimination is found, an appropriate remedy is to re-conduct the selection process free from the taint of unlawful discrimination<span class="Italic">. Georgia Girdis v. EEOC</span>, Request No. 05900437 (August 2, 1990); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 613 F. Supp. 611, 615 (D.C. Tennessee 1985); <span class="Italic">Pollard v. Grinstead</span>, 741 F.2d 73 (4th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Windham v. Secretary of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration</span>, 01933164 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reached the same result in other cases where more than one applicant was the victim of discrimination. The appropriate remedy is for the agency to recreate the selection process and remove the discriminatory taint. <span class="Italic">See Rocha v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01934018 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01934019 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although in cases involving multiple victims of discrimination only one complainant can be placed in the disputed position, more than one complainant can receive compensatory damages. For example, in <span class="Italic">James v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01972377 (1997), two complainants were found to be highly qualified for promotion. The Commission found that both complainants were discriminated against based on reprisal. The Commission in <span class="Italic">James</span> issued the following order for relief:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;The agency shall re-conduct the selection process considering the candidates on the "Highly Qualified" list at the grades 6/7/8 levels. As appellants were promoted to GS-6 shortly after filing the instant complaint, they shall be considered qualified at the GS-7 level or higher. The agency shall conduct an objective evaluation of the candidates on the agency's highly qualified list to reveal which of the candidates should have been selected for the position. Neither the Chief nor any other agency official involved in previous selection process or in appellants' previous EEO complaints shall participate in the current selection. The agency shall complete the selection process within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;If either of the appellants would have been selected for the position in the absence of reprisal, the agency shall place that appellant in the Lieutenant of the Watch, Supervisory Police Officer, GS-083-7/8, position retroactive to date on which the selectee assumed the duties of the position. The agency shall accomplish this action within forty-five (45) calendar days of the date this decision becomes final. If one of the other candidates would have been selected absent reprisal, the agency is not required to provide retroactive placement in the position or backpay to appellants. However, it must issue a final decision to this effect, with appropriate appeal rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;If either appellant would have been selected for the position in the absence of reprisal, the agency shall determine the appropriate amount of backpay (with interest, if applicable) and other benefits due, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.501, no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the date this decision becomes final. Appellant shall cooperate in the agency's efforts to compute the amount of backpay and benefits due, and shall provide all relevant information requested by the agency. If there is a dispute regarding the exact amount of backpay and/or benefits, the agency shall issue a check to appellant for the undisputed amount within sixty (60) calendar days after the date this decision becomes final. Appellant may petition for enforcement or clarification. A petition for enforcement must be filed with the Compliance Officer, at the address referenced in the statement entitled "Implementation of the Commission's Decision."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;The agency shall conduct a supplemental investigation pertaining to appellants' entitlement to any compensatory damages incurred as result of the agency's retaliatory actions toward them resulting in the failure to provide them with fair consideration for the position at issue. The agency shall afford each appellant sixty (60) days to submit additional evidence in support of his claim for compensatory damages. Within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt of appellants' evidence, the agency shall issue a final decision (with appropriate appeal rights) on the record, to determine each appellant's entitlement, if any, to compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5)&#x2003;The agency shall post at its facilities in San Diego, California copies of the attached notice. Copies of the notice, after being signed by the agency's duly authorized representative, shall be posted by the agency <span id="Page_1763"></span>within thirty (30) calendar days of the date this decision becomes final, and shall remain posted for sixty (60) consecutive days, in conspicuous places, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted. The agency shall take reasonable steps to ensure that said notices are not altered, defaced, or covered by any other material. The oriGINAl signed notice is to be submitted to the Compliance Officer at the address cited in the paragraph entitled "Implementation of the Commission's Decision," within ten (10) calendar days of the expiration of the posting period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(6)&#x2003;The agency shall provide training in the obligations and duties imposed by the anti-discrimination laws, including the right of employees to be free from reprisal, to all the managerial officials responsible for the agency's actions in this case. The agency should also consider whether the Chief, who has been found to clearly threaten the freedom of employees to use the EEO process, should be continued in a position with supervisory authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reaching in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Army</span> 0120123054 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the remedy in this case is complicated by the fact that although the five complainants were discriminated against in the selection process by reason of race, only two would have been promoted in any event. An effort must be made to determine, among the five, who would have been selected "but for" the unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Preston T. White and Kirk D. Hannan v. Department of Labor</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A30043 and 07A30044 (October 28, 2004) (finding that an administrative judge erred as a matter of law by awarding full relief to two complainants rather than determining which of the complainants would have been selected "but for" the discrimination). To do otherwise would place at least three of the complainants in a better position than they would have occupied in the absence of discrimination. Therefore, we will remand this matter back to the Agency for a supplemental investigation and determination as to whom, among the five complainants, would have been selected for the two Lead Nurse Consultant positions but for the discrimination. The equitable relief awarded (retroactive placement and back pay) must logically flow from this determination. However, all five complainants are entitled to consideration for compensatory damages for any harm proven to have resulted from their participation in a discriminatory selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the event the administrative judge determines that there has been discrimination but cannot make a determination of which complainant would have been selected in the absence of discrimination, the Commission has pointed its judges to two cases that have adopted a <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> approach to remedies. For example, in <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 07A30043 (2004), the Commission remanded the case back to the administrative judge with the following guidance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency's arguments on remedy, however, are well taken. The AJ erred, as a matter of law, in granting full relief to both of the complainants. In so doing, he placed at least one of them in a better position than he would have occupied in the absence of discrimination. The record clearly establishes that only one of the complainants could have been denied the GS-13 Mine Safety and Health Specialist position because of discrimination. The other had to have been denied for reasons "other than" discrimination. The complainant in the latter category cannot properly be awarded full relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(A). ("No order...shall require...promotion of an individual...or back pay, if such individual was...refused...advancement...for any reason other than discrimination....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the AJ made no effort to determine which of the complainants would have been selected "but for" the unlawful discrimination. Accordingly, we vacate the award of full relief and remand these matters to the AJ for a determination as to which of the two complainants would have been selected for the GS-13 Mine Safety and Health Specialist position, but for discrimination. The relief awarded must logically flow from that determination. The AJ may make the determination on the basis of the current record (if he deems it sufficient) or he may take additional evidence. In the event that the AJ is unable to determine which complainant would have been selected, the Commission directs his attention to <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. Barry,</span> 869 F.2d 605, 615 (D.C. Cir. 1989) and <span class="Italic">Albright v. The City of New Orleans,</span> 208 F. Supp.2d 634, 637-638 (E.D. La. 2002) (authority for a pro rata approach based on the theory that each complainant had less than a one hundred percent chance of being selected).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission made no mention of those cases in remanding <span class="Italic">Barth and Wiggins v. Social Security Administration</span>, 05A40478 (2006), where the administrative judge ordered the agency to place both complainants in the same position. Initially, the administrative judge declined to consolidate the cases because Barth raised a total of seven claims, only one of which involved the field office manager position also raised by Wiggins. The same administrative judge then proceeded to issue findings of discrimination in both cases in the selection of a field office manager and ordered both complainants placed into the position with back pay. It was not until its request for reconsideration in the <span class="Italic">Wiggins case that the agency raised the issue of the judge's error in granting relief. As a result, the Commission upheld the findings of discrimination, but remanded the cases to the judge on the issue of relief, stating:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the pendency of EEOC Appeal No. 07A30048, however, neither party informed the Commission that the same AJ had found the agency liable for discrimination against Beatrice Wiggins as to the same non-selection, or that he had awarded full relief to both complainants. As such, the Commission was unaware of the AJ's error at the time the appellate decision was issued, and consequently, we erred in issuing our "Order" of remedies including back pay, to complainant <span class="Italic">Wiggins.</span> Accordingly, we now must VACATE our previous "Order" concerning remedies in <span class="Italic">Beatrice L. Wiggins v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30048 (January 22, 2004). The AJ erred in failing to determine which candidate would have been selected for the position in question, but for the discrimination. Instead, the AJ simply concluded in each case that the agency failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that but for the discrimination the same selection would have been made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ erred, as a matter of law, in granting full relief to both complainants. In so doing, he placed at least one of them in a better position than s/he would have occupied in the absence of discrimination. Unlawful discrimination tainted the selection process, but that does not change the fact that only one individual would have been selected for the Field Office Manager position. The other had to have been denied the position for reasons "other than" discrimination. The complainant in the latter category cannot properly be awarded full relief.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(A). ("No order...shall require...promotion of an individual...or back pay, if such individual was...refused...advancement...for any reason other than discrimination....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the AJ made an inadequate effort to determine who would have been selected "but for" the unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">See White; Harmon v. Department of Labor,</span> EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A30043; 07A30044 (October 28, 2004) (finding that the AJ erred as a matter of law by awarding full relief to two complainants, and made no effort to determine which of the complainants would have been selected "but for" the discrimination). Accordingly, we VACATE our previous award of full relief to complainant <span class="Italic">Wiggins</span> and remand these matters to the AJ for a determination as to who would have been selected for the Field Office Manager position, but for the discrimination. The relief awarded must logically flow from that determination. The AJ may make the determination on the basis of the current record (if he deems it sufficient) or he may take additional evidence. In the event that the AJ is unable to determine who would have been selected, the Commission directs his attention to <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. Barry,</span> 869 F.2d 605, 615 (D.C. Cir. 1989) and <span class="Italic">Albright v. The City of New Orleans,</span> 208 F. Supp.2d 634, 637-638 (E.D. La. 2002) (authority for a pro rata approach based on the theory that each complainant had less than a one hundred percent chance of being selected).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, after a careful review of the record, we do not disturb our finding of liability in <span class="Italic">Beatrice L. Wiggins v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30048 (January 22, 2004); however, we VACATE in total the "Order" of relief that we set forth in that decision. Additionally, we VACATE the agency's final order concerning the Barth case. Further, we REMAND both cases to the AJ to make a finding either on the record, or by taking more evidence, concerning who would have been selected for the Field Office Manager position at issue. The AJ is then instructed to make new findings as to all appropriate remedies for both complainants.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission revisited the issue of relief for multiple victims of discrimination in a nonselection case and the possibility of <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> remedy in <span class="Italic">Coleman v.</span> <span class="Italic">Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120062552 (2008). In that case, the administrative judge found that one complainant was the victim age and sex discrimination and the other was the victim of sex discrimination. The agency contended that it could not determine which of the complainant's would have been selected absent discrimination and, relying on <span class="Italic">White, supra</span>, granted each complainant one-half the back pay involved. Only one complainant appealed that relief order. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, found that a <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> remedy could be implemented only if the agency first conducted a complete supplemental investigation and, based on that, could not determine who the successful candidate would have been:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we find that the agency's interpretation and application of the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">White v. Dep't of Labor,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30043 (Oct. 28, 2004) to be misconstrued. In <span class="Italic">White,</span> an EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) held a hearing and found that the agency had discriminated against the two complainants based on sex and, with regard to one complainant, based on age. The agency rejected the AJ's finding and appealed to our office. Upon review we reversed the agency's final order, but remanded the matter to the EEOC District Office for the AJ to determine which of the two complainants would have been selected but for the unlawful discrimination. We instructed the AJ to make the determination on the basis of the current record or by taking additional evidence. In the event that the AJ was unable to determine which complainant would have been selected, the Commission directed the AJ's attention to the federal court cases, which the agency here cites, ordering pro-rated relief to each complainant. As such, the <span class="Italic">White</span> decision imparts a two-part standard. First, where there is more than one complainant in a non-selection case, the fact-finder must determine, by a supplemental investigation, if necessary, <span id="Page_1764"></span>which complainant would have been selected for the position in the absence of the discrimination. Second, if a good faith attempt to ascertain the proper selectee is made, but it is impossible to reach a conclusion, the fact-finder may pro-rate the remedy among the complainants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the agency skipped the first step of the <span class="Italic">White</span> holding and applied the second step. The agency explains that the record fails to indicate which complainant, if any, would have been selected for the position absent discrimination because the selecting officials used an entirely subjective method of selection which was heavily tainted with discrimination. The agency excuses itself from any further duty to ascertain who would have been selected by stating that to instruct management to recreate the selection process anew would be futile because such action would prompt management to intentionally select someone other than either complainant. This argument is alarming. The agency has the affirmative obligation to take all measures possible to eradicate discrimination in the workplace. To stand aside and say that anything we do is futile is, in essence, a perpetuation of discrimination. Moreover, we find the agency's excuse to be speculative and potentially retaliatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.501(b) of our regulations states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When an agency, or the Commission, finds that an applicant for employment has been discriminated against, the agency shall offer the applicant the position that the applicant would have occupied absent discrimination, or if justified by the circumstances, a substantially equivalent position <span class="Italic">unless clear and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant would not have been selected even absent the discrimination.</span> (Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden of proof, therefore, is on the agency, yet the agency failed to make even a perfunctory attempt at establishing who would have been selected for the position. For example, the agency should have at least taken additional evidence on the question of who the selecting officials would have hired as a second choice. Instead, the agency quite glibly stated that the record does not contain such statements and left it at that. See Agency Response to Appeal at 4. We emphasize that it is not improper to pro-rate a back pay award in the case of multiple complainants where it cannot be ascertained by clear and convincing evidence who would have been selected absent the discrimination. However, this option is only to be taken as a last resort, after trying in good faith to make a proper determination. The agency is not to use this option as an easy way out of its responsibilities. Moreover, we find nothing in the agency's arguments that shows it had good cause for failing to re-conduct the selection process. Under these circumstances, therefore, we draw an adverse inference from the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.108(c)(3) of our regulations provides that where the agency fails without good cause to respond fully and in a timely fashion to requests for documents, records or affidavits, the Commission may on appeal, in appropriate circumstances, draw an adverse inference that the information would have reflected unfavorably on the agency, and that the Commission may consider the matters to which the information pertains to be established in favor of the complainant and issue a decision in his favor<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Bush v. Dep't of the Army,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01960709 (Feb. 1, 2000). As the agency here failed to take additional evidence on the selection process and failed to create a sterile, discrimination-free environment in which to recreate the selection, we adversely infer that complying with those requirements would reflect unfavorably on the agency's position. As such, we modify the agency's relief pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(c)(3)(iv).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having drawn an adverse inference, we find that the most equitable result is to order the agency to provide complainant 100% of the back pay. We infer, based on the agency's actions and inactions, that complainant would have been selected for the position but for his age. As such, complainant is entitled to the full remedy for that discriminatory non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that proper make-whole relief under these circumstances requires that the agency offer complainant a transfer to a Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, GS-13, position in Oklahoma, or a substantially equivalent position in Oklahoma. We note that if complainant accepts the offer, the agency must pay the relocation expenses for his move back to Oklahoma pursuant to its obligation under section 302-2.6 of the federal travel regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a footnote in <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, the Commission simply noted that the other complainant had not appealed and may have already been paid 50% of the back pay award. The Commission indicated it found nothing inconsistent in that possibility and its ruling in <span class="Italic">Coleman</span> since the only matter properly before it was the remedy to which Mr. Coleman was entitled. Reconsideration was denied. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0520080675 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no relief available to a complainant under the ADEA where he demonstrates that he was discriminated against in a promotion case, but the agency demonstrates it would have selected another applicant even absent discrimination. <span class="Italic">Knowles v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01930433 (1994). Note that this continues to be the law even in the wake of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, since that legislation did not apply to age discrimination cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, where there are multiple vacancies, it is possible that more than one victim of discrimination can be appointed to a position as evidenced by <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120130238 (2015), where the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a final matter, we note that we are also making a finding of race discrimination in a separate decision on behalf of another complainant in this same selection process. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Department of Defense</span> (<span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency</span>), EEOC Appeal No. 0120130240. In cases where there are two or more complainant-applicants for a single position and discrimination against both is found, we have typically determined that an appropriate remedy is to re-conduct the selection process free from the taint of unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Girdis v. Equal Employment Opportunist Commission</span>, Request No. 05900437 (August 2, 1990) (each claimant has the right to "compete without discrimination for a retroactive promotion and back pay"). However, in the instant case, there was not a single position filled. Rather, the Agency selected candidates for four positions. We have already found that the Agency has failed to prove that the rankings and recommendations of the panel were determinative of the ultimate selection decisions. As such, we have found that the Agency has not proven, by clear and convincing evidence that either complainant would not have been selected for any of the four available positions. Therefore, we conclude that both complainants in this matter are entitled to the remedy of a retroactive placement into one of the four positions filled (or into a substantially equivalent one) with back pay.</p>
