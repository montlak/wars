<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-67"><span class="space">12.</span> Reassignment and Modifying Essential Functions</h4>
<p class="noindent">When an employee cannot perform the essential functions of her position and there are no vacant, funded reassignment positions available, this constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the complainant's termination. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Melendez-Miranda v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120112031 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency stated that it terminated Complainant because she was unable to perform essential functions of her position. The Agency specifically referenced direct patient care functions that Complainant needed to be able to perform and the risks posed by her inability to perform such functions in case of emergency situations. We find that the Agency articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Complainant's termination. We find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AJ's finding that Complainant was unable to perform essential functions of her Registered Nurse position. The record indicates that Complainant's physical limitations prevented her from lifting, carrying, pushing and pulling weight over ten pounds, standing for periods of two hours, and walking for a period of one hour. The Chair of the Reasonable Accommodation Committee testified that upon Complainant's return to work, she was having difficulty walking, standing and had lifting restrictions. The Chair of the Physical Standards Board testified that Complainant was not physically fit to perform her Registered Nurse duties because of the demands of pushing, pulling, lifting and standing for periods of time. The Agency provided Complainant with light duty work for several months upon her return to work. However, the Agency was already utilizing two employees in the unit with sedentary restrictions pursuant to OWCP guidelines. The Agency sought to provide Complainant a reassignment within the facility that accommodated her physical restrictions and at the same pay grade. However, the Agency did not have any such positions available. We note that an employer is not required to create a job for a disabled employee, nor is it required to transform its temporary light or limited duty assignments and permanent jobs to accommodate an employee's disability. <span class="Italic">See Woodard v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A21682 (July 29, 2003); EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Workers Compensation and the ADA</span>. EEOC Notice No. 915.002 at 21 (September 3, 1996). We find that Complainant's termination was not unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Prophet v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120122435 (2012) (where performance in stressful environment was essential job function and employee could not perform in stressful environment and there were no vacant funded positions available, employee is not qualified).</p>
<p class="noindent">Some agencies, such as the Postal Service, create limited duty positions for employees who are injured on the job. When an employee alleges he or she is being discriminated against while assigned to a limited duty position, it is error for the agency to determine a complainant cannot perform the essential functions of his former position and, thus, has not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination. The relevant inquiry is whether the complainant can perform the essential functions of the limited duty position. If he can, then he is a qualified individual with a disability regardless of whether he can perform the essential functions of his regularly assigned position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mayer v. Postmaster General</span>, 01900186 (1990). When a complaint of disability discrimination relocates to a limited duty position, the agency errs in evaluating whether the employee could perform the essential duties of his regular position with or without reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954735 (1997) (finding it was error for the agency to conclude that the position in question was mail processor, where the employee had been on light or limited duty for two years); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Graham v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924001 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dellinger v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40040 (2005), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability because she could not perform all of the essential functions of a distribution clerk position where the complainant had been successfully performing that position with modified duties for some nine years. The Commission found that "the record does not support the agency's contention that complainant was not performing the majority of the Distribution Clerk duties she was assigned at the time she was removed from the agency. Rather, we find that the record supports the finding of the AJ that beginning in 1990, the agency assigned complainant to a modified Distribution Clerk position and she was able to perform the essential functions of this modified position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the employee has been performing duties in one position is a strong indication that he could perform those duties in another position. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A40794 (2006), the complainant had been working for a private contractor as an aircraft worker. He applied for a position with the agency as a sandblaster and, ultimately, was disqualified by the agency for employment because of a history of paranoid schizophrenia. Overruling its administrative judge, the Commission found that the complainant was a qualified individual with a disability. The Commission determined that the duties performed by an aircraft worker for the contractor were largely the same duties performed by a sandblaster, under the same conditions, for the agency. In reaching its conclusion in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Commission found that doctors' opinions questioning the ability of the complainant to perform the sandblaster duties were inadequate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the essential functions of the Aircraft Worker position that complainant held are equivalent to the Sandblaster position. In her September 7, 2000 letter, A-l maintained that complainant's position at Raytheon did not cover the same duties and responsibilities as the Sandblaster position. According to A-l, complainant's current position was in a small, open booth located in an air conditioned building. She also stated that his job was to "clean small parts," and that he did "not work on the large aircraft in the hangars." Finally, she maintained that "the new position is much more rigorous and requires the ability to move around and to work in large, hot, noisy hangars." We note, however, that complainant moved to the air conditioned location in March 2000. Prior to that time, he worked in the hangar. In his employment application, complainant indicated that he was responsible for cleaning "interior/exterior of aircraft, cleaning aircraft components, walking aircraft on or off the flight lines, blasting aircraft parts...." He also stated that he used "various chemical agents to clean aircraft parts like varsol, mild stripper, hot stripper, flat well, alcohol and alodine." With regard to tools, complainant stated that he used "vacuums, fire hoses, steam gun[s] air hoses, chemical sprayers, pallet jacks, buckets, wire brushes, flash lights...." Finally, complainant noted that he was qualified to operate "category III cranes...and wing walker[s]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of complainant's description of his duties supports his contention that the essential functions of his Aircraft Worker position were identical to those of the Sandblaster position. Both positions involve cleaning aircraft and component parts while using toxic chemicals and solvents and, among other things, steam guns and blasting equipment. Additionally, we note that the Sandblaster position description states that an applicant's experience "must be of sufficient length of time and quality to show the demonstrated ability to perform the majority of the duties of the Equipment Cleaner with only a normal amount of supervision." Given the fact that complainant was rated the most qualified and selected by A-l based, in part, on the duties that he performed for Raytheon, we find it somewhat disingenuous for her to maintain that the two positions were different to any important extent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Doctor B and A-l, relying on Doctor H's March 20, 2000 letter, found that complainant was not qualified. Specifically, Doctor B, among other things, maintained that complainant: (1) could not work shift work, (2) may not tolerate high noise, and (3) may not work in excessive heat due to medications. We note, however, that A-l, in her September 7, 2000 letter, stated that the agency could reasonably accommodate the noise and the shift work aspects of the job. We also note that although the agency found that there was no reasonable accommodation for the excessive heat that existed in the hangar area, we find no persuasive evidence that such an accommodation was required in this case. The position description for the Sandblaster position indicates that the work was performed inside in a well ventilated and illuminated shop. There is no indication in the position description that excessive heat was a hazard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, Doctor B and A-l did not take into consideration the fact that complainant had already worked in the hangar for ten months, including the summer of 1999, without any problems. There is no evidence that complainant ever requested an accommodation regarding the heat aspects of his position during the ten months that he worked in hangar. The agency never established how hot the hangar got or what temperature, if any, would caused problems for people like complainant who took olanzapine. Although we agree with the AJ that one cannot disregard the fact that Doctor H was complainant's treating psychiatrist and had first hand knowledge of his diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, we find that the agency took into account the concerns raised in her <span id="Page_1176"></span>letter, but failed to apply those concerns to the actual circumstances surrounding complainant's employment situation when it found that he was not qualified for the Sandblaster position. For example, there is no evidence that Doctor H, when she opined that it was not advisable for complainant to be around excessive heat, was aware of the specific temperatures in the areas where complainant would be working. Without evidence indicating what would constitute excessive heat where complainant is concerned, we would merely be speculating if we found that an accommodation was either necessary or unavailable.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, not all assignments to light duty positions will serve to negate the applicability of the essential functions of the complainant's regularly assigned position. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bassingthwaithe v. Secretary of Army</span>, 03970051 (1997), the Commission found that the light duty position was not the "position in question" where the notation on the SF-50 detailing the complainant to light duty included the notation "unestablished set of duties." The Commission found this notation indicated there was not enough light duty work to justify the complainant's permanent light duty assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a complainant is receiving workers' compensation benefits and state disability as a result of his physical inability to perform the duties of a machinist does not mean, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, that he was unable to perform the duties of a distribution clerk. The latter determination can only be made upon review of the complainant's medical records, medical status and the particular job requirements of a distribution clerk. The agency was not justified in denying the complainant back pay for previous discrimination on the basis that he was not ready, willing, and able to work. <span class="Italic">Dana v. Postmaster General</span>, 01921641 (1993).</p>
