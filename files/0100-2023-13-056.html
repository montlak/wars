<h3 class="h3" id="sec4-52"><span class="space">A.</span> RIGHT TO IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is not unusual, given the fact that the agency is responsible for conducting its own investigations, that complainants sometimes feel the investigation is less than fair. It is difficult to balance the employee's obligation to cooperate with the agency's investigative efforts with his or her concerns about impartiality. Mere suspicion that the investigator will be partial is not sufficient to justify a failure to cooperate, but when the employee presents evidence that the investigator misrepresented statements from his supervisor, the employee is justified in refusing to cooperate. <span class="Italic">Rowe v. USPS</span>, 01873072 (1987). In that case, the evidence took the form of a sworn affidavit from the supervisor that he had not made the statements at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">Due to their small size, some agencies contract with outside entities or persons to conduct EEO investigations. Although the Commission does not condemn the process wholesale, it is concerned with the fact that nonagency investigators have a pecuniary interest in satisfying the agency. In cases where the EEO director or other EEO officer is designated as an RMO, it is improper for the agency to use such an investigator. <span class="Italic">See Gilmore v. Railroad Retirement Board</span>, 05880105 (1988). In such instances, the agency should request the Commission to appoint an investigator on a cost-reimbursement basis. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 CFR 1613.216(c); EEOC Directive 107. Although the Commission has deleted any references to its authority to appoint an investigator upon request by an agency from Part 1614 and MD-110, it still retains that authority. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01932435 (1993). "[T]he Commission, upon receipt of a request from an agency and where the situation warrants, either will appoint an investigator or recommend that an agency consult with another agency in the appointment of an investigator." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, the Commission noted it will only entertain agency requests for appointment of an investigator. "A complainant's recourse in this regard would be to challenge the fairness or completeness of an investigation upon discovery of any deficiencies." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The case of <span class="Italic">DaCosta v. Secretary of Education</span>, 01995992 (2000), makes it abundantly clear that an outside investigation should take place when an EEO official is the subject of a discrimination complaint. The agency should act promptly and efficiently to have the complaint investigated by an outside investigator. In <span class="Italic">DaCosta</span>, the complainant was employed as an Equal Employment Specialist in the agency's Office of Human Resources and Administration, Administrator for Management Services, Equal Employment Opportunity Staff, Complaints Analysis and Conciliation Unit. She alleged discrimination based on national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">DaCosta</span> case has an extremely complicated procedural history, but the Commission summarized the relevant events as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency had an opportunity and the responsibility to investigate the complainant's complaint in 1994, but it failed to do so. On August 2, 1995, Administrative Judge I remanded the complaint to the agency based on a stipulation by the agency that the investigation would be completed within ninety (90) days. No investigation was conducted during the ninety-day period. The complainant expressed concern to her Senator in 1996, that many of her witnesses had already left the EEO Office and that the supervisor who allegedly discriminated against her planned to retire that year. Nevertheless, no investigation was conducted. On December 1, 1997, Administrative Judge 2 remanded the complaint to the agency for investigation by an independent investigator and the issuance of a final agency decision in response to the complainant's request. The agency was required by EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.110 to issue a final decision within 60 days of the complainant's request. Again, no investigation was conducted following the remand. The agency waited more than sixteen months to notify the complainant that an investigation would be conducted by a sole source contractor. Again, no such investigation was conducted. On July 29, 1999, the agency, not the required independent contractor, sent the complainant a set of interrogatories to "expedite" the issuance of a final agency decision on her complaint. However, to this day the record does not contain any indication that the agency has requested an affidavit or answers to interrogatories from the supervisor or from any other employees who had personal knowledge of the duties the complainant and the comparative employee, Employee A, performed from December 1992 through May 21, 1994, and the percentage of time they each spent on GS-13 level duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">In response to an order to show cause as to why sanctions should not be imposed, the agency argued that it attempted to have the complaint investigated by a neutral third party, and that it did not act in bad faith. On the other hand, the Commission found that the agency did not provide any documentation or explanation as to why it could not have had the complaint investigated timely. The Commission specifically noted that the agency used contract investigators in the past. Finding that the agency never really tried to have the case investigated by an outside party, the Commission stated "it merely initiated attempts to do so, and all the ineffective attempts were by the same office which allegedly had engaged in discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission noted that the "agency's conduct is precisely the reason the EEOC expects this type of complaint to be investigated by neutral third parties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Most unwisely, the agency also argued that the EEO Office now could investigate the complaint because there was no longer a conflict of interest since all of the relevant EEO officials were no longer employed by the agency. The Commission, of course, found that the agency cannot delay a case for four years and then conduct an investigation of that case because a conflict of interest no longer exists. With respect to its authority to impose sanctions, the Commission noted that while normally sanctions are imposed for failure to respond during an investigation, the agency prevented things from even getting to that point in the process. The Commission therefore invoked its inherent authority to impose sanctions in <span class="Italic">DaCosta</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds in the instant case that the agency has successfully prevented an independent investigator from making evidentiary requests by failing to assign the matter to an independent investigator as required by EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.102(a)(2). However, the agency's inaction does not nullify the Commission's inherent authority to sanction the agency's failure to fulfill its duty to investigate, or to otherwise provide for the prompt, fair, and impartial investigation of the complainant's complaint, within 180 days of the date she filed the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission can only conclude from the agency's course of conduct in this case that the agency's EEO Office negligently and intentionally delayed the investigation of the complainant's complaint because a timely investigation by an independent investigator would have shown that the agency discriminated against the complainant based on her national origin and in retaliation for her prior EEO activity. The agency's feeble attempts to explain its dilatory behavior can not reasonably justify its inability to have the complaint fully investigated years earlier, as prescribed by the regulations and as instructed by EEOC's officials.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a complaint identifies the person responsible for issuing the agency's final decision as the management official responsible for discrimination, processing of the complaint and decision must issue from an official who is not involved in the complaint. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Environmental Protection Administrator</span>, 05920097 (1992). The official who issues the final agency decision must be "fair, impartial, and objective." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing 29 CFR 1613.221(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency does assign one of its own employees to investigate an EEO complaint, it must ensure that the investigator is from a separate component than the one in which the complaint arose. In <span class="Italic">Rondon v. Postmaster General</span>, 05890516 (1989), the Commission addressed the need for an independent investigator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, while the agency is correct in its assertion that 29 CFR 1613.216(a) does not require the appointment of an outside investigator in every case, it may be necessary at times to insure impartiality. For example, in <span class="Italic">John C. McLaughlin v. Anthony M. Frank, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01882419 (October 3, 1988), the Investigator and appellant were in the same duty station, which was the duty station wherein the complaint arose, and the Commission found that the assignment of that particular Investigator was clearly not proper. Commonality of supervision is not the only consideration when one is reviewing the propriety of the assignment of a particular Investigator. In the present case, we know that both appellant and the Investigator are in the Caribbean Division, however, that is the only assignment factor disclosed. It is undisclosed whether both appellant and Investigator are assigned to the same branch, whether both are working at the same station, and particularly whether the Investigator is assigned to the station wherein the complaint arose. Consequently, lacking this information, the Commission is unable to make a determination concerning the propriety of the Investigator assigned and, accordingly, the case must be remanded to the agency in order to gather such information.</p>
<p class="noindent">It does not suffice to merely list the names and titles of the supervisory chain for both the complainant and the investigator, because this information alone does not reveal any relationships in the organizational components of the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Far too often, the appearance of impartiality, if not actual impartiality, is obscured by the close relationship between EEO staff, personnel staff, and the agency's representative. When there are irregularities in the processing of an EEO complaint, given these circumstances, it is by no means unusual that the employee feels he or she is not being given a fair shake. In <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05920355 (1992), although the Commission declined to order the agency to transfer processing of the case to another region, it did caution the agency that it might be advisable to honor the complainant's request that processing be transferred.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ho v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01945763 (1996), the Commission elaborated on the criteria for reviewing allegations of both an actual conflict of interest and the appearance of a conflict of interest. Although the precise circumstances of <span class="Italic">Ho</span> are no longer applicable, because the case involved a proposed disposition, <span id="Page_328"></span>the basic criteria established by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ho</span> would apply to most situations involving an actual or apparent conflict of interest. The <span class="Italic">Ho</span> case is also instructive because it involved both an EEO director who was involved in the allegations of discrimination and an agency official with responsibility for the agency's decision who enmeshed himself in the EEO process. In finding an actual conflict of interest as well as an apparent conflict of interest, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ho</span> wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his brief on appeal, appellant alleges bias on the part of the AJ. A careful review of the record would seem to indicate, however, that questions regarding the processing of this complaint should be directed at the agency. We note, for instance, that the EEO Director responsible for processing appellant's complaint is also one of the employees that appellant alleges received favorable treatment (Promotee A). The EEO Director also testified at the hearing, where she stated that she questioned the results of the Specialist's audits of appellant's position. The Commission finds the EEO Director's questioning of the Specialist's audits inappropriate, given that the EEO Director was embroiled in the midst of this controversy and given that an evaluation of her own position by the Position Management and Classification Division revealed that the position should be classified at the GS-12 level, not the GM-13 level. Despite this evaluation, however, the RO exercised his Management to Civilian Budget prerogative and classified the EEO Director's job at the GM-13 level. Finally, we note that appellant has alleged that the EEO Director failed to forward certain evidence to USACARA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More questionable, however, is the role that the facility's Commander played in this case. First, he made changes to the Specialist's first desk audit of appellant's position prior to the reorganization. As a direct result of his changes, the Specialist reduced the grading of appellant's position from GM-14 to GM-13. Second, the Commander issued the agency's proposed disposition in this case following his receipt of USACARA's Report of Investigation. Third, the Commander testified at the hearing about why appellant's position did not warrant a GM-14 level rating. Although the Commander's first and third actions are not contradictory, given that much of the Commander's hearing testimony related to why he made the changes to the desk audit, we believe that in light of his role in the classification of appellant's position, he should not have written the agency's proposed disposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's Management Directive for processing federal sector discrimination complaints states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Agencies must avoid conflicts of position or conflicts of interest as well as the appearance of such conflicts. For example, the same agency official(s) responsible for executing and advising on personnel actions, may not also be responsible for managing, advising, or overseeing the EEO pre-complaint or complaint processes. Those processes generally challenge the motivations and impacts of personnel actions and decisions. In order to maintain the integrity of the EEO investigative and decision making processes, those functions must be kept separate from the personnel function.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEO MD-110 (October 22, 1992), p. 1-1. Given that appellant's EEO complaint challenges his GM-13 rating and given the Commander's heavy involvement in that rating, it is a conflict of interest for the Commander to also write the agency's proposed disposition in the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Commander's participation in the EEO process resulted in prejudice to appellant, given that the Commander was largely responsible for the finding that appellant's position warranted a GM-13 rating before the reorganization<span class="Italic">. See Driscoll v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940179 (December 21, 1994) (although apparent conflict of interest where signer of offer of full relief also signed appellant's notice of termination, no conflict found because no prejudice to appellant resulted from apparent conflict). Although no actual conflict was found in <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, we find that one exists here: the person who made changes to appellant's classification audit because appellant's job description was "grossly inflated, inaccurate, and incorrect," had no business drafting the agency's proposed disposition in the EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Collins v. TVA</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943450 (June 16, 1995), another case where the Commission found that no conflict of interest existed. In that case, appellant alleged two conflicts: (1) the agency was represented at the hearing by the Director of Human Resources, whom appellant alleged was "the designated coordinator for EEO counseling"; and (2) the Director of Equal Opportunity Compliance (EOC) was the official who signed the FAD and was also a fact witness in the case. As for the first alleged conflict, the Commission found nothing in the record to support appellants characterization of the Director of Human Resources as being responsible for EEO counseling, and no indication that she played an EEO role in the case. As for the second alleged conflict, which more closely resembles the situation at issue, the Commission found no conflict because the record indicated that the Director of EOC's role was independent from the personnel management function. The Commission noted that: (1) the Director of EOC effectively excused himself from the EEO processing of the complaint; (2) the EEO Counselor who counseled appellant was from a different facility and not in any way part of the organization where the alleged acts of discrimination occurred; and (3) the Director of EOC's only involvement in the case was as appellant's contact when she initially visited the EEO office, and his resulting statement that appellant did not raise race or sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Collins</span> in all three of these aspects. First, the Commander did not effectively excuse himself from the EEOC processing of this complaint; on the contrary, he made himself an integral part of the process and wrote the agency's proposed disposition. Second, the EEO Counselor who counseled appellant was not from a different facility, but worked in the same facility where the alleged discrimination occurred. Third, the Commander had a much greater involvement in this case than did the Director of EOC in Collins; his testimony at the hearing involved much more than what bases of discrimination appellant raised. We therefore find that a conflict of interest existed in the agency's processing of this complaint and that appellant is entitled to a new proposed disposition, in which the Commander may not be involved<span class="Italic">. See Rabinowitz v. USPS</span>, Request No. 05930348 (September 23, 1993) (officials involved in discrimination may not be involved in processing complaint). We also note that because of the EEO Director's status as a comparative in this case, her handling of the processing of this complaint gives the appearance of impropriety.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its initial decision in <span class="Italic">Ho</span>, the Commission vacated the agency's final decision finding no discrimination and remanded the case for processing, including a transfer of the case "to another EEO office or facility not involved." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> On reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Ho v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05960310 (1997), the Commission found that no conflict actually existed because the Commander who wrote the proposed disposition did not also write the final decision. Instead, an agency official separate and apart from the Commander's organization wrote the final agency decision. Also significant to the Commission on reconsideration was that an administrative judge made findings independent of the proposed disposition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Commission often engages in tough talk about unbiased investigations, it seldom acts against agencies in such cases. Instead, it gives agencies a chance to conduct a supplemental investigation. For example, consider the following in <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01973339 (1999)--a decision critical of both the agency investigation and the administrative judge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is apparent that the administrative judge either ignored or discounted this evidence which strongly indicates that there was a genuine issue whether the appellant was qualified for this position. This evidence should have been weighed along side of the agency's evidence and not discarded out of hand without a proper analysis. Consequently, we find that summary judgment should not have been granted. We conclude this even though the record was not developed in a complete and impartial manner which we will address below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the administrative judge was mistaken in her blind reliance on the investigator's assessment of the ages of the unqualified candidates. Our review of the unqualified list indicates six candidates, including the appellant, five of whom were over the age of forty and only one who was under the age of forty. Of the two rated qualified under the first vacancy announcement, both were under the age of forty. This kind of misrepresentation of the evidence by the investigator is troubling especially when coupled with the lack of a balanced development of the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although charged with conducting an unbiased investigation of the appellant's claims, the agency did not seek to contact any witnesses cited by the appellant and failed to produce other key pieces of information such as the applications of the candidates. (See 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.108(b)). The agency claims it did not pursue statements of the appellant's witnesses because their testimony concerned only the issue of reprisal at another facility. If there is an issue of reprisal by the agency to be learned, even if not raised by the appellant, then this is the relevant forum in which to air it. Therefore, this was not an adequate reason for not interviewing the witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are also concerned by the fact that the position at issue was re-announced at a time coinciding roughly with the appellant's first contact with the EEO Counselor regarding his rejection. The agency did not determine an explanation for the re-announcement from the rating or selecting officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these and other numerous gaps in the investigation the Commission determines to order a supplemental investigation to obtain all appropriate information left out of the record. The failure of the agency to supplement the investigation may result in an adverse inference being drawn in accordance with 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(d)(3)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the circumstances, one wonders why the agency should be given a second chance in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, particularly where there is an indication that actual bias played a role in the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_329"></span>Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Sty v. Postmaster General</span>, 01984065 (1999), the Commission ordered the agency to assign a counselor and investigator outside of the complainant's geographic region. She alleged that the agency permitted the spread of rumors that she was a stripper in a private men's club throughout the Great Lakes region and the EEO office entirely refused to process her complaint. Significantly, the Commission ordered the agency to conduct an investigation into the timeliness of the complaint, which alleged a continuing violation. Given the extent of the agency's misconduct and recalcitrance in <span class="Italic">Sty</span>, it is unclear why the Commission did not apply the doctrine of estoppel to bar the agency from asserting any timeliness defense.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Curiel v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120110869 (2012), the Commission reversed an order of its administrative judge granting summary judgment to the agency where it found substantial evidence that the investigator appeared hostile to the complainant and deferential to management officials:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we turn to the investigation itself. EEOC Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEOC MD-110) (Nov. 9, 1999) provides that the investigative process be non-adversarial and that it include a thorough review of the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred; the treatment of members of the complainant's group as compared with the treatment of other similarly situated employees, and any policies and/or practices that may constitute discrimination, even though they have not been expressly cited by complainant. EEOC MD-110 Chapter 6, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; V, V.C. EEOC MD-110 also requires that the investigator be unbiased, and objective, thorough, and neutral in the investigator's approach to factual development and not an advocate for any of the parties or interests. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; VI.C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Investigator interviewed Complainant and her transcript is contained in the record. Throughout the taking of Complainant's statements, the Investigator appears hostile in his questioning and argumentative and combative toward Complainant: "So you have no evidence that you were treated differently than Hispanics or Mexicans..." and "[Complainant's first level supervisor] is the one who changed your PD, and you are making it sound like the Regional Management Officer is the responsible management official here?" Also, "So that made you think that they were trying to get you from all sides but did you at any point complain in terms of your actions. Did you say something like 'wait a minute that is an inappropriate question? Did you say that people do not have the right to that information?" Also, "Okay, so you have no evidence, and yet you bring the action. Why do you bring it if you have no evidence?" When the Investigator asked Complainant to whom did she complain about her change of duties and she replied her first level supervisor, the Investigator stated: "No, you could not complain to [first level supervisor]." Also from the Investigator: "Where are those E-mails? I am asking for them right now [;] where are they?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Frequently, the Investigator characterized evidence. For example, the Investigator asked Complainant: "So how were you adversely affected by the Regional Management Officer calling [Complainant's first level supervisor] and asking when you were going to retire? It seems like a legitimate question?" Also, "Alright, as an investigator, I do not find anything inappropriate in [the e-mail]." In addition, the Investigator repeatedly asked Complainant the same question concerning the bases upon which she believed she was being subjected to discrimination, although she provided an answer several times. For example, the Investigator asked Complainant what color car did she drive and when she responded blue, he asked what evidence did she have that her treatment was not because she drove a blue car.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the Investigator appeared deferential toward the Regional Management Officer. Although the Investigator may have asked Complainant after finishing questioning on each claim, if she needed to say anything more, the Investigator offered the Regional Management Officer the opportunity to go off the record and think about whether she would have liked to do so. In contrast, when Complainant's second level supervisor, who was the Chief Scientist for the Earthquake Hazards Team and who gave favorable statements regarding Complainant's work, asked the Investigator to bear with him for a minute during his examination, the Investigator stated that he could not give him a lot of time. At one point, when the Investigator was off the record and he asked the Associate Team Chief Scientist if there was anything else that she would have liked to say, she replied that she probably ought to go back on and say what she had said to the Investigator off the record which was that she found it challenging to work with Complainant and that Complainant was not particularly receptive to receiving feedback. When during the investigative inquiry by the Investigator Complainant's second level supervisor stated that he called EEO, the Investigator stated: "that is interesting, why would you call EEO as opposed to your Human Resources Officer."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Investigator also asked Complainant her religion which was never identified or raised as a basis for discrimination. When Complainant responded that she had no religion, the Investigator stated: "You are no religion? Maybe somebody found that out, [sic] could it be that you are being discriminated against because you do not espouse any particular religion." The reason for asking this question appeared to have been part of the Investigator's continued undermining of the bases Complainant had identified as the bases of her complaint. For example, the Investigator stated during examination of Complainant: "But, you do not have any evidence that you are being talked down to or made fun of, or whatever else that was based on your race or national origin?"</p>
