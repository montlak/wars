<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-133"><span class="space">b.</span> $5,001-$10,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has made some awards exceeding $5,000, but totaling $25,000 or less. For example, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Defense,</span> 01984888 (2000), the Commission awarded $6,000 in damages where the complainant's annual performance appraisal had been lowered in retaliation for EEO activity. As an interesting side note in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Commission found the complainant's failure to disclose the name of his Indian doctor and spiritual leader to the agency in discovery was in error. However, the Commission did consider the fact that the complainant had a need for such counseling as relevant in affixing the amount of damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996915 (2001), the Commission awarded $6,000 in damages for chronic depression as the result of a discriminatory transfer. The Commission made the award even though it acknowledged the distress of the complainant may never be completely ameliorated. The Commission also awarded $6,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Schlieter v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30007 (2003), where the complainant suffered from panic attacks and depression. The complainant sought assistance from a counselor, a psychiatrist and her pastor and was required to take daily medication in an attempt to control the attacks. In <span class="Italic">Debruin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A52391 (2006), the Commission awarded $6,000 in damages where the complainant was subjected to harassment for nearly a year, but gave only generalized testimony of the harm she suffered.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed an award of $6,000 in compensatory damages by the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Zounis v. Attorney General</span>, 0210092940 (2011), <span class="Italic">recon. denied,</span> 0520110431 (2011), where the complainant was one of two victims of sexual harassment who was ultimately terminated. Although the record does not reflect the amount of damages received by the other complainant and she did not appeal the judge's damage award, the Commission upheld a lower award for Zounis noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant is entitled to compensation for emotional distress caused by the sexual harassment. However, there are two major factors distinguishing Complainant's case from that of her Co-Complainant (SF). The first distinguishing factor is that Complainant did not experience the same level of ostracism as SF. This is primarily due to the termination of Complainant's employment. The second distinguishing factor is that Complainant did not experience the same level of sexual harassment as SF.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The decision on liability found that there were three types of activities contributing to an atmosphere of sexual harassment: 1) sexual joking and horseplay, 2) gossiping about employees' sexual activities, and 3) the use of sexual and vulgar language in the workplace. SF was a victim of all three of these types of activities, and did not herself engage in any of them.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complainant, in contrast, was a victim primarily of the sexual joking and horseplay, which she herself did not engage in. While she was also nominally a victim of the sexual gossiping and use of inappropriate language, Complainant herself was a primary instigator of these activities. The record is replete with examples of her inappropriate conduct, and indeed this was one of the reasons her employment was terminated. Complainant was in fact one of the people who contributed to the sexual harassment which caused harm to SF.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed an award of $6,000 by the administrative judge where a three-week period of harassment resulted in the complainant suffering weight loss, aggravated Colitis, increased blood pressure, sleeplessness and she became argumentative and withdrawn. <span class="Italic">Towns v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112091 (2012). The Commission rejected the complainant's request for $85,000 in damages finding that some of the complainant's symptoms were caused by events that did not contribute to the hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120141347 (2014), the Commission upheld an award of $6,000 to a victim of sexual harassment noting that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's award of $6,000 in non-pecuniary damages was correct. This takes into account that as a result of the sexual harassment which continued for five or six months, Complainant felt humiliated, repulsed, anxious, betrayed. disrespected, fearful, had an anxiety attack, increased blood pressure, got nauseated when she was reminded about the perpetrator, saw a mental health counselor and psychologist, and was prescribed medication for depression and to help her sleep.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120123334 (2013), the Commission upheld an award of $6,500 noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he harassing conduct by the EEO Program Manager was a short-lived, one time episode; after six months of the November 13, 2009 incident with Complainant's supervisor, he was no longer under that supervisor's supervision as a result of his voluntary move to another job; he took some sick leave as a consequence of the harassment; his ability to interact with the person he was in a relationship with deteriorated for several weeks, although their relationship survived long-term; he was upset and embarrassed about the incident; the people at work who knew about the incident distanced themselves from him, saying that they did not want to get involved; he lost sleep, saw a psychologist, and took medication for depression; he filed a workers' compensation claim for psychological injury; and he lost the supervisor's trust. However, the AJ stated that Complainant provided no specific details about his treatment or medication or any corroborating medical testimony or documentary evidence. On appeal, Complainant does not dispute this. The AJ also noted that Complainant's coworker did not notice any change in his demeanor to indicate that he was under stress after the incidents.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $7,000 in damages was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A13612 (2002), where the complainant was denied reasonable accommodation for a period of approximately one month. An award of $1,500 by an administrative judge was increased to $7,000 in <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Postmaster General</span>, 0114868 (2003), where the complainant testified that because the agency denied the accommodation of allowing her to sit while sorting mail, her feet became swollen and painful by the end of the day.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pitchford v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A23409 (2003), the Commission found a damage award of $7,000 was appropriate where the agency failed to accommodate the complainant's disabling condition for a six-year period and, as a result, the symptoms were aggravated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the FAD, the agency asserted five possible causes for the injuries suffered by complainant: (1) complainant's pre-existing condition, (2) exacerbation of complainant's pre-existing condition due to the agency's failure to accommodate her disability, (3) exacerbation of complainant's pre-existing condition due to other factors (including exposure to cold and drafts outside of work), (4) stress resulting from the agency's failure to accommodate complainant's disability and (5) stress resulting from other causes (including work related matters that were unconnected to the agency's failure to accommodate complainant's disability). The agency asserts on appeal that complainant did not meet her burden to provide evidence of the causal connection between her worsening condition and the agency's actions because she did not file the formal complaint of reasonable accommodation until approximately a year after being diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. The record shows, however, that complainant did in fact seek counseling about her conditions as early as February 9, 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her appeal, complainant responds to (3) of the FAD emphasizing that it is the cold and drafty conditions of her workplace which have worsened her disability, and not her non-work related activities. She states that she does not "engage in outside exposure activity when it's cold/drafty." Statements made by her children and husband further suggest that complainant keeps herself out of cold environments. They state that they have to "adjust things to fit her." The statements describe that the family does not use the air conditioning in the car, nor do they go to movies as a family because it is too cold for complainant. Complainant did not see how (5) was possible because all work related matters related back to the discrimination against her. She stresses that the discriminatory actions against her lasted for six years, and have caused her "injury, pain, constant taking of pain pills, [and] stressful headaches." Complainant provides statements from her two children, mother, husband and sister which corroborate these feelings. Her husband even stated that there were times they could not be sexually intimate because she was so <span id="Page_1838"></span>stressed from the agency not complying with the restrictions from her disability. The statements made by her family also said complainant was unable to deal with basic household and family needs. Complainant's sister and mother both said they helped out around the house and with the children because the complainant was in too much pain and too stressed out from her "job situation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.</span>, 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987). The Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a complainant has a preexisting condition, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. Second, if the complainant's pre-existing condition inevitably would have worsened, the agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination, the burden of proof being on the agency to establish the extent of this entitlement<span class="Italic">. Wallis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (citing <span class="Italic">Maurer v. United States</span>, 668 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Finlay v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985 (April 29, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the medical record reveals that complainant had problems with her neck and hands prior to the discriminatory action, the agency is liable for only for [sic] the additional harm or aggravation resulting from its discriminatory actions. Here, the agency discriminated against complainant insofar as she was denied reasonable accommodation for six years, from October 14, 1995 through December 15, 2001. Complainant has provided doctor's forms, as well as the above-mentioned statements from herself and her family as evidence of the additional harm caused by agency management. The medical notes from complainant's doctor provide that complainant's exposure to heat and cold extremes "result in increased symptomatology," and that the continuous "flare ups of pain involving the left side of her cervical spine and into her left arm [are] aggravated by various activities and especially by exposure to cold." The doctor noted that complainant would often complain that the cold area in which she worked aggravated her symptoms, and made her symptoms "worse, and ache." Doctor notes reveal that the complainant had a "perceptive drop of temperature that tends to provoke her condition considerably," and he noted that the most appropriate working condition for complainant would be somewhere greater than 72 degrees. Doctor notes also show that her symptoms on September 3, 1997, compared to her EMG and nerve conduction studies done in 1995, had worsened.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Commission finds that the evidence for nonpecuniary damages asserted by complainant and corroborated by her family links the emotional harm to the discrimination she suffered at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recent Commission decisions awarding nonpecuniary damages for emotional harm in cases similar to complainant's range from approximately $1,000-$12,000.<span class="Italic"> See Baptieste v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974616 (May 26, 2000) ($12,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages based on complainant's and others' statements of emotional distress due to agency's discriminatory termination); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973551 (April 14, 2000) ($9,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages based on complainant's statements of the interference with family and marital relations, digestive problems, headaches, anxiety, sleeplessness, and exhaustion resulting from the agency's discrimination); <span class="Italic">Butler v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971729 (April 15, 1999) ($7,500.00 in nonpecuniary damages based on complainant's testimony regarding his emotional distress); <span class="Italic">Hull v. Department of Veteran Affairs</span>, Appeal No. 01951441 (Sept. 18, 1998) ($12,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages based on complainant's testimony of emotional distress due to retaliatory harassment); <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950342 (June 13, 1997) ($5,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages where the complainant's testimony and his psychologist's report indicated that the harassment that complainant endured, which took both sexual and nonsexual forms, led complainant to suffer from anxiety, depression, emotional fatigue, occasional nightmares, and insomnia); <span class="Italic">Demeuse v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01950324 (May 22, 1997) ($1,500.00 for emotional distress after concluding that complainant suffered embarrassment and humiliation as the result of discriminatory harassment or hostile environment based on complainant's mental disability); <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996) ($3,000.00 in damages for emotional harm where complainant averred that she suffered from weight loss, nausea, stomach problems and headaches as a result of sexual harassment and the agency's failure to respond promptly to her allegations); <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01941906 (July 7, 1995), affirmed, EEOC Request No. 05950919 (February 15, 1996) ($8,000.00 in nonpecuniary damages where the complainant's statement and psychologist's report indicated that some of the complainant's emotional distress, including feelings of inadequacy, failure, and depression, were the result of a discriminatory performance appraisal and the denial of bonus pay based on that appraisal). The agency cites <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Apfel</span> to determine complainant's award in the instant case. EEOC Appeal No. 01971629 (Feb. 28, 2000) ($5,500.00 in nonpecuniary damages where medical documentation showed the temporary and mild nature of carpal tunnel syndrome, and affidavits from complainant and his wife established emotional distress).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant case shows that the agency did not provide reasonable accommodations for complainant while she worked at the agency until 2001, approximately six (6) years after her formal complaint. Medical records document that she suffered increased symptomology with exposure to temperature extremes. Statements from complainant as well as her mother, sister, husband, son and daughter, all describe how the stress and emotional pain complainant suffered impacted her health, and her family and marital relations during this time. Having carefully considered all the facts of this case, the Commission finds that an award of $7,000 in nonpecuniary damages is appropriate. In reaching this amount, the Commission has considered a number of factors, especially the nature, severity and duration of the emotional pain and suffering. We considered the evidence concerning complainant's emotional distress described in the affidavits of complainant and her family members, and the lack of objective evidence supporting her emotional harm. Additionally, we considered the amounts awarded in other similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an agency award of $7,500 in damages in <span class="Italic">Winston v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01972099 (2000). The decision contains little information about the complainant's emotional distress, but is significant for that reason. It appears from the <span class="Italic">Winston</span> decision that the Commission is unlikely to scrutinize an award to determine if it should have been lower once it rejects the complainant's contention that the award should have been higher. The Commission also awarded $7,500 in damages in <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995773 (2001), where the agency's retaliation caused the complainant to become depressed and "sick to her stomach" on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DaCosta v. Secretary of Energy</span>, 01A055993 (2003), the Commission awarded $7,500 in damages where the agency's discrimination exacerbated a preexisting depression. The Commission noted the exacerbation was mild, but lasted over four years. "[D]uring this time, while the complainant was functional, her enjoyment of life was low, and this caused the dissolution of a serious relationship with her boyfriend." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An award of $7,500 in damages was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Walker v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 07A20111 (2003), where the complainant suffered humiliation, marital tension and became unable to work for a period of time. In <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A33904 (2003), the Commission also awarded $7,500 in damages where the complainant had a preexisting condition that was exacerbated by the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $7,500 in damages in <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A33293.txt">01A33293</a> (2004), where the complainant presented evidence of feelings of inadequacy, loss of self-esteem, depression, frustration, weight gain and withdrawal from family participation. In making the award, the Commission noted the evidence of causal connection between the discrimination and the complainant's conditions was weak, that some of the conditions were attributable to a dispute with a subordinate employee that was not discriminatory and that some of the conditions, such as weight gain, occurred prior to the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered from anxiety and depression for a seven--month period, the Commission awarded $7,500 in damages. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A60181 (2006). The Commission noted that the complainant required medical treatment, including psychotropic medications, had headaches and insomnia, his heart would race and he was "jumpy and irritable."</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant testified that she suffered depression as a result of the agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation, but the medical documentation lacked specificity as to the degree of depression and its precise causes, the Commission awarded $7,500 in damages. In <span class="Italic">Langley v. Social Security Administration</span>, 05A50413 (2006), the Commission also noted that while the complainant contended she had not previously suffered from depression, she submitted no medical evidence to support that contention.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $7,500 in damages where the complainant suffered from depression, interference with family relationships, stress and other physical symptoms for a period of eight months. <span class="Italic">Hillion v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060065 (2007). The complainant in the case had sought an award of $35,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $7,500 was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">McCarroll v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070060 (2008), where the nonselection resulted in anxiety and depression, sleeplessness and weight gain. The Commission also noted that the administrative judge had noted that some of the complainant's distress was caused by outside events and properly took that into account in making the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120111711 (2014), the Commission increased an award of $2,500 by the administrative judge to $7,500 finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ, in pertinent part, awarded Complainant $2,500 in non-pecuniary <span id="Page_1839"></span>compensatory damages for emotional harm. Specifically, the AJ credited Complainant's testimony that she was greatly upset and humiliated by the Agency's actions, that she wanted to work as she had for many years at various jobs, and that the Agency's refusal to give her any assignments was upsetting and demeaning on a daily basis. The AJ, however, noted that Complainant's evidence of her emotional harm was limited to her own testimony. Moreover, the AJ found that Complainant was entitled only to damages for the extent to which the Agency's actions from March 28, 2008 to August 31, 2009 exacerbated her long-term emotional distress. The AJ found it significant that Complainant had been seeing a psychiatrist (P1) on a regular basis (once a week) since her workers' compensation claim alleging stress in the workplace was accepted in 1989....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful consideration of the record, we find that an award of $7,500 for non-pecuniary compensatory damages is appropriate. Specifically, we note the AJ's finding that the Agency's actions caused Complainant humiliation and emotional distress over a period of 17 months. In addition, we find it reasonable to infer that Complainant would suffer humiliation and emotional distress based on the inherently degrading and publicly humiliating nature of being required, for 12 months, to simply sit in a chair (except for breaks and lunch) in an enclosed area on the workroom floor, visible to other employees, without being given any work assignments. Moreover, although Complainant had long-term emotional distress dating back to 1989, Complainant testified that she experienced additional emotional distress based on the Agency's actions at issue here. Finally, we note that this amount is not "monstrously excessive" standing alone, is not the product of passion or prejudice, and is consistent with Commission precedent. In other cases, the Commission has awarded similar amounts for emotional harm such as humiliation and emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Postmaster General</span>, 01972655 (1998), the Commission awarded $8,000 in emotional distress damages where some of the emotional distress was caused by the death of the complainant's mother. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Gancayco v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A00471 (2001), the Commission awarded $8,000 in damages where the evidence demonstrated that the complainant had marital problems prior to her discriminatory termination, but the evidence also established significant emotional suffering as a result of the termination.</p>
<p class="noindent">That the testimony of the complainant's doctor is not fully credited or supported does not mean she is entitled to no damages. For example, in <span class="Italic">Grimes v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A10328 (2002), the Commission awarded $8,000 in damages where it determined the doctor's testimony on causation was based on false information supplied by the complainant. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992449 (2002), the Commission awarded $8,000 in damages where the complainant was briefly hospitalized for symptoms resembling a heart attack and was diagnosed with an anxiety reaction.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">St. John v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05175 (2003), the Commission awarded $8,000 in damages where the agency's discriminatory denial of an early start time placed her plans for the care of her elderly parents in "constant turmoil" and subjected her to "immense stress." Although the complainant related many other symptoms of the emotional distress, the complainant had previously suffered from depression and anxiety and, as a result, the Commission found there was a preexisting condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $4,000 by an administrative judge to $8,000 in <span class="Italic">Rucker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A5275 (2005). In that case, the Commission found that the complainant suffered from emotional distress to the point of crying at work several times, withdrew from his family and stopped attending church for a period of slightly more than one year. Similarly, the Commission increased an award of $2,500 to $8,000 in <span class="Italic">Bratsch v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120071942 (2007), where the sole evidence was the complainant's testimony of his frustration and distress over a one-year period of time. The Commission also took into account the fact that the complainant's responses during the investigation were hampered by limitations on his ability to read, write and understand the written language.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $8,000 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Banks v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070043 (2008), where the Commission found that the complainant suffered from insomnia, emotional distress, weight loss social withdrawal and crying bouts.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $8,500 in damages in a case where the agency failed to accommodate the complainant for a two-month period. Although the complainant established that he suffered from an anxiety disorder and experienced emotional distress for a four-year period, the Commission found that much of that harm was due to causes other than the agency's discrimination. <span class="Italic">Wimberly v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A23646 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $9,000 in damages was considered appropriate by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Sobol v. Postmaster General</span>, 01986262 (2000). The complainant relied solely on nonmedical evidence of embarrassment, humiliation, stress, marital strain, and loss of self-esteem. The Commission noted that more than half of the discriminatory events occurred prior to the effective date of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. An award of $9,000 in damages also was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01997073 (2002), where only some of the complainant's emotional distress was deemed to be the result of the agency's discriminatory actions. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A10856 (2001), the Commission awarded $9,000 in damages where the complainant experienced depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and difficulty in his marital relations. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01995276 (2001) (awarding $9,000 where the complainant established some emotional distress but failed to show that discrimination was the cause of physical ailments).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $9,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Wright v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A31608.txt">01A31608</a> (2004), where the complainant suffered from a preexisting post traumatic stress disorder condition that was exacerbated by the agency's discrimination. The Commission also deemed $9,000 to be an appropriate award in <span class="Italic">Cardella v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40047.txt">07A40047</a> (2004), where the complainant presented evidence that she suffered both emotional distress and physical pain as a result of the discrimination. Similarly, the Commission approved an award of $9,000 in <span class="Italic">Holt v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060034 (2007), where the complainant suffered embarrassment, loss of sleep, headaches, moodiness and weight gain for several months.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $9,000 in damages was considered appropriate in <span class="Italic">Poquiz v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720050095 (2008), where the complainant's nonselection resulted in frustration, low self-esteem and marital strain.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Wooten v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01960727 (1997), the Commission awarded $10,000 in compensatory damages where the complainant had long-standing psychiatric problems before the discrimination. In calculating the damage award, the Commission noted that the discrimination--notifying the complainant that her job performance was poor, proposing her removal, canceling the removal, and placing her on a performance improvement period--were "not particularly egregious," and occurred over a short period of time. In <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Postmaster General</span>, 01954362 (1997), $10,000 in compensatory damages was awarded by the Commission where the complainant's depression and other emotional and mental disorders were the direct result of sexual harassment and reprisal. In <span class="Italic">Vereen v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01984409 (2000), the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages where the complainant's depression spanned three years, but there was no evidence the depression would continue beyond that point.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $10,000 in compensatory damages was considered appropriate where the complainant suffered from emotional stress for nearly a year. In <span class="Italic">Allen v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01985772 (2001), the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages where the complainant suffered from insomnia, an upset stomach, shortness of breath, chest pains, leg cramping, weight gain, fatigue, and loss of interest in sexual relations. The complainant's wife testified that the distress was severe enough that she considered divorcing the complainant and he sought both psychiatric and marriage counseling for several months. In <span class="Italic">Costello v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A01872 (2001), the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages where the complainant had preexisting emotional conditions and prevailed on only one of her claims. In <span class="Italic">McLean v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01992331 (2001), the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages where the complainant suffered severe emotional distress and sought psychiatric help, but the period of harassment was only 89 days. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Drew N. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120160208 (2018) (complainant's three months of emotional harm, including stress, humiliation, anxiety, sleeplessness, and relationship stress, withdraw from social interactions, becoming morose and quiet, and harm to his professional reputation and standing, as a result of a discriminatory transfer warranted a nonpecuniary damages award of $10,000. An agency award of $2,000 was increased to $10,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bernardino v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A21281 (2002), where the complainant's nonselection resulted in her reassignment from Okinawa, Japan to the United States and the resulting distress lasted approximately two years.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant's removal considerably exacerbated a preexisting condition of depression, the Commission awarded $10,000 in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995621 (2002). Over a period of a couple of years, that exacerbation resulted in severe depression, limited concentration, daily panic attacks, and a lengthy stay in a partial hospital program. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Alcala v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A14299 (2002) (awarding $10,000 in damages where the agency's discrimination significantly exacerbated a preexisting condition); <span class="Italic">Howard v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 07A10098 (2002) (awarding $10,000 where the complainant was "devastated" and "humiliated" at being reassigned to a job where she had nothing to do and had to ask for work).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McManaway v. Postmaster General</span>, 01993233 (2002), the Commission awarded $10,000 in a case where the agency failed to hire the complainant and, as a result, some people believed he had failed a drug test. The emotional distress also affected the complainant's marriage and he was forced to take a job working 12 hours a day stacking 50-pound bags.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $10,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Willoughby v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01991367 (2002), where the complainant had a long history of medical problems prior to the discrimination and there was also evidence of marital discord prior to the discrimination. Although there was some evidence the medical conditions worsened after the discrimination, the complainant presented insufficient evidence to establish a causal connection between the worsening of the conditions and the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1840"></span>In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02660 (2002), the Commission upheld the award of $10,000 in damages by an administrative judge where there was significant evidence that the harm was in part related to family problems and in part related to agency actions that were not determined to be discriminatory. An award of $10,000 was upheld in <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A22995 (2003), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant "changed her life permanently, causing her great pain and loss of her emotional well-being."</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $25,000 by an administrative judge was reduced to $10,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. U.S. Coast Guard</span>, 07A10058 (2003). In that case, the complainant, her mother, a former roommate, a friend, and her previous supervisor testified that the complainant became consumed with her nonselection and, while previously an extrovert, became withdrawn. The complainant also had suicidal thoughts. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Totten v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A21880 (2003), the Commission found that an award of $10,000 was appropriate where the complainant suffered from major depression and considered suicide, but changed his mind after speaking with psychiatrist. Within a few months, the psychiatrist noted a marked improvement in the complainant's position. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Roppuld v. Small Business Administration</span>, 07A20141 (2003) (awarding $10,000 where the complainant offered no medical evidence but testified agency's retaliation led to depression, weight loss, mental anguish, and loss of professional reputation).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A00049 (2003), the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages to a victim of sexual harassment where the complainant suffered sadness, stress, tearfulness and a generalized anxiety disorder as the result of a sexual touching. The administrative judge in the case awarded the complainant $2,500 in damages for the touching and $50 per day in damages for a period of time after the touching when the supervisor was returned to the complainant's chain of supervision. The Commission in <span class="Italic">McKinney</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not agree with the agency's argument that these damages are punitive in nature; rather, this figure takes into account the value of complainant's emotional distress on a day to day basis, and seeks to compensate her for emotional distress suffered on a day to day basis as a result of sexual harassment and retaliation as manifested in the agency's failure to clear complainant's chain of supervisory control of the manager responsible for the proven distress. On a more practical matter, however, we find that in the interest of judicial efficiency, an outright award of $10,000 for emotional distress suffered from late February 1999 through April 2000 is more appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered from vomiting, anxiety, sleeplessness, digestive problems and emotional distress for a period of some six months, the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Daniels v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30028 (2003). Where the duration of the harm was nearly three years, the Commission found that an award of $10,000 by the administrative judge was appropriate. The Commission did not, in upholding the award, give a description of the symptoms. <span class="Italic">See Vindiola v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A20046 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency discriminatorily denied the complainant the right to express breast milk for feeding her baby during break periods, the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Puente v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A30018.txt">07A30018</a> (2003). In <span class="Italic">Puente,</span> the complainant suffered stress, which required medication for treatment. As a result of that stress, she was forced to stop breast feeding her baby. In addition, prior to stopping breast feeding, the complainant tried to use as little time as possible expressing milk, accelerated the breast pump machine, and experienced extensive bruising of her breasts.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $10,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Echard v. Attorney General</span>, 07A20137 (2003), where the complainant felt disappointed about work and depressed in her daily life and the discrimination lasted some 18 months. In <span class="Italic">Steed v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01A23845 (2003), the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages where inappropriate sexual comments and gestures continued over a one month period. The complainant testified she was depressed and suffered from anxiety, supported her claim with medical documentation, and also testified that the effects of the emotional distress caused her to be exhausted at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $20,000 in damages by the administrative judge was reduced to $10,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">McCorkle v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A30109 (2004), where the judge reasoned that loss of employment, particularly for an older worker, was emotionally damaging. In reducing the award, the Commission noted that the complainant's removal was reduced to a 15-day suspension shortly after the termination and that the complainant was only out of work for about two weeks.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Harris-Noy v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07A40035.txt">07A40035</a> (2004), the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages where the agency's actions resulted in extreme aggravation of shoulder pain as the result of exposure to cold air over a five-year period. An award of $10,000 was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Caneva v. Secretary of Defense,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01A32890.txt">01A32890</a> (2004), where the complainant testified that he became depressed about not being able to live and work in Europe when he was not selected and that his relationship with his wife suffered. "Although the AJ noted that complainant presented no medical evidence of depression or that he required medication, nevertheless, the hearing testimony shows that the non-selection changed complainant's personality, such that complainant experienced a loss of enjoyment of life, inability to focus, difficulty sleeping, and depression." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Menard v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A40004 (2004), the Commission reduced an award of $60,000 by the administrative judge to $10,000 based on the lack of supporting evidence. Although the Commission found the record supported the judge's findings that the complainant suffered from low self-esteem and often cried after the discrimination, there was insufficient corroborative evidence to establish the extent of the complainant's distress. The Commission noted the complainant did not present evidence of counseling or any other medical documentation and that other evidence from coworkers, friends and relatives did not support such a high damage award.</p>
<p class="noindent">A monetary award of $10,000 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Sellman v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A31350 (2004), where the complainant suffered emotional distress, sleeplessness and hostility. An award of $70,000 by the administrative judge was reduced to $10,000 in <span class="Italic">Eberly v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/07a30085.txt">07A30085</a> (2004), because the judge did not adequately take into consideration the complainant's preexisting condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission awarded $10,000 in damages where "the record shows that complainant experienced emotional distress, anxiety, embarrassment, and adverse effects on his social life for nearly nine months as a result of the agency's disability discrimination." <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A40981 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $10,000 also was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Dellinger v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A40040 (2005), where the complainant was terminated due to her disability. In upholding the award of its administrative judge, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Dellinger</span> noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">complainant has not testified that she was unable to work after she was released from the agency or to otherwise function, she was not diagnosed as depressed and she conceded at the hearing that she did not have counseling, although complainant alleged that she could not afford it. We credit complainant's testimony that she was upset after she was separated from the agency, had some financial problems, lost weight and had a strained relationship with her children. However, complainant provided no medical or other documentation regarding her mental condition following her separation from the agency, nor did she provide documentation regarding her actual financial state during this time. We find that non-pecuniary compensatory damages are designed to remedy a harm and not to punish the agency for its discriminatory actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $10,000 in damages where the complainant was not scheduled to work for one week and then assigned to a different facility after reporting alleged sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">Donatta v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A54941 (2006). Although the decision contains scant detail, the complainant did present evidence that she first sought medical treatment during the week she was not scheduled to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $10,000 in damages was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Nolan v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 07A40119 (2006), where the agency's failure to accommodate the complainant over a several month period led to a reinjury of her rotator cuff that required extensive medical treatment, including painful injections.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although expert testimony often enhances a damage award, it does not do so of necessity. For example, in <span class="Italic">Raffa v. Attorney General</span>, 01A51777 (2006), the Commission found that an award of $10,000 was appropriate notwithstanding the testimony of an expert economist that a detail to a limited duty position had cost the complainant a year of wages and work experience she would have otherwise earned. The problem in <span class="Italic">Raffa was one of causation:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, complainant argues that she lost a year of wages and work experience that she would have earned had she not been placed on limited duty. She further maintains that the she was placed on limited duty because of the false and malicious accusations that S related in his November 2001 memo to OPR. Complainant testified at the hearing about the physical and emotional harm she suffered because of S's actions. We accord the AJ's findings based on this testimony a great degree of deference given that the AJ could assess complainant's statements in the context of her demeanor. The AJ did not specifically discuss her reasons for setting the award at $10,000.00; however, we determine that the award is based on complainant and other witnesses' sworn testimony. The AJ did note that there was no evidence that S had any input into the decision to place complainant on limited duty.<span class="Italic"> See</span> AJ Decision at 27 n.19. The AJ further explained that S's actions continually exacerbated complainant's pre-existing depression, anxiety and weight gain problems. She stated, "[i]t is difficult to separate that which was directly related to the complainant's placement on limited duty and that which resulted from [S's] November 13, 2001 memo and narrative comments on her 2001 performance evaluation. The medical evidence in regard to this time period is brief. However, it is reasonable to conclude that the complainant experienced similar exacerbations as a direct result of [S's] action in November 2001 and February 2002." AJ Decision at 45.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding complainant's arguments to the contrary, we find <span id="Page_1841"></span>that that the amount of the award to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the circumstances. Having reviewed the expert economist's testimony and report, we agree with the agency that complainant has failed to establish that she would have been promoted and would have received an increase in wages and retirement benefits but for S's November 2001 retaliatory memo and the negative comments he placed in her February 2002 appraisal. The expert explained that he arrived at his lost retirement benefits calculation by comparing the highest three years of income that complainant would earn under her current situation against what she "likely would have actually been at if she had not lost grade or step increases." Hearing Tr. at 187:20-188:4. He arrived at his lost wages calculations by looking at her actual earnings, starting in 2000 and ending at her predicted date of retirement in 2009, and he projected wage increases based on "previous increases that she had received."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 191:1-9. We find these calculations to be ungrounded speculation and assumptions. Past performance does not necessarily predict future performance, and although in the federal government wage system, there is some constancy with regard to when one is entitled to a step or grade increase, such increases are never a certainty and are dependent on factors sometimes beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the expert's conclusions are correct. Moreover, as the AJ noted in her decision, complainant was placed on limited duty because it had been determined that she was untruthful in a prior OPR interview; therefore, the cause was not certainly S's actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered stress as a result of the agency's failure to provide reasonable accommodation, but the stress was also caused by other factors, the Commission determined that $10,000 was an appropriate damage award. In <span class="Italic">Hedgepeth v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A52869 (2006), the Commission found that "we concur with the decision's finding that complainant suffered stress and other conditions as the result of the agency's failure to accommodate her over a several month period, but the stress could also have been caused by other factors in her life. In addition, the record indicates that the agency's inaction may have aggravated complainant's condition, but was not its primary cause and her condition would likely have progressed even without the acts of discrimination."</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency failed to hire the complainant as a result of discrimination, the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Carmody v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 07200600991 (2006). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Carmody testified:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">that he was angry, and that he experienced interruptions in his normal daily habits, including irritability and difficulty sleeping. Complainant recounts feeling depressed and devastated, and testified that he does not go out to eat because of his feelings of depression. Complainant's wife bolsters complainant's testimony by describing her husband's behavior as pensive and quiet. Complainant's wife testified that she noticed changes in complainant's behavior including sleeplessness and obsession with finding out what happened. Complainant's wife testified that complainant became distant and had a hard time dealing with rejection. Complainant's wife testified to complainant's temperament change, and him being easily agitated and upset. Complainant's wife described the medications complainant was taking for his depression. Complainant's wife, however, admitted that complainant had anxiety and panic attacks prior to his dealings with TSA.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Camus v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 012005546681 (2006), the Commission upheld an award of $10,000 where the complainant suffered from sleeplessness, depression, weight gain and a disruption of her personal hobbies and activities, but the administrative judge determined that other actions taken by the agency which were not shown to be discriminatory also contributed to the emotional distress. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120052097 (2007) ($10,000 awarded where not all harm claim by complainant was attributable to agency's discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $10,000 in damages by an administrative judge where the complainant testified that, at the time of his nonselection, he was recovering from cancer surgery and had diabetes and that stress aggravated both of these conditions. He further testified that he was afraid to take leave during this period because he might need additional surgery and would need the leave at that time. In <span class="Italic">Logan v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 0720060093 (2007), the Commission rejected the agency's argument that the complainant was entitled to no more than $3,000 in damages because he presented no expert or medical testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $10,000 in damages was upheld in <span class="Italic">Risby v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720070064 (2008), where the administrative judge found that the complainant suffered from loss of sleep, weight gain, digestive problems, loss of enjoyment of life, and marital strain. The Commission found that, in awarding the damages, the judge had given due consideration to the fact that the conditions preexisted the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although denying an award of past pecuniary damages for lack of proof, the Commission awarded $10,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120083407 (2008). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to non-pecuniary damages, the agency noted that according to complainant, he was harmed by the break-up of his marriage and "while looking for work, my water, lights and gas were turned off and my car needed work." Complainant further stated, "Extreme depression developed with my being forced to live in in-humane conditions." The agency noted that complainant's ex-wife stated in her affidavit that following his termination, complainant "became withdrawn with me." The ex-wife further stated, "It didn't matter how much I worked and tried to help, it just wasn't enough. Our bills stacked high on the table, business gone, home gone we soon grew too far apart to pull it back together. I understand the distraught he was going through that he couldn't provide and keep his home and family together, but there was nothing further I could do to help."</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $10,000 in damages was deemed appropriate in <span class="Italic">Rowan v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120070384 (2009), where the complainant a motor vehicle operator, was ordered to pull weeds on several occasions. The complainant offered evidence that he suffered from stress, nightmares, sleeplessness and was irritable. The Commission found that the conditions were preexisting and, although related to his employment, were not initially caused by discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Sutter v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 0120080937 (2010), the Commission upheld an award of $10,000 in damages where the agency failed to accommodate the complainant for a period of approximately four months. The complainant presented her own testimony, as well as testimony from her son and a close friend, that she suffered from insomnia, nightmares and teeth-grinding. The Commission also noted that the administrative judge took into account several preexisting conditions in making the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where multiple personnel actions result in harm but only one is found to be discriminatory that will impact on the amount of a damage award. For example, in <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120100064 (2011), the complainant was found to be the victim of a discriminatory nonselection. Much of his damage evidence, however, focused on his previous resignation from the agency that he contended was a constructive discharge, but he had not filed a complaint over that action. The Commission awarded $10,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, agreeing with the agency that much of the harm alleged was caused by "issued separate and apart from his nonselection."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reduced an award of $35,000 in damages by the administrative judge to $10,000 where it found that the judge had also erred in ordering reinstatement where the complainant's removal was not based on discrimination but her earlier placement on AWOL status was. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Riddick v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720110011 (2011), found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the reprisal directed at Complainant by S1 exacerbated her stress and depression, which in turn, resulted in her "self-medicating" issues, depression, and attendant results thereafter. This self-medication started by 2007, prior to the first events found to be discriminatory, i.e., the May 23, 2008, AWOL and the subsequent pressure on her to settle her complaints. In awarding damages, the AJ also referred to Complainant's testimony about embarrassment and humiliation, which he found credible. This testimony by Complainant was about her testing positive for cocaine and being removed. Neither the testing nor the removal was found to be discriminatory. Given the above, we find that the award of $35,000 in nonpecuniary damages is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the discriminatory AWOL charge and pressure on Complainant to withdraw her EEO complaints were part of the discrimination for which Complainant sought damages, and these events more likely than not exacerbated her stress and depression, and consequent alcohol abuse and occasional cocaine use.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proper award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Department of Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) <span class="Italic">(citing Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989). We conclude that an award of $10,000 is consistent with Commission precedent, and is neither "monstrously excessive" nor the product of passion or prejudice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30087 (Jan. 30, 2004) ($10,000 awarded in non-pecuniary damages where a discriminatory letter of warning caused the complainant to experience a worsening of pre-existing stress, as well as insomnia, and depression).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $5,000 in damages by the agency was increased to $10,000 by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Decatur v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120110527 (2012), even though the complainant had preexisting conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, based on our review of the evidence in the record and based upon Commission precedent, we find that Complainant is entitled to $10,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages. This award takes into account Complainant's pre-existing medical conditions. This is a reasonable and appropriate award based on the evidence before us. The Commission finds that the Agency properly determined that Complainant established a causal nexus between the non-pecuniary harm and the discrimination. We find that the record establishes that despite Complainant's pre-existing conditions, the Agency's discriminatory actions charging Complainant absent without official leave (AWOL) and failing to pay him for 104 hours of leave between <span id="Page_1842"></span>May and July 2005, without prior notice, was the proximate cause of Complainant's exacerbated emotional, psychological, and financial problems. Specifically, the record shows that Complainant suffered from depression, anxiety, stress, loss of appetite and ability to concentrate, damage to his relationships with his family, feelings of persecution and worsening post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we modify the Agency's determination of the amount because a higher amount is clearly supported by the evidence. This award is based on the actual harm experienced which was the result of the Agency's actions, and it takes into account both the nature of the Agency's discriminatory actions as well as the nature, duration, and severity of the harm Complainant experienced as a result of those actions. <span class="Italic">See Utt v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070001 (Mar. 26, 2009) (Commission's compensatory damages award takes into account the nature of the Agency's discriminatory actions). We consider that more than a year passed between the times Complainant discovered he was charged with AWOL and when he recovered the missing income. Complainant was denied the income he fully expected to earn for three months in a row between May through July 2005. This series of discriminatory acts created a significant financial burden and sense of uncertainty which aggravated Complainant's pre-existing emotional problems. Complainant was finally paid the money he was shorted in November 2006. In his statement, Complainant describes in detail the stress, anxiety, and humiliation he faced as a result of being unable to meet his personal financial obligation to his family including child support during this time, wholly apart from the feelings of fear, persecution, and PTSD.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further determine that the Commission's award is consistent with amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ferebee v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720100039 (Apr 24, 2012) ($10,000 award of non-pecuniary, compensatory damages where Complainant suffered great financial strife following discrimination, suffered stress, lost sleep, and lost appetite); <span class="Italic">Rowan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120070384 (Jun 19, 2009) ($10,000 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages awarded where discrimination exacerbated Complainant's pre-existing emotional condition and resulted in continuing stress, humiliation, anxiety, sleeplessness, and depression).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission increased an award of $2,500 by an administrative judge to $10,000 in <span class="Italic">Underwood v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0720120001 (2013), where the complainant did not submit any medical evidence and relied solely on her own testimony and that of a coworker:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that the denial of her reasonable accommodation request caused her a great deal of stress because she always worried that if she got sick and was unable to go to the doctor's for a note she would be terminated. Complainant also stated that the stress from the Agency's failure to reasonably accommodate her disability affected her ability to have a social life. She testified that due to the stress she does not have the strength mentally or physically to interact with friends or family members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that the stress from her job caused her medical conditions to deteriorate, the stress wore her down, she "couldn't take it," and she became suicidal. Eventually Complainant felt that because of her suicidal thoughts, it was better if she resigned from her position, which she did in April 2010. As a result, Complainant suffered harm from the Agency's failure to reasonably accommodate her disability from January 2009 through April 2010, or approximately 15 months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's coworkers' testimony was vague and focused on the effects of Complainant's disability in general, and did not focus as much on the damages associated with the Agency's failure to reasonably accommodate Complainant. Relevant to the claim Complainant was successful on, one coworker noted that Complainant was often stressed at work after she called out of work and management would ask her for medical documentation. The coworker also testified that Complainant would often be very upset and would frequently cry. Another coworker noted that Complainant resigned because there was too much stress at work and she had too many problems with management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ noted that there were other factors that contributed to Complainant's stress that were related to her unsuccessful claims, such as being denied a hardship transfer, her belief that that she was being sexually harassed by her co-worker, her belief that another co-worker was being treated better than her, and the scrutiny of her taking breaks while at work. Both Complainant and her coworkers mentioned these other contributing factors during their testimony. Additionally, the AJ noted that Complainant's description of her damages directly attributable to the Agency's failure to reasonably accommodate her disability was vague.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Zehe v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 0120113282 (2013), the Commission found that an award of $10,000 as appropriate where the complainant submitted his own affidavit and one from his wife that the agency's failure to accommodate him caused him stress, longer commutes, humiliation, fear of losing his job, sleeplessness and loss of self-esteem. However, the Commission found that the evidence did not support the complainant's contention that the discrimination exacerbated his epilepsy noting the condition predated the discrimination, as did an increase in the number of seizures suffered by the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $10,000 was upheld by the Commission in <span class="Italic">Suttles v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120121071 (2013), where:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that she was embarrassed and humiliated when she was escorted out of the building at the time she was removed from her position. She stated she suffered from sleeplessness, weight gain, depression, and had feelings of desperation, helplessness, and hopelessness. She further stated that she worried about how she was going to support her family and survive financially. Complainant submitted evidence from her treating psychologist who stated that the termination caused Complainant considerable anger and depression which caused her to mistrust the work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the agency's discrimination was one of many factors that exacerbated the complainant's PTSD, the Commission found an award of $10,000 in damages was appropriate. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120113591 (2013); <span class="italic">see also</span> <span class="italic">Elvis G. v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019005802 (2021) (awarding $10,000 where proposed suspension caused a fainting spell, hypertension, emotional pain, loss of health, loss of appetite, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to reputation and professional standing all culminating into complainant's decision to retire).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld an award of $10,000 in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120130765 (2014), finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Complainant has described her suffering as noted by the Agency, together with a loss of self-esteem, as well as the impact the discrimination has had upon her marriage and her emotional well being with respect to her family. We find Complainant's husband's statement confirms in sufficient detail, Complainant's descriptions regarding her personal harm including: the impact upon her daily outlook on life (e.g., Complainant dreaded going to work); the strain on her marriage; her doubtful career prospects with the Agency; and diminished happiness from regular home and family activities. We find Complainant has adequately described the adverse impact caused by having fewer hours each week to spend with her family, her husband, and with her personal activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proper award of nonpecuniary, compensatory damages should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Dep't of Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483 (March 4, 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)). Upon review, we find that an award of $10,000 for nonpecuniary, compensatory damages is appropriate given the nature and duration of the harm. We determine that this amount meets the goals of not being motivated by passion or prejudice, not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, and being consistent with the amounts awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Caneva v. Dep't of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A32890 (July 15, 2004) (awarding $10,000 in nonpecuniary, compensatory damages based on testimony of complainant and his wife that complainant lost enjoyment of life, had an inability to focus, and had difficulty sleeping after the nonselection).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 0120123017 (2015), the Commission upheld an award of $10,000 where the retaliation caused distress for a period of two years, but the complainant submitted no medical documentation and there was other reasons for her distress.</p>
<p class="noindent">Three and a half years of suffering multiple symptoms and conditions led the Commission to increase a $5,000 award to $10,000 in <span class="Italic">Stacie D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120140918 (2017). <span class="Italic">Stacie D.</span> involved the agency's release of the complainant's confidential medical information to several coworkers, including the supervisor she accused of discrimination. The complainant testified that she knew that her supervisor had shared her medical information with others which "added to and multiplied her stress." The Commission also noted that the release of the complainant's medical information left her feeling embarrassed, hurt, mad, damaged, anxious and depressed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a religious harassment case, the Commission sustained an award of $10,000 where a supervisor referred to himself as a "Hebrew slave" to a subordinate of Jewish faith, whose family members were placed in death camps and executed during the Holocaust:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Complainant testified that S1's conduct made her "incredibly sad," dredged up horrific memories of the Holocaust and its impact on her family, and caused her to experience emotional pain. Our finding that Complainant was subjected to religious harassment, coupled with Complainant's testimony that she was negatively impacted by S1's conduct, persuades us that the AJ's award of $10,000 is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bernetta B. v. Secretary of Education</span>, 0120161513 (2017), awarded the complainant $10,000 in nonpecuniary damages where she alleged suffering from a "state of disbelief" when she was notified of her nonselection, and loss to her professional standing because she was prevented from applying to higher-graded positions or professional training as a result of <span id="Page_1843"></span>the nonselection. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Bernetta B</span>. noted that the complainant provided only limited evidence as to the severity or duration of her injuries and held that the complainant's "dismay at what she referred to as an agency 'cover up' of the discrimination and inconvenience suffered during the EEO process" was not compensable as that is stress related to participation in the EEO process.</p>
