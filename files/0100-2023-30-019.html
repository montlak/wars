<h4 class="h4" id="sec21-20"><span class="space">6.</span> Relief Following Default Judgment</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Royal v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0520080052 (2009), the agency challenged the authority of the administrative judge to order relief following default judgment. The Commission turned aside the agency's arguments in <span class="Italic">Royal</span> finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning now to the issue of the consequences of a default judgment in favor of complainant which is the result of a sanction levied against an agency, we note that the remedy phase will take on greater importance in these instances. In <span class="Italic">Matheny v. Department of Justice, supra,</span> we provided some guidance for AJs to use in crafting the appropriate remedy to award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The guidance provided is found in the discussion in <span class="Italic">Matheny</span> relating to the applicability of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(d) (formerly 55(e)) to default judgments issued in the Commission's administrative process. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(d) states that: "A default judgment may be entered against the United States, its officers, or its agencies only if the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence that satisfies the court." We noted: "As the Commission looks to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance, even as we are not strictly bound by them, we find that a judgment such as that entered by the AJ in the instant case would not be precluded under the Rules." The AJ in <span class="Italic">Matheny</span> noted "instances where even the incomplete record before [her] contained evidence of the agency's retaliatory animus toward complainant" and support for his claims of pay disparity. We stated then that the finding by the AJ that complainant had made the minimal showing of support for his claims rendered the entering of a default judgment an appropriate action, because complainant's case was therefore supported by evidence satisfactory to the AJ.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following a decision to issue a default judgment for complainant, an AJ would then need to decide if there was "evidence that satisfies the court" which established complainant's right to relief. For example, the establishment of the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case would be sufficient to show such a right. An AJ would have at his or her disposal the "pleadings" and the limited evidence available at that point in the hearings process. In the absence of a report of investigation, a complainant should be able to provide, if needed, his or her request for counseling (i.e., the informal complaint), the EEO Counselor's Report, the formal complaint (listing the bases and issues of the complaint) and the agency's letter accepting the complaint for investigation and defining the claims. At his or her discretion, the AJ could ask for an affidavit with more information, or could take limited testimony from the complainant in person.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, in the remedy phase, the complainant would provide evidence regarding entitlement to remedies such as back pay and compensatory damages, both pecuniary and non-pecuniary, as well as any other claimed remedy. In a case such as the one at bar, the AJ would have to find that the complainant is qualified for the position at issue, thus negating the agency's concern that complainant could be awarded a position for which she is not minimally qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find, in our review of record during the processing of this request for reconsideration, that complainant applied under the vacancy announcement posted December 27, 2005 for the Nurse Manager, Unit 2E-Ambulatory Procedure Unit, Preadmission Screening Clinic position. She was qualified for the position. The record evidence establishes that she was one of 5 applicants interviewed for the position, and that she scored second highest following the interviews for the position. The highest scoring candidate, not of her protected class (white), was selected instead. With respect to her claim that she was not assigned duties that would enable her to be promoted, we find that complainant sufficiently alleged that other employees, not of her protected class, were given detail assignments that would place them in a better position to receive promotions should a vacancy arise. The evidence before us satisfies the Commission that complainant is entitled to equitable remedies as a result of the default judgment in her favor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find that complainant should be given an opportunity to establish her entitlement to compensatory damages. Although in her decision of April 4, 2007, the AJ found that complainant's submission of evidence in support of her claim for compensatory damages was untimely, we find that the AJ's provision of 15 days to provide that evidence was an inadequate amount of time to obtain and submit the necessary medical documentation. Therefore, the case is remanded to the appropriate Hearings Unit for a determination of complainant's entitlement to compensatory damages. We note that the imposition of a default judgment sanction does not carry through to the remedy phase of the hearings process. An agency is not barred from submitting a rebuttal to complainant's claim for compensatory damages. However, this is also not an opportunity for the agency to try to relitigate the merits of the underlying discrimination complaint.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1710"></span>In <span class="Italic">Mana H. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120170670 (2018), the administrative judge awarded default judgment against the agency, but upon closer review of the case allowed for the agency to present evidence that the agency would have taken the same action absent any discriminatory motives. The agency proved its mixed motive defense, thereby limiting the complainant's personal relief to attorney fees only:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the pre-hearing process, the AJ granted a default judgment in favor of Complainant on her claim that the Agency discriminated against her when her supervisor, the QA Department Head (DH1), issued a Performance Expectation Module (PEM) that changed her assignments. The AJ did so to sanction the Agency for not concluding its investigation of the allegation in a timely manner. In a January 29, 2014, Order, the AJ concluded that the record contained a "minimal showing of support" for a default judgment that the Agency discriminated and retaliated against Complainant when DH1 assigned her the PEM tasks. He stated that Complainant could present evidence regarding compensatory damages and costs related to this claim during the hearing on her complaints. In an April 13, 2015, Order, the AJ denied the Agency's request to reconsider the default judgment and stated that "Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment, which is required to support a default judgment for an untimely investigation," and that there was no need for evidence of pretext on this issue. In a May 5, 2015, follow-up Order, however, the AJ noted that the Agency had "consistently articulated the same reason for Complainant's reassignment." He concluded that the Agency was "entitled to defend itself against a damage claim under the 'mixed motive' theory." He stated that the Agency could "limit damages by demonstrating through 'clear and convincing evidence' that it would have taken the same action even if it had not considered the discriminatory factors imposed by the default judgment" and that Complainant would have an opportunity to rebut the Agency's evidence. The AJ further stated that Complainant would not be entitled to personal relief if the Agency established that it would have reassigned Complainant to the PEM assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his post-hearing decision, the AJ noted that he "later revised [his] ruling that there was a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of unlawful discrimination on any basis and informed the parties that Complainant would have to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there was circumstantial evidence of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of an unlawful discriminatory motive for the PEM assignment in order to be entitled to equitable or make-whole relief." Noting that the Agency completed the investigation 57 days late, the AJ stated,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In hindsight, I probably should have used my discretion to impose a lesser sanction, if any at all, for the untimely investigation into this case. It appears that Complainant's desire to constantly amend her complaints may have caused the delay in the investigation into Issue Two, but I did not have sufficient facts to fully evaluate that issue prior to issuing my ruling.... Notwithstanding my hindsight observation, I will not allow this rearview to affect my ability to evaluate the relevant facts and apply the appropriate law in arriving at the conclusions discussed herein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">He found that DH1 issued the same PEM expectation to a similarly situated ND-4 Senior Engineer (CW1) who was not in Complainant's protected groups and who also reported to DH1. Because CW1 was "the only valid comparator," the AJ concluded that Complainant did not show that her PEM assignment was based on her membership in a protected class and did not establish prima face cases of discrimination or harassment. Applying a mixed-motives analysis, the AJ further concluded that the Agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action even absent the default judgment finding of liability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that Complainant was entitled to receive reasonable attorney's fees and costs related to the PEM claim but was not entitled to compensatory damages or equitable relief. He ordered the Agency to take the following corrective actions: ensure that EEO employees and management officials are aware of the procedural requirements for timely EEO investigations, train EEO employees on how to monitor investigation time limits, post a notice of the finding of discrimination at the Agency's NSWC facility, and compensate Complainant for reasonable attorney's fees and costs after Complainant submits supporting documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld the administrative judge's findings and order in <span class="Italic">Mana H</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When default judgment has been issued in favor of a complainant, the Commission must determine if there is evidence that establishes the complainant's right to personal relief. <span class="Italic">See Jeremy S. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120142917 (Feb. 9. 2017). One way to show a right to relief is to establish the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">See Royal</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052; <span class="Italic">Matheny</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A30373.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the AJ found that a default judgment was an appropriate sanction for the Agency's failure to complete the investigation into the PEM claim in a timely manner. Although he initially stated in an Order that Complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, he subsequently revised that ruling. The AJ notified the parties that the Agency could limit damages by establishing through clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the default judgment and that Complainant would have an opportunity to rebut the Agency's evidence. Following a hearing in which Complainant had a full opportunity to present her evidence, the AJ found that Complainant did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and that the Agency established that it would have taken the same action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We see no reason to disturb the AJ's findings in this area. There is no merit to Complainant's claim that the Agency had the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that a protected characteristic was not a motivating factor. As noted above, Complainant could demonstrate a right to personal relief by establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. She has not done so. Complainant has not shown that the AJ erroneously concluded that CW1, who received the same PEM expectation as Complainant, was the only appropriate comparator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To ensure that the Agency, which adopted the AJ's findings, has complied with the AJ's order of corrective action, we will again order the corrective action. To clarify that we are not ordering the Agency to provide relief that it has already provided, the order below directs the Agency to take steps "to the extent that it has not already done so."</p>
