<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-137a"><span class="space">1.</span> Severe or Pervasive Analysis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Like all claims of harassment, the complainant must show that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993). The Commission visited that question in <span class="Italic">Norbert K. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2021001898 (2021), where the complainant alleged harassment based on his race (Asian) and national origin (Chinese). Some of the remarks included:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1. In 2017, while visiting the Washington, D.C. office, the subordinate made mocking and disparaging remarks about Chinese immigrants to Complainant, who is a Chinese immigrant, and since then, the subordinate repeated the comments to the Division Chief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2. The subordinate complained about being singled out by "someone" in the office, for "being an American" and that "someone" had accused him of being "American-centric," "pro-Taiwan" and "insensitive to Chinese culture." Complainant believed these comments were directed at him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3. Since 2017 and as recent as May 5, 2020, the subordinate made disparaging comments and taunted Complainant, which Complainant alleges were "thinly veiled attempts to paint [Complainant] as someone other than white and born in a foreign country who holds a grudge against" an American.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, the complainant alleged that the subordinate disrespected his authority, sent disrespectful emails, and pretended not to understand his speech. Finding that the alleged behavior was severe enough to rise to the level of harassment, the Commission highlighted that the subordinate's behavior came at a time of increased nation-wide hostility toward Asian Americans in <span class="Italic">Norbert K</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Title VII, discrimination on the basis of national origin means discrimination because an individual (or their ancestors) is or is perceived to be from a certain place or has (or is perceived to have) the physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics of a particular national origin group. Harassment based on national origin can take different forms, including ethnic slurs, ridicule, intimidation, workplace graffiti, "jokes," physical violence, or other offensive conduct directed toward an individual because of his birthplace, ethnicity, culture, language, appearance, dress or foreign accent. <span class="Italic">See EEOC Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination</span>, No. 915.005 (Nov. 18, 2016).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The subordinate's alleged behavior occurred in the context of a nation-wide increase in reports of harassment against Asian Americans. Asian American workers face multiple sources of discrimination. One source is language or accent discrimination. Perceptions of Asian accents may negatively affect the communication skills and perceived competence of Asian American workers. Asian American and Pacific Islander Work Group Report to the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Another source of discrimination is the perception of Asian Americans as "forever foreign." Perceptions of Asian Americans as foreign can negatively impact assessments of communication ability, competence and, importantly, trustworthiness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering Complainant's allegations, we determine that the subordinate's alleged behavior falls squarely in these two sources of Asian American discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, with respect to language or accent discrimination, the subordinate allegedly made comments about Complainant's accent or use of the English language, ostensibly for clarification, but delivered in a manner that Complainant alleges was intended to degrade and embarrass him. Notably, record reveals that the subordinate was familiar with Chinese accents, given that he spent many years working in Beijing, China.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the subordinate allegedly perceived Complainant as foreign by engaging in rude emails, taunts, and comments insinuating that Complainant was "un-American," "anti-American," or had a "grudge against America." The subordinate also voiced alleged negative opinions of Chinese immigrants. Before the subordinate was assigned to Complainant's supervision, the Office Director and Division Chief were allegedly aware that the subordinate made disparaging references to Complainant's national origin, including his perceived "un-American" status. The subordinate allegedly used the term "foreigner" in a derogatory manner in reference to Chinese immigrants, allegedly implying that they (and Complainant, as a Chinese immigrant) were not American regardless of naturalized citizenship. And when the subordinate worked at the Agency's U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China, the subordinate allegedly had a reputation for bullying locally hired Chinese employees and referring to them as "communist spies."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, if proven true, we conclude that the actions alleged by Complainant are sufficiently severe and pervasive to state a viable claim of discriminatory harassment on the bases of race (Asian) and national origin (Chinese) that requires investigation and further processing.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Sharbini v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120101987 (2010), where the Commission reversed dismissal of a complaint by an employee who was Palestinian and Muslim who alleged a hostile environment where a security manager noticed a small Palestinian flag on the mirror of his truck and told the complainant it raised a "red flag" and made people "concerned."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Kopacz v. Department of Transportation</span>, 01821116 (1983), the complainant prevailed in a complaint of harassment based on national origin and religion where he presented testimony from a coworker that 40-60% of the jokes told at the facility were Polish in nature. The complaint was spurred by an incident where an agency official, in the appellant's presence, asked why the new Pope had chosen John Paul as a name, with the punchline being that John Paul was the only name the Pope could remember. The Commission stated that a complainant can show a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of harassment by "showing that ethnic and religious jokes were so pervasive and on-going in the agency facility that agency management must have become aware of the situation, yet took no significant action to correct it, even up to the present time." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Commission shifted the burden to the agency to advance a legitimate reason for its inaction. The agency's argument that joking served to relieve tension was rejected as unconvincing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The passage of time between incidents may render a claim insufficiently severe or pervasive. For instance, calling a person a decidedly ethnic name, such as "Julio," does not create a hostile working environment where the incidents occurred approximately 10 times over a three-month period. The Commission found the incidents were too sporadic to be "sufficiently severe or pervasive" to alter the conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01934025 (1994). But, in <span class="Italic">Maisonet v. Postmaster General</span>, 05960542 (1998), the Commission found national origin harassment based primarily on some seven or eight instances of remarks from a coworker referring to the complainant as a "fucking Puerto Rican":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, the AJ issued a recommended decision (RD) dated September 8, 1995, in which he found that appellant had been discriminatorily harassed based on her national origin. In support of this finding, the AJ determined that one of appellant's co-workers (Employee A) had referred to appellant as a "f****** Puerto Rican" on at least seven or eight occasions. The AJ also found Employee A had told appellant that "f****** Puerto Ricans" were taking American jobs and that they are lazy. Although Employee A denied having made these remarks, the AJ credited appellant's testimony on this question based on her demeanor and the inflection and tone of her voice. The AJ also noted that appellant's position was supported by Employee A's propensity for using crude language and his dislike of appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As further evidence of national origin harassment, the AJ cited a picture of two women on a calendar which was posted in the Facility's lounge. Next to the picture, someone had written appellant's name, as well as the name of another Puerto Rican worker, and referred to them as "The P.R. Sisters." The AJ found that "P.R." was a reference to Puerto Rican, and that the calendar "was clearly ridiculing [appellant] and also deriding her national origin." RD at 18. The AJ found that the slurs and the calendar were clearly unwelcomed by appellant, and that they were sufficient to establish a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar vein, in <span class="Italic">Balderas v. Attorney General</span>, 0120110222 (2012), the Commission found that even though the alleged comments were "offensive and disturbing," and included some based directly on national origin, the conduct did not rise to the level of a hostile work environment where some of the incident occurred in 2001, others occurred in 2002 and 2005 and the complaint was not filed until 2006.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the conduct is physical in nature, it may require fewer incidents to rise to the level of being sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60803 (2006), the Commission reversed dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim where the complainant alleged that due to his national origin his supervisor had yelled and swore at him, slammed down a telephone several times, threw a chair across the room, and acted like he was going to hit the complainant. Although the conduct at issue occurred on only two days separated by about a month, the Commission found that the complainant had stated a claim for relief, particularly noting the alleged violent conduct of the management official.</p>
<p class="noindent">In one case, the Commission held that permitting an employee to be in the proximity of the complainant constituted a hostile environment where the employee's past actions, based on national origin, were physically threatening. In <span class="Italic">Raney v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A22635 (2003), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By our decisions on two prior complaints (<span class="Italic">Raney v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01962665, July 17, 2000 and EEOC Appeal No. 01A130309 (August 27, 2002)) we noted the history of CB (also referred to as CW) in repeatedly disregarding the instructions of hospital <span id="Page_949"></span>management not to enter certain areas of the hospital and to avoid contact with complainant. We further noted that the agency's Board of Investigation concluded in 1994 that CB purposely fueled the conflict with complainant once he became aware that complainant was afraid of him. The Board further concluded that the Chief of Nursing Service and the Chief of Surgery took no concrete action to address or resolve the conflict between them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our previous decisions stated that the conflict between complainant and CB dated back to 1989 and that CB's actions were based on complainant's national origin. We noted evidence that CB disliked "foreign doctors" and made several statements regarding his dislike of foreign doctors. In addition, the record in this case contained the testimony of a resident physician who confirmed complainant's account that CB made numerous references to his expertise as a marksman, and as an archer and that his actions were threatening to him and other residents. He testified that in the past, CB often bristled at taking criticism about clinical issues from complainant and himself by getting angry, slamming doors and making hand gestures towards them in the shape of a pistol or gun.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With this history of the threatening nature of CB's interactions with complainant, we conclude the agency erred in concluding that CB's presence in areas near complainant's work areas, did not create a hostile work environment. We also find that this case presents strikingly similar actions of CB that the agency has failed to adequately address. Complainant testified that CB appeared in the OR surgical suite three or four times where he regularly performs surgery and speaks with patients' families. Complainant stated that CB sometimes used the copier but other times was there to socialize with other nurses and on one occasion blocked his path to the OR. On at least one occasion, complainant stated that CB was singing, gesturing with his hands and making noises to disturb him. We find this testimony to be credible because it describes behavior closely similar to past actions of CB in ignoring the agency's order to stay away from complainant and in fueling his conflict with complainant. In addition, the evidence established that CB was reassigned to the outpatient clinic where complainant treated patients two times a week.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that agency officials improperly permitted CB to work in proximity to complainant despite CB's history of hostility towards complainant's national origin. We further find that the agency's failure to take more stringent action led to these additional instances of harassment for which the agency is liable. The agency's rationale for concluding that no harassment occurred and that no action was necessary is unfounded. For instance, the Chief of Nursing's (CN) conclusion that CB had a legitimate reason to use the copier in the OR was unjustified as it was based solely on CB's representation that the copiers on his own floor and several others were "unavailable." Likewise, CN's conclusion that CB legitimately needed to obtain surgical instruments from the OR, failed to account for the availability of instruments from other sources. In sum, it is clear the agency failed to take appropriate measures to prevent further instances of harassment and that it is liable for the actions of CB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, based on the foregoing, we reverse the agency's final decision finding no discrimination. We conclude that complainant established by a preponderance of the evidence he was subjected to harassment based on his national origin and that the agency failed to take appropriate measures to prevent the harassment from re-occurring. The agency is directed to take action as outlined in the order below.</p>
