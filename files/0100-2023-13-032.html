<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-30_2"><span class="space">3.</span> Default Judgment</h4>
<p class="noindent">Default judgement is reserved for the most egregious conduct and not a favored sanction by the Commission. Even in especially deficient and late investigations, the Commission has declined to impose default judgment. In <span class="Italic">Genaro G. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2020004241 (2022), for instance, the complainant requested a hearing 182 days after filed his complaint. The AJ issued the usual order requiring that the agency submit the investigative file within 15 days. Almost three months later, the complainant filed a motion for default judgment, noting that the agency had to begin the investigation. Responding to the AJ's initial order to produce the investigative file, the agency defended its failure:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[S]ince November 2015, it had experienced an interruption in conducting investigations because it did not have available contract investigators who met the Agency's security requirements. The Agency indicated that, despite utilizing a competitive process to hire qualified investigators, it was still experiencing significant delays in investigating EEO complaints. According to the Agency, it had assigned Complainant's materials to an investigator and estimated that the report of investigation would be completed by May 22, 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency then failed to respond to the AJ's order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed, but instead, provided a copy of the investigative file. The investigative file arrived 223 days after the AJ issued the initial order to provide it within 15 days. Ruling on the default judgment motion, the AJ found that the investigative file was "deficient" because it included "hardly any documentary evidence" and "because the affidavit [from an agency official] was unsigned and therefore, unsworn." However, the AJ declined to impose default judgment against the agency. Instead, he ordered in <span class="Italic">Genaro G</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[Twelve] hours of training, regarding the proper processing of EEO complaints, for those Agency officials responsible for the inadequate number of investigators available to investigate EEO complaints. In addition to identifying the responsible officials, the Agency was required to file a statement explaining why it did not have enough EEO investigators to timely complete investigations and what actions it has taken to address the problem. AJ-2 also found that Complainant was prejudiced by the inadequacy of the investigation and ordered the Agency to bear a portion of Complainant's discovery costs. Specifically, AJ-2 ordered the Agency to pay reasonable attorney's fees for up to five hours preparing requests for production of documents and reviewing the Agency's responses to his requests for production.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_312"></span>AJ-2 also ordered the Agency to pay for the costs of taking the deposition of S1, including the court reporter fee, the fee for one copy of the deposition transcript, and reasonable attorney's fees for up to 15 hours preparing for and taking the deposition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Genaro G</span>. found that the agency's "investigator shortage" argument did not establish good case for its failure to timely complete the investigation, the record was inadequate and, though default judgment was not warranted, expanded upon the AJ's sanction order:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 3, 2016, when the Agency failed to complete the investigation within 180 days, Complainant requested a hearing. On December 8, 2016, AJ-1 ordered the Agency to provide the complete investigative file, within the earlier of 15 days from receipt of the order or from receipt of Complainant's hearing request. The Agency did not respond to the December 8, 2016, order until April 12, 2017, and it never responded to the June 12, 2017, Order to Show Cause. The Agency provided the report of investigation to the Commission on June 20, 2017, 442 days after Complainant filed his complaint. It waited yet another week to transmit the report of investigation to Complainant. As AJ-2 noted in the Sanctions Order, not only does the unavailability of investigators to timely complete investigations EEO complaints not amount to good cause, the Agency's failure to ensure it had enough investigators is an affront to the Commission's regulations and the federal sector process. The Agency is ultimately responsible for timely completion of investigations of EEO complaints, whether the delay is attributable to contractors and Agency employees, or the failure of Agency officials to ensure the availability of contractors. <span class="Italic">See Cox v.

Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10048 (Dec. 23, 2002); <span class="Italic">Mitchell-Wilcox v. Tenn. Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920176 (Apr. 23, 1992). We agree with AJ-2's determination that the Agency failed to establish good cause for its failure to timely complete the investigation, timely provide the investigative file to Complainant, and comply with the AJ's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, AJ-2 found that the report of investigation was deficient because it contained hardly any documentary evidence and because the affidavit from S1 was unsigned and, therefore, unsworn. Upon careful review of the record, we agree that the investigative file is severely deficient. The investigation appears to have been severely rushed and perfunctory, as a result, the investigative report does not even contain Complainant's affidavit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the report of investigation, the investigation was conducted between April 4, 2017, through June 10, 2017, with the investigator submitting the investigative file to the Agency on the end date. Report of Investigation (ROI) at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a June 9, 2017 memorandum to the record, the EEO Investigator noted that the matter was not assigned to her until Tuesday, June 6, 2017, and the contractor responsible for the investigation told her that the case was "due as soon as possible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 92. The next day, June 7, 2017, the EEO Investigator faxed and emailed the interrogatories to Complainant's representative and also spoke with his representative to express that a quick turnaround was needed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The EEO Investigator asked Complainant's representative to return the completed interrogatories as soon as possible, no later than Wednesday, June 14, 2017. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the EEO Investigator, a contractor (C1) subsequently called and informed her that the report of investigation was needed by June 9, 2017. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record contains a series of June 7, 2017 emails between the EEO Investigator and Complainant's representative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 93-94. When Complainant's representative pointed out that the EEO Investigator originally asked for the interrogatories by Wednesday, June 14, 2017, and that her email moved the deadline up to June 9, 2017, the EEO Investigator responded, "Yes, but [C1] has instructed me to finish the case as soon as possible. Please do what you can and return as soon as possible. Next Wednesday would be the very latest that I can accept the interrogatory." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 93. The EEO Investigator stated in the memorandum to the record, "On Friday, June 9, 2017, [C1] instructed investigator to use EEO Counselor report as statement for Complainant given the information was very similar, if not the same, as what would appear in an interrogatory. The Report of Investigation was written according to this instruction. The EEO Counselor report was used to provide the statement of the Complainant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 92. In another June 9, 2017, memorandum to the record, the EEO Investigator stated that, "[d]ue to the urgency of completing this Report of Investigation," she interviewed S1 on Friday, June 9, 2017, which was his day off, and an unsigned affidavit for S1 was being submitted. ROI at 96.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 13, 2017, Complainant submitted his completed affidavit to the EEO Investigator, but it was not included in the ROI. <span class="Italic">See</span> Reply to Agency's Response to Motion for Default Judgment at 4; Response to Motion for Summary Judgment at 4. By June 9, 2017, 431 days had already passed since Complainant filed his EEO complaint, and 249 days had passed since the Agency's October 3, 2016 deadline to complete the investigation. It is nonsensical that the Agency could not wait an additional four days to include Complainant's affidavit in the record, particularly when Complainant returned it in less than a week after receiving the questions and before the original June 14, 2017, deadline. Complainant had already waited more than a year for the Agency to investigate his EEO complaint and obtain his statement. The Agency's failure to thoroughly investigate his EEO complaint in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(b) and EEO MD-110 not only resulted in a deficient investigative record, but also robbed him of the opportunity to finally address his allegations of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's rush to complete its overdue investigation resulted in a nearly worthless investigative record and is an affront to the federal sector EEO process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued in its response to Complainant's motion for default judgment that its delay in producing the ROI had no prejudicial effect on Complainant, that there were no consequences resulting in a delay in justice, and that its actions did not undermine the integrity of the system. However, we find that, not only did the Agency's delay have a prejudicial effect on Complainant, result in a delay in justice, and undermine the integrity of the system, the Agency's rushed investigation produced a shoddy, incomplete ROI, which compounded such harm. Therefore, we agree with AJ-2 that a sanction was warranted and consider the appropriate sanction under the circumstances. AJ-2 ordered training for the officials responsible for the Agency not having enough investigators to timely complete EEO investigations and, because Complainant was prejudiced by the inadequacy of the investigation, ordered the Agency to bear a portion of Complainant's discovery costs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency not only failed to timely initiate or complete the investigation of the EEO complaint but, as discussed, the Agency's investigation was so rushed and deficient that it was an affront to the federal sector EEO process. The Agency failed to show good cause for its delay. Moreover, the Agency's disingenuous attempt to establish good cause, by asserting it did not have enough investigators to timely complete EEO investigations, reflects serious disregard for the Commission's regulations. While the Agency contended that its delay was not as lengthy as the delay in other cases where default judgment was found to be appropriate, we note that its delay would have only been extended if it had actually fulfilled its responsibility to properly investigate the EEO complaint. Moreover, the Commission has found that, "given the length of time that the processing of a federal sector EEO complaint can take, any delays past the time frames in the regulations can impact the outcome of Complainant's claims." <span class="Italic">Royal</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The effect on the integrity of the EEO process, the fourth factor, should not be underestimated when tailoring a sanction. <span class="Italic">Cox</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050055. "Protecting the integrity of the 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 process is central to the Commission's ability to carry out its charge of eradicating discrimination in the federal sector." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Royal</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080052). An agency that treats the time deadlines for production of an adequately developed investigation as optional has a negative effect on the outcome not only of the immediate case, but also of any other cases under its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Moreover, the Agency repeatedly failed to reply to or comply with the orders of the EEOC AJs. The Agency did not timely comply with or respond to the December 8, 2016, order to produce the complaint file and did not respond to the June 12, 2017, order to show cause. Moreover, as discussed, the Agency's disingenuous arguments in its untimely response to Complainant's motion for default judgment not only failed to establish good cause for the Agency's actions but also reflected serious disregard for the federal sector EEO process. The Commission must ensure that all parties abide by its regulations and orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that, in addition to training and bearing a portion of Complainant's discovery request, the Agency should not be able to rely on evidence produced for the first time during the discovery process in support of its motion for summary judgment or a motion to dismiss. Additionally, the Agency cannot rely on affidavits in the investigative record or the depositions in lieu of witnesses who are unavailable to testify. This sanction will effectively emphasize to the Agency the need to comply with Commission orders in a timely manner, as well as ensure that future Agency investigations are properly developed for adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120132260 (July 17, 2015). This is the least severe sanction that addresses the Agency's conduct and equitably remedies Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the specific circumstances of this case, we also find it appropriate to order the Agency to: (1) analyze its performance in conducting timely and adequate EEO investigations in accordance with the Commission's regulations, during this Fiscal Year and the previous two fiscal years, and to report its findings to the EEOC. In the event the Agency finds it is not in compliance with the Commission's regulations on EEO investigations, the Agency is directed to propose to the EEOC a corrective plan of action; and (2) provide training to its EEO personnel <span id="Page_313"></span>who failed to comply with our regulations. Our decision to sanction the Agency in this matter will effectively emphasize to the Agency the need to comply with Commission regulations and orders in a timely manner.</p>
