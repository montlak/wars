<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-100"><span class="space">D.</span> STANDING: FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM--AGENCY JURISDICTION</h3>
<p class="noindent">The preceding section focused on the status of the complainant as it relates to the issue of standing. Even when the complainant has standing to file a complaint, the complaint must be filed with the proper agency. In situations where a complaint is filed with the wrong agency, that agency has no jurisdiction over the complaint. However, the Commission is relatively forgiving of complainants who timely initiate the EEO process with the wrong agency, particularly in situations where it is unclear which agency has jurisdiction over a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">EEO cases do not often involve jurisdictional issues arising from whether the complaint has been filed with the correct agency. In most cases, it is clear that the complaint should be filed against the employing agency, or the agency that has denied employment. Previously, 29 CFR 1613.212(a) provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency shall provide in its regulations for the acceptance of a complaint from any aggrieved employee or applicant for employment <span id="Page_207"></span>who believes that he or she has been discriminated against by that agency because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or handicapping condition. A complaint may also be filed by an organization for the aggrieved person with that person's consent.</p>
<p class="noindent">In Part 1614, the Commission expresses this general principle more clearly. "A complaint must be filed with the agency that allegedly discriminated against the complainant." 29 CFR 1614.106(a). In most instances, where a complaint of discrimination is filed with the wrong agency, it is not because of lack of clarity in the regulations. Rather, the failure is that the complainant does not read the regulation. However, there are instances in which questions legitimately arise as to the proper agency for receipt of the complaint, and they are covered below. In addition, there are instances in which it is not clear whether the complainant is an employee or applicant for employment at the agency where the complaint is filed. The mere fact that an agency labels a complainant as a volunteer or independent consultant does not defeat jurisdiction. See the sections above on "<a href="0100-2023-12-100.html#sec3-99">Volunteers</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-11-039.html#sec2-39">Independent Consultants and Contractors</a>" for further discussion. In appropriate cases, a complainant who is deemed a volunteer or independent consultant actually may be an employee of the agency for Title VII purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Jurisdiction is a tricky term from a legal perspective. This is, in part, because the term jurisdiction encompasses two separate and distinct concepts: personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction relates to whether the EEOC has jurisdiction over the parties to the complaint, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, both the agency involved and the aggrieved employee or applicant for employment. The issue of personal jurisdiction is further confused in the EEO arena because complaints of discrimination are initially processed by the agency involved and not the EEOC. So, in this context, personal jurisdiction relates to whether the complainant has alleged some action involved which is within the agency's authority to correct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Subject matter jurisdiction relates to whether the Commission has jurisdiction over the actual merits of the dispute, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, has the complainant alleged that a personnel action has been taken or a term or condition of employment has been affected due to some form of discrimination over which the Commission has enforcement authority. As noted in the section above on "<a href="0100-2023-12-052.html#sec3-52">Standing: Failure to State a Claim--Overview</a>," the Commission views subject matter jurisdiction as an issue of whether the complainant has alleged a matter that is within EEO purview. Occasionally, an appellant will file a complaint which in fact alleges discrimination but is beyond the authority of the agency to grant relief. It is proper, in such circumstances, for the agency to dismiss the complaint as beyond the EEO purview. However, in doing so, the agency must establish enough of a record for the EEOC to review and determine that the matter is clearly beyond its purview. Although many Commission cases speak in terms of "EEO purview," there is no reference to "purview" in the regulations. Being beyond EEO purview is simply another way of saying the complainant has failed to state a claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.107(a). This section focuses on whether the agency has "personal jurisdiction" over the complaint insofar as it relates to the ability to grant relief to the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">In its regulations, the Commission does not speak in terms of jurisdiction. Rather, 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(1) simply provides that complaints may be dismissed for failure to state a claim under 29 CFR 1614.106(a). Jurisdiction is an element of a properly stated claim under 106(a) to the extent that the complaint must be filed with the agency that is alleged to have discriminated against the complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some of the special situations that can arise are addressed below. Although 29 CFR 1614.106(a), on its face, appears to prohibit the filing of a complaint with an agency that is not the employing agency, the Commission has interpreted the regulation to mean an aggrieved employee or applicant can bring a complaint against any agency that is "indispensable to the just investigation of appellant's complaint." <span class="Italic">Ching v. Department of Navy</span>, 01872873 (1988). In that case, the agency argued that it was not a proper party because the regulation at issue that disqualified the complainant from employment was promulgated by the Department of Defense. The Commission refused to dismiss the complaint against the Department of Navy and instead ordered that the Department of Defense be joined in the complaint as a party needed for just adjudication. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ronso v. Secretaries of Air Force and Army</span>, 05960418 (1999), the Commission found that both agencies were proper parties where the Air Force screened candidates and the Army made the final selection. Nor is there any requirement that the complaint be confined to two agencies. In <span class="Italic">Beverly v. Attorney General</span>, 01A23746 (2002), the Commission found the Department of Navy, the Department of Justice, and the National Security Agency should be joined as respondents where the complainant worked for the Navy, the supervisor worked for the FBI, and the alleged discrimination occurred while both were on assignment at NSA.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases where it is unclear whether a particular agency has the authority to grant relief, an EEO complaint may be filed with more than one agency and the agencies should cooperate with each other in their respective investigations. <span class="Italic">Stoker v. Panama Canal Commission</span>, 01822208 (1984). In that case, the complainant filed his complaint with the PCC alleging that the Commission's Central Examining Office improperly rejected him for a position with the Department of the Army. (The CEO previously coordinated the employment activities of all federal agencies within the Canal Zone.) Over the PCC's objections that it lacked the authority to grant relief, the EEOC remanded the case for investigation, advised the complainant to file a second complaint with the Department of the Army, and advised both agencies to cooperate in investigating the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01963212 (1996), the Commission found that both OPM and the agency were indispensable parties, as OPM had informed appellant of his ineligibility for a firefighter position because of his age. However, by its own admission, the agency made the final selection decision and OPM's role was limited to submitting a certificate of eligible applicants to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Moreover, the fact that a policy was implemented on a department-wide basis does not necessarily preclude an individual complainant from challenging a sub-agency's implementation of that policy. <span class="Italic">See Gennetten v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01913697 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Gennetten</span>, the complainant maintained that he was discriminated against on the basis of age as a result of the implementation of a Department of Defense hiring freeze by the Department of the Navy. The Department of the Navy dismissed the complaint as being beyond EEO purview because it could not direct the Department of Defense to hire the appellant. The Commission reversed the agency's cancelation of the complaint, finding that the appellant was an aggrieved person within the meaning of the EEO regulations and it was clear that the appellant was challenging the propriety of the agency's implementation of the department-wide directive. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01973033 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Buchhagen v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05940948 (1996), the Commission held that a federal employee may file a discrimination complaint with another federal agency if the latter agency is the cause of the alleged discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Buchhagen</span>, the complainant was an employee of the Defense Department whose position was jointly funded by DOD and the Department of Health and Human Services. The complainant contended that it was the actions of DHHS, in withdrawing its funding for the position, that were discriminatory. Reversing an earlier decision, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Buchhagen</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that the previous decision found that appellant's complaint failed to state a claim because appellant was neither an employee of or an applicant for employment with the agency (HHS). In doing so, both the agency and the previous decision erroneously framed the issue as being whether appellant should be viewed as an employee of the agency against whom she brought her complaint or as an "independent contractor." However, such an analysis is inappropriately applied to the facts of this case, since appellant clearly was an employee of a federal agency at the time of the relevant events and since employment related actions of which she complains were clearly taken against her by federal agencies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a) provides that an agency may dismiss a complaint which fails to state a claim pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103(a) provides that individual and class complaints of employment discrimination prohibited by Title VII (discrimination on the bases of race, color, religion, sex and national origin), the ADEA (discrimination on the basis of age when the aggrieved individual is at least 40 years of age) and the Rehabilitation Act (discrimination on the basis of disability) shall be processed in accordance with Part 1614 of the EEOC Regulations. Further, EEOC Regulation 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103(c) provides that within the covered departments, agencies and units, Part 1614 applies to all employees and applicants for employment and to all employment policies or practices affecting employees or applicants for employment. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that an employee is aggrieved when some personal loss or harm has been suffered with respect to a term, condition or privilege of employment<span class="Italic">. Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.</span>, 409 U.S. 205 (1972).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We discern no indication from the foregoing language of the Commission's regulations that an employee or applicant of a federal agency who is negatively affected by an action taken by another agency with regard to a term, condition or privilege of his or her employment lacks standing to file a complaint of discrimination against the acting agency. Certainly, appellant is required to file his complaint against the particular agency which has taken the discriminatory employment action by which he is allegedly harmed<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.106(a); 1613.2123; <span class="Italic">Ido Colantuoni v. OPM</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950136 (September 14, 1995); <span class="Italic">Pion v. OPM</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880891 (October 18, 1988). Thus, appellant, as an employee of the DOD, has standing to file an EEO complaint because she is "aggrieved" with regard to HHS's decision to terminate its funding for her position. If we were to order further processing of this complaint, however, it would still be necessary to join DOD as a necessary party to the proceedings in view of the fact that it had the ultimate authority to pay her salary and to terminate her. The record further indicates that HHS and DOD were each responsible for funding a percentage of appellant's salary. Consequently, any remedy to be provided in this case including back pay and/or reinstatement would necessarily require the participation of both DOD and HHS to accomplish.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_208"></span>Unfortunately for the complainant in <span class="Italic">Buchhagen</span>, the Commission found that he was precluded from pursuing the complaint on other grounds. Relying on <span class="Italic">Buchhagen</span>, in <span class="Italic">Decker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 01977056 (1998), the Commission held that OPM was the proper respondent, even though it was not the employing agency, where OPM denied the complainant the opportunity to present a paper at a federal conference.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly relying on <span class="Italic">Buchhagen</span>, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Lee-Chee v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01986197 (1999), held that the Department of Transportation might be the proper respondent in a complaint of sexual harassment where the complainant, who was employed by the Department of Treasury, alleged that she was subject to unwelcome advances at a convention that she attended as part of her employment. The Commission held that if the alleged perpetrator was an employee of the Department of Transportation and attended the convention in that capacity then that agency was the proper respondent. The Commission remanded the case for further investigation because it was not clear if the alleged perpetrator was attending as a private citizen or an employee of Transportation. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Sposato v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01A01199 (2000) (a USDA employee properly filed complaint against the Air Force where complainant alleged he was harassed by an Air Force employee).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency that does not employ the complainant may be a proper respondent agency in an EEO complaint if that agency administers a term, condition, benefit, or privilege of employment. In <span class="Italic">Laber v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01960376 (1996), the Commission held the Department of Defense was a proper respondent agency, even though the complainant was not employed by that agency where:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he agency clearly provides a benefit for employees of other Defense Department agencies, namely tuition reimbursement for attendance at non-DoD schools. The case of <span class="Italic">Justus v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, EEOC Request No. 05921045 (April 8, 1993), which the agency cites in its opposition brief, is distinguishable from this case because it did not involve the administration of employment benefits by a non-employing agency. We therefore find that appellant has standing to file a complaint against the agency in connection with its disapproval of his request for tuition reimbursement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mares v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01960499 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar vein, when one agency places an employee with another agency, both agencies should be joined in a complaint of discrimination. For example, in <span class="Italic">Walji v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01995482 (2001), the Commission relied upon its Enforcement Guidance on workers placed by staffing firms to find that the Department of Agriculture and U.S. AID were proper respondents to the complaint. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Walji</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a preliminary matter, we observed that the agency invoked the argument that its actions were only dictated under contract by U.S. AID and therefore, it should not be held responsible for the complainant's claims. We have spoken on the application of Title VII where one employment entity merely places employees with another. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Application of EEO Laws to Contingent Workers Placed by Temporary Employment Agencies and Other Staffing Firms</span>, No. 915.002, December 3, 1997 (Guidance). In the case at bar, the USDA acted as what can be termed, a staffing firm to USAID when it placed the complainant pursuant to the Resources Support Services Agreement (RSSA). As we stated in this Guidance, the two employment entities which exercised control over the complainant's employment in varying degrees had joint responsibilities as joint employers under Title VII to comply with the requirements of the nondiscrimination statutes<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Here, the record established that both agencies shared control over the complainant's employment. USDA evaluated the complainant's performance whereas, USAID decided to terminate the complainant's employment. USAID also decided which Schedule B employees it wanted to retain and or rehire. Both agencies contend that the other was responsible for determining the complainant's duties. In all, the record evidenced that each agency had some measure of control over the complainant's employment. Therefore, the actions of both agencies must be evaluated in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">An interesting situation developed in the wake of the air traffic controllers strike in August of 1981. One black controller filed an EEO complaint with the FAA some nine months later alleging that his request to be rehired was denied, but the agency had granted a similar request from a white female former controller. The agency dismissed the complaint as beyond the EEO purview since it was barred by presidential order from rehiring any controller who participated in the strike. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Transportation</span>, 01830759 (1983), found that the agency acted prematurely in dismissing the complaint because the employee had alleged that the agency was enforcing the presidential order in a discriminatory fashion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is an established principle that an agency is presumed to follow its own regulations and other applicable regulatory directives. FAA needs to establish that it did in fact follow the executive mandates as to the other former ATCs who, allegedly were rehired by it after the strike. Once FAA has shown that it followed the requirements and prohibitions for the other ATCs, it can then establish that it followed same with regard to appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission remanded the case to the agency with instructions that it conduct an inquiry sufficient to satisfy its directive and that it memorialize that record in writing. Interestingly, the Commission did not indicate what remedy would be available to the complainant if it was found that the FAA had violated the presidential order by enforcing it in a discriminatory manner. Since the order still would bar the rehiring of the complainant, it is unclear what authority the FAA would have to grant relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">If two agencies are involved in the alleged discrimination, the proper course is for the employee to file a complaint with the agency he or she believes is actually responsible for the discrimination. This is true even where the alleged discriminating agency is not the employing agency. In such cases, the employing agency should then be joined as an indispensable party to the complaint. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Velez v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01961480 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant complains that, with loss of her clinical privileges, her ability to perform her job has been affected. Having alleged a personal loss and harm with respect to a term, condition or privilege of employment, appellant has stated a claim under our regulations. The agency contends, however, that it did not take the alleged discriminatory action against appellant and cannot provide a remedy. There is no indication in the foregoing language of the Commission's regulations that restricts an employee who is negatively affected by an action of another agency with regard to a term, condition or privilege of his/her employment, from filing a complaint of discrimination against the acting agency<span class="Italic">. Buchhagen v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940948 (June 3, 1996). In fact, the regulations require an appellant to file his/her complaint against the particular agency that has taken the alleged discriminatory employment action and by which s/he is allegedly harmed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.106(a); <span class="Italic">Ido Colantuoni v. OPM</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950136 (September 14, 1995); <span class="Italic">Pion v. OPM</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880891 (October 18, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, appellant, as an employee of the agency, has standing to file an EEO complaint against both the agency and the AF because she is "aggrieved" with regard to the AF's decision to suspend her clinical privileges. In view of the fact that the action of the AF affected her ability to perform her job, further processing of this complaint will require joinder of the AF as a necessary party to the proceedings. The record further indicates that appellant properly consulted both agencies with regard to her EEO claims and both agencies are responsible for her employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, any remedy to be provided in this case would necessarily require the participation of both agencies to accomplish. It is the policy of the Commission that, when two agencies bear joint responsibility for an act of alleged discrimination, both agencies are proper respondents and the complaint must be jointly processed<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Buchhagen, supra; Denson v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05920383 (June 11, 1992); <span class="Italic">Reyes v. OPM</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900916 (November 15, 1990); <span class="Italic">Cloud v. USPS</span>, EEOC Request No. 05881077 (June 14, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we remand appellant's complaint to the agency and, by this decision, notify the AF of its joinder to the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Filing a complaint of discrimination with more than one agency has its hazards as the complainant in <span class="Italic">Donovan v. Department of Defense</span>, 01961017 (1997), found. Illustrating the confusion that can arise when complaints are filed with more than one agency, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Donovan</span> nearly lost his right to proceed against either agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant filed an appeal on November 16, 1995 with this Commission from a final agency decision (FAD) dated October 16, 1995 dismissing appellant's complaint of employment discrimination. Appellant filed a complaint against the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the instant complaint against the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The complaint against the DCAA was the subject of a prior Commission decision in <span class="Italic">Donovan v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01956513 (Sept. 23, 1996). In EEOC Appeal No. 01956513 the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Commission further finds that...the agency properly dismissed appellant's allegation that DLA harassed him and failed to accommodate his disability by failing to provide him with a "handicapped" parking space. Although the [DCAA] and DLA are both components of the Department of Defense, DCAA and DLA function as separate entities. The Commission notes that DCAA advised appellant to file a separate complaint with DLA, and states that it will cooperate in DLA's investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Donovan</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01956513.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant matter DLA dismissed the instant complaint regarding the handicapped parking space on the grounds that it stated the same claim as raised by appellant with the DCAA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that if we were to affirm the DLA's dismissal of the complaint, then appellant would not be able to raise his claim regarding the DLA in the administrative EEO forum despite the fact that he properly filed the complaint against the Department of Defense. The Commission will not allow, under the circumstances of this case, such a result. Because <span id="Page_209"></span>of our decision in <span class="Italic">Donovan</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01956513, DCAA will not investigate appellant's claim that DLA discriminated against appellant. Therefore, under the unique circumstances of this case, DLA shall be ordered to investigate the instant complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is also possible for an employee to be subject to employment discrimination by someone who is not technically an employee of the agency. In <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01956509 (1997), the appellant alleged that a medical director of the U.S. Army Health clinic improperly disregarded information and a recommendation submitted by the appellant's personal physician regarding his work capabilities. The agency found that the medical director was not an agency employee and was assigned to an Army Medical Center. The Commission found that for purposes of stating a claim, it did not matter whether the doctor was an agency employee where conditions of the appellant's employment were based upon the doctor's reports. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Alexander</span> stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In allegation (a), appellant alleged that a Medical Director disregarded the clarification and recommendation made by his personal physician with regard to his physical capabilities for a position for which he had applied. Appellant's allegation is sufficient to render him an aggrieved employee. Because appellant has alleged that the adverse action was based on disability, he has raised an allegation within the purview of the EEOC regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency determined that the Medical Director assigned to an Army Medical Center was not an "agency employee." We nevertheless find that the record contains sufficient evidence supporting a finding that agency determinations relating to appellant's ability to work were predicated upon the determinations of the Medical Director. We therefore determine that the actions of the Medical Director were within the scope of the agency, irrespective of whether the Medical Officer is or is not an agency employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the mere involvement of another agency in a matter that results in discipline does not aggrieve an employee. An allegation that an agency that is not the appellant's employer took action that allegedly led to discipline of the appellant by his employer fails to state a claim. In <span class="Italic">Steinberg v. Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 01950645 (1997), the appellant alleged that a letter sent by the defendant agency caused him to be disciplined by his employing agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Steinberg</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time appellant filed the July 21, 1993 complaint, appellant was employed as an Administrative Judge with the Denver District office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Appellant alleged in the July 21, 1993 complaint that he was discriminated against when:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;On October 7, 1992, the agency's Senior Counsel wrote to the Commission alleging that appellant had violated standards of conduct and ethical standards by using his official title in correspondence with the agency [FDIC]. This was the agency's Senior Counsel's attempt to jeopardize appellant's employment. Appellant was issued discipline in the form of a letter of warning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that appellant was not harmed by the October 7, 1992 letter written by the agency's Senior Counsel to appellant's employer (the Commission) alleging that appellant had violated standards of conduct and ethical standards by using his official title in correspondence with the agency. The October 7, 1992 letter itself did not harm appellant. The purported letter of warning was issued by appellant's employer, the Commission. The agency has no control over discipline issued by the Commission. The agency did not issue any discipline to appellant (who was only an applicant for employment with the agency) and it can not revoke such discipline which was purportedly issued by the Commission. Therefore, we find that appellant was not aggrieved by any alleged action taken by the agency in allegation 1.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no easy solution to the problems encountered when a complaint involves more than one agency. The Commission has established no clear method of dealing with such complaints to ensure orderly processing. On the positive side, there are very few complaints where there is a question about which agency is the proper respondent.</p>
