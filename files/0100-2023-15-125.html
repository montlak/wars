<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-123"><span class="space">3.</span> Good Faith Obligation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Parties may not simply respond to discovery requests by denying information responsive to the request does not exist without exercising a good faith effort to determine if the information exists. A good example is provided by <span class="Italic">Petersel v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720060075 (2008), where the Commission upheld the sanction of an adverse inference against the agency where it failed to conduct an adequate investigation and then failed to exercise due diligence in responding to discovery. Although the following excerpt from <span class="Italic">Petersel</span> is lengthy, it does give a thorough explanation of a party's obligations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the AJ properly drew an adverse inference against the agency in this case. Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3), an AJ may sanction a party for failure to provide requested relevant information, to include an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information, exclusion of other evidence offered by the party refusing to provide the requested information, or issuance of a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party. <span class="Italic">See Hale v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). The Commission has determined that delegating to its AJs the authority to issue sanctions against agencies, and complainants, is necessary and is an appropriate remedy that will effectuate the policies of the Commission. <span class="Italic">See Matheny v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Request No. 05A30373 (April 21, 2005). <span class="Italic">See also Cosentine v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40114 (August 9, 2006). These sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned. A sanction may be used to both deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party. If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his or her discretion to impose a harsher sanction. <span class="Italic">See Hale, supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies have a duty to maintain pertinent evidence upon receiving notice that a complainant has initiated the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14. Although the agency asserts that the destruction of relevant evidence was inadvertent, the Commission's regulations do not require a finding of willfulness or bad faith. <span class="Italic">See Cosentine v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40114 (August 9, 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ set forth in great detail the basis for applying an adverse inference. Specifically, as the AJ noted in her decision, it was only through the AJ's own questioning of a neutral witness at the hearing (almost two years after the complaint in this case was filed), that a younger Hispanic employee who was a probationary PTF at the relevant time was identified. W1, a city letter carrier, shop steward, and On-the-Job Instructor (OJT) in the San Pedro office, was asked whether he observed any Hispanic PTF's on probation in San Pedro in 2003. W1 identified one person, C1. W1 testified to working with C1 while C1 was still a PTF probationary employee. W1 also testified that S1 was C1's supervisor at the time. The AJ noted that at the hearing, S1 denied supervising C1 during his probationary period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, had the agency's investigation been conducted properly under the minimal standards set by MD-110, and had the agency complied with the Commission's record keeping regulations, the IR would contain Form 3996's and 1750's for other probationary PTF employees at San Pedro during the period 2002 to 2004, or at least for one year prior to the filing of the complaint. Additionally, the record shows that seniority rosters indicate "the date the individual entered on duty with the Postal Service [as a probationary employee], and for those who passed, their pass date would be ninety (90) days after the seniority date."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also shows that complainant sought information related to other PTF's in discovery, and the agency failed to produce such information, despite its obvious relevance to the case, stating that the source of such information was seniority lists and that they had not been retained. As the AJ concluded in her decision, this was a false and incomplete answer, as the agency later admitted. Complainant asked for information which existed at the time, which contained at least partial responses to his discovery requests, and which could have been obtained, as demonstrated at the hearing. Yet the evidence in the record supports the finding that the basis for failing to produce the relevant information was simply because the agency failed to contact at least three management officials who were obvious sources of such information. Moreover, the agency produced no evidence that it conducted a good faith inquiry prior to providing false and incomplete discovery responses or even prior to December of 2005. Only then, after issuance of an order by the AJ to submit a declaration under penalty of perjury from a competent witness, the acting Postmaster (AP) stated that she had generated a list containing some of the information requested. We agree with the AJ that had the agency counsel questioned such an obvious witness with potential knowledge much earlier than December of 2005, it would have received the information provided by AP at a time when the information was more complete or could have been made more complete. According to AP, some terminated employees might not have been reflected in the attachments to her declaration because hard copies of rosters were not generated and changes to the roster were made on an evolving basis when hiring and termination occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the AJ that the agency's investigator also could have contacted the Postmaster at the facility in question in a timely manner but did not. Had the agency produced the PS Form 1750 (i.e., an evaluation report generated for every probationary employee) for PTF carriers at the San Pedro office, along with the 3996s, complainant may have been able to produce additional evidence of similarly situated employees. According to one agency witness (W2), all probationary PTF employees at the San Pedro office in 2003, would have had a completed Form 1750, yet the agency failed to produce any to complainant. In fact, on cross-examination, W2 testified that he could not recall if he was ever asked to look for Form 1750s for other PTFs who worked at San Pedro in 2003. Accordingly, we agree with the AJ's conclusion that the reason for the untrue and incomplete discovery responses of the agency, according to all the evidence on point, is that the agency counsel failed in 2004 and 2005, to make a good faith, reasonable inquiry of its client, with whom it has a continuing relationship, and certify the discovery response accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also supports the AJ's conclusion that the agency failed to act in good faith in response to her orders to supplement the record with the documents which could confirm W1's testimony, or otherwise show the existence and performance records for other probationary PTF's during the relevant time period. Although the San Pedro Postmaster was belatedly contacted after the AJ's first direct order to provide information, the agency initially alleged that it could not provide the information sought by her Order dated December 19, 2005, because the seniority rosters were unavailable. At hearing, however, the agency's counsel admitted that this was incorrect. The agency's only attempt to show "good cause" why sanctions should not be imposed was the agency counsel (A1)'s own testimony concerning purported documentation obtained from the manager of agency's "Shared Services" unit (M1). A1 stated that the agency's law department was "notified" on December 19, 2005, that certain personnel information could be obtained from the Shared Services Center which she had previously stated did not exist. There was, however, no explanation as to who provided the notification, to whom, and why.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we agree with the AJ's conclusion that A1 was "notified" at that point in time because it was only at this time that the appropriate inquiry was made, and that the inquiry was made only in response to the AJ's second order to produce relevant information, show cause why it did not do so sooner, or be sanctioned. However, as the AJ noted the belated statement by A1 did not show good cause, nor did it provide the appropriate evidence, because it failed to produce a declaration from M1 under penalty of perjury prior to the hearing, and failed to seek leave from the AJ for the late addition of M1's testimony at the hearing to lay the foundation for the admissibility of these documents. Instead, A1 provided her own declaration purportedly "certifying" the validity of the documents, but in fact simply repeating the out-of-court, unsworn, untested statements of M1. The AJ concluded that there was no excuse give for relying on "testimony" of counsel, who clearly could not testify of her knowledge concerning the records. We agree with the AJ that the information the agency relies upon is inherently unreliable, and the agency offered no excuse for its choice not to present such evidence in a sworn, reliable form during investigation, in its responses to discovery, in response to the AJ's orders issued well before hearing, if not at hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further agree with the AJ's conclusion that M1's unsworn documentation is not sufficiently reliable and probative to support a conclusion that there were no employees comparable to complainant who passed probation under similar circumstances and were significantly younger and/or Hispanic. There was no authentication through a declaration under penalty of perjury nor was his testimony tested at the hearing by cross-examination. Moreover, the potential significance of this documentation to this case was neglected by the agency until the day of hearing and the agency failed to provide any explanation for its absence. Since the evidence is unreliable, it cannot support the agency's ultimate argument that, because M1 told A1 in 2006, that no similarly situated comparatives existed, the agency obviously had no motive to conceal evidence of discrimination in 2004 and 2005. We agree with the <span id="Page_508"></span>AJ that it would have been fundamentally unfair to complainant had the AJ accepted the "testimony' of A1 which admittedly had been untrue as to other discovery matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as a result of the AJ's own efforts to supplement the record before the hearing, she concluded that the agency does not understand its obligations under the Commission's rules, refuses to comply with the rules, or unjustifiably continues to defend its conduct in this case. The AJ noted that in spite of the obvious relevance of complainant's request for information about other PTFs in 2003, the agency's closing brief argued that an adverse inference should not be drawn based on its failure to retain and produce the documents containing the information because "management would not have realized the relevance of the seniority rosters to be on notice to preserve them, as complainant's case involved constructive discharge." The AJ concluded that such a position presents a direct conflict with the agency's position throughout the discovery process that it could not answer complainant's various requests because the information sought existed in seniority rosters which were unavailable at the time. The AJ further notes that the record shows that the agency was clearly on notice of tie significance of the seniority rosters and other equally significant documentation concerning the performance of not only complainant, for whom the records were kept, but also for comparative employees, for whom the evidence was not produced. The AJ furthermore concluded that it is not a meaningless error when the agency's lawyer provides false discovery responses from the client whose business she represents on a daily basis. The AJ also found no evidence of any reason for the false discovery answers short of inexcusable neglect to make a proper inquiry prior to making the discovery responses or even prior to December of 2005. The AJ also noted that the agency lawyer cannot and did not claim a lack of familiarity with her only client's records, nor has she shown that she was misled intentionally or unintentionally by false information from her client.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the record supports the AJ's position regarding the agency's failure to produce relevant documents and testimonial evidence. Moreover, we agree with the AJ's conclusion that the agency's attempt to rectify its failure at the hearing was inadequate and unreliable. Thus, the AJ acted within her discretion in drawing an adverse inference against the agency regarding the lack of comparative data.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, after a careful review of the record in its entirety, the Commission finds that the AJ set forth the relevant facts and properly analyzed the appropriate regulations, policies and laws. Based on the evidence of record, the Commission discerns no basis to disturb the AJ's finding of discrimination.</p>
