<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-52"><span class="space">1.</span> The MSPB and EEOC--Causal Connection and Punishment</h4>
<p class="noindent">Two separate, but related problems have plagued the analysis of drug and alcohol abuse cases over the years. The first problem involves the degree to which drug or alcohol-related misconduct should be excused by the reasonable accommodation requirement. The second problem involves determining when misconduct is drug or alcohol-related and when it is independent of any drug or alcohol abuse. The EEOC and the MSPB have not always been in agreement as to the resolution of these problems. That unfortunate fact has resulted in much confusion over an agency's obligation to provide accommodation to employees who suffer from drug addiction or alcoholism because many of the cases have invoked the overlapping jurisdiction of the Board and the Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">To complicate life in this area, the MSPB in 1988 issued rulings in a trilogy of cases involving drug and alcohol abuse that not only reversed its previous stances, but put it into direct conflict with EEOC rulings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 224 (1988); <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 MSPR 682 (1988); <span class="Italic">Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135 (1988). The culmination of these cases was a holding that reasonable accommodation of an employee who suffers from problems relating to drug or alcohol abuse can include demotion and, perhaps, other punitive measures. The Board adopted the philosophy that punishment can assist alcohol and drug abusers in accepting responsibility "for the results of their misdeeds" and, thereby, aid their recovery. Intertwined with its findings that punishment can be a form of accommodation, the Board also explored, at length, the requirement that there must be a causal connection between the alcohol or chemical dependency and the misconduct or performance problems cited by the agency. The result was that an agency incurred no liability for punishing an employee suffering from alcohol or chemical dependency for conduct that is not related to the dependency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Over the intervening years, the Commission and the Board have seemingly eliminated their disagreement in the handling of cases involving punishment as accommodation. While the Commission had never held that discipline can be a form of reasonable accommodation, it had held that the Rehabilitation Act did not prevent discipline in conjunction with accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Labor</span>, 03910017 (1991) (discussed in full below). Ultimately, this is the position adopted by Congress in passing the ADA and made applicable to the federal government though the 1992 Rehabilitation Act amendments. The Commission and the Board have been in general agreement on the issue of causal connection.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board and the Commission also had adopted the doctrine of firm choice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253 (4th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Whitlock v. Donovan</span>, 598 F. Supp. 126 (D.D.C. 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Whitlock v. Brock</span>, 790 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Under the doctrine, the agency was required to give the employee a "firm choice" between rehabilitation and termination as part of its reasonable accommodation efforts. However, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 03940100 (1996), based on the Americans with Disabilities Act amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, the Commission declared the firm choice doctrine no longer applicable. Under the current state of the law an agency is not required to give an employee a firm choice as part of its reasonable accommodation efforts. Although the doctrine of firm choice has been eliminated by the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, in <span class="Italic">Carney v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01942391 (1996), the Commission indicated it would still apply that doctrine in pre-amendment cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">This discussion starts with the Board's decisions because of their impact on how cases under the Rehabilitation Act involving drug and alcohol abuse are <span id="Page_1331"></span>handled by the Board and the Commission. Because most of the disciplinary actions handed out in these cases are appealable to the Board, it has had the first chance to develop much of the law in this area. The Commission's primary role has been in reviewing these cases and the Board's findings on the affirmative defense of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span>, the employee was removed for selling drugs on agency premises. As an affirmative defense, the employee asserted disability discrimination on the basis that he was a drug addict and his misconduct was related to that offense. The Board in <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span>, 36 MSPR at 228-29, held that to prevail the employee must demonstrate a causal connection between his misconduct and his drug addiction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the appellant is handicapped, the administrative judge should carefully consider whether the appellant is simply a drug user who, although he may have been intoxicated at the time of his misconduct, is not handicapped, or a drug abuser who is addicted to drugs and therefore suffers from a handicapping condition. The Rehabilitation and Abuse Acts were intended to provide assistance to individuals who, because of the long-term effects of drug abuse, have lost the ability to control their behavior. They were not intended to protect those who misuse alcohol and drugs occasionally, but who retain control of their actions and must be held accountable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This distinction has been recognized implicitly by Congress in defining "addict" in several provisions of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966. These provisions describe an addict as: "any individual who habitually uses any narcotic drug...so as to endanger the public morals, health, safety, or welfare, or who is so far addicted to the use of such narcotic drugs as to have lost the power of self-control with reference to his addiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 USC 2901(a); 42 USC 3411(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board then proceeded to set forth strict evidentiary standards that appellants would have to meet to demonstrate their drug or alcohol addiction.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> decision restricted the scope of the Rehabilitation Act by making it applicable only to those who can demonstrate a causal connection between their misconduct or poor performance and their proven drug or alcohol dependency. Left outside the ambit of the Act are those in the less severe stages of dependency who can only demonstrate that their conduct or performance is related to their drug or alcohol abuse.</p>
<p class="noindent">What is surprising about the <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> decision is that the Board went far beyond what was necessary to decide the case. The Board could have relied on previous Commission case law to the effect that not all conduct arguably related to drug or alcohol abuse falls within the province of reasonable accommodation. The Commission had previously held that an agency was under no obligation to "accommodate" the sale of drugs at an agency facility merely because the employee suffered from a drug addiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crosby v. Department of Air Force</span>, 03840155 (1986). The Board could have held that to accommodate such conduct would be an undue burden. In late 1988, the Commission passed up, at least temporarily, a chance to comment on the <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> decision when it remanded a case to the Board for further development of the record prior to conducting a review of the Board decision. <span class="Italic">See Loveland v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03880157 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, without specifically mentioning the <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> case, the Commission adopted the causal connection requirement enunciated by the Board in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Postmaster General</span>, 03890071 (1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Implicit in the analysis of a case alleging handicapped discrimination is a causal connection between the handicapping condition and the misconduct cited by the agency, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, petitioner must show that his handicapping condition (drug addiction) is related to the criminal conduct. Without a causal relationship, the agency is under no obligation to accommodate petitioner. As noted by the AJ, petitioner does not claim that he was "high" on drugs at the time he sold the cocaine to the Postal Inspector, nor does he propose even a tenuous relationship between his chemical dependency and that drug transaction. It is apparent from the record that petitioner's primary motivation was the desire to enter into a "very good deal." Moreover, it is apparent from the record that the agency removed petitioner solely because of his criminal conviction, not his chemical dependency....</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Pacheco v. Postmaster General</span>, 03920018 (1993), the EEOC specifically rejected the notion that there is a nexus between drug addiction and selling drugs. In the <span class="Italic">Pacheco</span> case, the Commission rejected testimony from an addiction expert that the complainant's judgment was impaired as a result of his addiction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question is whether petitioner has established the requisite nexus between his drug addiction and his removal. Petitioner has presented testimony from an addiction expert, as well as his own statements, that his judgment was impaired as a result of his cocaine use, and therefore, he engaged in trafficking and was ultimately removed. The Commission finds that while the evidence presented by petitioner may explain his subsequent relapses, the evidence is not sufficient to support a nexus between his cocaine addiction and the trafficking charge which led to his removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that petitioner benefitted monetarily from the transactions, particularly the transaction where he substituted sodium bicarbonate for cocaine. This evidence, coupled with the lack of evidence establishing that petitioner was under the influence of drugs during the entire period of his misconduct, suggests that petitioner's misconduct was intentional in nature. The Commission finds that the intentional nature of this misconduct is an intervening factor which defeats petitioner's nexus argument. Accordingly, the Commission concurs with the MSPB's finding that petitioner has failed to show he was discriminated against on the basis of a disability (drug addiction) when he was removed.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission continued its tendency of finding fewer circumstances in which there is a nexus between drug or alcohol addiction and misconduct. That there is some relationship between the two is not sufficient; there must be a direct causal connection.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Leary v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03920075 (1993), the Commission found there was an insufficient showing of nexus where the employee was removed for AWOL due to his incarceration for alcohol and drug-related offenses:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner has not shown that the excessive unauthorized absence upon which his removal was based stemmed directly from his alcoholism/drug dependency or that his disability, not another factor, was the determinative reason for his unauthorized absence. Although petitioner may not have been arrested and incarcerated but for his alcoholism/drug dependency, the Commission finds, under the circumstances of this case, that the connection between petitioner's disability and his removal is too attenuated to establish the necessary causal nexus. Specifically, we conclude that the agency's policy against granting leave for incarceration was the decisive factor which resulted in his absences and thus his removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the charge of excessive unauthorized absence which precipitated petitioner's removal resulted from the agency's refusal to grant petitioner's request for EAL from August 28, 1989, through September 13, 1989, during which he was incarcerated following his arrest. Because petitioner's request for leave was disapproved pursuant to the agency's policy, he was placed in an unauthorized absence status. Petitioner was not absent because his disability incapacitated him or because, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, of a suspension for alcohol-related conduct. The agency's policy against granting leave for incarceration operated independently of the particular alcohol-related conduct by petitioner when he was arrested. The record shows that the Notice of Decision effecting petitioner's removal was based not upon the conduct for which petitioner was arrested, but upon an agency policy against granting leave for incarceration for any reason. Therefore, in light of the factor of the agency's policy, the Commission finds that the relationship between petitioner's disability and the discipline which led to his removal is too weak to establish the requisite nexus.</p>
<p class="noindent">After <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span>, the Board moved on to the <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span> case, where the employee stole prescription drugs from the agency and was later arrested with them in his possession. The importance of the "causal connection" requirement established in <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> became readily apparent. It was undisputed that the appellant suffered from both drug and alcohol-related problems and that he had stolen the drugs to relieve the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal. However, there was no evidence that the employee was under the influence of either drugs or alcohol at the time he actually stole the drugs. After reviewing its case law concerning misconduct involving disabilities that were not drug or alcohol-related, the Board in <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, 37 MSPR at 687-88, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our adoption and application of these precedents to misconduct cases presenting defenses of alcohol or drug handicaps is further supported by the narrow scope and purpose of the Rehabilitation and Abuse Acts. These statutes afford employees accommodation only from adverse actions based solely on their alcohol and drug abuse. They do not prohibit an agency from discharging or otherwise disciplining an employee for misconduct when the adverse action is, as here, based solely on the conduct itself. Any other rule would provide a shield for the drug and alcohol user from the disciplinary consequences of independent misconduct that non-drug users or alcohol consumers or physically and mentally handicapped employees who commit identical acts of misconduct cannot share. Nothing in the Acts suggests that alcoholics and drug abusers should be treated more favorably in disciplinary situations than other physically or mentally handicapped or non-handicapped employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again, it is worth noting that the Board was not required to restrict the application of the Rehabilitation Act to achieve the same result. It could have found that, although the Act applied to the appellant, it would be an undue burden for the agency to accommodate the theft of prescription drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Having dispensed with <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> and <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, the stage was now set for <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>. In <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, a postal inspector faced a proposed removal for brandishing a pistol at four persons outside a bar and firing a shot in their direction. The inspector was also charged with carrying a firearm without a permit and contrary to agency policy. In response to the employee's affirmative <span id="Page_1332"></span>defense of alcoholism, the agency reduced the penalty to demotion. In an initial decision, a Board administrative judge reversed the action on the grounds that the agency had failed to accommodate the employee's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board reversed the decision of its administrative judge and affirmed the demotion. Among those whose livelihood depends, in substantial part, on successfully defending employees from adverse actions, not many would quarrel with the result in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>. The penalty of demotion for such a serious offense is generous, if anything. What is troublesome is how the Board obtained this result.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the outset of the case, the Board held that some misconduct on the part of a drug abuser or alcoholic is so egregious as to take the employee outside of the definition of a qualified individual with a disability. Certainly, it can be skillfully argued that there is no accommodation that would allow the employee in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> to carry out the essential duties of a position which requires carrying a firearm. From there, however, the Board pressed onward in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 147-49:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, the Board finds that a permanent demotion or downgrade to a position for which the employee is qualified, at the highest grade available, may constitute reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. For example, an agency may demonstrate by medical or other expert evidence that retaining an alcoholic or drug addict in his current job, during rehabilitation, may not be reasonable or may impose an undue hardship on the agency under the circumstances of a particular case. Similarly, an agency may demonstrate that detailing such an employee on a temporary basis during rehabilitation, while retaining him in his current grade and pay level, may not be reasonable or may constitute undue hardship to the agency under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Letter 792-6 (Nov. 28, 1986). The Rehabilitation Act does not preclude such demotions or downgrades.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Board herein makes a major departure from its previous precedent and now holds that any agency may impose reasonable discipline for any act of misconduct, short of removal, while at the same time affording the abusing employee an opportunity to rehabilitate....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Acts and applicable regulations do not prohibit all discipline short of removal from being instituted while the agency affords an employee the opportunity to rehabilitate. The source of the "no-discipline" rule, FPM 792-2, Subchapter 1-2, has now been contradicted by the more recently promulgated FPM Letter 792-16, which interprets the President's Executive Order No. 12564 (1986) (entitled, "Drug Free Workplace"), and which does permit some discipline short of removal for abusers (other than those who voluntarily identify themselves as abusers), even while they are being rehabilitated. In overruling the "no-discipline" rule, the Board adopts the medically-recognized principle that one of the ways to help alcohol and drug abusers overcome their problem is to make them take responsibility for their own actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">In reaching its decision, the Board specifically cited <span class="Italic">Swank v. General Services Administration</span>, 03870050 (1987), as not precluding discipline as an accommodation. In that case, involving an employee with a psychiatric illness, the Commission expressly reversed the Board on the issue of demotion as an accommodation because it was disciplinary in nature. Apparently, from the <span class="Italic">Swank</span> decision, the Board extracted the corollary that a demotion can be an accommodation if it is nondisciplinary in nature. When the demotion comes in direct response to specific misconduct, it is hard to differentiate whether it is used as an accommodation or as discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Board's partial reliance on <span class="Italic">Swank</span> is of particular importance because that case involved a psychiatric illness. Extension of <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> to other disabilities, especially mental disabilities, would significantly narrow agency obligations under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that removal of an alcoholic employee can only be effected under 42 USC 290dd-1(d), which permits removal of an employee who "cannot properly function in his employment" if "lesser forms of discipline are not appropriate, and if the employee has either refused treatment, or repeatedly failed in treatment." <span class="Italic">Navarro v. USPS</span>, 03850059 (1988). In the <span class="Italic">Navarro</span> case, the Commission upheld removal of the employee who refused to disclose the reason for his leave request. The employee sought the leave to enter an alcohol treatment program, but would only tell the agency that his leave request was due to "personal hardship." The agency denied the leave, but the employee entered the program and remained AWOL for more than one month. The Commission did not hold that some form of discipline could constitute reasonable accommodation, but that "petitioner's failure to specify the nature of his 'personal hardship' or the use he intended to make of the requested leave obviated any agency obligation to grant such leave as reasonable accommodation of his alcoholic condition." Other cases also suggest that the Commission's view is that discipline cannot be imposed as reasonable accommodation, but only as a last resort after attempts at reasonable accommodation have failed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Department of Commerce</span>, discussion, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1990, the Commission began to cite the <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> case with approval, though not on the issue of demotion. In <span class="Italic">Wilber v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 03900033 (1990), the complainant, a BATF agent with a long history of alcoholism, was removed after he drove a government vehicle the wrong way down a highway. He was involved in a head-on collision that claimed the life of a two-year-old girl. The complainant had been drinking heavily prior to the accident and was intoxicated at the time it occurred. The MSPB upheld the removal. Relying on <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, the Board found the complainant's conduct was so egregious that "it struck at the core of the agency's mission and his duties as a law enforcement officer." The Board concluded that the complainant was not a qualified individual with a disability because the conduct disqualified him from performing the essential duties of his position, such as carrying firearms and driving government vehicles. The Commission concurred in <span class="Italic">Wilber</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hougens v. United States Postal Service</span>, 38 MSPR 135 (1988), the MSPB held that an employee who is an alcoholic or drug addict will not be considered a "qualified" handicapped individual if he or she engages in misconduct "which, by its very nature, strikes at the core of the job or the agency's mission, or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is hampered." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 144. In making its determination, the MSPB reviewed EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.702(f) and noted that the term "qualified" defines "the reach of an agency's affirmative action program to ensure that individuals with handicaps are not excluded from positions whose essential performance requirements they can meet." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 146. The MSPB found, however, that neither Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act nor EEOC regulations require federal agencies to extend affirmative action to unqualified handicapped employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the MSPB noted that 29 CFR 1613.702(f) expressly authorizes agencies to "consider job qualification in light of the risk of endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 146. Where an employee's misconduct creates such a risk, the MSPB held that "the employee can no longer be considered qualified for service in his position under the regulation; and, a claim of handicap discrimination must fail since the employee now falls outside the scope of &#x00A7; 501." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 147.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a thorough review of the record, the Commission concurs with the Board's finding that petitioner has failed to establish that he is a qualified handicapped person pursuant to 29 CFR 1613.702(f). We find that due to the nature of petitioner's misconduct, petitioner has failed to establish that, even with reasonable accommodation, he could perform the essential functions of his position "without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Board's finding that petitioner's misconduct, involving driving his GOV while intoxicated the wrong way on an interstate highway and causing an accident which resulted in the death of a 2-year old child, non-fatal injuries to a private citizen, and $2,000 damage to the GOV, is so serious and is of such a nature as to disqualify him for service in his position as a special agent. As noted by the Board, petitioner's misconduct "struck at the core of the agency's mission and his duties as a law enforcement officer." Accordingly, the Commission concludes that petitioner's egregious and notorious conduct precludes him from being a qualified handicapped person....</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Deaton v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 03900086 (1990), the Commission, focusing on the criterion of misconduct that strikes at the core of the agency's mission, took <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> a step further. In <span class="Italic">Deaton</span>, an IRS criminal investigator was arrested while riding in a car with his cousin. Both were intoxicated and the cousin was found to be in possession of cocaine. The complainant told local police that he was working in an undercover investigation, using his cousin as a source to discover the identity of drug dealers, and had authorized the purchase of cocaine as part of the investigation. Unfortunately for the complainant, none of what he told the local police was true. The agency removed the complainant finding that his misconduct would adversely affect his credibility as a witness in trials and would hamper his ability to work with local enforcement officials in IRS investigations. The Board upheld the removal relying on <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in a decision that is noteworthy for its lack of an explanation of the underlying rationale, found that reinstating the employee would impose an undue burden on the agency. The conduct, the Commission found, was distinguishable from that in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> and <span class="Italic">Wilber</span> and was not so egregious as to preclude the complainant from demonstrating he was a qualified individual with a disability. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Deaton</span> went on to find:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that as a Criminal Investigator, petitioner occupied a position which mandated a high degree of sound judgment and integrity, as well as a high standard of conduct. Petitioner's duties involved independent travel, undercover work, serving as a government witness, and participating in investigations, some drug-related, in conjunction with other federal agencies and local law enforcement officials. Moreover, petitioner was empowered to carry a gun and a badge. Agency officials testified that petitioner's reputation was irreparably harmed, such that he could never again be trusted to serve as a government witness or head an investigative team. Given the notoriety of the case, agency officials <span id="Page_1333"></span>testified that retaining petitioner would severely undermine the agency's credibility, as well as serve as a source of embarrassment to the agency. Thus, we find that the agency has shown that reinstating petitioner would result in an undue burden. Although petitioner argued that he is rehabilitated, he has presented no evidence to rebut the agency's evidence which established that, despite his rehabilitation, he can no longer be employed as a Criminal Investigator. To this end, the agency relies on the other charges brought against petitioner which establish his trustworthiness was questionable. Moreover, the AJ himself found that petitioner was not a credible witness. In <span class="Italic">Wilber</span>, the Commission notes that the petitioner presented evidence which established that it would not unduly burden the agency to reinstate him. In fact, at least one agency official stated in that case that he would re-hire the petitioner. Such is not the case here....</p>
<p class="noindent">It is difficult to see the distinction the Commission is drawing in <span class="Italic">Wilber</span> and <span class="Italic">Deaton</span>. Arguably, as the Board found, the conduct of the complainant in <span class="Italic">Deaton</span> demonstrated that he could not be relied upon to perform the essential functions of his position. It is clear that the Commission rejected this approach, but it is unclear what the Commission relied on in the alternative.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Labor</span>, 03910017 (1991), the Commission had an opportunity to more fully develop the interrelationship between the ability to perform the essential functions of the position, reasonable accommodation and discipline for infractions that occur as a result of substance or alcohol abuse. <span class="Italic">Smith</span> involved a mine inspector who previously received treatment for alcoholism. He subsequently lost his license for operating under the influence.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee was required to have a driver's license to get to various mine sites to perform his inspections; therefore, the agency gave him alternative work in a laboratory while it proposed his removal. It subsequently settled the case through a last chance agreement providing that the employee would be suspended until his license was reinstated. The agreement also required the employee to seek continuing treatment for his alcoholism. Any further infractions would result in removal without appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="noindent">The employee appealed his suspension to the Board, alleging that the agency forced the settlement, under duress, and that it had failed to reasonably accommodate his disability by not providing alternative work through the suspension dates. The Board found it had jurisdiction because the suspension was imposed as a penalty in addition to the last chance agreement. The Board upheld the suspension and found the employee was not a qualified individual with a disability because a license was an essential requirement of his position. In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Commission, in a lengthy opinion, sustained the Board's decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether a handicapped person is a qualified handicapped person, consideration must be given to whether, with or without reasonable accommodation, the handicapped person could perform the essential functions of the job in question. 29 CFR 1613.702(a). Petitioner argues that, with reasonable accommodation, he could have performed the essential functions of his Inspector's position. In particular, petitioner notes that the agency provided him with an alternative work assignment (working in the laboratory) and argues the agency could have continued to do so during the period his driver's license was suspended.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The essential function of petitioner's job involved inspecting mines. There was no evidence that petitioner was unable to effectively perform that function or that his alcoholism substantially impaired his ability to inspect the mines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in order to perform that essential function, petitioner had to be able to drive to the mines. Because of the suspension of his driver's license, petitioner was unable to do so. Petitioner points to several alternatives--including traveling with other Inspectors to the mines, which would have allowed him to perform the essential functions of his job. Petitioner also points to an alternative work assignment...which he performed until he was suspended. Petitioner claims such an assignment would have allowed him to remain employed during the period he was unable to drive because of the suspension of his driver's license.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that petitioner previously was assigned alternative work and that the agency previously permitted Inspectors to drive to the mines together, we find that such actions arguably would have constituted reasonable accommodation. With such reasonable accommodation, petitioner would have been able to perform the essential functions of his Inspector position during the time that his driver's license was suspended. Therefore, we are persuaded that petitioner satisfies the definition of being a qualified handicapped person because he establishes that, with reasonable accommodation, he could have performed the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that petitioner was a qualified handicapped person, we also have considered whether the agency provided petitioner with reasonable accommodation and are persuaded that it did. In particular, through the LCA, the agency afforded petitioner a "firm choice" between treating his alcoholism and termination. By mitigating the petitioner's proposed termination to a suspension and by requiring petitioner to continue the treatment for his alcoholism, the agency provided petitioner with such a choice. <span class="Italic">Mitchell G. Stout v. Anthony M. Frank, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 019000204 (July 20, 1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Whitlock v. Donovan</span>, 598 F. Supp. 126, 131 (D.D.C. 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Whitlock v. Brock</span>, 790 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Also, while petitioner challenges the manner in which the LCA was executed, the MSPB determined that there was no harmful procedural error in regard to the LCA's execution.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that when the Commission has previously considered waivers involving appeal rights, it generally has disallowed waivers of prospective rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Claudette Royal v. Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01903626 (September 5, 1990). In regard to the waiver involved in the LCA herein, that issue is not presently before us as the MSPB ruled that the LCA did not prohibit petitioner from challenging his suspension. Moreover, as discussed more fully in note 1, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the LCA was not an issue squarely within the MSPB's jurisdiction. While only the suspension is before us now, petitioner is advised that the Commission would not generally hold that the LCA would preclude him from challenging any subsequent agency action against him....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The reduction of the penalty and the LCA's provision requiring petitioner's continued treatment are reasonable accommodations because petitioner was able to retain his employment, conditioned upon his continued treatment for alcoholism. Further, the LCA unequivocally placed petitioner on notice that, in order to remain employed with the agency, he had to continue his treatment for his alcoholism. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">George N. Ruggles v. H. Lawrence Garrett, III, Secretary, Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03840216 (November 17, 1989). Moreover, while the suspension constituted a penalty, based on the facts of the matter before us, the agency was not prohibited from imposing a penalty while simultaneously affording petitioner an opportunity to rehabilitate himself. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marvin Stephens v. Anthony M. Frank, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03880040 (January 8, 1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Clyde M. Bryan Jr. v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03840073 (January 28, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Tapia v. Postmaster General</span>, 01912722 (1993), the Commission appears to have clarified its analysis. Rather than focusing on whether the conduct is so egregious as to disqualify an employee from being a qualified individual with a disability, the Commission instead focused on whether it would be an undue burden for the agency to accommodate the disability in light of the nature of the misconduct. This clearly is the better analytical approach.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Tapia</span>, the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having established that he is a person with a disability in the form of alcoholism, appellant must next show that there was a causal relationship between his alcoholism and the conduct that resulted in the subject adverse action, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, his termination. After carefully reviewing the record, the Commission finds that appellant met this burden. Appellant's removal was based on the events which transpired over a three-day period between February 28 and March 2, 1989. Appellant provided uncontroverted evidence that the incidents precipitating his removal occurred during a period of heavy drinking. Moreover, appellant's consumption of alcoholic beverages and his resultant intoxication were expressly cited in several of the charges accompanying the official Notice of Proposed Removal. Since his removal was grounded upon these events, we find that appellant established a sufficient nexus between his disability and the conduct resulting in his removal to warrant a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> inference of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a causal connection is established, the inquiry is focused on whether or not appellant is a qualified person with a disability. EEOC Regulations define a qualified person with a disability as one who can perform the essential functions of the position in question with or without reasonable accommodation. 29 CFR 1613.702(f). In this case, to make out a facial showing that he is a qualified employee with a disability, appellant must show that he was able to perform the essential functions of his position prior to the events which triggered his removal. In addition, appellant must show that there are plausible reasons to believe that the disability of alcoholism can be accommodated. <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. United States Postal Service</span>, 662 F.2d 292, 310 (5th Cir. 1981). Thereafter, the burden is on the agency to show that it cannot reasonably accommodate the disability. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 308.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although appellant testified that his alcoholism sometimes detrimentally affected his work, the Commission finds that the record contains sufficient evidence to show that, prior to the three-day period precipitating his removal, appellant was satisfactorily performing the essential functions of his position. As previously noted, the AJ emphasized that the record lacked any objective evidence of prior work deficiencies. In his investigative affidavit, the Regional Inspector stated that, prior to the subject incidents, there was no evidence of alcohol abuse. Additionally, there are plausible reasons to believe that the agency could accommodate appellant, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, through the provision of a "firm choice" between treatment and termination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253 (4th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span>, 598 F. Supp. at 131. Given the foregoing, the Commission finds <span id="Page_1334"></span>that appellant has made a facial showing that he is a qualified individual with a disability. Therefore, the ultimate question is whether the agency is properly relieved of its duty to reasonably accommodate appellant's alcoholism.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Regulations require agencies to "make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental limitations" of qualified disabled applicants and employees unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. 29 CFR 1613.704. With regard to alcoholic employees, the duty to reasonably accommodate includes the requirement "to exert substantial affirmative efforts to assist [them] toward overcoming their [disability] before firing them for performance deficiencies related to drinking." <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span>, 598 F. Supp. at 131 (court found that agency which had for years tolerated the employee's absences failed to reasonably accommodate him when it neglected to clearly inform him of the consequences of continued absences); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant was a postal inspector, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a law enforcement official. The record indicates that, in that capacity, he was required to engage in independent travel and investigation, operate an agency vehicle and carry a gun. Therefore, we find that appellant could legitimately be held to very high standards of judgment and conduct. He violated those standards by the actions on which his removal was based. Appellant drove his government vehicle while intoxicated and was involved in an automobile accident. When later questioned about his actions, he failed to inform his supervisor about this accident. He had to have a rental car towed after he drove it off the road. Appellant abandoned his job responsibilities and engaged in drunk driving, both of the agency vehicle and the rental car, at times when he should have been on duty. He had a second automobile accident in the rental car. He was arrested, and ultimately convicted, for driving while intoxicated. Finally, he acted in a careless and thus dangerous manner in regard to his firearm. In short, appellant abandoned his position, engaged in criminal activity, attempted to cover up one of the consequences (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, his first accident), and through both driving while intoxicated and careless handling of his weapon seriously endangered both himself and the public. The weight of the evidence establishes that such conduct would normally result in discharge, regardless of disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency maintained that appellant's misconduct, given its gravity, destroyed management's faith in his integrity, exhibited extraordinarily poor judgment, and showed him to be undependable. Furthermore, the agency determined that appellant's continued employment would present a clear and manifest danger to the public and other employees. Accordingly, the agency concluded that it could not retain appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the agency's arguments persuasive. That is, the Commission concludes that, given the sensitivity of his position as a law enforcement officer, appellant's actions so damaged his credibility that it would impose an undue hardship on the agency to accommodate his disability. Accordingly, the agency was under no obligation to offer appellant a firm choice at rehabilitation prior to effecting his removal. Furthermore, the nature and gravity of appellant's misconduct make it unreasonable to require the agency to accommodate him through reassignment. The agency maintained that appellant's actions wholly undermined the trust it expects from and places in its employees. The Commission agrees that, mindful of the agency's unique mission and the faith and confidence of the public upon which it relies, it would be an undue hardship to require the agency to reassign appellant in light of the serious transgressions underlying his removal. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the agency did not unlawfully fail to accommodate appellant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has now, in essence and with some fine tuning, adopted the Board's approach in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>. While discipline is clearly not a form of reasonable accommodation, an agency is permitted to combine discipline with accommodation as a means of giving an employee a "firm choice" between treatment and suffering the consequences of refusing or discontinuing treatment. All of this would appear to harken back to the Board's comments in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> that an employee suffering from alcohol or substance abuse must be made responsible for his or her own actions as part of the treatment in overcoming those problems. As noted below, the firm choice doctrine has now been abandoned under the ADA amendments to the Rehabilitation Act. The final resolution, from a statutory standpoint, is not that discipline can be a form of reasonable accommodation, but simply that the law does not prevent disciplining an employee who is an alcoholic or drug addict for engaging in conduct that would warrant discipline if the employee were not an alcoholic or drug addict.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the MSPB and the EEOC have largely come into agreement on many aspects of cases involving alcoholism and drug addiction, they continue to be somewhat at odds over the precise standard to apply in determining whether alcoholism is causally connected to a particular misconduct. In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Secretary of Army</span>, 03930085 (1993), the Commission rejected a Board standard that the appellant must show that alcohol impaired his ability to the extent that he was unable to grasp the seriousness of his misconduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, in order to avail himself of the protection of the Rehabilitation Act, petitioner must establish the requisite nexus between his alcoholism and his misconduct which resulted in his removal. The Board found that petitioner failed to establish a causal relationship because he was not deprived of "an understanding of the seriousness of his misconduct," and his intoxication did not "affect his ability to form intent." The Commission disagrees. The evidence in this case establishes that petitioner was intoxicated at the time he appropriated the government vehicle for his personal use, and when he was involved in an accident shortly thereafter. While evidence that an appellant/petitioner was intoxicated during a period of misconduct is not the dispositive factor in establishing a causal relationship, it is a factor which will be considered by the Commission. The Commission finds that petitioner's intoxication, coupled with the evidence from the accident report establishing that petitioner was unable to recite the alphabet and his admission that "his mind was someplace else" during the accident is sufficient to establish that petitioner's judgment was impaired at the time of the incident. Thus, the Commission finds a causal relationship between petitioner's alcoholism and his misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">It remains unclear just how much a complainant's judgment must be impaired before a causal connection is established under the Commission's analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a complainant can establish that his alcoholism was causally connected to some of his misconduct does not mean the Commission will automatically impute a causal connection to all misconduct. The Commission will examine the totality of the circumstances to determine if such an inference is warranted. In <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Postmaster General</span>, 01932296 (1994), the Commission found that such an inference was not appropriate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is not a case in which the agency claimed to be unaware of appellant's disability at the time of its decision, nor did the agency claim that there was no causal connection to any of the disciplinary actions in his record. The personnel specialist testified that because of the last-chance agreement, she was aware that there seemed to be a problem with alcohol, and she considered appellant's request for reinstatement under the above-described ELM policy covering the reinstatement of recovered employees. However, she also stated that the discipline file showed other instances of insubordination, for being absent, and for failure to follow instructions, that did not indicate in any way that appellant was under the influence of alcohol or that there was reason to believe that alcohol was a contributing factor. The personnel specialist testified that she decided against his reinstatement because of his very poor work record which showed that he had been disciplined almost every year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the question here is whether, given the nexus between appellant's disability and parts of his work record, a causal relationship should be imputed to the balance of the work record. The AJ considered the degree to which appellant's work record referenced alcohol, and the time periods in which appellant participated in EAP. From December 16, 1980, the date of appellant's earliest discipline, through February 23, 1984, there were seven disciplinary actions against appellant, none of which referred to alcohol. The first discipline referencing alcohol took place on March 19, 1984; a supervisor detected the odor of alcohol about appellant. Thereafter, five more disciplinary actions that did not reference alcohol were taken against appellant, until in April 1986, a suspension notice stated that there was an odor of alcohol about appellant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1986, appellant began to participate intermittently in the EAP program. According to the EAP supervisor, management sent appellant to the EAP program. Thus, we can infer that the agency was aware of appellant's alcohol problem at least as early as 1986. Appellant in his testimony asserted that all of his discipline was related to alcohol, maintaining that every time he was absent from his work location, he was outside drinking. Appellant called a former coworker to testify, who had known him since 1979 and who worked in the same area. Asked whether he ever smelled alcohol on appellant on the work room floor, the coworker responded, "I can't say that I did"; asked whether appellant was intoxicated, he answered, "No." He did, however, state that he had seen appellant outside drinking at lunch time. Appellant testified that at the time he received discipline, he did not state the reasons for his behavior or state that he had been drinking. He testified that he made excuses and told lies, as he was not convinced at the time that he had a problem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After considering all of the evidence, we find that the preponderance of the evidence does not support a finding of a nexus between appellant's disability and his overall work record. Other than appellant's testimony, there was no evidence to tie appellant's drinking to any of the discipline prior to 1984, and only one of the disciplinary actions of the 13 issued before April 1986 referenced appellant's use of alcohol. We have considered whether the nature of appellant's discipline should have put the agency on notice that alcoholism might be a factor, on the premise that his insubordination, absences, and the like would be symptoms of his disability. The Commission recently found a causal connection based on a finding that the appellant's performance problems were symptoms of his disability of alcoholism<span class="Italic">. Edward Overby v. United States <span id="Page_1335"></span>Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920056 (October 14, 1993). In <span class="Italic">Overby</span>, however, the testimony of coworkers indicated a relationship between the appellant's drinking and his work habits, and the Commission determined that agency officials knew of the drinking. Such evidence is not present in this case. In addition, we have considered the documents that appellant submitted with his appeal. Many pertain to the period from 1987 onward, and we have already determined that the agency was aware of appellant's alcohol problem since 1986. Other documents show that appellant was sent by court orders to outpatient treatment for his alcoholism or alcohol dependency in 1980 to 1983, apparently for driving under the influence. While these documents suggest a disability during a period coinciding with his discipline, they at most establish the fact that appellant was an individual with a disability. They do not show that the agency knew of the disability, or show any other relationship between the disability and the behavior which led to his discipline<span class="Italic">. Cf. Overby, supra</span>. Accordingly, we find that appellant has not established a causal connection between his disability and the agency's decision not to reinstate him.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a clear trend toward requiring an employee suffering from alcoholism to establish, through extrinsic proof, the causal connection between alcoholism and any misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just when it seemed that the EEOC and the MSPB had come to agreement on the doctrine of firm choice, the role of discipline in reasonable accommodation cases involving alcoholism, and how to resolve these basically incompatible goals, the doctrine of firm choice was declared dead.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 03940100 (1996), the Commission reviewed the firm choice doctrine in light of the ADA amendments to the Rehabilitation Act. The Commission determined that the ADA amendments altered an agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation to alcoholics. Unlike the original version of the Rehabilitation Act, the new sections permit agencies to hold alcoholic employees to the same behavioral and performance standards as other employees. In <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, the Commission concluded that agencies are no longer required to offer an alcoholic employee a firm choice under ADA amendments to the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the parties implicitly stipulated that petitioner is a qualified person with a disability through their stipulation that the sole issue to be determined was whether the agency fulfilled its legal obligation to provide petitioner a firm choice. The clear suggestion here is that if petitioner showed firm choice was not provided, he would prevail in his disability claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The doctrine of firm choice is designed to force the employee to confront his alcoholism and seek treatment. It consists of warning the alcoholic employee with performance or conduct problems that he will receive discipline, up to and including removal, if he does not enter into and follow through with a program that treats alcoholism. We find, however, that federal employers are no longer required to provide the reasonable accommodation of firm choice under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, because the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 changed the applicable standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that federal agencies shall make affirmative plans for the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities. This statutory provision imposes on federal employers both a nondiscrimination requirement and an affirmative obligation for individuals with disabilities. On October 29, 1992, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 19924 amended section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act to include the following provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under title I of the [ADA] (42 USC 12111 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.) and the provisions of sections 501 through 504, and 510, of the [ADA] (42 USC 12201-12204 and 12210), as such sections relate to employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 USC &#x00A7; 791(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commission and court cases that pre-date the 1992 Rehabilitation Act Amendments viewed firm choice as a form of reasonable accommodation required under section 501. <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Frank</span>, 916 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253 (4th Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03910045 (May 2, 1991). The seminal firm choice case is <span class="Italic">Whitlock v. Donovan</span>, 598 F. Supp. 126 (D.D.C. 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd without opinion</span>, 790 F.2d 964 (1986). Although <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> recited, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the operative "affirmative" obligation language in 5501 of the Rehabilitation Act in finding that federal employers are required to "exert substantial affirmative efforts to assist alcoholic employees toward overcoming their handicap...," the decision explicitly stated that such duty is subsumed under &#x00A7; 501(b)'s reasonable accommodation requirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 598 F.2d 126, 130-131.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These earlier decisions holding that firm choice must be provided as a form of reasonable accommodation are inconsistent with the ADA employment standards now incorporated into section 501. Section 104(c)(4) of the ADA permits a covered employer to hold an employee who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior as other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the employee's alcoholism. 29 USC &#x00A7; 12114(c)(4). While the ADA requires employers to consider other forms of reasonable accommodation for employees with alcoholism, for example, a flexible schedule or leave to accommodate an employees treatment, employers do not have to excuse the violation of uniformly-applied conduct or job performance standards as a form of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In essence, the doctrine of firm choice has historically required federal employers to excuse the violation of otherwise-uniformly-applied job performance or conduct standards by giving the employee with alcoholism the firm choice of entering into and completing treatment, or receiving discipline, up to and including removal. We find that section 501, as amended by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 to incorporate ADA employment standards, no longer requires that a firm choice be provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency was not therefore required to provide petitioner a firm choice between treatment and removal, and properly removed him for being AWOL and giving false information to a management official. Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner was not discriminated against when he was removed.</p>
