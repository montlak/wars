<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-23"><span class="space">B.</span> "DIRECT THREAT" OR "ELEVATED RISK" DEFENSE</h3>
<p class="noindent">When a mental or physical disability presents a danger to the employee or others, the agency is under no obligation to accommodate the employee. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of Navy</span>, 03870174 (1987), an employee who suffered from a paranoid personality disorder threatened to shoot his supervisor. Although the Commission noted there was a direct connection between the employee's disability and the charge against him, "the agency's duty does not extend to situations were actions of the employee endanger the safety of others." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similarly, the hearing-impaired complainant in <span class="Italic">Herman B. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2020003251 (2021), represented a direct threat where "he could not visually and orally observe and monitor site conditions, rapidly respond to events communicating information, orally announce events to personnel in the immediate area, set priorities or give immediate directions similar to an incident commander."</p>
<p class="noindent">The ADA specifically incorporates a direct threat defense at 42 USC 12113(b). That section allows employers to adopt a qualification standard that includes "a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health and safety of other individuals in the workplace." The Commission further defines this provision at 29 CFR 1630.2(r):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Direct Threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. The determination that an individual poses a "direct threat" shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. This assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The duration of the risk;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The nature and severity of the potential harm;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;The likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;The imminence of the potential harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">Situations involving a potential direct threat defense often also invoke ADA restrictions on fitness-for-duty examinations, which an agency can conduct only if they are job-related and consistent with business necessity. See Chapter 14 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-23-137.html#sec14-135">Fitness-for-Duty Examinations: Performing Essential Functions and Direct Threat</a>," for a full discussion.</p>
<p class="noindent">The statutory language of the ADA would seem to limit the direct threat defense to situations where an individual would pose a threat to others. As noted by the Commission's ADA regulation, it interprets the provision as applying to situations where the individual is a threat to himself or others. Not all courts have agreed with this interpretation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Echazabal v. Chevron USA, Inc.</span>, 213 F.3d 1098 (9th Cir. 2000) (the provision does not include direct threat to self). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Moses v. American Nonwovens, Inc.</span>, 97 F.3d 446 (11th Cir. 1996) (a direct threat includes a threat to oneself).</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to resolve the conflicts in the circuits, the Supreme Court granted <span id="Page_1284"></span><span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> case to determine whether the ADA direct threat provision applies to a disabled individual or only to others as the language of the Statute suggests. In <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A. v. Echazabal</span>, 122 S. Ct. 2045 (2002), the Supreme Court held that the EEOC's interpretation of the direct threat defense was a permissible rulemaking under the ADA. Writing for a unanimous Court in <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 122 S. Ct. at 2048-53, Justice Souter found the EEOC's extension of the ADA statutory language to the individual was reasonable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 102 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 328, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> prohibits "discriminat[ion] against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability...in regard to" a number of actions by an employer, including "hiring." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). The statutory definition of "discriminat[ion]" covers a number of things an employer might do to block a disabled person from advancing in the workplace, such as "using qualification standards...that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability." &#x00A7; 12112(b)(6). By that same definition, <span class="Italic">ibid.,</span> as well as by separate provision, &#x00A7; 12113(a), the Act creates an affirmative defense for action under a qualification standard "shown to be job-related for the position in question and...consistent with business necessity." Such a standard may include "a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace," &#x00A7; 12113(b), if the individual cannot perform the job safely with reasonable accommodation, &#x00A7; 12113(a). By regulation, the EEOC carries the defense one step further, in allowing an employer to screen out a potential worker with a disability not only for risks that he would pose to others in the workplace but for risks on the job to his own health or safety as well: "The term 'qualification standard' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.15(b)(2) (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chevron relies on the regulation here, since it says a job in the refinery would pose a "direct threat" to Echazabal's health. In seeking deference to the agency, it argues that nothing in the statute unambiguously precludes such a defense, while the regulation was adopted under authority explicitly delegated by Congress, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12116, and after notice-and-comment rulemaking.<span class="Italic"> See United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">Mead Corp.,</span> 533 U.S. 218, 227 (2001); <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 842-844 (1984). Echazabal, on the contrary, argues that as a matter of law the statute precludes the regulation, which he claims would be an unreasonable interpretation even if the agency had leeway to go beyond the literal text.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the textual bar to any agency action as a matter of law, Echazabal says that Chevron loses on the threshold question whether the statute leaves a gap for the EEOC to fill. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> at 843-844. Echazabal recognizes the generality of the language providing for a defense when a plaintiff is screened out by "qualification standards" that are "job-related and consistent with business necessity" (and reasonable accommodation would not cure the difficulty posed by employment). 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a). Without more, those provisions would allow an employer to turn away someone whose work would pose a serious risk to himself. That possibility is said to be eliminated, however, by the further specification that "'qualification standards' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace." &#x00A7; 12113(b);<span class="Italic"> see also</span> &#x00A7; 12111(3) (defining "direct threat" in terms of risk to others). Echazabal contrasts this provision with an EEOC regulation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 357, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> antedating the ADA, which recognized an employer's right to consider threats both to other workers and to the threatening employee himself. Because the ADA defense provision recognizes threats only if they extend to another, Echazabal reads the statute to imply as a matter of law that threats to the worker himself cannot count.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The argument follows the reliance of the Ninth Circuit majority on the interpretive canon, <span class="Italic">expressto unius excinsio alterius,</span> "expressing one item of [an] associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned." <span class="Italic">United States v. Vonn,</span> 535 U.S. ___ (2002) (slip op., at 8). The rule is fine when it applies, but this case joins some others in showing when it does not. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., id.,</span> at ___ (slip op., at 9); <span class="Italic">United Dominion Industries, Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 532 U.S. 822, 836 (2001); <span class="Italic">Pauley v.</span> <span class="Italic">Beth Energy Mines, Inc.,</span> 501 U.S. 680, 703 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first strike against the expression-exclusion rule here is right in the text that Echazabal quotes. Congress included the harm-to-others provision as an example of legitimate qualifications that are "job-related and consistent with business necessity." These are spacious defensive categories, which seem to give an agency (or in the absence of agency action, a court) a good deal of discretion in setting the limits of permissible qualification standards. That discretion is confirmed, if not magnified, by the provision that "qualification standards" falling within the limits of job relation and business necessity "may include" a veto on those who would directly threaten others in the workplace. Far from supporting Echazabal's position, the expansive phrasing of "may include" points directly away from the sort of exclusive specification he claims<span class="Italic">. United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">New York Telephone Co.,</span> 434 U.S. 159, 169 (1977); <span class="Italic">Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v.</span> <span class="Italic">Bismarck Lumber Co.,</span> 314 U.S. 95, 100 (1941).[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In saying that the expansive textual phrases point in the direction of agency leeway we do not mean that the defense provisions place no limit on agency rulemaking. Without deciding whether all safety-related qualification standards must satisfy the ADA's direct-threat standard, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Albertsons, Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Kirkingberg,</span> 527 U.S. 555, 569-570, n.15 (1999), we assume that some such regulations are implicitly precluded by the Act's specification of a direct-threat defense, such as those allowing "indirect" threats of "insignificant" harm. This is so because the definitional and defense provisions describing the defense in terms of "direct" threats of "significant" harm, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12113(b), 12111(3), are obviously intended to forbid qualifications that screen out by reference to general categories pretextually applied.<span class="Italic"> See infra.</span> at 11-12, and n.5. Recognizing the "indirect" and "insignificant" would simply reopen the door to pretext by way of defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Just as statutory language suggesting exclusiveness is missing, so is that essential extrastatutory ingredient of an expression-exclusion demonstration, the series of terms from which an omission bespeaks a negative implication. The canon depends on identifying a series of two or more terms or things that should be understood to go hand in hand, which are abridged in circumstances supporting a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded. E. Crawford, Construction of Statutes 337 (1940) <span class="Italic">(expressto untus</span> "'properly applies only when in the natural association of ideas in the mind of the reader that which is expressed is so set over by way of strong contrast to that which is omitted that the contrast enforces the affirmative inference"' (quoting <span class="Italic">State ex rel. Curtis v.</span> <span class="Italic">De Corps,</span> 134 Ohio St. 295, 299, 16 N.E. 2d 459, 462 (1938)); <span class="Italic">United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">Vonn, supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Strike two in this case is the failure to identify any such established series, including both threats to others and threats to self, from which Congress appears to have made a deliberate choice to omit the latter item as a signal of the affirmative defense's scope. The closest Echazabal comes is the EEOC's rule interpreting the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 357, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> a precursor of the ADA. That statute excepts from the definition of a protected "qualified individual with a handicap" anyone who would pose a "direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals," but, like the later ADA, the Rehabilitation Act says nothing about threats to self that particular employment might pose. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(b). The EEOC nonetheless extended the exception to cover threat-to-self employment, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(1) (1990), and Echazabal argues that Congress's adoption only of the threat-to-others exception in the ADA must have been a deliberate omission of the Rehabilitation Act regulation's tandem term of threat-to-self, with intent to exclude it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But two reasons stand in the way of treating the omission as an unequivocal implication of congressional intent. The first is that the EEOC was not the only agency interpreting the Rehabilitation Act, with the consequence that its regulation did not establish a clear, standard pairing of threats to self and others. While the EEOC did amplify upon the text of the Rehabilitation Act exclusion by recognizing threats to self along with threats to others, three other agencies adopting regulations under the Rehabilitation Act did not.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 28 CFR &#x00A7; 42.540(l)(1) (1990) (Department of Justice), 29 CFR &#x00A7; 32.3 (1990) (Department of Labor), and 45 CFR &#x00A7; 84.3(k)(l) (1990) (Department of Health and Human Services).[4] It would be a stretch, then, to say that there was a standard usage, with its source in agency practice or elsewhere, that connected threats to others so closely to threats to self that leaving out one was like ignoring a twin.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In fact, we have said that the regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, which had previously been the regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, are of "particular significance" in interpreting the Rehabilitation Act because "HEW was the agency responsible for coordinating the implementation and enforcement of &#x00A7; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794," prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities by recipients of federal funds<span class="Italic">. Toyota Motor Mfg. Ky. Inc.</span> v. <span class="Italic">Williams.</span> 534 U.S. 184, 195 (2002). Unfortunately for Echazabal's argument, the congruence of the ADA with the HEW regulations does not produce an unequivocal statement of congressional intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we put aside this variety of administrative experience, however, and look no further than the EEOC's Rehabilitation Act regulation pairing self and others, the congressional choice to speak only of threats to others would still be equivocal. Consider what the ADA reference to threats to others might have meant on somewhat different facts. If the Rehabilitation Act had spoken only of "threats to health" and the EEOC regulation had read that to mean threats to self or others, a congressional choice to be more specific in the ADA by listing threats to others but <span id="Page_1285"></span>not threats to self would have carried a message. The most probable reading would have been that Congress understood what a failure to specify could lead to and had made a choice to limit the possibilities. The statutory basis for any agency rulemaking under the ADA would have been different from its basis under the Rehabilitation Act and would have indicated a difference in the agency's rulemaking discretion. But these are not the circumstances here. Instead of making the ADA different from the Rehabilitation Act on the point at issue, Congress used identical language, knowing full well what the EEOC had made of that language under the earlier statute. Did Congress mean to imply that the agency had been wrong in reading the earlier language to allow it to recognize threats to self, or did Congress just assume that the agency was free to do under the ADA what it had already done under the earlier Act's identical language? There is no way to tell. Omitting the EEOC's reference to self-harm while using the very language that the EEOC had read as consistent with recognizing self-harm is equivocal at best. No negative inference is possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is even a third strike against applying the expression-exclusion rule here. It is simply that there is no apparent stopping point to the argument that by specifying a threat-to-others defense Congress intended a negative implication about those whose safety could be considered. When Congress specified threats to others in the workplace, for example, could it possibly have meant that an employer could not defend a refusal to hire when a worker's disability would threaten others outside the workplace? If Typhoid Mary had come under the ADA, would a meat packer have been defenseless if Mary had sued after being turned away?<span class="Italic"> See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(d)<span class="Italic">. Expressio unius</span> just fails to work here.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">B</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since Congress has not spoken exhaustively on threats to a worker's own health, the agency regulation can claim adherence under the rule in <span class="Italic">Chevron,</span> 467 U.S., at 843, 50 long as it makes sense of the statutory defense for qualification standards that are "job-related and consistent with business necessity." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a). Chevron's reasons for calling the regulation reasonable are unsurprising: moral concerns aside, it wishes to avoid time lost to sickness, excessive turnover from medical retirement or death, litigation under state tort law, and the risk of violating the national Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1590, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 651 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. Although Echazabal claims that none of these reasons is legitimate, focusing on the concern with OSHA will be enough to show that the regulation is entitled to survive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Echazabal points out that there is no known instance of OSHA enforcement, or even threatened enforcement, against an employer who relied on the ADA to hire a worker willing to accept a risk to himself from his disability on the job. In Echazabal's mind, this shows that invoking OSHA policy and possible OSHA liability is just a red herring to excuse covert discrimination. But there is another side to this. The text of OSHA itself says its point is "to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions," &#x00A7; 651(b), and Congress specifically obligated an employer to "furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees," &#x00A7; 654(a)(1). Although there may be an open question whether an employer would actually be liable under OSHA for hiring an individual who knowingly consented to the particular dangers the job would pose to him, there is no denying that the employer would be asking for trouble: his decision to hire would put Congress's policy in the ADA, a disabled individual's right to operate on equal terms within the workplace, at loggerheads with the competing policy of OSHA, to ensure the safety of "each" and "every" worker. Courts would, of course, resolve the tension if there were no agency action, but the EEOC's resolution exemplifies the substantive choices that agencies are expected to make when Congress leaves the intersection of competing objectives both imprecisely marked but subject to the administrative leeway found in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor can the EEOC's resolution be fairly called unreasonable as allowing the kind of workplace paternalism the ADA was meant to outlaw. It is true that Congress had paternalism in its sights when it passed the ADA,<span class="Italic"> see</span> &#x00A7; 12101(a)(5) (recognizing "overprotective rules and policies" as a form of discrimination). But the EEOC has taken this to mean that Congress was not aiming at an employer's refusal to place disabled workers at a specifically demonstrated risk, but was trying to get at refusals to give an even break to classes of disabled people, while claiming to act for their own good in reliance on untested and pretextual stereotypes.[5] Its regulation disallows just this sort of sham protection, through demands for a particularized enquiry into the harms the employee would probably face. The direct threat defense must be "based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence," and upon an expressly "individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job," reached after considering, among other things, the imminence of the risk and the severity of the harm portended. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(r) (2001). The EEOC was certainly acting within the reasonable zone when it saw a difference between rejecting workplace paternalism and ignoring specific and documented risks to the employee himself, even if the employee would take his chances for the sake of getting a job.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Echazabal's contention that the Act's legislative history is to the contrary is unpersuasive. Although some of the comments within the legislative history decry paternalism in general terms, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 72 (1990) ("It is critical that paternalistic concerns for the disabled person's own safety not be used to disqualify an otherwise qualified applicant"); ADA Conf. Rep., 136 Cong. Rec. 17377 (1990) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) ("[Am employer could not use as an excuse for not hiring a person with HIV disease the claim that the employer was simply 'protecting the individual' from opportunistic diseases to which the individual might be exposed"), those comments that elaborate actually express the more pointed concern that such justifications are usually pretextual, rooted in generalities and misperceptions about disabilities. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span> H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, at 74 ("Generalized fear about risks from the employment environment, such as exacerbation of the disability caused by stress, cannot be used by an employer to disqualify a person with a disability"); S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 28 (1989) ("It would also be a violation to deny employment to an applicant based on generalized fears about the safety of the applicant.... By definition, such fears are based on averages and group-based predictions. This legislation requires individualized assessments").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Similarly, Echazabal points to several of our decisions expressing concern under Title VII, which like the ADA allows employers to defend otherwise discriminatory practices that are "consistent with business necessity," 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(k), with employers adopting rules that exclude women from jobs that are seen as too risky. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dothard v.</span> <span class="Italic">Rawlinson,</span> 433 U.S. 321, 335 (1977); <span class="Italic">Automobile Workers v.</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson Controls, Inc.,</span> 499 U.S. 187, 202 (1991). Those cases, however, are beside the point, as they, like Title VII generally, were concerned with paternalistic judgments based on the broad category of gender, while the EEOC has required that judgments based on the direct threat provision be made on the basis of individualized risk assessments.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Respect for this distinction does not entail the requirement, as Echazabal claims, that qualification standards be "neutral," stating what the job requires, as distinct from a worker's disqualifying characteristics. It is just as much business necessity for skyscraper contractors to have steelworkers without vertigo as to have well-balanced ones.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 226 F.3d, at 1074 (Trott, J., dissenting). Reasonableness does not turn on formalism. We have no occasion, however, to try to describe how acutely an employee must exhibit a disqualifying condition before an employer may exclude him from the class of the generally qualified. This is a job for the trial courts in the first instance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, our conclusions that some regulation is permissible and this one is reasonable are not open to Echazabal's objection that they reduce the direct threat provision to "surplusage,"<span class="Italic"> see Babbitt v.</span> <span class="Italic">Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</span> 515 U.S. 687, 698 (1995). The mere fact that a threat-to-self defense reasonably falls within the general "job related" and "business necessity" standard does not mean that Congress accomplished nothing with its explicit provision for a defense based on threats to others. The provision made a conclusion clear that might otherwise have been fought over in litigation or administrative rulemaking. It did not lack a job to do merely because the EEOC might have adopted the same rule later in applying the general defense provisions, nor was its job any less responsible simply because the agency was left with the option to go a step further. A provision can be useful even without congressional attention being indispensable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
