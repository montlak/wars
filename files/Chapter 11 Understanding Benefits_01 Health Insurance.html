<h2 class="h2" id="ch11">HEALTH INSURANCE</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program helps to protect eligible employees and their families from the costs of illness or accidents. It provides guaranteed protection that cannot be canceled by the health plan. It also provides coverage without medical examination or restrictions because of age or physical condition. The government makes a substantial contribution to the cost of FEHB insurance, while the employee pays the rest through payroll withholding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The program offers virtually immediate coverage, taking effect on the first day of the pay period that begins after the employing office receives the employee's completed Standard Form 2809, and that follows a pay period during any part of which the employee was in pay status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Continued coverage extends for up to a year while the employee is in a nonpay status on account of illness or another reason. However, employees must pay their share of the premiums for each pay period in which coverage continues. When the employee is in nonpay status on account of military duty of more than 30 days, coverage can extend up to 24 months, provided the employee pays both the employee and the government share of the premium during the last 12 months. Temporary protection for 31 days without cost after enrollment or coverage of an eligible family member ends (except for voluntary cancellation) is also available, as is continued protection after retirement.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Participation and eligibility</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Enrollment.</b> Participation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is voluntary, but employees are encouraged to enroll. Unless the position is excluded from coverage, new employees have 60 days from the date of appointment or from their date of eligibility to enroll. Employees who choose not to enroll at their first opportunity may enroll during the annual Federal Benefits Open Season, or upon the occurrence of an event that would permit enrollment. Each year, OPM provides an open season from the Monday of the second full work week in November through the Monday of the second full work week in December. Upon enrollment, employees select and sign up for an individual plan that best suit their health needs from among the many plans offered under FEHB.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">FEHB plans offer a Self Only, Self Plus One, and Self and Family enrollment types. A Self Only enrollment covers only the enrollee. A Self and Family enrollment covers the enrollee and all eligible family members. The Self Plus One enrollment type covers the enrollee and one eligible family member designated to be covered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Eligible family members.</b> Family members eligible for coverage under the Self Plus One or Self and Family enrollment are your spouse (including a valid common law marriage), and your unmarried or married children, legally adopted children, recognized natural (born out of wedlock) children, foster children, and stepchildren under the age of 26. However, your child's spouse and/or child are not covered. Children of federal enrollees are covered by their parent's FEHB Self and Family enrollment until their 26th birthday (plus a 31-day temporary extension of coverage). Your child does not have to live with you or be financially dependent on you for coverage to apply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if married, foster children can be covered under their foster parents' Self and Family enrollment. To be considered a foster child for health benefits purposes, the following requirements must be met:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The child must be under age 26 (if the child is age 26 or over, they must be incapable of self-support);</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The child must currently live with you;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The parent-child relationship must be with you, not solely the child's biological parent;</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You must be the primary source of financial support for the child; and</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You must expect to raise the child to adulthood.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">You must sign a certification stating that your foster child meets all the requirements. Contact your agency or retirement system for more information.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Self and Family premium does not change based on the number of family members on your enrollment. If you are already enrolled in Self and Family when your child under age 26 is added, covering your child will not increase your premium costs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other relatives, such as parents or a grandchild (unless qualified as a foster child), are not eligible for coverage as family members even if they live with and are dependent on you.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With a Self and Family Enrollment, any new eligible family member, such as a new child or spouse, automatically becomes covered. If you don't list an eligible family member on your SF-2809 or other enrollment request, that person is still entitled to coverage. Self Only Enrollments may be changed to a Self and Family Enrollment within a limited time period after the event or during an open season.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Same-sex spouses.</b> Legally married same-sex spouses are eligible family members under a Self Plus One or Self and Family enrollment. Coverage is available to any legally married same-sex spouse of any federal employee or annuitant, regardless of the employee's or annuitant's state of residency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In addition, the children of same-sex marriages are treated in the same manner as those of opposite-sex marriages and are eligible family members according to the same eligibility guidelines. This includes coverage for children of same-sex spouses as stepchildren.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> "Spouse" does not include unmarried domestic partners of federal employees unless they meet the requirements of being spouses in common-law marriage in states where such marriages are recognized.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Former spouses.</b> Certain former spouses of civil service employees, former employees, and annuitants may qualify to enroll in a health benefits plan under FEHB. Former spouses whose divorce occurred during the spouse's federal service should contact the agency that employed the spouse at the time that the divorce occurred; those whose divorce occurred after retirement should contact the former employee's retirement system.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Ineligible family members.</b> The employee's parents, or others who are not considered eligible family members (such as a grandchild, unless the grandchild qualifies as a foster child) cannot be covered, even if they live with or are supported by the employee. If the removal of the ineligible family member results in the employee's enrollment decreasing from three or more individuals to two individuals or from two individuals to one individual, the employee is eligible to decrease their enrollment type to Self Plus One or Self Only, respectively, within 60 days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Loss of eligibility.</b> If a family member loses eligibility for coverage (for example, when a child reaches the age of 26, or in case of a divorce), then that family member is entitled to convert to an individual policy with the applicable plan within 31 days. Your child's coverage continues at no cost for 31 days after the enrollment terminates. The family member will not be notified either by the employing agency or by OPM when such eligibility is lost, but must apply within the 31 days after coverage ends. Generally, a person who loses family member status is also eligible for temporary continuation of coverage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Temporary, seasonal, and intermittent employees.</b> Certain temporary, seasonal, and intermittent employees who are identified as full-time employees are eligible for FEHB. Non-Postal Service employees on temporary appointments, seasonal schedules of less than six months per year, and intermittent schedules are eligible to enroll in an FEHB health plan with a government contribution to the premium if the employee is expected to work a full-time schedule of 130 or more hours in a calendar month. If the employing office expects the employee to work at least 90 days, the employee is eligible to enroll. Employees expected to work fewer than 90 days are generally ineligible to enroll; however, if the expectation changes to at least 90 days, the employee will become eligible to enroll. Temporary, seasonal, and intermittent employees expected to work fewer than 130 hours in a calendar month are generally not eligible to enroll.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Children's Equity Act.</b> The Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act mandates that employees be enrolled for Self Plus One or Self and Family coverage in FEHB if they are subject to a court or administrative order requiring them to provide health benefits for their children. If applicable, employees must enroll for coverage in a health plan that provides full benefits in the area where their children live, or provide documentation to their employing office that they have obtained other health coverage for their children. If, after their employing office provides notice and an opportunity to enroll, and the employee does not enroll, their employing office will enroll them involuntarily as follows:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If employees have no FEHB coverage, the employing office will enroll them for Self Plus One or Self and Family coverage in the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan's Basic Option.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If employees have Self Only enrollment in a fee-for-service plan or in a health maintenance organization that serves the area where their children live, their employing office will change the enrollment to Self Plus One or Self and Family in the same option of the same plan.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If employees are enrolled in an HMO that does not serve the area where their children live, their employing office will change their enrollment to Self Plus One or Self and Family in the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan's Basic Option.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">As long as a court/administrative order is in effect, and the employee has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under FEHB, the employee cannot cancel enrollment, change to Self Only, or change to a plan that doesn't serve the area in which the children live, unless documentation of other coverage for the children is provided. If the court/administrative order is still in effect when employees retire, and they have at least one child still eligible for FEHB coverage, they must continue FEHB coverage into retirement (if eligible) and cannot cancel coverage, change to Self Only, or change to a plan that doesn't serve the area in which their children live as long as the court/administrative order is in effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Plans.</b> Some of the FEHB plans offered under the program are open to all employees. However, many plans require the employee to obtain health care through designated providers in a particular geographic location, to work for a particular agency, or to join a particular union. The brochures describing the plans offered give more details, but in some cases, it will be necessary to call the plan for eligibility requirements. Some of the federal employee union plans are open to all employees who hold full or associate membership in the sponsoring organization; others are restricted to employees in certain occupational groups or agencies. OPM has a plan provider directory available on its website at <i><a href="http://www.opm.gov/insure/health/index.asp">www.opm.gov/insure/health/index.asp</a></i>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>SF 2809.</b> Employees may enroll in FEHB by completing the Employee Health Benefits Election Form (annuitants, survivor annuitants, former spouses, and children and former spouses who are eligible for temporary continuation of services complete form OPM 2809), and turning it in to their employing office. This may be done online through OPM's website. Employees at many agencies may enroll through an agency self-service system. Consult your HR office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees normally may not enroll or be enrolled as employees if they are covered as family members under someone else's existing enrollment in FEHB. However, in certain unusual circumstances, your agency may allow such dual enrollments in order to: a) enable an employee under age 26 who is covered under a parent's Self Plus One or Self and Family FEHB enrollment to enroll in FEHB to cover their own spouse and/or child; b) enable an employee under age 26 who is covered under a parent's Self Plus One or Self and Family FEHB enrollment, but lives outside their parent's HMO service area, to have FEHB coverage; or c) enable an employee who separates or divorces to enroll in FEHB to cover family members who move outside the HMO service area of the covering FEHB Self Plus One or Self and Family enrollment. In these unusual situations, each enrollee must notify their plan as to which family members are covered under which enrollment.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Types of plans</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Unless the position is excluded by law or regulation, each federal employee is entitled to enroll themself and eligible family members in a health plan offered under the FEHB program. Each health plan carrier charges a different premium. The government pays up to 75 percent of the cost of health benefits coverage, and employees pay the remainder, based on a formula set by law. Several basic types of health benefits plans are available to you under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Fee-for-service plans.</b> Fee-for-service plans reimburse you or the health care provider for covered services. If you enroll in one of these plans, you may choose your own physician, hospital, and other health care providers. Some FFS plans have preferred provider organization arrangements which offer a choice of doctors and hospitals within a network, usually at a lower out-of-pocket expense. There are two general types of FFS plans:</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>1. FFS Plans without PPO.</b> A non-PPO FFS is a traditional type of insurance in which the health plan will either pay the medical provider directly or reimburse you after you have filed an insurance claim for each covered medical expense. You may visit the doctor or hospital of your choice. A non-PPO FFS may be more expensive and require extra paperwork.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>2. FFS Plans with PPO.</b> An FFS with a PPO allows you to see medical providers who reduce their charges to the plan. You will pay less money out-of-pocket when you use a PPO provider. When you visit a PPO, you usually won't have to file claims or paperwork. Be aware, though, that going to a PPO hospital <i>does not</i> guarantee PPO benefits for all services received within that hospital. For instance, lab work and radiology services from independent practitioners within the hospital may not be covered by your PPO agreement. Most PPO networks are quite wide, but they may not have all the doctors or hospitals you want. Enrolling in an FFS plan does not guarantee that a PPO will be available in your area. In "PPO-only" options, you must use PPO providers to get benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The charges and FEHB fee-for-service plan benefit payments for certain physician services for retirees who do not have Medicare Part B may not exceed the limits on charges and payments established under the Medicare fee schedule for physician services.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Health maintenance organizations.</b> HMOs provide care through a network of physicians and hospitals in particular geographic or service areas. Your eligibility to enroll in an HMO is determined by where you live or, for some plans, where you work. Some HMOs are affiliated with or have arrangements with HMOs in other service areas for nonemergency care if you travel or are away from home for extended periods.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An HMO provides a comprehensive set of services, as long as you use the doctors and hospitals affiliated with the HMO. HMOs charge a copayment for primary physician and specialist visits and generally no deductible or coinsurance for in-hospital care.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most HMOs ask you to choose a doctor or medical group to be your primary care physician. In many HMOs, you must get authorization or a "referral" from your PCP to see other providers. The referral ensures that you see the right provider for the care most appropriate to your condition. Care received from a provider not in the plan's network is not covered unless it's emergency care or the plan has a reciprocity arrangement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Specific requirements will vary with each HMO plan. Review each plan's benefit brochure for details.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">'<b>Point of service product.</b> Some HMOs offer a POS product that lets you use providers who are not part of the HMO network, but you will pay more to use them. Usually you will pay higher deductibles and coinsurances than you would pay a plan provider. You'll also need to file a claim for reimbursement, like in an FFS plan. Some plans are POS plans, which have features similar to both FFS plans and HMOs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Consumer-driven health plans.</b> The term describes a range of approaches to give you more incentive to control the cost of either your health benefits or health care. You have greater freedom in spending health care dollars up to a designated amount, and you receive full coverage for in-network preventive care. In return, you assume significantly higher cost-sharing expenses after you have used up the designated amount. The catastrophic limit is usually higher than those common in other plans.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>High deductible health plans.</b> A high deductible health plan with a health savings account or a health reimbursement arrangement provides traditional medical coverage and a tax-advantaged way to help you build savings for future medical expenses. The HDHP/HSA or HRA gives you greater flexibility and discretion over how you use your health care benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">HDHPs generally have a higher annual deductible than other traditional health plans. The limits are indexed and set by the IRS each year. Depending on the HDHP you choose, you may have the choice of using in-network and out-of-network providers. Using in-network providers will cost less. With the exception of preventive care, you must meet the annual deductible before the plan pays benefits. In-network preventive care services are covered at 100 percent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When you enroll in an HDHP, the health plan determines whether you are eligible for a health savings account or a health reimbursement arrangement. If you are Medicare-enrolled, you are not eligible for an HSA. Each month, the plan automatically credits a portion of the health plan premium into your HSA or HRA, based on your eligibility as of the first day of the month. You can pay your deductible with funds from your HSA or HRA. If you have an HSA, you can also choose to pay your deductible out-of-pocket, allowing your savings account to grow.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Preadmission certification.</b> Enrollees should be aware that all plans require preadmission certification for all hospital admissions of a nonemergency nature. If you are enrolled in an FFS plan, you are responsible for seeing that this requirement is met, and the plan may not cover some hospital costs otherwise coverable if the preadmission is not certified. For information on emergency admissions, consult the brochure for the particular plan.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Health savings accounts</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Tax-favored HSAs are generally available for people who are not eligible for Medicare and who have a qualifying high deductible health plan. By law, HSAs are available to members who enroll in an HDHP, are not enrolled in Medicare, are not covered by another health plan that is not an HDHP, and are not claimed as a dependent on someone else's federal tax return. The health plan credits a portion of the health plan premium to the HSA. The credited amount is different for a Self Only enrollment than for a Self Plus One or Self and Family enrollment. You have the option to make additional tax-free contributions to your account, so long as total contributions do not exceed the limits established by law. Eligible federal employees who are enrolled in HDHPs can make pretax allotments to their HSAs through the Federal Flexible Benefits Plan. OPM has worked with payroll providers and employee self-service systems to provide this service. The funds in your HSA can be used to pay for your plan deductible and/or qualified medical expenses that do not count toward your deductible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While these plans may not be attractive to every employee, they do provide federal employees with yet another choice in making the best use of their health care dollars by adding the option of a tax-free savings account that accumulates and rolls over from year to year to pay medical expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enrollees in HDHP plans must meet the deductible before insurance kicks in, meaning enrollees initially pay the full cost of care instead of a copayment or percentage of the total cost. Most HDHP plans also will provide enrollees with free preventive care, such as physicals and screenings; these do not come out of the deductible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An added advantage of HSAs is that the money is the enrollee's to keep -- even if the employee switches employers or leaves government entirely. In addition, money in the account earns tax-free interest. Neither is true with health reimbursement arrangements, which are tailored specifically for employees who are not allowed to open health savings accounts because they are eligible for Medicare. Money remaining in the health savings account at the end of the year rolls over to the next year. There is no cap on how much money can accumulate in either fund type.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Health reimbursement arrangement</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">If you select an HDHP and you are not eligible for an HSA, you will be set up with an HRA. The health plan will credit a portion of the health plan premium to your account. The amount for either a Self Only, Self Plus One or a Self and Family enrollment will be the same as the amounts that will be deposited in HSAs in the same plan. You can use funds in your account to help pay your health plan deductible and/or qualified medical expenses that do not count toward the deductible. You also can use the account to pay Medicare premiums.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Dental and vision insurance</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program is governed by OPM regulations and is the country's largest employer-sponsored dental and vision program. There is no government subsidy for the program, so enrollees pay the full premium. Eligible individuals can enroll in a dental and/or vision plan during the first 60 days as a newly eligible employee, during the federal benefits open season, or when there is a qualifying life event. They may enroll in a plan for Self Only, Self Plus One, or Self and Family coverage. Employees must be eligible for FEHB in order to be eligible to enroll in FEDVIP. It does not matter if they are actually enrolled in FEHB -- eligibility is the key. Annuitants do not have to be eligible or enrolled in FEHB.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal employees, phased retirees, retirees, and dependents are eligible for coverage under the same rules that apply to FEHB, except that the maximum age for covered unmarried dependent children has not been increased from 22 to 26 as it has for FEHB. Only unmarried dependent children above the age of 22 shown to be incapable of self-support may be covered. Employees may enroll at the same time as they enroll for FEHB coverage, and FEDVIP is subjected to the same open seasons. However, enrollment in FEHB is not a prerequisite for eligibility in FEDVIP, and FEDVIP does not affect general FEHB rates. Enrollment is also possible from 31 days before the enrollee or an eligible family member loses other dental or vision coverage to 60 days after a qualifying life event that allows enrollment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Eligible family members.</b> FEDVIP rules and FEHB rules for family member eligibility are not the same. Eligible family members for FEDVIP include an employee's spouse (including a spouse under a valid common law marriage) and unmarried dependent children under age 22. This includes legally adopted children and recognized natural children who meet certain dependency requirements. This also includes stepchildren and foster children who live with the employee in a regular parent-child relationship. Under certain circumstances, coverage may be continued for a disabled child 22 years of age or older who is incapable of self-support. Same-sex spouses and the children of same-sex marriages are eligible family members under a Self and Family or a Self Plus One enrollment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You may enroll from 31 days before you get married to 60 days after you get married. You also may enroll from 31 days before you or an eligible family member loses other dental/vision coverage to 60 days after a qualifying life event that allows you to enroll. The following are qualifying life events:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You or an eligible family member loses other dental/vision coverage.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Your annuity or compensation is restored after having been terminated.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You return to pay status after being on leave without pay due to deployment to active military duty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You get married.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You return to federal employment after being on LWOP if you did not have federal dental or vision coverage prior to going on LWOP, or your coverage was terminated or canceled during your period of LWOP.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">The primary form of enrollment is through the website <i><a href="http://www.BENEFEDS.com">www.BENEFEDS.com</a>.</i> This website also provides full details of available plans. Alternatively, eligible employees and annuitants can call toll-free (877) 888-FEDS (3337), TTY (877) 889-5680, to have a BENEFEDS customer service representative enroll them over the telephone.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Premium conversion</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Premium conversion is a health insurance tax benefit and all employees who enroll in FEHB automatically receive this benefit unless they waive participation. It allows you to allot a portion of your pay to your employer, who will in turn use that amount to pay your contribution for FEHB coverage. This allotment is made on a pretax basis, which means that the money is not subject to federal income, Medicare, or Social Security taxes, and in most cases, state and local taxes. The allotment reduces your taxable income, so less tax is withheld, and your paycheck is larger. Unlike the deferred taxation of Thrift Savings Plan contributions (which are taxed when you receive the money), you are not taxed later under premium conversion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Eligibility.</b> You are eligible to have your FEHB premiums paid under the premium conversion plan when:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You are an employee of the executive branch.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Your pay is issued by an executive branch agency.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You participate in the FEHB Program.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">If you are enrolled in the FEHB Program and are employed outside the executive branch, or your pay is not issued by an agency of the executive branch, you may be eligible if your employer agrees to offer participation in the plan. If you are an employee paying both yours and the government's share of the premiums, the entire amount deducted from your pay qualifies for premium conversion.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Qualifying life event</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">A QLE is a term used to describe events deemed acceptable by the IRS that may allow premium conversion participants to change their participation election outside of open season. There are several qualifying life events that may permit you to change. Check with HR for a complete list of QLEs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> An election of phased retirement is not a QLE which would allow benefit changes outside of open season.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Continuations or terminations</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Transfers/Nonpay status.</b> Eligibility for coverage under the health benefits program will continue if the employee transfers to or is reemployed by another agency without a break in service of more than three calendar days. You do not need to do anything to ensure your continued enrollment, but the gaining employing office must transfer your enrollment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enrollment may also be continued for up to one year if the employee is in a nonpay status because of illness or other reason; however, employees must pay the employee's share of the premiums for each pay period that coverage is extended.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the case of military duty of more than 30 days, enrollment may continue for up to 12 months. You are responsible for the enrollee share of the premium during this period, just like any other employee in leave without pay status. Current federal law extends the 12-month period an additional 12 months. During this additional period, you must pay both the employee and the government shares of the premium, plus an additional 2 percent of the total premium, on a current basis. Your employing office may waive the requirement that you pay your share of the premiums during all or any part of the 24-month period. Employees who enter the military service for periods of 30 days or less are also continued in the program. However, if the period of service is more than 30 days and the employee elects to have the enrollment terminated, the enrollment will be reinstated if the employee returns to the job by exercising reemployment rights. An employee who returns from military service not in the exercise of reemployment rights must register for health benefits participation within 60 days, the same as a new employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Phased retirement.</b> Phased retirement service is creditable toward the five years of service needed to continue FEHB coverage as an annuitant. In the event an employee ends their phased retirement for full retirement, FEHB benefits will continue if the employee meets all eligibility requirements as of the separation from service on which the full retirement is based.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In phased retirement, FEHB will stay with the employing agency and premiums will be deducted from a phased retiree's pay. For FEHB purposes, an employee in phased retirement status is treated the same as when they were working full time. This means that a phased retiree will pay the same employee share of the FEHB premium as if they were a full-time employee, not a part-time employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Retirement.</b> Ordinarily, enrollment automatically continues for covered employees upon retirement with the same benefits and costs as when on active status, provided that the enrollee is retired under a system for federal employees on an immediate annuity. The retiree must have been enrolled or covered as a family member under the program (though not necessarily in the same plan) for the five years of service immediately preceding retirement; or, if less than five years, for all service since having the opportunity to enroll in a plan under the program. An annuitant may not normally enroll after retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Survivors.</b> Survivors of deceased employees or annuitants remain covered by the plan if a family member is entitled to a survivor's annuity. Survivors and annuitants may pay premiums directly to OPM if the annuity is insufficient to cover the premium.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a phased retiree dies during a period of phased employment, survivor benefits will be determined under the rules for deceased employees. If a spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity, the period of service the employee performed during phased retirement will be credited as part-time service in the computation of the survivor annuity benefit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Cancellations.</b> Normally, enrollees may cancel their enrollment at any time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Temporary continuation of coverage.</b> Temporary continuation of coverage is available to employees who are voluntarily or involuntarily separated from government service (except for gross misconduct) and who would not otherwise be eligible for continued coverage. Included is separation for retirement when the employee is unable to meet the five-year enrollment requirement for continued enrollment after retirement. Your human resources office must notify you within 61 days after your regular FEHB enrollment terminates of your opportunity to enroll under TCC. Generally, you have 60 days after getting the notice or 60 days after separation, whichever is later, to enroll under TCC. It's a good idea to ask your agency for TCC information on the day you separate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This temporary coverage continues for up to 18 months after separation from service. In such a TCC situation, the former employee must pay the total premium for the plan they select (both the employee and the government contributions), plus a charge of 2 percent for administrative expenses. Even when this temporary continuation ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), the former employee is still entitled to a 31-day temporary extension in the same enrollment category held at the time TCC expires for conversion to an individual contract with your current health benefits plan. There is no cost to the separated employee for this 31-day extension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">TCC is also available for up to 36 months for a covered child or a former spouse who would otherwise lose FEHB coverage as a result of changes in family member status. The employing agency must be notified within 60 days when a child or former spouse becomes eligible for TCC.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Appeals</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Claims.</b> If a plan denies a claim by an FEHB enrollee for a payment or service, the carrier must reconsider its decision if it receives a written request from an employee within one year citing the reasons why the claim should have been honored. Within 30 days, the plan must pay the claim or provide the service, reaffirm its original denial, or request further valid information to enable it to make a determination. If the plan affirms its denial or fails to respond to the claim, the employee may request an OPM review of the plan's compliance with its FEHB contract. The disputed claims section of your plan's brochure will tell you how to write to OPM to ask for review of the claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Appeals for reconsideration.</b> OPM is generally the final administrative authority on FEHB matters. However, if retirement benefits are affected, an appeal may be possible to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Discontinuance and change in plans</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Enrollees who lose coverage as a result of the discontinuance of a plan or a plan option at the end of a contract year must choose a new plan or plan option during open season, unless OPM establishes another time frame. If the discontinuance occurs at another time, OPM must establish a time frame for changes and effective dates. Enrollees who fail to choose a new option to replace a discontinued option will be considered enrolled in the remaining option of the plan. Enrollees who fail to choose a new plan to replace a discontinued plan will be enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations at 5 CFR 890.301, 306, 806 and 1108 assure continuance of health coverage if a health insurance plan should become incapacitated, either temporarily or permanently, due to a disaster. Enrollees have 60 days from the declaration of a disaster by OPM to change enrollment. Enrollees who do not choose a new plan within the deadline will be enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option. The effective date of the changed enrollment will be announced by OPM when it makes the announcement allowing such changes.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Fraud hotline</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Call the OPM Inspector General's hotline to report fraud, waste or abuse at 1-877-499-7295 if a health plan provider has billed you for services you did not receive, or with any allegation of fraud, waste, or abuse in FEHB. You may also fill out a hotline complaint form on OPM's website, or write to: ATTN: OIG Hotline, OPM Office of the Inspector General, 1900 E St., N.W., Room 6400, Washington, D.C. 20415-1100.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What is a health savings account?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> When you enroll in an HDHP, the health plan determines whether you are eligible for a health savings account or a health reimbursement arrangement. An HSA is a trust account that you own for the purpose of paying qualified medical expenses for yourself, your spouse and your dependents.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What are the general features of an HSA?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> One of the main features is that your own HSA contributions are tax-deductible or pretax (if made by payroll deduction). Other features include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Interest earned on your account is tax-free.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Tax-free withdrawals may be made for qualified medical expenses.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Unused funds and interest are carried over, without limit, from year to year.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> You own the HSA, and it is yours to keep -- even when you change plans or retire.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Your HSA is administered by a trustee or custodian.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Who is eligible for an HSA?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You must participate in a high deductible health plan, have no other insurance coverage other than those specifically allowed, and not be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return in order to be eligible for an HSA. Some examples of other coverage that would cause ineligibility are: a flexible spending account, a spouse's FSA, a spouse's HMO, other non-high deductible health insurance coverage, TRICARE, Medicare, or receipt of VA benefits within the previous three months. You may still have other disability, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance policies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How can I contribute to my HSA?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You may contribute your own money to your account by making a lump-sum contribution or periodic payments at any time, in any amount up to a maximum limit. The maximum amounts vary by plan.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What expenses can I pay for with my HSA?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Your HSA can be used to pay for "qualified medical expenses," as defined by IRS Code 213(d). These expenses include, but are not limited to, medical plan deductibles, diagnostic services covered by your plan, long-term care premiums, and health insurance premiums if you are receiving federal unemployment compensation, over-the-counter drugs, LASIK surgery, and some nursing services. When you become Medicare-enrolled, you can use the account to purchase any health insurance other than a Medigap policy. You may not, however, continue to make contributions to your HSA once you are Medicare-enrolled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the complete list of IRS-allowable expenses, request a copy of IRS Publication 502 by calling (800) 829-3676, or visit the IRS website at <i><a href="http://www.irs.gov">www.irs.gov</a></i> and click on "Forms &#x0026; Instructions."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. May I use my HSA to pay for non-health-related expenses?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. You may withdraw money from your HSA for items other than qualified health expenses, but the amount will be subject to income tax, and if you are under 65 years old, an additional 20 percent penalty on the amount withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can the unused funds in my HSA be rolled over each year?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Your funds will accumulate without a maximum cap.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Are health plan contributions to my HSA considered taxable income and are they tax deductible?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> "Premium pass through" payments are not considered income, but you may not deduct them on your income tax return.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Does the money in my HSA earn interest?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Your HSA funds are invested. Depending on which HDHP product you choose, the interest rate and payment of interest will vary. Your earnings are tax-free.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What happens to my HSA if I leave my health plan or job?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You own your account, so you keep your HSA, even if you change health plans or leave federal employment. If you no longer are enrolled in an HDHP, you are not eligible to make payments to your HSA, but you may request withdrawals for qualified medical expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What are the survivor benefits associated with my HSA, and how are they taxed?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Your HSA would pass to your surviving spouse or named beneficiary tax-free. If you are unmarried and do not have a named beneficiary, the money is disbursed to your estate and is taxable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What is the difference between an HSA and a health care flexible spending account? It seems as though they serve the same purpose.</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> HSA is similar to an HCFSA in that it is funded with pretax dollars that may be used for the same type of health care expenses. However, HSAs are only available to employees who elect an HDHP, while HCFSAs are not restricted to any specific type of plan. You cannot have an HSA and an HCFSA at the same time. HSA balances roll over from year to year and continue to grow tax-free. HCFSA money is lost if you do not spend it by the end of each year.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What is a health reimbursement arrangement?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> HDHP members who do not qualify for an HSA will be provided an HRA. An HRA is an employer-funded account to reimburse allowable medical expenses. There is no additional paperwork needed for enrollment into the HRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What are the general features of an HRA?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses is one feature. Others include:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Carryover of unused credits from year to year.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Credits in an HRA do not earn interest.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Credits in an HRA are forfeited if you leave federal employment or switch health insurance plans.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Your HRA is administered by the health plan.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Who is eligible for an HRA?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You are eligible for an HRA if you are enrolled in an HDHP and you are not eligible for an HSA. You can have an HRA if you're enrolled in Medicare or if you're covered by another non-HDHP health plan.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How is an HRA funded?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Your health plan will credit a portion of the health premium. The credit will be the same as the plan's HSA deposit for a Self Only or Self and Family enrollment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What expenses can I pay for with my HRA?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> You can use funds in your account to pay:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Qualified medical expenses that do not count toward the deductible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Your health plan's deductible.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Your Medicare premiums.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Is my HRA portable?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> If you retire and remain in your health plan, you may continue to use and accumulate credits in your HRA. If you terminate employment or change health plans, only eligible expenses incurred while covered under that health plan will be eligible for reimbursement, subject to timely filing requirements. Unused credits are forfeited.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can the unused funds in my HRA be rolled over each year?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Your credits accumulate without a maximum cap.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. What is premium conversion?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Premium conversion is the "pretax" arrangement for paying your health insurance premiums. This means that the part of your salary that goes for health insurance premiums will become non-taxable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Under premium conversion, do I have to pay a tax later?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. Don't confuse premium conversion with the deferred taxation of Thrift Savings Plan contributions, which are taxed when you receive the money.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. How do I sign up for premium conversion?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> The payroll office will sign you up for premium conversion automatically. You don't need to fill out a form. You do have a choice, though, to waive premium conversion despite the savings. It's a personal decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Why would I not want the tax savings provided by premium conversion?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> It's <i>extremely</i> unlikely that you wouldn't want the tax savings, but it's possible. The potential reasons fall under two headings: flexibility and Social Security.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Flexibility.</b> An employee participating in premium conversion generally has all the same flexibility as a person who chooses not to participate. Because of the tax laws, though, there are two exceptions. If you waive premium conversion, you will have the flexibility, without giving any reason whatsoever, either to drop your health insurance altogether or change from a Self and Family enrollment to Self Only. If you are participating in premium conversion, you will be allowed to drop coverage, or change to Self Only, only if your decision to do so comes at the time of a "qualifying life event," such as when you get married or your spouse gets a job that covers you under your spouse's health insurance. This flexibility is generally of little or no value compared to the tax savings of premium conversion.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Social Security.</b> If you pay Social Security taxes on your salary, then premium conversion may result in somewhat lower Social Security benefits. In rare situations, it may be advantageous to pay full Social Security taxes rather than the lower Social Security taxes you pay under premium conversion. These unusual cases do not involve employees covered by the old Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the CSRS-Offset plan. If you are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and you pay no federal income tax, you may wish to investigate further.</li>
