<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-44"><span class="space">30.</span> Severity of the Harassment</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Commission excused some fairly significant filing delays in <span class="Italic">Margaret M v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120181973 (2018), where the harassment was especially egregious, but occurred on only one day. Three complainants where the subjects of the harassment and all three complaints were dismissed for failure <span id="Page_167"></span>to timely contact an EEO counselor or failure to file a timely formal complaint. The facts in <span class="Italic">Margaret M</span>. drove the Commission's decision, so the full opinion is reproduced below:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of events giving rise to this complaint, Complainant 1, 2, and 3 worked as Rural Carrier Associates at the Agency's Drew Station facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 1, 2018, Complainant 1 contacted the EEO Counselor alleging discrimination. The matter was not resolved informally. On April 12, 2018, Complainant filed a formal complaint alleging that the Agency subjected her to discrimination on the basis of sex (female) when: on November 17, 2017, the Manager watched her all day long, and made comments which she believed constituted sexual harassment. He also stated that she would not be paid for the day's work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency dismissed Complainant 1's complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(2), due to the untimely EEO Counselor contact. The instant appeal followed. Complainant 1 requested that the Commission allow her complaint to continue by tolling of the timeframes for equitable purposes. Complainant 1 indicated that due to the harassment, she resigned. She was instructed that she had no avenue of recourse regarding the Manager's actions. She was later contacted on February 1, 2018, by another coworker who informed her that she had been subjected to sexual harassment as well at the hands of the Manager. It was at that time she became aware that she could raise her claim of harassment with the Agency. On the same day, Complainant made contact with the EEO Counselor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 7, 2018, Complainant 2 contacted the EEO Counselor alleging sexual harassment by the Manager. The matter was not resolved informally and on March 6, 2018, Complainant 2 received her Notice of Right to File her formal complaint. On April 12, 2018, Complainant 2 filed a formal complaint alleging that the Agency subjected her to discrimination on the basis of sex (female) when: on October 21, 2017, the Manager made sexual advances towards her and management did nothing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency dismissed Complainant 2's formal complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(2) finding that Complainant 2 failed to file her formal complaint within 15 days of receiving her Notice of Right to File. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant 2 appealed asserting that from the moment the Manager transferred into the facility, he subjected Complainant 2 to sexual harassment. She indicated that the harassment continued until she resigned from the workplace. She noted that the first day he started, he called himself the HNIC which she stated meant "Head N***** in Charge" and that he made offensive comments which were sexual in nature. The Manager asked her if she was happy in her marriage and noted that "you're feisty, I like 'em like that, it gives me a thrill." Complainant 2 stated that when she had been out, the Manager stated that he would excuse her for being off if "she got down on her knees" and told her not to pass out at work or he would be forced to do mouth to mouth on her; have his legs over her; and he would be near her crotch. When Complainant 2 informed the Manager she was resigning, he told her to give him her badge so that he can look at her while he relieved himself sexually. Complainant 2 asserted that she informed management of the Manager's action. Management told Complainant 2 that they had heard that the Manager was "flirty" and "fresh." However, nothing was done about it. Based on the events Complainant 2 experienced, she asked that the time period be tolled and that her complaint be remanded for further processing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 3, 2018, Complainant 3 contacted the EEO Counselor alleging that she had been subjected to sexual harassment. When the matter was not resolved informally, Complainant was issued a Notice of Right to File her formal complaint on March 5, 2018. On April 12, 2018, Complainant 3 filed a formal complaint alleging that the Agency subjected her to discrimination on the basis of sex (female) when: between September 18, 2017 and October 4, 2017, the Manager made sexual advances towards her and management did nothing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency dismissed Complainant 3's formal complaint to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(2) finding that Complainant 2 failed to file her formal complaint within 15 days of receiving her Notice of Right to File. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant 3 appealed asking that the Commission toll the time frames. Complainant 3 repeated the same information regarding the Manager entering the facility and stating that he is the HNIC. Complainant 3 noted that she too was subjected to sexual harassment. She indicated that the Manager came into her workspace and began to rub up against her arm. She then asserted that he stated, "I especially appreciate you, I love you." She indicated that the Manager told her that he could spot a "baby Mama" and that he would want her to be closer to his house and he could make her his baby Mama. He would refer to her as his "Bae," "Boo," and "Baby Mama." The Manager would tell her that she needed a "real man" and told her she needed to have a baby. Despite constant complaints to management, nothing was done. Complainant contacted the EEO Counselor when she learned that she could file an EEO complaint. As such, she asked that the Commission reverse the Agency's dismissal of her complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the records, we find that the three appeals involve the same management official, namely the Manager. Further, Complainant 1, Complainant 2 and Complainant 3 all assert that they were subjected to sexual harassment by the Manager. We find that for the sake of administrative economy, we consolidate the three appeals into the instant decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the records shows that the Manager was assigned to the Drew Station in September 2017. From the moment the Manager arrived, Complainant 1, Complainant 2 and Complainant 3 were subjected to sexual harassment. Each indicated that the Manager referred to himself as the "HNIC." They all noted that he was belligerent, made grossly inappropriate comments for the workplace, and made references to sex.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the record included a copy of the Agency's internal investigation. The investigation indicated that at least seven other women had alleged that the Manager had subjected them to sexual harassment. The report indicated that he touched women and would tell them "I love you." Multiple women indicated that he would tell them that he loved them. When he was told that the individual had a boyfriend, the Manager told her that she could be his "baby's mama" and he would take care of her noting that he has 13 kids and his wife is pregnant with twins. He would call employees some fifteen times in one day and was combative. He told women that he needed them around him. He would say something about "talking under [a woman's] clothes." Women complained that the Manager would hug them and grab their buttocks. In addition, the women in the facility reported that the Manager would refer to women being on their knees, comment about his sperm count, and indicated that if his female employees gave him a little, he would give them a lot. For example, one woman asserted that he asked her to cook for him naked and "all would be forgiven."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The regulation set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(2) states, in pertinent part, that an agency shall dismiss a complaint which fails to comply with the applicable time limits contained in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106. EEOC Regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) provides that an aggrieved person must initiate contact with an EEO Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action. In addition, the regulations require the filing of a formal complaint within fifteen (15) days of receiving the notice of the right to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the unique facts of this case, the Commission determines that it is appropriate to reverse the Agency's final decisions and remand the complaints for further processing. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) provides that the time limitations provided for in the EEO complaint processing regulations are subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling. Under this authority, we find that this is an appropriate case to excuse Complainant 1's failure to contact the appropriate EEO counselor within the regulatory 45-day period and to excuse the delay of Complainant 2 and Complainant 3 for filing their EEO complaints outside of the 15-day time limit. In reaching this decision, we have considered that the complaints at issue concern allegations by three employees involving the Manager. The Complainants asserted that the Manager engaged in egregious behavior including assault, physical touching and requests for sexual favors. Under these facts, the Commission finds it appropriate to require the Agency to continue processing of the complaints, despite Complainant 1's delay in seeking EEO counseling and Complainant 2 and 3's delays in filing their formal complaints. In addition, we note that the Agency should consolidate the complaints as they involve similar claims of sexual harassment at the same facility by the same management official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Agency's final decisions dismissing Complainant 1, 2, and 3's complaints are REVERSED and the matters are REMANDED as set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Frederick A. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120161257 (2017), held that the severity of the alleged harassment justified excusing a one-day delay. In that case, the complainant alleged that his immediate supervisor sexually harassed him by, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, following him into the bathroom and making inappropriate comments, gawking at the complainant's crouch and licking his lips, and calling him before and after work regarding non-work related issues. Noting the effect the harassment had on the complainant, in <span class="Italic">Frederick A</span>., the Commission excused the delay, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant requests that the brief delay be excused because Complainant is subjected to ongoing sexual harassment by his supervisor. For instance, Complainant stated that following the filing of his complaint "I haven't been able to come on post, due to death threats <span id="Page_168"></span>made to me on my old phone. I have been getting pranks calls also. I'm so scared of this person [supervisor]. I burned thru all of my leave [emphasis in its oriGINAl]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(c) provides that the time limits in the EEO complaint process are subject to waiver, estoppels and equitable tolling. Complainant in this case has asserted that starting in April 2015, he experienced ongoing sexual harassment and stress by his supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that under the very specific circumstances of this case, the serious nature of Complainant's sexual harassment allegations by his supervisor during this time period, and the brevity of his delay (one day), are sufficient justification to exercise our discretion to excuse the delay.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission similarly excused a one-day delay "in light of the nature of Complainant's allegation" in <span class="Italic">Louvenia S. v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120171261 (2017). In <span class="Italic">Lyle P. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120172461 (2017), the Commission excused a roughly six-day delay, noting the seriousness of the alleged conduct, namely that the complainant was, among other things, forced to schedule a medical appointment for what his supervisor perceived as bipolar disorder, and the "brief delay." It bears noting that the record in <span class="Italic">Lyle P</span>. did not contain a copy of the agency's notice of right to file a formal complaint.</p>
