<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-98"><span class="space">E.</span> ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES AND ANALYSIS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Title VII did not, in its oriGINAl form, place any obligation on employers to accommodate religious beliefs. It was the Commission itself that first broke this ground in 1966 by adopting a regulation that required accommodation of religious practices unless doing so would create "a serious inconvenience to the conduct of business." In 1967, the Commission revised the regulation to reflect an "undue burden" standard that the employer would have to meet in denying accommodation. The affirmative obligation to accommodate religious practices became statutory law in 1972 through a congressional amendment to Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR Part 1605, Appendix A.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies should note that the Commission's guidance on religious accommodation is restricted to the Title VII aspects of accommodation, and is not meant to address the agencies responsibilities under the Constitution or any other federal statutes. The guidance set forth at 29 CFR Part 1605 states that it is an unlawful employment practice to fail to accommodate a religious practice of an employee or prospective employee unless the employer "demonstrates that accommodation would result in an undue hardship on the conduct of its business." 29 CFR 1605.2(b).</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsection (c) defines what is meant by reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;After an employer or prospective employee notifies the employer or labor organization of his or her need for a religious accommodation, the employer or labor organization has an obligation to reasonably accommodate the individual's religious practices. A refusal to accommodate is justified only when an employer or labor organization can demonstrate that an undue hardship would in fact result from each available alternative method of accommodation. A mere assumption that many more people, with the same religious practice as the person being accommodated, may also need accommodation is not evidence of undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;When there is more than one method of accommodation available, which would not cause undue hardship, the Commission will determine whether the accommodation offered is reasonable by examining:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;The alternatives for accommodation considered by the employer or labor organization; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;The alternatives for accommodation, if any, actually offered to the individual requiring accommodation. Some alternatives for accommodating religious practices might disadvantage the individual with respect to his or her employment opportunities, such as compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Therefore, when there is more than one means of accommodation which would not cause undue hardship, the employer or labor organization must offer the alternative which least disadvantages the individual with respect to his or her employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are two important things to note from the above regulation. First, to demonstrate an undue hardship the agency must present actual evidence of the hardship. Speculation as to the effects of granting the accommodation is not sufficient to sustain the agency's burden. Second, the obligation to accommodate is not merely to find the least intrusive means of accommodation. The accommodation must permit the employee to engage in the desired religious practice without infringing upon that person's employment opportunities. For example, an agency may not accommodate an employee by permitting leave to participate in religious practices and then using the unavailability of the employee as a basis for a poor performance evaluation or a failure to promote. The fact that the accommodation may cause some inconvenience for the agency does not mean the employee can be penalized in any way for that inconvenience.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission sets out the basic parameters of what constitutes a reasonable accommodation for religious purposes and gives several examples in its Compliance Manual, at Section 12-IV, A, 3:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although an employer never has to provide an accommodation that would pose an undue hardship, <span class="Italic">see infra</span> &#x00A7; 12 IV-B, it discharges its accommodation duty if it provides a "reasonable" accommodation. An adjustment offered by an employer is not a "reasonable" accommodation if it merely lessens rather than eliminates the conflict between religion and work, provided that eliminating the conflict would not impose an undue hardship. If all accommodations eliminating such a conflict would impose an undue hardship on an employer, the employer must reasonably accommodate the employee's religious practice to the extent that it can without suffering an undue hardship, even though such an accommodation would be "partial" in nature. To qualify as a reasonable accommodation, an adjustment also must not discriminate against the employee or unnecessarily disadvantage the employee's terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where there is more than one reasonable accommodation that would not pose an undue hardship, the employer is not obliged to provide the accommodation preferred by the employee. However, an employer's proposed accommodation will not be "reasonable" if a more favorable accommodation is provided to other employees for non-religious purposes, or, for example, if it requires the employee to accept a reduction in pay rate or some other loss of a benefit or privilege of employment and there is an alternative accommodation that does not do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, reasonableness is a fact-specific determination. "The reasonableness of an employer's attempt at accommodation cannot be determined in a vacuum. Instead, it must be determined on a case by case basis; what may be a reasonable accommodation for one employee may not be reasonable for another... 'The term "reasonable accommodation" is a relative term and cannot be given a hard and fast meaning. Each case...necessarily depends upon its own facts and circumstances, and comes down to a determination of "reasonableness" under the unique circumstances of the individual employer-employee relationship.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 33--Employer Violates Title VII if it Offers Only Partial Accommodation Where Full Accommodation Would Not Pose an Undue Hardship</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rachel, who worked as a ticket agent at a sports arena, asked not to be scheduled for any Friday night or Saturday shifts, to permit her to observe the Jewish Sabbath from sunset on Friday through sunset on Saturday. The arena wanted to give Rachel this time off only every other week. The arena's proposed adjustment does not fully eliminate the religious conflict and therefore cannot be deemed a reasonable accommodation in the absence of a showing that giving Rachel the requested time off every week poses an undue hardship for the arena. If the arena makes that showing, it must still accommodate Rachel's religious practice to the extent it can without suffering an undue hardship, which could include granting some, but not all, Friday evenings and/or Saturdays off.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 34--Employer Not Obligated to Provide Employee's Preferred Accommodation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Tina, a newly hired part-time store cashier whose sincerely held religious belief is that she should refrain from work on Sunday as part of her Sabbath observance, asked her supervisor never to schedule her to work on Sundays. Tina specifically asked to be scheduled to work Saturdays instead. In response, her employer offered to allow her to work on Thursdays, which she found inconvenient because she takes a college class on that day. Even if Tina preferred a different schedule, the employer is not required to grant Tina's preferred accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 35--Accommodation by Transfer</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yvonne, a member of the Pentecostal faith, was employed as a nurse at a hospital. When she was assigned to the Labor and Delivery Unit, she advised the nurse manager that her faith forbids her from participating directly or indirectly in ending a life, and that this proscription prevents her from assisting with abortions. She asked the hospital to accommodate her religious beliefs by allowing her to trade assignments with other nurses in the Labor and Delivery Unit as needed. The hospital concluded that, due to staffing cuts and risks to patients' safety, it could not accommodate Yvonne within the Labor and Delivery Unit because there were not enough staff members able and willing to trade with her. The hospital instead offered to permit Yvonne to transfer, without a reduction in pay or benefits, to a vacant nursing position in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit, which did not perform abortion procedures. As described below, an employee should be accommodated in his or her current position absent an undue hardship. Here, the hospital could not accommodate Yvonne in her current position due to staffing cuts and risks to patient safety, so the hospital's solution of a lateral transfer complies with Title VII. If the hospital is government run or receives federal funds, it could also have obligations to accommodate Yvonne under federal laws protecting conscience rights of its health care employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII is violated by an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate even if, to avoid adverse consequences, an employee continues to work after his or her accommodation request is denied. "[A]n employee who temporarily gives up his [or her] religious practice to submit to employment requirements [does not] waive[ ] his [or her] discrimination claim." Thus, the fact that an employee acquiesces to the employer's work rule, continuing to work without an accommodation after the employer has denied the request, should not defeat the employee's legal claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the obligation to provide reasonable accommodation absent undue hardship is a continuing obligation. Employers should be aware that an employee's religious beliefs and practices may evolve or change over time, and that this may result in requests for additional or different accommodations. Similarly, the employer has the right to discontinue a <span id="Page_1056"></span>previously granted accommodation that is no longer utilized for religious purposes or subsequently poses an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden to identify a reasonable accommodation cannot be shifted solely to the complainant. To the contrary, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Ronny S. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120132198 (2016), noted that agencies are obligated to "facilitate the securing of a voluntary substitute." In that case, the complainant requested leave to observe Easter. The agency gave him one opportunity to swap his requested day off, which the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Ronny S</span>., held failed to satisfy the agency's obligation to reasonably accommodate the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated in his affidavit that he was given an opportunity to voluntarily swap his requested day off with another employee. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Complainant was offered any other option that would enable him to take leave for a religious observance that day. Likewise there is nothing that shows he was given the opportunity to suggest alternatives, or that there was any discussion around the issue at all.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has found acceptable several alternatives for accommodating conflicts between work schedules and religious practices, including voluntary substitutes and swaps, flexible scheduling, or lateral transfer and change of job assignments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(d). With regard to voluntary substitutions or swaps, the Commission believes the obligation to accommodate requires employers to facilitate the securing of a voluntary substitute. <span class="Italic">Samuelson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120112777 (February 19, 2013). Some ways of doing this are publicizing policies regarding accommodation and voluntary substitution, promoting an atmosphere in which substitutions are favorably regarded, or providing a central file, bulletin board, or other means for making voluntary substitutes available. <span class="Italic">See Hoffman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01092 (June 29, 2001), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A10911 (November 16, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not show that the Agency took any action to facilitate voluntary swaps. Instead, management placed the burden solely on Complainant. Consequently, we do not find that the Agency's suggestion that Complainant ask colleagues to swap schedules constituted a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate Complainant's religious beliefs. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. Dep't of Defense (Defense Commissary Agency)</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120150382 (May 1, 2015). Therefore, we find the Agency failed to accommodate Complainant's religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency has already offered the employee a reasonable accommodation, it is not required to pursue every available alternative to meet its burden of showing undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 01850239 (1987). In that case, the agency had accommodated the complainant for five-and-a-half years by giving him Saturdays off. The agency then required the employee to work Saturdays for a six-month period due to a staff shortage and again accommodated him after obtaining more staff. The agency in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> did identify three vacant positions that the complainant could have transferred to, but did not pursue the alternative of having other staff members exchange schedules with the complainant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To meet its burden of showing undue hardship, however, an employer does not have to pursue every available alternative. In <span class="Italic">Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook</span>, No. 85-495 (November 17, 1986), the Supreme Court held that an employer has met its religious accommodation obligation under Title VII "when it demonstrates that it has offered <span class="Italic">a</span> reasonable accommodation to the employee." Slip op. at 8. (emphasis added) In that case, the Court specifically rejected the Second Circuit's holding that the employer must show that <span class="Italic">each</span> of the employee's proposed accommodations would result in undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 7. In the Court's view, neither the statute nor the legislative history required an employer to choose any <span class="Italic">particular</span> reasonable accommodation "where the employer has already reasonably accommodated the employee's religious needs." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 7. Additionally, the Court stated, "[t]he employer need not further show that each of the employee's alternative accommodations would result in undue hardship." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission determined that the agency demonstrated a good faith effort to accommodate the employee and found that more than a <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> burden was involved in canvassing all of its facilities to explore a mutual schedule change.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not dismiss a complaint alleging a failure to accommodate a religious belief because the employee refuses to fill out a form requesting such accommodation. <span class="Italic">Weeden v. USPS</span>, 01852823 (1987). If the employee timely contacts a counselor and alleges a failure to accommodate, the case must proceed like any other Title VII case. In a similar vein, in <span class="Italic">Parham v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A63126 (2006), the Commission found that the agency erred in dismissing a claim that use of the complainant's social security number violated his religious beliefs because it contained the "mark of the beast." The Commission held that the complaint did state a claim for relief and remanded it for investigation. The remand may be an exercise in futility since, in dismissing the claim, the agency contended that it was required by law to use the complainant's social security number on certain forms. That being the case, it would certainly be an undue hardship to violate a statute to accommodate an individual's belief. The agency's real error was in not allowing sufficient development of the record to render a final decision on the merits, instead of dismissing for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic framework of analysis for religious accommodation cases is set forth in <span class="Italic">Berg v. Department of Transportation</span>, 03840008 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of religious discrimination...the petitioner must demonstrate that: (1) he has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief that conflicts with an employment requirement; (2) he informed the employer of his belief; (3) the agency made a requirement of him that would force petitioner to abandon a fundamental aspect of his belief.... Should a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case be established, the agency must show that it made a reasonable effort to accommodate the petitioner's need to observe his Sabbath, but was unable to do so without causing more than a <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> hardship on the conduct of its business.... Where an employer makes no attempt to accommodate, a violation will be found....(citations omitted)</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency should not confuse its burden of showing undue hardship with the criteria of what constitutes an undue hardship in religious accommodation cases. While the hardship imposed upon the agency is not required to approach the level of hardship required in reasonable accommodation cases under the Rehabilitation Act, the agency stills bears the burden of demonstrating that a hardship actually would be imposed. The Commission explained the contours of the undue hardship doctrine for religious accommodation in <span class="Italic">Harley v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922249 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A showing of undue hardship cannot be merely hypothetical, but must instead include evidence of an actual imposition on coworkers or disruption of work schedules or routines. <span class="Italic">Tooley v. Martin Marietta</span>, 648 F.2d 519, 521 (4th Cir. 1987). Various alternatives for religious accommodation include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the use of voluntary substitutes, flexibility in work schedules, or lateral job transfers. 29 CFR 1605.2(d)(1). This Commission has previously held that the following are not undue hardships in the context of religious accommodation cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;general discontent or grumbling among other employees;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;timekeeping or payroll changes not overly expensive or time-consuming;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;vague, unexplained statements of conflict in seniority rights guaranteed by a collective bargaining agreement;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;where a position requires Saturday work, providing for exchanging days off, where such exchanges are not an unlikely, remote possibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Hawkins v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890937 (May 18, 1990); <span class="Italic">Mann v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880166 (July 21, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, in general, evidence of undue hardship is not the agency's mere assumption that if one employee's request for accommodation is granted, many more employees may also need accommodation. <span class="Italic">Cardona</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890532 at 5. A refusal to accommodate is justified only when an employer demonstrates that undue hardship would in fact result from each alternative method of accommodation. 29 CFR 1605.2(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, we disagree with the agency and the administrative judge on the issue of undue hardship. The agency has in essence argued that because there is a collective bargaining agreement in place with a first-come, first-serve rule and a seniority rule for same day requests, that the agency has no obligation to consider other alternatives for granting leave which would allow appellant to pursue his religious duties. We wholly disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rules for granting leave under the bargaining agreement are merely the starting point, not the ending point, for the agency. The agency faced a situation here where several employees requested leave for December 1, 1990, and applying the rules under the bargaining agreement, appellant was not entitled to take December 1 off before several other employees who had also asked for that date off. At this point, however, the agency did nothing to try to meet appellant's request for religious accommodation. The testimony in this case is extraordinary in that both deciding officials stated that it was their opinion that the agency had no legal obligation to accommodate an employee's religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to this explicit testimony that there was no attempt at accommodation, as is in fact required under federal law, the record is void of any evidence that voluntary substitutes or a change in appellant's work schedule were attempted by anyone at the agency. The law is well-settled that it is the employer's burden to demonstrate accommodation was not possible without undue hardship. In this case, the agency has not shown that given three months advance notice, it attempted any accommodation for appellant or that some of the obvious accommodation alternatives would be unduly costly or burdensome for the agency to carry out. For these reasons, then, we find that appellant has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was discriminated against, based on his religion, when the agency denied his <span id="Page_1057"></span>request for leave and thereafter suspended him from his work for seven days.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's offer and implementation of a "trial" accommodation as the result of an EEO complaint cannot be accepted as evidence of an agency's efforts to fulfill its initial obligations to the employee. <span class="Italic">Eidenberg v. Department of Air Force</span>, 03840009 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to "accommodate" every belief of an employee that may be grounded in religion and insulate the employee from all contrary beliefs. Merely being exposed to a view that one finds unacceptable from a religious point of view does not constitute discrimination, particularly when the view is not that of the agency. In <span class="Italic">Pharr v. Postmaster General</span>, 01941123 (1994), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, appellant alleges discrimination based on a letter which was posted on the APWU bulletin board where appellant is employed. The record contains a copy of the letter in question. The record shows that the letter was signed by a former APWU member and is addressed to "To Whom it May Concern." Therein, the writer requests that his union membership be discontinued because of the union's endorsement of the Freedom of Choice Act. The writer expresses his personal opposition to the Act and to abortion, and also states his religious beliefs in that regard. Appellant asserts harm in that the letter refers to her as an APWU member. Although the letter does refer to the union, there is no reference to any named individuals, including appellant. The letter was not addressed to appellant personally. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that the agency initiated, promoted or endorsed the letter in any way, and appellant has presented no evidence to that effect. As noted above, the letter was signed by a former union member, posted on the union bulletin board, and has since been removed by the union. Thus, there is no indication in the record that the act was accomplished by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although appellant asserts that she is offended by the writer pushing his political and religious views upon her, appellant has not alleged that she has suffered a personal loss or harm with respect to a term, condition or privilege of employment. Moreover, appellant has presented no evidence of any concrete effect from viewing the letter. Therefore, we find that appellant is not an "aggrieved" employee within the meaning of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.103, and as such, has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.107(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency is not required to provide an employee with his accommodation of choice; it is legally obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation. Where the agency has offered a reasonable accommodation, it is not required to demonstrate that the employee's preferred accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Terenyi v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A05190 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Solomon B. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120140422 (2016), the Commission took the analysis a step further by addressing what happens when a complainant declines an agency's good faith offer to accommodate his or her religious practices. In that case, the complainant requested a flexible work schedule to accommodate his religion, but declined the agency's offer to allow him to arrive to work at 9:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. In finding no discrimination, the Commission focused on the fact that the complainant's declination of the agency's offer was for a reason unrelated to his religion in <span class="Italic">Solomon B.:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that Complainant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on religious accommodation; we find that the Agency made good faith efforts to reasonably accommodate him. In October 2011, Complainant informed S1 that his late arrivals were due to his morning prayers, and his schedule was adjusted in November 2011. Starting in December 2011, when Complainant requested his religious accommodation from the DFO1, S1, and the DF02, he was offered a work schedule with a start time of 9:00 <span class="small">AM</span>. Complainant declined the offers because he did not want to work past 5:00 <span class="small">PM</span>. We find that the management officials' offers to move Complainant's start time to a later time to accommodate his morning prayers were made in good faith. Additionally, we do not find Complainant's rejection of these offers on the grounds that it was unreasonable to expect him to work past 5:00 <span class="small">PM</span> to be reasonable on his part. We note that Complainant's religious accommodation request was related to his morning prayers, and that he did not state that he needed to leave by a certain time, due to his religion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In May 2012, Complainant's schedule was changed, outside of accommodation process, and Complainant stated that since then, he has not been late. Had Complainant accepted the change to start his work schedule to 9:00 <span class="small">AM</span> in January 2012, he would have been accommodated since then. As such, we find that the Agency did not discriminate against Complainant based on religion because the Agency made good faith efforts to reasonably accommodate his religious beliefs.</p>
