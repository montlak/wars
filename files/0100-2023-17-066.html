<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-67"><span class="space">4.</span> Failure to Produce Witnesses or Secure Affidavits</h4>
<p class="noindent">The adverse inference may be extended to situations where the agency does not have control over a witness but does take actions that prevent the complainant from securing the voluntary cooperation of the witness. In <span class="Italic">Crummer v. Secretary of Commerce</span>, 01913933 (1992), the Commission upheld the use of an adverse inference when the agency interfered with the ability of the complainant to secure the testimony of a past agency employee. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Crummer</span>, also noted other instances in which the use of an adverse inference would be appropriate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency failed to notify Comparative 1 that he was an approved witness or provide for his appearance at the hearing. The agency was notified by the AJ by letter dated January 29, 1991, that it was responsible for providing for the appearance of any approved agency witnesses. Appellant's attorney was notified that it was his responsibility to provide for the appearance of any non-government witnesses. Comparative 1 was approved as a witness on February 12, 1991. We note that at the time the hearing was actually conducted, Comparative 1 was no longer employed by the agency. He had resigned on April 5, 1991, only days before the scheduled hearing. Appellant's attorney was notified of the resignation only two days before the hearing. Given the facts of this particular case, including the timing of the resignation, we find that the agency acted in bad faith when it did not notify Comparative 1 of the hearing prior to his untimely resignation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once appellant's attorney realized that Comparative 1 had resigned from the agency and that the agency had not informed him of the scheduled hearing, appellant's attorney attempted to obtain the telephone number of Comparative 1 to secure his attendance at the hearing. The agency refused to provide the information. Even after the AJ made a request that the information be released to appellant's attorney, the agency refused, giving no specific reason for the refusal. At the hearing, the agency cited its Personnel Bulletin 297-1. That bulletin allows the disclosure of personal information to an agency or any governmental jurisdiction in the United States for civil law enforcement activities. Accordingly, as made very clear in the agency's final decision, the information could have been released to the AJ who then could have contacted the witness. Further, as untimely suggested by the agency, it could have contacted Comparative 1 and had him contact appellant's attorney or the AJ. While both of these alternatives were apparently available, the agency's unspecific refusal to release the information did not realistically, make the options clear alternatives to appellant's attorney. Accordingly, again, we find that the agency acted in bad faith in its refusal to release appellant's telephone number or to exercise the alternatives it suggested in its final decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we find that the AJ was correct in drawing an adverse inference against the agency with respect to the possible testimony of Comparative 1 and its failure to retain comparative evidence in the form of Comparative 1's work drafts. It is a widely accepted rule that when a party has relevant information within its control which it fails to properly produce, that failure to produce such evidence gives rise to the inference that the evidence is in fact unfavorable. <span class="Italic">International Union (UAW) v. NLRB</span>, 459 F.2d 1329, 1335 (D.C. Cir. 1972). The rule, traceable back as far as the eighteenth century,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, is expressly stated in 29 CFR 1613.218(e)(1), which provides that if a party in bad faith refuses or fails to respond to discovery requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witnesses, approved by the Administrative Judge and in the control of that party, the Judge may draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing the request. The adverse inference rule is also used generally by the Commission to avoid unnecessary delays in the administrative appeal process, which occur when discovery orders or evidentiary requests are ignored. <span class="Italic">Diane C. Wendling v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900063 (February 6, 1990). When such bad faith conduct occurs, we have not hesitated to employ this rule accordingly<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Charlotte E. Grimes v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900374 (July 16, 1990); <span class="Italic">Joseph I. Sellman v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05890993 (December 14, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the facts of this case as outlined in the background and in numerations above clearly warrant invoking this rule. The agency has testified that it discarded Comparative 1's corrected drafts for the period preceding the FY '89 evaluation and failed to provide for the appearance of a witness who was within its employ up until a few days before the hearing. Further, the agency, in bad faith, prevented appellant's attorney from contacting Comparative 1. Finally, the agency did not exercise any available alternatives to cooperate with the EEO process in securing Comparative 1's appearance at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">But an agency's failure to produce a necessary witness for the hearing can lead to an adverse inference that the testimony of the witness would have been unfavorable to the agency. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960170 (1998), the Commission upheld the administrative judge's reliance on an adverse inference in finding pretext where the agency failed to produce at the hearing a comparable employee identified by the complainant. The Commission held that it was proper for the administrative judge to base her finding "primarily" on the adverse inference, although it did note there was evidence in the record "suggesting" the comparable employee had received no discipline for similar offenses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Henkhunzens v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962469 (1998), the Commission upheld an adverse inference where the agency failed to secure an affidavit from a similarly situated employee during the investigation and the employee failed to appear at the hearing despite being ordered to do so. In upholding the inference, the Commission noted the existence of other evidence in the record that was consistent with the inference drawn by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ramsay v. Postmaster General</span>, 01973915 (1998) (the agency failed to produce discovery documents and witnesses for a hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01963661 (1998), the Commission held that an administrative judge did not abuse his discretion by imposing an adverse inference on an agency that failed to produce a witness, even where the agency demonstrated good faith in attempting to locate the witness. The agency contended that the supervisor had been transferred overseas and could not be located. The Commission did not dispute the agency's contentions about its efforts to locate the witness, but imposed the adverse inference in any event. In <span class="Italic">Aileen C. v. Agency for International Development</span>, 0120170399 (2018), the agency tried to excuse its failure to secure an affidavit from the complainant's "<span class="Italic">de facto</span>" supervisor by explaining that the supervisor <span id="Page_596"></span>had declined to participate with the investigation "because she did not supervise the specialist and she did not feel that the questions applied to her." The Commission refused to give the agency a pass in <span class="Italic">Aileen C</span>., imposed an adverse inference against the agency, and explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reveals that the EEO investigator was thorough, and pursued affidavits from both S1 and AA. S1 promptly responded with a completed affidavit, but AA, who at that point was working for another Federal agency, did not. The investigator then notified AA that "failure to provide a manager's affidavit can be used by the EEOC to impose liability on the Agency for non-cooperation with an investigation." AA responded by email that she again declined to cooperate with the investigation, stating: "I neither supervised [Complainant] nor supervised or interacted with her [contractor] employer, I do not feel that the questions that you have asked me to respond to are pertinent or applicable to me." She copied the Agency's Acting EEO Director (presumably the EEO investigator's supervisor) and the Agency's General Counsel in case the EEO investigator required "additional guidance."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record contains no "additional guidance" from the Acting EEO Director or the General Counsel to either AA or the EEO investigator. The Agency's final decision (signed by the Acting EEO Director), acknowledged AA's failure to participate in the investigation, but concluded the evidence of record did not show that discrimination had occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency has not shown good cause for its failure to engage in further efforts to obtain AA's affidavit. There was ample indication in the record that AA's testimony constituted highly relevant evidence warranting investigative attention. Complainant notified the EEO investigator that AA was her "<span class="Italic">de facto</span>" supervisor and alleged that it was AA, not S1, who was ultimately responsible for terminating her contact. She also alleged that AA specifically tied her termination to her disability when, in the context of a discussion about her termination, said that "[g]iven your state of health, this is a demanding job and we need someone who is stronger to do it." The EEO Counselor's report in this case states that during a phone call with the counselor, AA confirmed that she made comments about Complainant's health to Complainant in the context of Complainant's contract termination. Finally, in his affidavit provided during the investigation, S1 explicitly stated that, "I consulted with [AA] to seek concurrence for the termination of [Complainant's] position."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the conduct of the Agency in this case, we find that the imposition of sanctions is warranted for its failing to obtain AA's testimony, preventing Complainant from obtaining evidence in her favor. While it appears that at some point, AA moved to another federal agency, as a federal employee she retained her duty to respond during an EEO investigation. The Agency has provided no indication that it took any steps whatsoever, either through its EEO program or its General Counsel, to obtain the necessary cooperation of AA during the investigation. Therefore, as an evidentiary sanction under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.404(c) (2), we will presume that had AA submitted an affidavit, she would have admitted she was directly involved in the decision to terminate Complainant's position, as S1 testified (he sought her "concurrence" with the termination decision), and that Complainant's disability played a significant role in the decision to place someone else in the position ("we need someone who is stronger" to do the job). We conclude that, with the record evidence construed as such, Complainant has met her burden of proving that consideration of her disability played a decisive role in her termination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01931010 (1993), however, the Commission held that there was no showing of bad faith that would justify an adverse inference where the agency ordered a witness within its control to appear for the hearing, disciplined the witness for failure to appear and no evidence suggested an effort to conceal relevant information. The Commission noted that an agency cannot physically compel the attendance of a witness.</p>
<p class="noindent">The drawing of an adverse inference for failure to produce a witness does not guarantee that the complainant will prevail on his complaint. The case must still be analyzed according to the appropriate burdens of proof in light of the adverse inference. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0A21961 (2003), the Commission found the adverse inference was insufficient for the complainant to carry his burden of proof:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so finding, we note, as the AJ did, that the AJ took an adverse inference against the agency for ALJ's refusal to testify. The Commission's regulations afford broad authority for the conduct of hearings by Administrative Judges<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109 <span class="Italic">et seq; Rountree v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 13, 2001). When a complainant or agency fails to comply with an AJ's order, an AJ may take action against the non-complying party pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3), up to and including issuing a decision in favor of the opposing party<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(f)(3)(iv). Here, when ALJ refused to testify, the AJ warned ALJ and the agency that he would take an adverse inference that ALJ's testimony would have been favorable to complainant. While we are unable to ascertain with precision what adverse inference the AJ drew in regard to ALJ's testimony, it appears that the AJ determined that if ALJ had testified, he would have supported complainant's claim that, when asked by complainant why S1 was chosen instead of complainant ALJ responded that "we thought the young woman would do a good job." Although complainant would have preferred the AJ to have sanctioned the agency by considering the matters to which the testimony pertained, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the reasons for complainant's non-selection, to have been established in her favor, the AJ has discretion in determining sanctions and complainant failed to provide any evidence that the AJ in the case herein abused this discretion by imposing a lesser sanction than she desired. Moreover, we conclude that this statement is not, as complainant appears to assert, direct evidence of discrimination, as it may have merely been a way to describe the selectee, rather than an admission that her age was looked on with favor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant correctly notes that many of the statements made by RMO in support of his decision to recommend S1 are not supported by the record, such as complainant's weakness as a writer or the claim that certain Administrative Law Judges had complained about complainant. Indeed, the AJ concluded that this was the case in his decision. RMO also testified, however, that he recommended S1 based on her superior writing skills and the fact that she had the full confidence of both himself and individuals on the staff, as well as the ability to adapt to changing situations and to relate to all types of people. Complainant offered no evidence to indicate that these were not abilities held by S1, nor, as the AJ noted, did she prove that her qualifications for the position were observably superior to S1's. RMO further testified that he felt complainant had issues relating to time and attendance. In support of this belief, he described an incident in which he and complainant had a disagreement due to his belief that she returned late from lunch. RMO testified that complainant was extremely belligerent during this discussion. Although complainant argued that she was not, in fact, late because she was getting a flu shot, as permitted by the agency regulations, there is no dispute that this argument occurred or that it was a very unpleasant incident. Complainant provides no evidence to support her claim that her age motivated RMO's accusation, rather than the fact that, at the very least, it appeared that she had returned late from lunch without using leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, although complainant contends that the evidence establishes that S1 was selected before the list containing complainant's name was presented to RMO and before the position in question was vacant, we fail to see how this, even if true, establishes that age motivated the selection at issue. Testimony establishes that the agency was aware that the individual occupying the position in question no longer desired to be in a management position and was applying for another position. Testimony further establishes that the agency was attempting to fill the upcoming vacancy as quickly and smoothly as possible. Even if complainant is correct that the selection took place prior to the position becoming officially vacant and prior to RMO's receipt of her name as a candidate, this does not prove that complainant's age was the basis for the selection. As the Commission has noted numerous times, pre-selection <span class="Italic">per se</span> does not constitute discrimination when it is based on the qualifications of the preselected individual and not on a prohibited basis<span class="Italic">. See McAllister v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931038 (July 28, 1994). The Commission finds, therefore, that even if S1 was preselected, this does not indicate that age motivated the decision not to select complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we agree with the AJ that although some of the agency's explanations for failing to select complainant were rebutted by complainant, there remains unrebutted legitimate nondiscriminatory explanations for RMO's recommendation to the selecting official that S1 be selected. n1 We note that at all times it remains complainant's burden to establish that, more likely than not, her age motivated the non-selection. The record in the case at hand establishes that RMO and complainant did not get along, that the selection at issue involved some irregularities, and that ALJ referred to the selectee as a "young woman," but we are unable to conclude that complainant established by a preponderance of the evidence that age motivated RMO's recommendation of S1 over complainant or SO's subsequent selection of S1.</p>
