<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-161"><span class="space">2.</span> Disciplinary Actions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Just as a belated disclosure of a disability or request for reasonable accommodation does not create an excuse for past poor performance, they do not create an excuse for past misconduct. The Commission explains what an employer should do when the disclosure of a disability or request for accommodation comes in response to counseling or discipline for misconduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employee states that her disability is the cause of the conduct problem or requests accommodation, the employer may still discipline the employee for the misconduct. If the appropriate disciplinary action is termination, the ADA would not require further discussion about the employee's disability or request for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the discipline is something less than termination, the employer may ask about the disability's relevance to the misconduct, or if the employee thinks there is an accommodation that could help her avoid future misconduct. If an accommodation is requested, the employer should begin an "interactive process" to determine whether one is needed to correct a conduct problem, and, if so, what accommodation would be effective. The employer may seek appropriate medical documentation to learn if the condition meets the ADA's definition of "disability," whether and to what extent the disability is affecting the employee's conduct, and what accommodations may address the problem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employers cannot refuse to discuss the request or fail to provide reasonable accommodation as a punishment for the conduct problem. If a reasonable accommodation is needed to assist an employee with a disability in controlling his behavior and thereby preventing another conduct violation, and the employer refuses to provide one that would not cause undue hardship, then the employer has violated the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., Q. 10.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, the Commission provides an interesting example:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Example 20</span>: An employee informs her supervisor that she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A few months later, the supervisor asks to meet with the employee concerning her work on a recent assignment. At the meeting, the supervisor explains that the employee's work has been generally good, but he provides some constructive criticism. The employee becomes angry, yells at the supervisor, and curses him when the supervisor tells her she cannot leave the meeting until he has finished discussing her work. The company terminates the employee, the same <span id="Page_1259"></span>punishment given to any employee who is insubordinate. The employee protests her termination, telling the supervisor that her outburst was a result of her bipolar disorder which makes it hard for her to control her temper when she is feeling extreme stress. She says she was trying to get away from the supervisor when she felt she was losing control, but he ordered her not to leave the room. The employee apologizes and requests that the termination be rescinded and that in the future she be allowed to leave the premises if she feels that the stress may cause her to engage in inappropriate behavior. The employer may leave the termination in place without violating the ADA because the employee's request for reasonable accommodation came after her insubordinate conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The example given by the Commission is particularly interesting because in this scenario the employer had knowledge of the disability prior to the misconduct. However, the employee did not give the employer any indication of a possible need for accommodation until the misconduct occurred and therefore was not entitled to reasonable accommodation. The example is also interesting because implicit in the Commission's explanation is the fact that the requested accommodation would have been reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Atkinson v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120081924 (2008), the Commission found that the agency was justified in terminating a complainant with Tourette syndrome who engaged in physically violent and threatening behavior. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Atkinson</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of the events giving rise to his complaint, complainant was a nursing aid who transported patients and equipment in a VA hospital. On March 2006, he was seen by a coworker running down hallways pushing wheelchairs with patients very fast. (Report of Investigation, ROI, C-5-4). On the same day, a staff nurse saw complainant in an elated state hurrying, sweating a lot, and acting strangely when getting ready to transport a patient, he held a plastic bag with a patient's belongings by clenching it between his teeth, and in one hand held the wheelchair, and by the other was about to grab the patient's oxygen tank until the nurse intervened. The nurse contacted complainant's supervisor about this (ROI, written statement following affid. B-2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sometime after being paged, complainant reported to his supervisor's office. According to his supervisor, he was pale, his shirt and hair were sopping wet, and he was dripping with sweat off his chin. Seeing his state, the supervisor told complainant he should go home, but complainant, who could then hardly speak in full sentences objected, got angry., stormed out of the room screaming, and headed to the escort office. (ROI, affid. B-4, p. 16).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerned about complainant's behavior, the supervisor called the VA police to meet complainant at the escort office and to ensure he left the hospital. She also went to the escort office. Once there, she saw him screaming and jumping around, and the police trying to calm him, with co-workers in the office shaking in a corner. According to the supervisor, complainant struggled against the police, was handcuffed by them, got out of the cuffs and was handcuffed again. (ROI, affid. B-4, p. 17). A co-worker of complainant who was in the escort office wrote that when the police arrived and asked complainant to leave the premises, he refused saying there was no problem. The co-worker wrote that complainant got physical., and when the police attempted to handcuff him, he was kicking, struggling and screaming. (ROI, C-5-4). This account was corroborated by the statement of another co-worker in the escort room. (ROI, C-5-1). The second co-worker added that complainant was mad and sweaty. (ROI, affid. B-3, page 7). The supervisor and both co-workers stated that when complainant was escorted out by the police in a wheelchair, he threatened the supervisor by saying "I'm going to get you."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The above accounts are all corroborated by a police report, which added that in addition to telling the supervisor he was going to get her, alluded to "going postal." The supervisor and one co-worker denied that the police threatened complainant. (ROI, affid. B-3, page 9, affid. B-4, p. 18-19). Based on witness accounts, including complainant, it cannot be established whether or not the police swore. Complainant conceded that the responding VA officers were unaware of his disabilities. (ROI, affid. B-1, page 34).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant denied threatening his supervisor, but conceded that due to his tourette syndrome he may have and would not remember. Complainant contended that had he been given time to rest and get his belongings together in the escort office, he could have gotten calm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant was terminated by letter dated March 17, 2006, for his actions in the escort office and a prior recent incident where complainant got disruptive in the human resources office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD found that the agency actions that occurred against complainant were due to his behavior, not his alleged disabilities. Based upon a review of the record, we agree. There are multiple witness statements supporting that complainant behaved as characterized by the agency, which explains the actions taken against him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant avers that he should have been reasonably accommodated by allowing him to calm down, and stated that if he made a threat, it was because of his tourette syndrome. Where a workplace conduct standard is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity, an employer may discipline an employee wish a disability for engaging in misconduct if it would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities</span>, Question and Answer 30 (March 25, 1997) (available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>). We find that complainant has not shown he was treated differently.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to not being an excuse for past misconduct, a disability does not entitle the complainant to an accommodation that requires the agency tolerate otherwise inappropriate behavior. For example, in <span class="Italic">Casey v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120090180 (2010), the complainant, who suffered from depression and anxiety, claimed discrimination when the agency suspended him for five days for violating its anti-harassment policy and that the agency subsequently failed to provide him with reasonable accommodation by "bearing with" any future similar conduct. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Casey</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's Anti-Harassment Policy (Policy) describes prohibited conduct including "name calling, swearing, bullying, expressing or insinuating threats." Additionally, the Policy prohibits intimidation, described as the "[u]se of physical or organizational power to coerce a person to perform a particular action, or to instill a feeling of humiliation or intimidation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We assume, as did the agency, without so finding, that Complainant is an individual with a disability. We find the record supports the Agency's finding that Complainant's conduct, described in the Discipline Letter he received, as work-related communications and conduct that violated a uniformly applied policy of conduct, specifically, the Agency's Anti-Harassment Policy. Multiple witnesses, both in Complainant's protected class and from outside Complainant's protected class, appear in the record, with consistent details that supported the Agency's factual conclusions about Complainant's behavior. E.g. Affidavit of S1, ROI Ex. 8; Statement of E1, Jack Driver, ROI Ex. 20, at 46. We find the Policy is job-related and consistent with business necessity. An employer may discipline an employee with a disability for engaging in such misconduct if it would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance at Questions 35-36. Accordingly, we conclude that the agency was not required to excuse the misconduct of name-calling, threatening, intimidation, or unprofessional confrontations with employees of the processing plant, or Agency officials solely because of Complainant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Reasonable Accommodation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an individual decides to request accommodation, the individual must let the employer know that he or she needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. This request, however, does not necessarily mean that the employer is required to provide the change. The agency need not provide the accommodation if it would cause an "undue hardship" to the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5)(A) (2000). "Undue hardship" means significant difficulty or expense and focuses on the resources and circumstances of the particular employer in relationship to the cost or difficulty of providing a specific accommodation. It refers not only to financial difficulty, but also to accommodations that are unduly extensive, substantial or disruptive, or those that would fundamentally alter the nature or operation of business. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> at &#x00A7; 12111(10); <span class="Italic">See also</span> EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We consider that the only accommodation Complainant states that he requested is that the agency "bear with him," or "try to understand" his behavior, possibly meaning that the Agency should permit Complainant's conduct, whatever it is, when it is the result of his disability or the effects of the medication that Complainant takes or fails to take. The Agency was under no such obligation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, No. 915.002, at Question 36 (rev. Oct. 17, 2002) ("Guidance"). We do not find that the Agency denied Complainant any requested reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again, in <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120093341 (2011), the Commission stressed that a disability is not an excuse for misconduct. In <span class="Italic">Dias</span>, the Commission rejected an argument by the complainant that he was subjected to disability discrimination because of his sleep apnea and diabetes when the agency proposed his termination for sleeping on the job and he resigned rather than face removal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this matter, we find that Complainant has not shown that the Agency engaged in actions that a reasonable person performing his job would have found intolerable, nor is it clear what actions he claims were discriminatory. S1 and her supervisor averred that Complainant was issued the letter proposing his termination because of sleeping on the job on at least three occasions. That he was counseled for sleeping on the job, sleeping at a meeting, and poor attendance, is not, without more, an intolerable or discriminatory, action by the Agency. The record indicates <span id="Page_1260"></span>that Complainant chose, of his own volition, to resign from the Agency rather than be terminated for sleeping on duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In proposing his removal, the Agency explained that it did so because of his sleeping on the job. Complainant argued that these reasons were not true; however, Complainant, assuming he is an individual with a disability and that he established <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> cases of discrimination based on national origin and disability, has not shown that the Agency's reasons were not its true reasons or that its actions were influenced by legally impermissible criteria, i.e., animus based on disability and/or national origin. <span class="Italic">See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</span> 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993); <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981). It is Complainant's burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency's explanation is a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</span> 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000). We find that Complainant has not done so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant did not request a reasonable accommodation; however, to the extent that he may be arguing that his medical conditions bar his termination, we note that the Rehabilitation Act does not require employers to excuse poor performance or violation of conduct standards that are job-related and consistent with business necessity as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Babbitt,</span> EEOC Docket No. 03940100 (March 28, 1996); <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, supra.</span></p>

Secretary of Interior</span>, 0120121828 (2015) ("The Commission notes that if the sleeping incidents prevent Complainant from performing the essential functions of his position, then he cannot be qualified individual with a disability."); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Attorney General</span>, 0120090011 (2014) (upholding five-day suspension for conduct unbecoming a federal employee based on outbursts where asking for agency to "cut him some slack" and not put him in stressful situations was not a request for an effective accommodation); <span class="Italic">Green v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120090340 (2011) (noting the Commission "has long held an employer is not required to excuse past misconduct even if it is the result of an employee's disability."); <span class="Italic">Kane v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112749 (2011) (emergency placement in off-duty status justified where complainant was stopped and arrested, identified himself as postal service manager and that was reported in two local newspapers).</p>
